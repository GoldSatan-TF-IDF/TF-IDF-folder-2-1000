harry turtledove the golden shrine i spring on the bizogot steppe came late and grudgingly the breath of god blew down from the glacier and over the frozen plain long after southern breezes began melting snow and bringing green back to the raumsdalian empire at last though as the sun stayed longer in the sky day by day the weather north of the tree line began to change too even down in the empire count hamnet thyssen reckoned spring a minor miracle up on the bizogot steppe the miracle seemed not so minor spring was harder won here all the same hamnet had a bigger miracle to celebrate on this bright mild blueskied sunny day he and his friends had lived through the winter and i tell you he remarked to ulric skakki i wouldnt have given a counterfeit copper for our chances when we set out last fall why not your grace with his auburn hair and foxy features ulric could don the mask of innocence more readily than count hamnet who was large and dark and somewhere between stolid and dour just because it was a tossup whether our side wanted us dead more than the enemy did that will do for a start hamnet answered which made ulric laugh as merrily as if he were joking what do you say marcovefa asked the shaman from the cannibal tribe that lived atop the glacier looked like a bizogot she was large and blond and robust the language her folk used sprang from the bizogot speech but from a strange distant dialect and her people had been isolated for centuries from the clans who roamed the steppe she was learning their speech as she was learning raumsdalianlearning them both as foreign tongues hamnet thyssen explained in slow simple words partly in raumsdalian and partly in the bizogot language he wished the empire were doing more to fight the rulers the mammothriding invaders whod swarmed through the gap after the glacier melted in two the stocky swarthy curlybearded invaders made ferocious fighting men and even more fearsome wizards everyone thought so except marcovefa her own powers equaled or exceeded those of the rulers sorcerers hamnet often wondered why that should be so his best guess was that the scattered folk who dwelt up on the glacier did without so many material things they had no crops they knew nothing of wood they knew no animals larger than foxes they couldnt work metaleven stone was sometimes hard for them to come by no wonder then that their magical skills were strong they had to have something going for them up there in the perpetual cold and the perpetually thin air thus wizardry flourished alongside desperate poverty so it seemed to him anyhow marcovefa didnt think of herself or the folk among whom shed grown up as poor but then shed had no standard of comparison till she came down to the bizogot steppe with hamnet and his comrades the summer before she laughed at his worries now it will be as it is thats all she said all we can do is try to make it turn out the way we want it to well yes hamnet said i dont think of that as all marcovefa laughed again louder this time but it is soon enough nothing will matter any more because we will be dead she made ulric skakki laugh too on a different note later i hopenot sooner he said i dont plan on dying for quite a while yet no eh hamnet said why did you come up to the steppe again in that case maybe im a fool ulric said he was a great many things scout raider thief assassin hamnet thyssen had never made the mistake of reckoning him a fool other mistakes certainly that one nohe wasnt such a big fool or that particular kind of fool himself then ulric aimed a wry smile at him or maybe you have such pretty eyes i couldnt resist count hamnet snorted he took his pleasureand too often his painfrom women so did ulric skakki hamnet had never thought pretending otherwise was funny ulric did what are you going on about trasamund rumbled he was the very image of a bizogot jarl a clan chief he was a big man bigger than hamnet he had a heros muscles a heros appetite for strong drink and willing women a heros courage strong sun and chill winds had carved harsh lines that gave dignity to his bluffly handsome features he was these days a jarl almost without a clan the three tusk bizogots lived close by the glacier trasamund was one of the first men through it one of the first to begin exploring lands cut off by ice for thousands of years and the rulers had fallen on his clan first when they swarmed into the lands on this side of the glacier trasamund had been down in the empire then the only thing he could have done had he been among his clansmen was die with them he knew that but blamed himself anyhow i was just telling count hamnet how beautiful he was and he was getting all embarrassed about it ulric said archly if i didnt know the two of you trasamund let his voice trail away hamnet knew what he wasnt saying the bizogots scorned men who lay with other men which was putting it mildly trasamund didnt know what to make of men who lay with women but affected not to no bizogot seemed to have thought of that particular vice before hamnet sent ulric a not particularly warm glance he didnt want trasamund thinking of him like that grinning ulric blew him a kiss so much for the not very warm glance if you were half as funny as you think you are youd be twice as funny as you really are hamnet said and id still be funnier than you ulric said hamnet shook his head like a man bedev iled by bees he was unlikely to need to worry about bees this far north soon enough though midges and flies and mosquitoes would spring to life in every pond and rill and puddle left by melting snow and ice everything on the bizogot steppe burst with life in the springtimeincluding the pests ulric skakki seemed to be trying his best to get himself included in their number more bizogots rode up from the southwest to take over the watch hamnet thyssen was glad enough to head back to camp he made a point of talking with marcovefa and trasamund and of ignoring ulric the adventurer noticed he laughed at hamnet who ignored him harder than ever ulric skakki kept right on laughing hamnet kept right on fuming if you let him bother you he wins you know marcovefa said i suppose hamnet answered but if i dont let him bother me that says i shouldnt have been bothered to begin with and he wins anyhow so what am i supposed to do you could kill him marcovefa wasnt joking the bizogots brawled at any excuse or none her own clan like the others scattered over the top of the glacier had grown more ruthless than the folk from whom they were descended theyd had to life up there gave them even less margin for error than the ordinary bizogots had to marcovefa the frozen steppe was a land of riches and abundance if that didnt say how desperately impoverished her folk were nothing could all the same hamnet shook his head we need him and he broke off one word too late and what marcovefa asked of course she noticed she wasnt just a shaman she was an uncommonly observant woman hamnets cheeks heated when he answered he spoke in a low voice because he didnt want ulric to hear but however reluctantly he spoke the truth and hed be more likely to kill me curse it he was a formidable warrior he was sure he could beat trasamund even if the bizogot was bigger and stronger than he wastrasamund had more courage than he knew what to do with but less technique than he needed ulric skakki was no braver than he had to be but he coupled a wildcats speed and grace with more skill in fighting with weapons or without them than anyone else hamnet had ever known if you quarrel i could magic him marcovefa paused i think i could hes a strange one no doubt about it had she ever seemed doubtful about her own spells before if she had hamnet thyssen couldnt remember when she mocked the sorcery she found down here below the glacier both that of bizogot shamans and that of raumsdalian wizards she even mocked the rulers sorcery which far outdid anything either bizogots or raumsdalians could manage if she wasnt sure her spells would bite ulric how is he different from the rest of us hamnet asked marcovefa shrugged hes slipperier than anyone else ive ever seen he might find a way to slide out from under any charm i set on him ah hamnet thought it over then nodded i can see that sounds like ulric all right tents made from the tanned hides of woolly mammoths straggled across the plain bizogot camps were disorderly affairsthis one put together by survivors from several shattered clans more so than most dogs not far removed from wolves ran at hamnet and the other newcomers they barked and snarled and growled but didnt quite attack miserable beasts marcovefa didnt like dogs there were none up on the glacier her folk tamed voles and hares so they could have a more reliable food supply but that was as far as they went along those lines she asked why keep them around anyway they work they guard hamnet said two dogs tripped over each others feet they both went sprawling he added they give us something to laugh at i suppose so but marcovefa didnt seem convinced she pointed to the running pack of boys and girls who followed the dogs isnt that why people have children one reason i suppose hamnet thyssen had no children he knew of a lot of things might have been different if he had have you got anything for us one of the boys yelled he held out a grimy hand for whatever he could scrounge bizogots scrounged without shame wherever and whenever they could where they couldnt scrounge they often stole dont give him anything the girl who spoke used a dialect different from the boys they came from separate clans and never would have joined together if the rulers hadnt spread disaster across the bizogot steppe she added hes nothing but a miserable nosepicker anyway liar the boy shouted and pitched into her they were at an age where size mattered more than gender and she had half a head on him he might have been bold but he was soon down on the ground and snuffling by the way his nose ran he hadnt picked it any time lately serves him right for being stupid marcovefa said yes but hamnet raised his voice enough enough by god he yelled loud enough to make the girl stop she eyed him in surprise enough he said once more were all one clan here or we might as well be you made him sorry for jumping youfair enough but dont humiliate him save that for our real enemiesthe rulers who are you to talk about all of us being one clan the girl demanded you arent even a bizogot you arent even a human beingshe didnt say it but it was what she really meant so what hamnet thyssen returned the way it looks to me there are only two clans left the rulers and everyone who hates them which side are you on she thought about that then roughly she pushed the boy away from her if i get the chance to kill the rulers i will if anyone says anything different ill kill him she couldnt have been more than eleven but she plainly meant every word good enough hamnet pulled a chunk of smoked muskox meat from his pocket and tossed it to her she caught it stuck it in her mouth and began to chew bizogots needed strong teeth the dried meat was almost as tough as wood liv and audun gilli and a captive from the rulers came out of a nearby tent liv nodded to hamnet by the racket the dogs made i thought it might be you she said if its not me its an attack and that would be worse hamnet answered liv nodded she was a striking woman with proud cheekbones blue blue eyes and golden hair unfortunately hacked off short it was also dirty and greasy as bizogot hair commonly was so was hamnets washing during the winter on the frozen steppe was asking for chest fever shed been the shaman of the three tusk clan till the rulers smashed it shed also been hamnet thyssens woman till she decided she liked audun better maybe like called to like audun was a wizard even if one with an unfortunate fondness for guzzling everything he could find or maybe that had nothing to do with it couples came together too often they also came apart hamnet could look at her and deal with her without wanting to kill her or to kill himself he could even deal with audun gilli without wanting to kill him most of the time all that struck him as very strange if not downright marvelous when gudrid played him false and left him hed lingeredwallowedin a trough of misery for years but liv hadnt played him false shed only shifted her affections amazing the difference that made liv didnt torment him with bygone days that could never come again either hamnet wondered how it was that she came from the barbarous bizogots while gudrid was an allegedly civilized raumsdalian of course civilization had its sophisticated pleasures elaborate revenge among them why gudrid thought she needed elaborate revenge on hamnet one would have to ask her since she was hundreds of miles to the south all comfortable in nidaros he couldnt very well do thatand he didnt want to anyhow marcovefa pointed to the captive i see you dashru she said dashru nodded i am seen he answered unhappily he spoke the bizogots language with a thick accent and bad grammar he was shorter than most bizogots but wider through the shoulders his hair and beard were black and curly his eyes polished jet his nose a proud scimitar that was the only pride he had left rulers who had the bad luck or lack of fortitude to fall into enemy hands were dead to their own folk forever after they were dead in spirit too after suffering such a disgrace some slew themselves when they found the chance others like dashru lived on but not happily never happily teach us more of your language hamnet said dashru sighed and nodded again i do that you not learn well though we try hamnet said you dont learn the bizogots tongue easily either grunting of deer squawking of geese dashru said disdainfully we think the same of your speech hamnet told him dashru made a horrible face as if hed smelled something nasty the trouble was the bizogot language and raumsdalian on the one hand and the rulers tongue on the other were as different as chalk and tobacco bizogots and raumsdalians spoke related languages the vocabulary wasnt the same but here and there words in the one tongue sounded something like those in the other the bizogots had more complicated noun declensions than people in the empire used while raumsdalian had a battery of verb tenses the mammothherders lacked but the basic principles underlying both languages were similar all the words in the rulers language were different that was bad enough but not unexpected why believe a language that had grown up beyond the glacier would have familiar vocabulary the grammar though whoever put together the grammar in the rulers language had to be twisted so hamnet thyssen thought anyhow he knew dashru felt the same way about the bizogot speech but he didnt care when the rulers talked to one another they used a word order hamnet found perverse they slapped pieces of words together to make bigger more complicated ones they used particles to show how the pieces fit together why anyone would want to talk like that hamnet had no idea but the invaders found it as natural as he found raumsdalian dashru worked his way through a lesson on numbers that was one more thing that drove hamnet crazy for one of something the number and the thing it described were singular and in the subjective case for two three or four of something the number and what it described were singularwhyand in the possessive case for five and above they were plural and in the possessive case this makes no sense hamnet said he is right marcovefa said that made hamnet feel better hed wondered if he was missing something he should see dashru only shrugged we talk like this what do you want me to do tell you we talk some other way yes hamnet thought he wouldnt have been sorry to hear a lie just then if it made the rulers language easier to pick up but why do you do it this way he asked because we do the captive answered why do you talk like you do that is really stupid he meant it count hamnet could hear as much the raumsdalian turned to marcovefa can you cast a spell to make the language easier to learn he asked her is there a spell for translating from one language to another up on the glacier we all used the same tongue we needed no spell like that she answered she eyed dashru do your shamans use translating spells yes but i dont know how they work he said i am herder fighter i know nothing of magic hamnet thyssen believed him the bizogots hadnt captured any of the rulers wizards those wizards were stronger than any shaman except marcovefa they were also fierce warriors in their own rightand perhaps even more determined not to be taken alive than the ordinary fighting men of their folk marcovefa looked thoughtful a spell like that shouldnt be too hard to shape she said the law of similarity would apply one word for a thing or an idea is bound to be similar to another for the same thing or idea they both point toward the same original which makes them point toward each other too that probably made perfect sense to her it made more sense to hamnet than the way the rulers counted but not much more he would never make any kind of wizard and he knew it the aptitude wasnt there do you want to go on or do you want to make a magic dashru asked in the bizogot language we go on hamnet replied in the rulers speech that seemed a simple enough answer but dashrus wince told him hed made a hash of it somehow resignedly he asked what did i say wrong first dashru told him what he did wrong asking what he did wrong then the prisoner told him what he did wrong saying they would go on he could hear the mistakes too he doubted he would ever speak without making them fairly often if he could get the rulers to understand him and could understand some of what they said that would do i dont aim to be a poet in their tongue he told marcovefa it is an ugly language she agreed it is even uglier than raumsdalian so there hamnet thought dashru was offended the rulers tongue is not ugly he said it is full of strength full of power it is fit for well for rulers no wonder you folk do not care for it you are part of the herd for us to milk and shear and slaughter as we please if you think that way if you act that way you will make everyone on this side of the glacier fight you to the death hamnet said so what dashru returned after we kill you all we settle the land ourselves we do what we want with it for a moment he sounded like a proud warrior part of a proud folk but only for a moment as he remembered where he was he deflated like a pricked bladder i will not see that i who am nothing i can tell you what you will see hamnet thyssen said you will see the rulers whipped back through the gap back beyond the glacier like the dogs and sons of dogs they are dashru laughed in his face a bison may bellow before it goes over the cliff but it goes over all the same and even the bison here have small horns they are weak as the folk here are weak do not laugh too soon marcovefa warned him the prisoner laughed again you are another who pretends to be stronger than she is marcovefa looked at him she muttered something in her own dialect of the bizogot language it really was almost a separate tongue in its own right hamnet couldnt recognize more than a couple of words her hands shaped quick passes all of them aimed at dashru he stared defiantly back at her after a moment defiance changed to alarm he shouted something in his own language hamnet thyssen made out away with you in the midst of guttural gibberish dashrus fingers twisted in a sign much like the one the bizogots used to turn aside evil that seemed to buy him a few heartbeats of relief but no more marcovefa went on muttering dashru started to have trouble breathing his face went a mottled purple above the edge of his beard will you kill him hamnet asked unless he admits i am stronger i will and i will roast his heart afterwards and eat it too marcovefa would have sounded more excited talking about an unexpected shower and when she spoke of roasting dashrus heart she meant it up atop the glacier captives from another clan were meat nothing more the rulers were a proud folk many of them would have died before yielding in a trail of strength especially against someone from outside their own folk but dashru had already yielded once maybe that prompted him to drop to his knees or maybe getting sorcerously asphyxiated would have weakened almost anyone whatever the reason he choked out mercy with what had to be close to his last breath by the look in marcovefas eye she would sooner have butchered and cooked him than given him what he wanted but hed done what she said he had toor most of it anyway i am stronger yes she demanded in the rulers language mercy dashru said again and then reluctantly yes a moment later he was sucking in great gulps of air he got back his usual swarthy coloring you insult me again marcovefa asked dashru shook his head no he said no wizard lady better not marcovefa made as if to spit in his face but contemptuously turned her back instead enough lesson of speech dashru asked hamnet thyssen he wasnt going to have anything more to do with marcovefa not if he could help it count hamnet had no trouble understanding that enough language lessons yes he answered dashru got out of there as fast as he could again hamnet would have done the same thing you are too soft on him marcovefa said he is a captive a rabbit on the fire he should remember he isnt likely to forget not now hamnet said if he hadnt got out of line he wouldnt have needed the lesson marcovefa said adding did you see how useless his countercharm was yes count hamnet wondered whether the countercharm would have been useless against livs sorcery or audun gillis he didnt think so though he wasnt sure now i know more of what the rulers do i know more of how they think i want to fight them i want to beat them marcovefa said youd better want to and youd better do it too hamnet said without you we havent got much chance foosh marcovefa saida dismissive noise their magic is not so much you shouldnt have such trouble with it she paused of course the magic you people down here know isnt so much either thats why we need you count hamnet said if anything happens to you he shook his head he didnt want to think about that he would lose his woman in the ordinary run of things with the sorrows hed known in his love life that would have been disaster enough and then some since the bizogots and the empire would likely go under the rulers yoke in short order his love life for once wasnt his biggest worry the lewd glint in marcovefas eye said she thought he was thinking about it you find some other woman to give you what you want she teased where will i find another woman who can give me the rulers driven back beyond the gap he asked she pointed north same place you found meup on top of the glacier i didnt want to make that trip once we wouldnt have tried to climb the ice then if the rulers werent going to kill us if we stayed on flat ground hamnet shuddered at the memory of that fearsome ascent we wouldnt have had a chance if that big avalanche hadnt made the slope less impossible than it usually is it is not easy marcovefa admitted if it were my folk would have come down from the glacier long ago our enemies drove us up there tooso our songs say i believe them no one would have gone up there unless he had to all right then hamnet thyssen said dont talk foolishness everyone on this side of the gap needs you he slipped his arm around her waist i need you in a way the rest of the people dont though you think so do you she gave him a sidelong glance and a mocking smile so no other men on this side of the gap would want me that wasnt true she was pretty enough that any man might want her hamnet answered with guile of his own youd scare most of them off once they found out you might carve them into steaks if they made you unhappy foosh marcovefa said again i dont butcher anyone from my own clanand a lover is about the same as a clansman well thats a relief hamnet was kidding but kidding on the square he and marcovefa both started to laugh the world might be coming to pieces around them might be it was if the glacier hadnt come to pieces none of what happened since would have been possible but you couldnt keep looking at anything so large for very long not without your mind snapping if something funny came along close by youd laugh which didnt mean the bigger troubles went away not looking at them for a little while helped them seem more tolerable though whether they really were was a question hamnet ignored for the time being a scout rode into the bizogots camp he pointed north and east theres a band of those muskox turds riding south he said they wont pass too far from us how big a band trasamund asked that was the right question sure enough if it was too large these remnants of half a dozen shattered bizogot clans would have to fight shy of it for fear even a hardwon victory would leave them too weak to fight again the scout considered maybe half a dozen war mammoths he said more of the miserable mushrooms on their riding deer of course but not too many i think we can take them i bet hes right ulric skakki said to hamnet scouts always see bigger forces than the ones that are really there most of the time anyhow hamnet said he raised his voice to question the bizogot did they look like men who intended to settle down when they found good grazing or did they seem on their way to somewhere else hard to know for sure the scout said and hamnet thyssen nodded impatiently after more thought the man went on if they wanted to stop the grazing was good where they were they were moving pretty steady heading for the empire ulric murmured count hamnet nodded again the rulers already had an army down there fighting against sigvat iis soldiers hamnet wondered whether sigvat wished hed taken all the warnings hed got more seriously too late to worry about that now for sigvat and for everybody else trasamund made a fist and slammed it into his thigh lets hit them hamnet thyssen and ulric skakki looked at each other what do you think ulric asked we might as well hamnet asked if we can break the links between the rulers big army down in the south and the gap weve done something useful theyd better have a tough time reinforcing their men down in the empire i suppose so ulric didnt sound thrilled after a moment he explained why any time you say something that starts with if we can i start worrying about it me in particular or anybody hamnet inquired anybody the adventurer replied well good i wouldnt want to be singled out count hamnet murmured trasamund went on shouting trying to fire up the bizogots and get them moving that very moment a crack squadron of imperial cavalry would have had trouble riding off to war as fast as he wanted the mammothherders to move when the bizogots didnt get cracking fast enough to suit him he yelled louder than ever a bizogot who wasnt from the three tusk clan complained loudly and profanely trasamund knocked him down and kicked him the man came up with a knife in his hand trasamund kicked him again right where it did the most good the other bizogot crumpled clutching at himself he isnt going to ride to war hamnet said i dont think so ulric agreed in shrill falsetto he lowered his voice in two different ways to continue trasamunds going to get killed if he keeps doing that one of these days the other fellow will stick him before he can kick well you dont see bizogots living to get old very often do you hamnet said its a rough life up here and they dont make it any easier on themselves they never make anything easy on anyone including themselves ulric shrugged it makes them toughif the empire had to take the beating the nomads have it would have gone bellyup to the rulers a long time ago but youre rightthey pay the price for it they rode east as if they never once thought about the price hamnet and ulric rode with them if ulric worried he didnt show it hamnet thyssen looked worried even when he wasnt he was now he rode close to marcovefa to protect her if he could he understood she was more likely to protect him than the other way around but he would do what he could audun gilli and liv also rode together which one of them would protect the other was anyones guess a couple of other bizogot shamans dressed like liv in clothes all fringed and decorated with little bells rode with the fighters too maybe they could help maybe not hamnet didnt think they could do any harm the land was as flat as if a heavy weight had lain on it not long before and so one had the glacier had lingered far longer here than down in the empire every so often hamnet rode past a boulder left behind by the retreating ice if the rulers had a scout up on top of a frost heavea pingo the bizogots called such a thinghe could spot the oncoming horsemen from a long long way count hamnet didnt think they would that was a ploy for an army staying in one spot not for men moving south as fast as they could heres hoping theyre just warriors with no wizard along he said to ulric skakki yes heres hoping ulric replied we could use an easy fight for a change snowshoe hares bounded away from the bizogots ptarmigans flew off wings whirring the hunting up here was marvelous especially in the brief burgeoning season of the year hamnet thought it was a shame he was hunting a quarry that could hunt him too they they are an outrider pointed due east to hamnet thyssen those wiggles on the horizon might have been anything his eyes werent particularly bad but they werent particularly good either before long he made out mammoths mammoths with men atop them those could only be rulers the bizogots herded mammoths and used them but didnt ride them till they saw the rulers in action riding mammoths had never occurred to them now they were wild to learn the art if they survived and stayed free maybe they would if before long the rulers spied the bizogots too they stopped heading south and swung toward the west they used their common battle formation mammoths anchoring the center of their line with warriors on riding deer out to either wing horses were better riding animals than deer even if they lacked antlers but fighting against mammoths was like fighting the glacier the glacier is melting hamnet reminded himself the bizogots could beat mammoths they could yes but it wouldnt be easy ii as the two little armies closed with each other trasamund harangued the bizogots this is our chance for revenge we can hurt them we can kill them it doesnt matter that they beat us before we are the bizogots the lords of this land time to offer up some blood to god the blond barbarians cheered they wanted to believe they could beat the rulers they wanted to forget their clans were shattered and they were pounded together into a makeshift fighting force the way bits of meat got stuffed into a sausage casing at least till the arrowsand the spellsstarted flying they could but ulric skakki caught count hamnets eye how often have we heard that speech he asked hamnet shrugged whats he supposed to say we might as well give up because theyre going to wallop the snot out of us i dont think so well when you put it that way maybe not ulric allowed but ive listened to the same bluster too often before a losing battle we wont lose well win that wasnt hamnet thyssen it was marcovefa who sounded even more sublimely confident than trasamund did with you working magic for us we have a chance anyhow hamnet said she made a face at him he wasnt a confident man he didnt shrink from a fight against the rulers but hed seen too many of them go wrong marcovefa only laughed now they try a spell to throw insects at us they think we cannot beat the likes of that she laughed again she might have thought it was funny but alarm trickled through hamnet the rulers had used that spell in a battle the year before and the swarms of bugs they threw at the bizogots and their animals drove them mad and paved the way for the invaders victory liv and audun gilli had had to abandon their own magic to weaken the enemy sorcery even a little would marcovefa be able to do anything else while she fought it even if she couldnt liv and audun rode with the bizogots today if marcovefa could keep the rulers wizards busy the two of them might work magic on the enemy that liv had once worked a different kind of magic on hamnet he shoved down in his mind he didnt have time to fret about liv now any more than he had time to fret about gudrid a gnat flew into his left eye he rubbed his face and sent marcovefa a reproachful look maybe it was a natural gnat not one the rulers had inspired maybe marcovefa was just weakening the spell not blocking it altogether he supposed he could forgive her a gnat or two but why did this one have to find his eye trasamund drew his blade and brandished it over his head it was a twohanded sword which meant he needed a welltrained horse to use it he couldnt hang on to the reins and swing it at the same time while he used it he had to guide his mount with knees alone arrows started flying hamnet shot again and again emptying his quiver as fast as he could the rulers had used spells to break bowstrings too not this time or if they were trying that magic marcovefa wasnt letting it get anywhere here and there invaders and riding deer crashed to the ground some lay still others writhed and thrashed in pain bizogots also went down whatever marcovefa was doing she wasnt interfering with the rulers archery therein lay her greatest danger one of those flying shafts might find her no sooner had that thought crossed hamnets mind than marcovefa caught an arrow out of the air she kissed the tip and threw it back at the rulersmaybe at the man whod shot it hamnet was able to watch because it glowed as it flew and it flew faster than any shaft ever launched from a hornbacked bow it caught an enemy warrior square in the chest and he didnt move after he slid off over his riding deers tail how did you do that hamnet shouted she winked at him magic she answered as if he didnt know could you hit a war mammoth with an arrow like that he asked in any fight between rulers and bizogots the invaders had the edge because they could ride mammoths and fight from them marcovefa thought about it maybe she said at last those longnosed marmots have a lot of protection though did she mean the thick leather armor the mammoths wore or the rulers ward spells hamnet didnt know he didnt have much time to wonder either the rival forces came to close quarters trasamund worked fearsome execution with that twohanded blade hamnet drew his own sword and traded cuts with an enemy warrior till their mounts carried them past each other trasamund guided his horse toward a mammoth hamnet wondered if battle fury had driven the three tusk jarl out of his wits but there was method to his madness he sprang down from the horse and hewed at the mammoths left hind leg the huge beast let out a horrid bleat of pain and toppled hamstrung the warriors atop the mammoth shrieked as it crashed to the ground one tried to leap clear only to be crushed by that mountain of falling flesh another did jump free but it did him no good trasamund cut him down before he could even get to his feet then the jarl remounted and rode toward another mammoth he cant do that twice ulric skakki exclaimed i didnt think he could do it once count hamnet answered now the rulers knew what trasamund had in mind they shot at him again and again an arrow in its throat his horse sank like a ship that had hit a rock but it had got him close to the woolly mammoth careless of his own safety he dashed forward his huge sword swung in an arc of mayhem and struck home the mammoth bugled distress like the other great beast it went down and that was as much as the rulers wanted their war mammoths had given them the edge in every fight with the bizogots against a berserk madman who would maim them without caring whether he lived or died they had no sure defense they turned and fled north as fast as their riding deer and the mammoths still hale would carry them hamnet thyssen would have called for a pursuit had the rulers tried to keep going south if they were heading away from their army down in the empire he was content to let them go theyd hurt the bizogots too this little band couldnt stand too much hard use or it would fall to pieces for now the bizogots made the most of victory they dismounted and methodically finished off any wounded rulers they found no one went near the thrashing crippled war mammoths i hate to waste all that meat a bizogot said it could feed us for quite a while but if we come back tomorrow we can fight the lions and the bears and the dire wolves and the foxes and the teratorns for the scraps ulric skakki said he was bound to be right the beasts wouldnt leave so much flesh lying around for long but right now those mammoths could still kill we can butcher the deer that went down they wont give us any trouble hamnet said and the horses liv added and the horses hamnet agreed without enthusiasm he wasnt fond of horse meat and nothing would ever make him like it but nothing went to waste on the bizogot steppe with meat to be had the nomads would take it marcovefa looked at the rulers swarthy curlybearded corpses they would be tasty she said plenty of flesh on themthey didnt go hungry well almost nothing goes to waste on the bizogot steppe hamnet thought marcovefas clan up atop the glacier thought nothing of eating dead enemies life there was even harsher than it was here he shook his head people down here dont do that or if they did do it they never talked about it who could say what went on in poor clans in harsh winters even the folk who might have talked wouldnt the strongest taboo possible lay on admitting one had tasted mans flesh seems a shame to let them lie there for your birds and big foxes marcovefa used the name shed made up for dire wolves theyd gone round that pingo before instead of doing it again hamnet asked how strong was the magic the rulers threw at you nothing special she answered if my folk could ever come down from the top of the glacier they would show the rulers and everyone else what real rulers are she was probably right it might happen one day as the ice continued to melt and avalanches offered easier paths down hamnet thyssen refused to worry about it his greatgreatgrandchildren could do that if he ever had descendants of his own marcovefa had just been talking about dining on his main worry she wouldnt get away from it either you know she said with the enemy inside you you can work real magic against him you know him in a way you never would without eating him no hamnet said again not unless you think you can beat the rulers all by yourself no one down here wants anything to do with a cannibal it may be all right for you but we have strong bans against eating people the alarming thing was marcovefa thought about it only after that consideration did she reluctantly shake her head maybe not by myself she said too much might go wrong but it is a foolish ban all customs look foolish to people who dont follow them that wasnt hamnetit was ulric but if you laugh at them thats one of the easiest ways i know to make everybody hate you when we were up on the glacier we stayed polite to your clan hamnet added we gave them the meat we carried with us so they wouldnt eat you instead marcovefa broke in well yes hamnet said but we didnt try to stop them from butchering their enemies after a fight we helped them win and we didnt say anything when they ate mens flesh we just didnt eat any ourselves our customs are right marcovefa maintained for you ulric said not for everybody same with ours if he hadnt added the last three words the shaman from atop the glacier would have got angry at him hamnet thyssen could see the warning signs on her face he wouldnt have wanted to anger any wizard let alone one as powerful as marcovefa but ulric managed to disarm her she gave him a grudging nod maybe she said the butchery went on even if the bizogots left the hamstrung mammoths alone they had plenty of meat once they saw that they stopped caring so much about leaving some behind not elegant maybe but its a victory ulric said we need victories we dont see them often enough hamnet replied now weve given the rulers a poke and well see what they do next you have a knack for making everything sound so delightful you always did ulric skakki batted his eyes count hamnet picked up a pebble and threw it at him ulrics hand dropped to the hilt of his sword but he was laughing so was hamnet thyssen you could do that after you won a battle somewhere to the north the rulers wouldnt think anything was funny right now days stretched as spring advanced nights shrank the air was murmurous with birds and with bugs down at sudertorp lake the reedchoked waters by the shore would be full of nesting ducks and geese and swans for years the leaping lynx bizogots had lived well off the waterfowl so well that they built stone houses to live in during the spring and summer though they had to follow the herds the rest of the year but the rulers had shattered the leaping lynxes the year before whos holding sudertorp lake now hamnet asked trasamund anyone have the rulers garrisoned it i dont think so the jarl answered by the time they got down there most of the birds would have flown theyre strangers here they might not even know how rich it gets come spring then we ought to go there hamnet said if they are taking the waterfowl we should drive them off if we can if they arent we ought to take the birds ourselves the hunting is easythe leaping lynxes show that we could spend less time tending the herds and more time rousing the bizogots against the rulers trasamund plucked at his beard it could be i hate to walk in on a clans territory when im not at war with it but you know the leaping lynxes are shattered count hamnet said weve got some of them with us put it to them if you want ask if theyd rather see the rulers eating their waterfowl or if the birds should go to their own kind the bizogot chieftain rumbled laughter youre sneakier than you look thyssen if i ask them like that by god i know what theyll say thats the idea hamnet said if you ask the question the right way youll get the answer you want unless i dont trasamund said with bizogots you never can tell we are a free people we are he sounded proud of his folks freedom hamnet thyssen nodded somberly yes thats so and i cant think of anything thats done you more harm in your fight against the rulers if you made war as a unit instead of by clans that didnt want to stand with other clans wouldnt you have had more luck he strode off leaving trasamund staring after him as he walked he wondered too late if hed just sunk his own scheme if the three tusk jarl got angry at him wouldnt he be less likely to want to follow a suggestion no matter how sensible it was why didnt that occur to me sooner he wondered unhappily but he knew the answer if something came to him he was likely to say it hed helped ruin things with liv by blurting out questions he should have swallowed that might have gone wrong anyway but hed sure given it a push he must have still been scowling when he came up to ulric skakki because the adventurer said whats gnawing at you now you look like somebody just told you youd have rocks for supper no the rocks are in my head ive been stupid hamnet explained how hed botched things with trasamund ulric raised a quizzical eyebrow at least you know you messed up most people never figure that out but how do i keep from making the same mistakes over and over hamnet asked ulric looked at him if i knew the answer to that dont you think id do it myself if you find out let me know count hamnet must not have offended trasamund too badly the jarl shouted the rest of the bizogots into moving toward sudertorp lake on they went driving their herds before them they crashed into what had been the grazing grounds of several tribes but no one complained can you imagine the wars we would have started if we tried this journey before the rulers came trasamund asked and he let out a gusty sigh you dont need to sound so disappointed ulric skakki said scoff all you please the jarl said the glory of the bizogot folk is shattered forever not if we can beat the rulers hamnet said then you can get back a lot of what you lost well some it it anyhow some maybe but so many clans have broken up so many fine grazing grounds are up for grabs now the steppe will never be the same trasamund sighed again nothing can ever be the same when the world crashes down you dont lift it up onto your shoulders again hamnet winced his own world had crashed down twice first when gudrid left him for whomever she pleased then when liv chose audun gilli instead of him his body was seamed with scars from swordstrokes and arrows that had got home scars seamed his soul too none of the wounds his body bore disabled him he wasnt so sure about the ones inside dire wolves began tracking the musk oxen with the bizogots the big wolves knew enough to stay out of bowshot that meant they werent desperately hungry if they had been they would have gone for the kill and worried about everything else later sometimes there wasnt much difference between a wolf and a man the dire wolves scent was enough to spook the musk oxen they formed a defensive circle on the plain the bulls and big cows facing out and protecting the smaller females and calves with their horns as long as they stayed in the circle the bizogots who herded them couldnt go anywhere either that meant the whole band of bizogots either had to halt or to split and leave the herdsmen behind with the balky beasts trasamund solved that with direct action the way a bizogot jarl might be expected to solve a problem at his bawled commands some of the bizogots attacked the dire wolves hungrier wolves might have gone after the horsemen who galloped down on them this pack turned and ran only a couple of them got shot and one of those didnt seem badly wounded it certainly ran off at a good clip the other dire wolf made more more than a few paces before it went down blood ran from its mouth the arrow had pierced a lung and maybe its heart as well it writhed and twisted and quickly died are they going to leave the carcass there marcovefa sounded shocked theyll skin it i suppose hamnet answered sure enough a bizogot bent down to do just that what about the meat we have enough he said the only time we eat dire wolf is when were very hungry and cant get anything better and some of the bizogots here are from the red dire wolf clan they may not eat of their own fetish animal that at least i understand said the shaman from atop the glacier the other she shook her head you have so much down here you can afford to waste things we ate little foxes when we could catch them you can just leave these big foxes out to rot so strange if you had herds of mammoths and musk oxen or herds of riding deer like the rulers would you still eat fox meat count hamnet asked i dont know i hope so marcovefa answered with the wolves driven off the bizogots shouted and waved and got the musk oxen moving again it took longer than trasamund wished it would have miserable stubborn creatures the jarl grumbled and theyre different from bizogots because ulric skakki asked politely trasamund rewarded him with a glare their heads are harder count hamnet suggested are you sure ulric didnt sound as if he believed it funny men funny as a funeral trasamund said keep joking funny men and maybe it will be your funeral if the rulers havent killed me yet im not going to lose any sleep about you ulric blew him a kiss trasamund set a hand on the hilt of his sword maybe you should maybe i should do lots of things im not very likely to do ulric replied with a yawn maybe one of them is know when to keep your mouth shut hamnet suggested the adventurer looked comically astonished there are such times count hamnet gave up they rode on every so often a small band of bizogots would join them hardly ever did one man come in alone as might have happened in the empire up here winters were so hard and long that one man was unlikely to survive them on his own as he might have in raumsdalia the bizogots had to cooperate to live but the land was too niggardly to support anything more than clans the only way hamnet thyssen saw for the mammothherders to go from folk to nation was by conquering richer country farther southby invading the raumsdalian empire in other words in days gone by hed brooded about such things now he needed to brood about a folk that had invaded the empire not about one that might when the bizogots came to sudertorp lake they came to its western edge where a natural dam of rock and permanently frozen earth contained the waters that had flowed into its basin as the glacier retreated across the bizogot steppe all this water marcovefa exclaimed not frozen water not now no hamnet agreed it freezes every winter though winter before last hed ridden across the ice covering sudertorp lake hed almost died too when the rulers magic split the ice and nearly spilled his comrades and him into the freezing waters below and this is supposed to be a great thing marcovefa laughed at him where i come from the glacier never thaws really i didnt notice when i was there count hamnet didnt do light sarcasm as well as ulric skakki but he did manage to squeeze a chuckle from the shaman from atop the glacier swifts and swallows skimmed low above the water snatching insects out of the air ducks and geese and swans and coots and grebes and loons nested amidst the reeds and rushes tall herons stabbed fish out of the water with swordlike beaks hamnet wondered what the fish ate during the winter one another probably he imagined sudertorp lake holding one very large very ferocious fish at the start of each new spring obviously the picture was impossible that didnt stop it from forming a lion drinking at the edge of the lake looked up when it heard or smelled or saw the bizogots bearing down on it its snarl showed formidable fangsnot fangs to match those of the sabertooths farther south but formidable all the same when the snarl didnt intimidate the bizogots the lion trotted away darktufted tail tip held proud and high on the other side of the glacier big hunting cats had stripes instead of a mane the rulers called them tigers hamnet thyssen wondered whether any of them had come down through the gap just our luck if they have he thought but the rulers were worse predators than tigers or lions or dire wolves or bears im surprised we dont see more ea gles up here getting fat off all the waterbirds ulric skakki remarked they make their nests out of twigs they build them in trees or on cliffsides count hamnet said no twigs no trees he waved no cliffs either a point three points in fact ulric said all right fine have it your way im not surprised it makes perfect sense nothing makes perfect sense hamnet eyed the adventurer including you ulric clutched his heart i am wounded to the slowwhich has a harder time getting out of the way than the quick what are you going on about trasamund asked and then answered his own question more raumsdalian foolishness i doubt not well you wouldnt expect us to spout bizogot foolishness would you your ferocity ulric replied in calm reasonable tones we leave that to you the jarl muttered under his breath the day will come when youve joked once too often i shouldnt wonder ulric said all the more reason to enjoy myself before it does dont you think he studied trasamund the way a natural phi los o pher might study a nondescript beetle or do you think hamnet thyssen studied trasamund too and studied the tide of red rising from his neck to his cheeks i think thats enough of that he said do recall we are supposed to be on the same side oh i recall my insults to my enemies are more pointed ulric mimed drawing and loosing a bow in the next engagement in fact ill use the points you made about ea gles nests or the absence thereof you are quite mad trasamund said ulric skakki inclined his head like a nobleman receiving a coveted compliment your most humble and sometimes obedient servant your ferocity in point of fact though when the wind blows from the south i do know a hawk from a heron the herons are the ones that nest in the reeds mad trasamund repeated hamnet thyssen was inclined to agree with him they saw a few of the rulers riding deer as they traveled east along the northern shore of sudertorp lake the deer werent in large herds though and the bizogots and raumsdalians didnt come across any of the squat ferocious invaders from beyond the gap count hamnet supposed the deer were stragglers that wanted to wander the bizogot plains on their own without caring about what the rulers wanted he sympathized with them the bizogots wanted to do exactly the same thing unfortunately the rulers had other plans such strange beasts marcovefa set the thumbs of both hands on her forehead above her eyes and spread her fingers wide miming antlers none of the animals that lived atop the glacier hamnet recalled had antlers or horns they had to seem odd to marcovefa odder even than the horns of musk oxen or cattle because the antlers had so many tines they fend off enemies with them they dig with them the males fight with them hamnet said down in the empire and nearby lands only stags have antlersthe does do without but with these riding deer both sexes carry them though the males are larger why dont we kill them the shaman asked the bizogots like waterfowl better when they can get them he answered dont you she shrugged i ate birds up on the glacier mostly small ones yes but sometimes ones like these too the deer are new they dont taste like musk ox or anything else new tastes are more interesting to me venison was different from musk ox but it wasnt as different as duck or goose if you want to shoot one you can do that count hamnet sad ill help you eat it if you do do you want me to marcovefa asked id just as soon eat fat goose he answered if youd rather have venison though i wont complain ill help you put it away the way i said i would that would be good i dont want to waste it marcovefa said seriously even more than the regular bizogots the folk who lived atop the glacier had a horror of waste count hamnet supposed that was why they were cannibals understanding it didnt make him want to imitate it when the riders spotted a deer wandering along marcovefa strung her bow she sang to the arrow she nocked the chant was in her own dialect which meant hamnet could make out only a few words he guessed the charm was to make the arrow fly straight and true but he would have guessed the same thing if he couldnt have understood any of it marcovefa drew the bow to her ear and let fly the arrow charmed or not struck the deer just behind the left shoulder the animal started to run but its legs went out from under it after a few strides it fell to the steppe thrashing feebly good shot hamnet thyssen said can you charm them against men the same way sometimes not always men are harder marcovefa answered countercharms hamnet wondered those too but men dont want to be shot their will opposes the spell she said animals dont know anything about it till it happens to an animal everything is a surprise i hadnt thought of that hamnet said i never imagined it would matter in magic everything matters finding out where finding out howthats what a shaman does marcovefa dismounted and went over to the riding deer hamnet would have waited till it stopped kicking but it didnt try to savage her she swiped a knife across its throat with a humansounding sigh it died as its blood rivered out up atop the glacier they would have saved that blood for puddings and sausages they might have down on the bizogot steppe too if they werent traveling marcovefa gutted the deer they would have used more of the offal up atop the glacier too she looked not so much unhappy as resigned when she pushed the rest of the carcass away from the steaming pile of guts too much left for the big foxes again she said nothing to worry about hamnet said venison steak was just about as good as waterfowl when it came to a choice between venison chitterlings and say roast duck he would have plumped for roast duck as usual people carrying big slabs of raw bloody meat made the horses snort and flare their nostrils and sidestep count hamnet fed his mount a few earlyripening berries bribery worked almost as well as it would have with people they rounded the easternmost corner of sudertorp lake hamnet rode bareheaded the sun was warm enough to make him sweat he wasnt the only one either he watched audun gilli undo his jacket and swipe a sleeve across his forehead by god hamnet exclaimed as inspiration stuck we could bathe here we really could everybody stared at him he didnt blame the bizogots and audun and ulric for gaping chances to bathe didnt come often on the frozen steppe but it wasnt frozen now which was exactly the point it was a pleasant day they had plenty of water and even the lake wouldnt be too cold why not trasamund said why not by god the women here with us know what men look like and the men know what women look like anyone who lets his hands get gay i hope he drowns dying was easy among the bizogots drowning wasnt hamnet thyssen wasnt sure hed ever heard the word in their language before the literal meaning was smothers in water so he couldnt doubt what trasamund meant the jarl told off a few men to hold horses while the rest washed they would take their turn later the rest of the bizogots and the three raumsdalians stripped off their clothes and splashed at the edge of the lake everyone had a tan face and hands and was pale everywhere else not all that bloody warm ulric skakki muttered trying to rub dirt off his arms we wont get chest fever from it hamnet said up here that will have to do he was filthy he couldnt remember the last time hed bathed nobody else was any cleaner though if you were no dirtier than anyone around you how dirty you were could stop mattering for a while not as good as a tub but better than anything i knew before i came down off the glacier marcovefa said no lakes like this there even the springs freeze in the wintertime hamnet did and didnt want to stare at her lean athletic body seeing it in the sunshine pleased him yes despite chilly water though he didnt want to show everyone else how much it pleased him and he feared he would when he got a glimpse of liv he deliberately turned away seeing her naked only reminded him of what had been and wasnt any more he splashed himself and scrubbed hard i hate the idea of getting back into my grimy clothes audun gilli said if you want to stay naked you can do thatfor a few weeks anyhow count hamnet didnt want to put on the smelly furs again either he knew too well he had no choice somebody splashed somebody else in a heartbeat everybody was splashing everybody else pretty soon the men started ducking one another it was a good thing theyd all left their weapons behind on the shore a hulking bizogot tried to shove ulric underwater the mammothherder flew over the adventurers shoulder and splashed into the lake on his back he came up coughing and puffing and blowing water dripping from his beard and the end of his nose but his blue eyes glowed how did you do that teach me another time maybe ulric said when weve got our clothes on again a woman let out an irate squawk then she did her best to smother with water the bizogot who hadnt listened to the jarl the man tried to apologize but he was spluttering too hardand laughing too hard too then she hauled off and hit him bizogot women were solid and strong she packed a mean punch the man stopped laughing and howled instead enough trasamund shouted he could sound authoritative even nakedno mean feat you gave him what he deserved he still needs to be able to fight when hamnet came out of sudertorp lake he let the sun and the southerly breeze dry him then he climbed back into his clothes they seemed even nastier now than hed thought they would and of course they were crawling with lice before long he would be once more too and before long he wouldnt notice the sour stink that clung to them any more as ulric dressed he made a face and said some people werent very good at keeping clean no one would ever have imagined he might be one of those people the leaping lynxes stone huts werent far from the eastern end of sudertorp lake theyd built them by the marshes where the waterfowl nested most thickly some of the refugee leaping lynxes sighed to be coming home under such sorry circumstances other bizogots seemed surprised and impressed that their countrymen had built any kind of permanent housing then a man came out of one of the stone huts he wasnt especially tall but thick in the chest and wide through the shoulders he had black hair and a long thick elaborately curled beard in short he belonged to the rulers he carried a bone staff in his right hand fire leaped from it as he pointed it at the bizogots iii flame engulfed a mammothherder and his horse the man screamed so did the animal and galloped across the steppe fire still clung to it and to its rider the horse ran on long after it should have dropped hamnet wondered whether the sorcerous conflagration burned and preserved at the same time to make torment last and last laughing the wizard raised the bone staff and pointed it at another bizogot the man ducked not that that would have done him any good flame sprang forth from the staff once more marcovefa raised a hand and spoke sharply in her own dialect the flame stopped before it reached the bizogot the wizard from the rulers stared as if he couldnt believe his eyes then the streak of fire started to slide back toward him faster and faster he stared again this time plainly in horror and shouted something in his guttural language more rulers came out of other huts some of them must have been wizards too for they carried staves like the first mans when they added their strength to his they stopped the fire just before it recoiled on him marcovefa bit her lip as the flame ever so slowly began to move out again this time toward her audun gilli and liv began incanting too to give her what aid they could all together though they were not quite a match for the sorcerous power the rulers had gathered here but there were ways around that hamnet thyssen needed a few heartbeats longer than he might have to realize as much when he did he wasted no more time he strung his bow aimed at the closest enemy wizard and let fly the rulers sorcerers normally brushed arrows aside with some small spell or another putting forth all their strength against marcovefa they had no time or energy for such minor wizardries the arrow caught the sorcerer square in the chest he looked absurdly surprised as he clutched at himself his knees buckled he slumped to the ground ulric skakki and the bizogots started shooting right after hamnet did two or three other sorcerers fell wounded or killed that meant the lot of them couldnt concentrate on marcovefa any more and she proved more than equal to anything but the lot of them they might have paid less attention to the fire one of them had first unleashed she didnt when they shielded themselves against arrows they left themselves vulnerable to the flames they screamed when their bone staves caught fire and screamed again when they did they dashed this way and that trying to quell the flames some of them had the presence of mind to plunge into sudertorp lake but not even water quenched the fire like sulfurous oil they went right on burning steam rose from the lake the fire didnt touch the rulers who werent wizards they tried to flee the bizogots rode after them slaying enemies who ran from them made ever so much better sport than fleeing themselves i thank you marcovefa said riding up alongside hamnet she leaned toward him and brushed her lips across his even for me a few too many there at first something kindled in her eyes later on i thank you properly we have to make do with words right now best thing ive heard today hamnet answered deadpan marcovefa laughed he went on why had so many of their wizards gathered here better to ask them than meexcept i dont think any of them are left alive her nostrils flared and most are too cookedtoo charred that is the word you useto be worth eating yes count hamnet left it right there that stink had invaded his nose too at least he didnt confuse it with the smell of roasting pork the way he had up atop the glacier remembering how hed hungered for mans flesh before realizing what it was still raised his hackles well these huts are ours now by godours by right of conquest trasamund said proudly the rulers ran off the leaping lynxes and now weve run off the rulers we may not be a neat tidy clan of the oldfashioned kind but well have to do times arent what they were before the rulers came either ulric skakki stared at him in artfully simulated disbelief a bizogot jarl admits the times are changing what is this sorry old world coming to i dont know by the past couple of years nothing good trasamund said but im not dead yet and some more of those maggoty muskox turds are that i like and i know the world is changing was i not the first man through the gap he struck a pose there on horse back ulric didnt tell him no but the adventurer had gone through the gap the winter before him none of the three tusk bizogots knew ulric had crossed their grazing grounds and he didnt want it known trasamund pointed to the wizards blackened corpses a good thing these burning bastards didnt start grass fires that could have been a nuisance i hadnt thought about it but youre not wrong count hamnet said grass fires can be very bad trasamund said not now but later in the yearat the end of summer and the start of fall before the first snows we dont get much summer rain here and things dry out when fires start they can spread and spread they can ruin grazing grounds when that happens wars follow you have to have somewhere to take your herds or if the fires catch the animals you have to grab someone elses when its that or die you do what needs doing i suppose so hamnet said hed fought in plenty of wars with less behind them than life and death trasamund pointed to the stone huts lets make sure we havent got any more vermin skulking in there a raumsdalian would have spoken of serpents or scorpions the frozen steppe lacked a few unpleasant things anyhow the jarl of the three tusk clan went on we can live off the fatby god the goose greaseof the land for a while anyhow then things get hard again they always do curse them no more rulers remained hamnet thyssen did wonder why so many wizards had come together when he wondered out loud once more ulric said to plot mischief against us why else i cant think of any other reason either hamnet replied i wish i could maybe your lady friends and audun will figure out what they were up to from the stuff they left behind ulric said hamnet gave him a stony look liv is not my lady friend these days you may perhaps have noticed perhaps nothing bothered ulric skakkior if it did he didnt let it show which served about as well still in that blithe vein he went on you dont have to hate a lover after she leaves you you know you can yes but its not a requirement livs a ladyno doubt about thatand she makes a good friend whether youre sleeping with her or not do i tell you how to run your life hamnet growled as a matter of factyes that caught hamnet with his mouth open he closed it before a bug flew inat this season of the year a real worry on the bizogot steppe not just a way for mothers to scold their children he feared ulric was telling the truth he did like to run other peoples lives not just his own feebly he said well ill try not to do it any more no no try to do it less ulric said which only made his confusion worse compared to proper houses raumsdalian houses the huts the leaping lynxes had run up were sorry their roofs were thatch over a framework of bones held together with sinew no one had tended to them since the rulers ran the bizogots away from sudertorp lake that left the huts draftier than they might have been during springtime though it wasnt such a great hardship hamnet and marcovefa took one of the huts for their own he threw out the bones and other trash that had accumulated in there marcovefa gave him a quizzical look why bother she said it doesnt stink or anything you dont care much about house keeping do you he said i dont care any about house keeping marcovefa answered why bother i save caring for things that matter he supposed that made sense lots of people he knew had made sense lately marcovefa ulric skakki even trasamund to quote ulric what was this old world coming to but to stay friends with a woman whod left you to stay friends with a woman whod left you for a weed of a man like audun gilli hamnet could believe ulric was friends with a swarm of women in the empire and on the frozen steppe and likely elsewhere as well ulric didnt take anything or anybody seriously if he ran into a woman hed slept with once upon a timewell so what he wouldnt fret about it when hamnet met a woman though he always thought she was the woman and he hated admitting even to himself that he might have made a mistake if things didnt work out then of course he blamed the woman for the failure how could you stay friends with someone you blamed he glanced over at marcovefa if things went wrong between them would he wind up shunning her too he suspected he would he seemed to work that way whether ulric skakki approved or not she was looking at him too she beckoned now that we have this clean floor thanks to you we ought to use it i said i would thank you for that arrow before now i will she shrugged out of her jacket it was still light outside bizogots cared much less about privacy than raumsdalians living the way they did that was no surprise it also held true for their cousins from atop the glacier hamnet preferred privacy but hed spent enough time among the bizogots to do without it at need had she thanked him any more thoroughly he thought he would have fallen over dead he couldnt imagine a more enjoyable way to go after his heart stopped thudding quite so hard he said i should save you more often why not marcovefa agreed lazily she seemed in no hurry to put her clothes back on when hamnet was younger he would have tried for a second round in a little while now that he was the age he was he knew he would have to wait longer most of the time he took that for granted sprawling naked beside an inviting woman who was also a powerful shaman he realized he might not have to can you do anything magical to get him back into shape again in a hurry he asked she looked at him sidelong what do you want me to do i dont know youre the wizard he said how about this she leaned over and did something it should have raised the dead raising the middleaged proved a bigger challenge she muttered to herself then murmured to herself then began a chant in her own dialect the tune she chose almost made hamnet start to laugh down to the southwest of the raumsdalian empire the manche barbarians had wizards who could charm snakes with music marcovefa had never seen a snakewell shed never seen a twoeyed snake anyhowbut her tune was a lot like theirs and it worked like a charmed snake he rose to the occasion she nodded to herself there it is she said now what do you want to do with it he did laugh then so much that he lost what shed given him she didnt seem too annoyed about repeating the spell hamnet found something to do with it after all marcovefa seemed contented afterwards too again she asked then count hamnet remembered that he remembered thinking about the answer he didnt remember giving it which was fair enough because he fell asleep before he could when he woke up he found marcovefa had pulled a blanket cut from a mammoth hide over the two of them he was still bare under the hide a moment later he discovered she was too it was still light outside no it was light again the brief northern night had come and gone and the sun was shining from a different direction now marcovefa stirred only a couple of minutes after hamnet did happy now she asked him her voice said she was smugly certain of the answer and he nodded with you yes i should hope so but he went on id be happier if we could drive the rulers back beyond the gap marcovefa grunted she got out from under the blanket and in a marked manner got into her clothes she paused only once to say no wonder you lose women no wonder at all hamnet agreed mournfully wondering if hed lost her too all he did was answer the question she asked him he didnt even forget to say something nice about her but then he went on to the rest of what was in his mind too lateas usualhe realized that was his mistake when would he ever learn no would he ever learn late or otherwise you are what you are thats all marcovefa seemed to be reminding herself she shrugged well who isnt since she seemed willing to leave it there hamnet thyssen didnt push it either as he also dressed he decided not pushing it was a good idea and progress of a sort that also would have been too late to do him any good had he decided the other way the bizogots had a fire of dried dung going they were roasting meat above it hamnets stomach rumbled there were appetites and then there were appetites filling your belly wasnt so much as making love but you wouldnt go on making love very long even with sorcerous assistance if you were empty hamnet got a muskox rib instead of gnawing on it he gave it to marcovefa then he grabbed another one for himself maybe she would recognize the peace offering maybe not she certainly ate with good appetite bizogots always did and their close kin from atop the glacier even more so and the only way she could have got more off the bone was with a rough tongue like a lions her tongue wasnt the least bit rough hamnet knew that as well as a man could she took another rib and denuded that one too you people are so lucky to have such big meatbeasts she said do you know how lucky you are voles pikas hares thats all we knew well that and the beasts that go on two legs i was up there i saw how you lived hamnet said you did what you could with what you had people everywhere do the same he thought of the manches again and of how they scraped a living from their desert that wasnt the same as what the bizogots did but it wasnt necessarily easier either there is so much more to have down here marcovefa said the animals the trees thewhat do you call them down in the empire the crops thats it plants that arent berries but you can eat them anyhow and the big berry things that grow on trees fruit hamnet said apples and pears and plums surprised the bizogots too they had nothing like them marcovefa wasnt done and the headspinning stuff the smetyn and the beer and the wine once in a while we find mushrooms to send shamans into the spirit world you go whenever you want you are so lucky i am so jealous count hamnet wouldnt have called getting drunk going into the spirit world when he did it he mostly did it to forget whatever was troubling his spirit but it was new and wonderful to the shaman from atop the glacier everything was new and wonderful to marcovefa she was like a child in a fairyland if it sometimes looked like a nightmare to hamnet maybe he was the jaded one and maybe hed seen enough of the world down here on the ground to have a better notion of what was what than she did he suspected that was so but didnt make the claim out loud he didnt feel like arguing besides he might have been wrong he rather hoped he was ulric skakki also snagged a second rib he took a bite then nodded to hamnet cozy little place weve got isnt it till the rulers find out were here hamnet replied how long do you think that will take depends on whether any of them got away yesterday the adventurer said i dont think so but im not sure or maybe one of the wizards got word out magically and they already know wont be long any which way when the wizards dont show up wherever theyre supposed to the rulers will come see why not that was less palatable than juicy muskox meat i wish you didnt make so much sense hamnet said ulric only shrugged if you dont like the answers dont ask the questions hamnet thyssen sighed i dont like the answers who would but i needed to hear them well there you are then ulric said now youve heard them i dont think the rulers will get here before we finish breakfastat least if we hurry he bit another chunk of meat off the rib ears burning hamnet ate some more too we need to send out patrols trasamund said in his usual tone of brooking no arguments if the rulers are moving to the north and south we need to know about it suppose theyre going around the west end of sudertorp lake ulric skakki liked arguments brooked or not what do we do then trasamund scowled why would their wizards meet here if their main route runs around the other end of the lake he demanded well youve got something there ulric said how much i dont know but something the jarl gave him a sardonic bow more than i expected from you by god you never admit youre wrong do you hamnet could have told him that was the wrong thing to say to ulric he didnt need to ulric proved quite capable of demonstrating it on his own when i am wrong i dont have any trouble admitting i amunlike some people i could name the difference is im not wrong very often so naturally you wouldnt have heard me talk about it much you are a funny man trasamund rumbled funny as my nightmares really let me take a look ulric skakki ambled over and peered into the bizogots left ear he started to laugh youre right that is a funny one in there cursing trasamund cuffed himor tried ulric caught his arm before the blow landed caught it and twisted trasamund let out a startled grunt of pain when he tried to get away ulric twisted harder youll break it if you do much more trasamund said hamnet admired how calmly he brought out the words thats the idea ulric answered when you go hitting people who didnt hit you you cant look for them to like it well maybe you can but youll be disappointed let go of me and ill cut you in half trasamund snarled ulric gave back a merry laugh you really know how to get a man to do what you want dont you your ferocity what do you expect me to say the bizogot asked how about sorry skakki now i know better than to talk to people with my fist that ought to do it ulric jerked on trasamunds arm a little more something in there creaked count hamnet heard it plainly despite trasamunds courage his face went gray he choked out the words ulric skakki wanted to hear the adventurer let him go and jumped back in case he still showed fight trasamund didnt not right away he worked his wrist to make sure it wasnt broken after all once satisfied of that he managed a glare ill pay you back for that one day skakki he growled youre welcome to try ulric said politely but would you give any man leave to hit you for a joke no man has leave to hit me no matter why trasamund said then why did you think you had leave to hit me ulric asked because he was doing the hitting not taking the blow hamnet thyssen said when the bizogot didnt answer right away that won him a glower when i want you putting words in my mouth thyssen ill stick out my tongue for you trasamund said better that than sticking your foot in your face hamnet observed trasamund looked blank for a moment hamnet realized hed translated a raumsdalian phrase into the bizogots language then the jarl got it his hand went over his shoulder so he could draw his great blade but he winced when his fingers closed on the leatherwrapped hilt the wrist still pained him maybe it even made him thoughtful he let his hand drop contenting himself with saying your time will come too i dont doubt it everyones does hamnet agreed but i hope it doesnt come at your hands that would mean were fighting each other not the rulers trasamund chewed on that by his expression he didnt care for the taste well youre right he said at last an astonishing admission from any bizogot and doubly astonishing from him then he added but once theyre whipped dont think ive forgotten about you count hamnet bowed once the rulers are whipped your ferocity i will meet you wherever you please i will meet you here i will meet you down in nidaros i will meet you in the doorway to the golden shrine if that tickles your fancy the doorway to the golden shrine is it trasamund threw back his head and laughed by god your grace youre on once we beat the rulers ill cut your heart out in the doorway to the golden shrine he held out his hand bargain ill meet you there surely hamnet thyssen clasped with him as ulric says youre welcome to try you may get a surprise thoughand if you do it may be your last one im not afraid of you im not afraid of skakki either trasamund said you can go on about surprises as much as you want death is always the last surprise ulric threw his hands in the air when a bizogot jarl gets philosophical on you its time to go do something else he mooched off that one trasamund shook his head in mingled exasperation and affection so hamnet judged anyhowthose two emotions always warred in him when he thought of the adventurer trasamund went on what are we going to do about him turn him loose against the rulers count hamnet said if thats not the most important thing were doing were doing something wrong weve done plenty of things wrong the jarl said which was only too true not that one thoughnot lately anyhow they taught us their lessons the hard way so they did hamnet left it there the hard way was the only way the bizogots understoodwhen they understood any way at all hamnet gnawed on a roasted goose leg as he rode across the bizogot steppe ulric skakki was working on a swans drumstick that would have been an expensive delicacy down in the empire at sudertorp lake the swans bred in as much exuberant profusion as the smaller waterfowl and sudertorp lake was merely the largest of the many lakes and ponds and puddles dotting the flat ground that was still frozen a few feet down count hamnet looked toward the northern horizon but he couldnt see the glacier see it or not he knew it was there ulric understood what his glance meant do you really think that whole mountain of ice is going to melt away before i went through the gap i would have told you no hamnet said now i suppose it will one of these days the world will be a different place then i wont be here to see it though and neither will you i suppose not ulric said seeing whatand whowas on the other sides been interesting enough and then some yes and then some hamnet thyssens gaze focused more sharply on ground much closer first glances couldand often diddeceive the steppe had little dips and rises that had a way of hiding trouble till it was right on top of you or sometimes right in back of you every time something moved count hamnets hand started to go to his sword or his bow and things did move again and again small birds nested among the small bushes voles and lemmings scurried weasels chased them hares hopped shorteared foxes loped after them and noisywinged ptarmigan a snowy owl swooped down it rose again with a lemming in its claws prey still writhing feebly it flew past hamnet and ulric just out of bowshot hamnet felt the birds golden eyes on him till at last it turned its head in a different direction godcursed thing he muttered if its only an owl i dont mind it ulric skakki said but if its one of the rulers wizards in owl shape come to look us over the way they do if it is it just got an eyeful hamnet said two eyes full in fact i doubt it was a wizard this time ulric said oh whys that count hamnet asked the adventurer spread his hands in wry amusement well it looked us over it looked us over good and it didnt fall out of the sky laughing that makes me think it must be an ordinary owl heh hamnet thyssen said i wish that were the kind of joke that made me laugh so do i ulric replied i dont like wasting them were in a mess you know the rulers can whip the bizogots they can whip the empire the only thing they havent shown they can whip is marcovefa and theres only one of her a little bad luck and were all in a lot of trouble yes hamnet left it right there if anything happened to marcovefa the bizogots and raumsdalia would suffer true but so would he the last woman in the world who thought he was anything out of the ordinary he shook his head that wasnt quite right she was the last woman in the world who made him think he was anything out of the ordinary that made her a rarer bird yet rare as a wizard from the rulers magicked into owls shape hamnet didnt know he couldnt tell marcovefa could have if shed been along she was busy back at the leaping lynxes huts busy with something sorcerous though hamnet couldnt have said what it was she didnt mind working with liv and audun gilli sometimes hamnet could accept that sometimes it bothered him it didnt bother marcovefa though and she paid no attention to hamnets occasional grumbles he supposed he could see the logic behind that working against the rulers counted for more than personal squabbles it made perfectly good sense hed even pointed out as much to trasamund understanding it and liking it were two very different things whats going on inside your head ulric skakki asked you look like you want to murder somebody the owl count hamnet lied without hesitation ulric was too good at divining what went on inside him hamnet didnt want the adventurer to know he was worrying about his latest woman ulric would only laugh at him and tell him things he didnt want to hear even if they were trueor maybe especially if they were truehe didnt want to hear them ulric skakki eyed him now hamnet wondered if the adventurer would start telling him things even after hed lied that would be humiliating and if hamnet lost his temper and turned away ulric would laugh at him and laugh and laugh that would be more humiliating yet but ulric didnt twit hamnet instead he pointed to the northwest something over there he said dont know what but something i didnt see it hamnet thyssen confessed well its there ulric told him wed better find out what the demon it is too because its liable to be dangerous he rode off to see what hed spotted a dire wolf maybe or a lion count hamnet followed he made sure his sword was loose in the scabbard he strung his bow and reached over his shoulder to check on the position of his quiver he adjusted it a little then nodded to himself ulric laughed harshly watching him you dont believe that yourself it may not be likely but its possible hamnet said all kinds of things are possible its possible the rulers really are nice people who want the best for us ulric said its possible sure but its not bloody likely count hamnet shut up his eyes narrowed as he scanned the ground ahead lots of little dips where a man on foot might hideand the flowers and grasses and little bushes here grew as thick as they ever did on the bizogot steppe hamnet thought of snakes no real vipers up herethe mammothherders thought raumsdalians were lying when they talked about them but a man from the rulers could prove more dangerous than any rattlesnake ever hatched there ulric skakki pointed hamnet was a good hunter but ulric was better he could follow a trail that baffled the noble and he spotted motion count hamnet missed hamnet missed it till it was pointed out to him anyhow then he too saw the shifting shrubs up ahead not a wizard anyway he said as he rode toward them with ulric no eh how come youre so sure the adventurer asked dont be stupid hamnet was pleased to get a little of his own back if the bastard were a wizard he wouldnt be running from the likes of us would he ulric grunted not unless he was a cursed stupid wizard i suppose the rulers dont seem to have many of those hamnet thyssen answered i wish to god they did would make life easier wouldnt it ulric agreed now if you were a ruler stuck on foot where would you hide from a couple of savage fellows from the wrong side of the glacier whore trying to do you in right about therethat birch thicket now hamnet thyssen pointed he and ulric both laughed even if it wasnt really funny none of the birches grew much higher than his knees they were shrubs bushes not the trees they would have been south of the line where the ground stayed frozen all the time but at this season of the year their leaves gave good cover good yes but not quite good enough the birch bushes stirred someone was trying to crawl deeper into the thicket two bowstrings twanged hamnet wasnt sure whether he or ulric let fly first a grunt of dismay bitten off short said at least one arrow struck home give up count hamnet shoutedone of the fragments of the rulers language hed acquired he added another one we no kill captives to the rulers any kind of yielding looked like shameful weakness many of them preferred death to surrender manybut not all the fights across the frozen plain and inside the empire had taught hamnet as much he might despise and distrust the invaders but hed found that some of them were ordinary enough to go on breathing if they saw the chance all hamnet got this time was more wiggling among the leaves he and ulric skakki looked at each other they didnt bother nodding but both shot at about the same time again another involuntary grunt of pain told of a woundor of someone desperate who was cunningly bluffing but hamnet didnt think so he slid down from his horse and drew his sword lets find out what thehe added an obscenityknows ulric also dismounted lets make sure one of those things isnt that youre a real idiot count hamnet gave the adventurer a mocking bow i never need to worry about the different nasty things that might happen to me not when youre around you come up with more of them than i ever could always at your service your grace ulric sounded more like a trusted retainer than a comradeinarms they plunged into the low thicket together they both made plenty of noise hoping to panic their quarry into moving and showing them where to go and it worked the leaves not far from where theyd shot the ruler started thrashing the raumsdalians hurried that way embarrassing if four or five of the buggers are hiding under there ulric remarked embarrassing is hardly the word hamnet thyssen said ulric laughed for all the world as if they were trading quips at an elegant salonsay earl eyvind torfinnsdown in nidaros goblets of wine in their hands instead of sword hilts but only one ruler hid in the birch bushes when hamnet and and ulric split up to attack from two directions at once the invader from beyond the gap called out dont kill me i yield in the bizogot language good god count hamnet burst out ulric skakki didnt say anything but he looked as astonished as hamnet felt that harsh guttural accent was familiar but not in a womans contralto i bleed she said you said you would spare me will you help me and not she broke off not rape me and then cut my throat or knock me over the head was what she had to mean bleed she did she had an arrow through her right hand and another in her left calf raping a wounded woman wasnt hamnet thyssens idea of sport he wondered whether it was ulrics if it was the adventurer gave no sign of it i will draw the arrow in your leg he said and drew out a spoonlike device hed left one of those with a bizogot shaman but must have got another down in the empire as he got to work he added by the way whats your name tahpenes she said through clenched teeth iv well well isnt this intriguing ulric skakki said as he extracted the arrow from tahpenes leg she kept her teeth clenched and didnt let out a peep all through the unpleasant process hamnet had seen that the rulers warriors were made of stern stuff the same appeared to hold for their women intriguing not the word id use he said using raumsdalian like ulric they wanted tahpenes worried or he supposed they did not being able to understand them would push her down that road he eyed her with more than a little curiosity of his own she was the first woman of the rulers hed seen close up liv had spoken slightingly of their looks they werent tall and blond they werent even tall or blond tahpenes had hair so black it was almost blue dark brown eyes and a formidable blade of a nose she also had broad shoulders and formidable arms if she werent multiply wounded she might have been dangerous she might be dangerous anyhow ulric bandaged her with matteroffact competence what will you do to me uh with me she asked in the bizogots tongue whatever we want ulric said before count hamnet could answer had the adventurer done some raping and knocking over the head in his time hamnet thyssen wouldnt have been surprised he didnt want to ask even in raumsdalian right now he said well take you back for questioning tahpenes winced count hamnet had no trouble figuring out why when the rulers questioned people they put them to the question by all accounts they were good at that kind of thing and they seemed to enjoy it too we dont intend to torture you right now hamnet said trying to reassure the new captive not unless you show us we need to anyhow ulric skakki added trying to do anything but hamnet sent him an aggrieved look if that bothered ulric he concealed it very well in raumsdalian he said we may have to do some nasty things to her you never can tell and even if we dont shed better think were ready to otherwise shell just decide were soft mmh hamnet thyssen said unhappily he didnt like the idea of torturing women he didnt like the idea of torturing men either which didnt mean hed never done it and ulric had a point the rulers were much too likely to judge the bizogots and raumsdalians as soft keeping tahpenes healthily on edge wasnt the worst idea in the world can you stand ulric asked her returning to the bizogots tongue i think so she said and showed she could wait hamnet said as ulric started to lead her back toward the horses the adventurer raised a gingery eyebrow search her count hamnet told him otherwise youre liable to sprout steel in some uncomfortable spot my my and here i took you for a dewysouled innocent ulric skakki said hamnet answered that with the rude noise it deserved ulric laughed then shook his head the worst of it is youre right i may not find everything even with a good frisking but i sure wont if i dont check her at all ulric gave tahpenes a bow of sorts this isnt personal you understand just something id better do to keep you from sticking me while im not looking she didnt say anything if ulric hadnt told her the search wasnt personal it wouldnt have been hard for her to think it was he patted her through her clothes and then reached under them chances were she would have slapped his face if she didnt figure that was a fast way to get herself killed he came up with several small slim holdout blades too think i missed anything thyssen he asked when he thought he was done her hair hamnet said at once after a moment he added and women have a hiding place men dont so they do ulric said and then you have anything shoved up your twat tahpenes no she said if you do ill kill you ulric told her but the bizogot women can find out about that when we get back to our camp as for your hair he didnt ask her about that he patted and prodded at it and was rewarded with a couple of long stout pins wouldnt want one of these poking out of me neither would i hamnet nodded to tahpenes have any more give them up now and no blame to you if you say no and we find them well you wont like that i promise one more is all the woman pulled it out and gave it to ulric skakki he accepted it with a sour smile he liked missing things he should have found no more than anyone else would have all the same you can bloody well ride in front of me ulric said that way hamnet and i will both have a shot at you if you decide to get smart that way you can put your hands all over me tahpenes replied distaste in her voice if i feel like it ulric said what makes you think youve got anything id want to grope and as long as youre alive and we dont peel you out of your trousers here and now what makes you think youve got any business complaining tahpenes answered the first question with a dirty look the second with what was probably intended for a dignified silence ulric helped her climb up onto his horse that did interest her these are strange animals your riding deer with no antlers she said as he got up behind her we like em ulric answered he nodded to hamnet keep an eye on her just because she doesnt know what a horse is that doesnt mean she wouldnt do her damnedest to steal one really i never would have guessed like the adventurer hamnet thyssen used the bizogots tongue they wanted tahpenes to know they were alert she didnt try anything as they rode back to the stone huts the leaping lynxes had built when she realized where they were going one of her strong dark eyebrows rose what are you doing here she said this is where our wizards were meeting were is right hamnet told her i dont think any of them got away sure hope not anyhow ulric skakki put in tahpenes turned around to stare at him she looked away in a hurry when he blew her a kiss from close range this is not possible you are not of the rulers you are of the herd to be ruled as we think best how could you beat our wizards wasnt too hard count hamnet answered and heres a lesson for you if something happens it isnt impossible you should remember that how dare you mock me tahpenes demanded we enjoy mocking silly ideas it makes us laugh ulric answered you are not afraid by the way tahpenes said it she might have accused them of cheating at dice she was at least as arrogant as the men of her people why am i not surprised hamnet thought wryly tahpenes went on folk of the herd should be afraid something is wrong something is perverse if you are not get used to it sweetheart ulric skakki said cheerfully youve beaten us more than weve beaten you sure but weve won often enough so we know we can ask your wizards if you dont believe meif you can find any of them alive to ask i mean but you cannot beat our wizards tahpenes might have been stating a law of nature she doubtless thought she was well too bad for her she suddenly let out an indignant squeak hamnet thyssen didnt see exactly what ulric had done to her but it was something that damaged her dignity the adventurer said thats to remind you not to talk nonsense you see we did so why do you say we cant tahpenes didnt answer she was one sadly confused ruler count hamnet almost didnt blame her if not for marcovefa the wizardry from her folk would have dominated anything the shamans and sorcerers from south of the gap could do against it a bizogot spotted the two horses coming back to the stone huts he rode toward them whove you got there he called a captive hamnet stated the obvious its a woman the bizogot was full of clever observations did you bring her in for the sport of it no for questioning ulric answered if she lies to us then we can have fun with her but if she tells the truth shes worth more for that says you the mammothherder exclaimed i sure dont think so well if you want to fight me we can do that ulric said easily just let me know what you want me to do with your body once youre dead that took longer to sink in than hamnet thought it should have this bizogot plainly wasnt overburdened with brains and if he had as much pride as a lot of his comrades he would fight ulric on general principles for a moment count hamnet thought he would do just thatin which case he would have died and in short order too instead of charging though he jerked his horses head around and rode away hamnet didnt reckon him a coward few bizogots were but he must have heard the anticipation in ulric skakkis voice ulric didnt just know he could kill he looked forward to it and that was plenty to put the bizogots wind up it made tahpenes thoughtful too you act more like a man of the rulers than one from the herd she remarked a moment later she let out another shrill irate squeal tell you whatyou dont insult me and i wont feel you up ulric said deal tahpenes was silent for some little while at last she said i did not think i was insulting you i meant it for praise i know the adventurer said thats part of whats wrong with you you need to understand that your new neighbors dont love you we dont admire you we dont want to be like you and were strong enough to make what we want matter if we werent would we have caught you she looked unhappyno unhappier i thought i could spy on you without drawing notice it seems i was wrong it does doesnt it ulric skakkis tone of voice suggested she was an idiot for thinking any such thing its all of a piece hamnet said more to ulric than to their captive the rulers think they can do whatever they want get away with whatever they want sooner or later theyll find out theyre wrong theyd better or theyll end up winning this fight after all they all think like that dont they ulric had a knack for embellishing other peoples thoughts maybe they should have called themselves the herd not the rulers they all act the same like so many uh riding deer how dare you speak of us like that how dare you tahpenes snarled you dont know what youre talking about doesnt stop you from talking about us hamnet said why should it stop us from talking about you the answer blazed in her black eyes hamnet thyssen read it there the rulers had the right to do as they pleased because they were the rulers lesser folk existed only on sufferance when those lesser folk had captured you though bragging about how wonderful and mighty you were could prove inexpedient for a mediumsized wonder tahpenes was smart enough to see that hamnet pointed ahead there are the houses the leaping lynx bizogots built yes those are the houses where your precious wizards met they died right in front of them were he speaking raumsdalian he would have called the stone structures huts he always thought of them that way when he used his own language here though he wanted to make them seem impressive to tahpenes she was a nomad herself any permanent buildings were bound to be large and imposing in her eyes here comes trasamund ulric pointed to the burly jarl tahpenes knew the name we beat his clan when we first came here she said so you did count hamnet agreed why dont you tell him all about it dont you think hed want to know just how you embarrassed the bizogots he led tahpenes didnt answer she didnt boast to trasamund either pretty plainly she was clever enough to see the obvious just as plainly that put her several lengths ahead of most of the rulers marcovefa had trouble with the idea of prisoners this woman doesnt know very much she complained to hamnet thyssen weve got most of what she does know keeping her alive is nothing but a waste of food we can spare it hamnet said are you hungry hungry no by god marcovefa laughed so much food right nowall these waterfowlim getting fat no one up on top of the glacier gets fat no one not unless you have something wrong with you and you die soon only the rich got fat down in the empire that was one way you could tell they were rich they always had plenty to eat hardly any bizogots grew fat in the springtime the leaping lynxes had been the exception so many ducks and geese and swans and other birds bred at sudertorp lake what the bizogots took barely dented the abundance now trasamunds band was reaping the same benefits hamnet could smell duck grease on his own mustache he said you arent fat youre just right he hoped marcovefa believed him because he meant it how do i know that she asked well if i havent shown you i must be older and feebler than i thought i was he said he knew exactly what he could do for a man his age it wasnt bad at all of course he did get magical help every now and then too you are only a man men will say anything so they can do that marcovefa dismissed half the human race with a wave of the hand instead of arguing with her hamnet changed the subject have you learned anything worthwhile from tahpenes maybe a little marcovefa said grudgingly not much but a little like what hamnet asked i have learned i would not want to be a woman among the rulers marcovefa answered they are for screwing for birthing warriors for doing what men tell them to do and that is all poor fools to hamnet thyssen that sounded a lot like womens life among the bizogotsor for that matter down in the empire women took their revenge with adultery and other betrayal he knew more about that than hed ever wanted to find out if he said something along those lines he would only make marcovefa angry so he asked how are things different up on the glacier my folk dont think a woman with a working brain is poison marcovefa answered they like clever women in fact if women are shamans then more men can hunt and fight it is so here too i have seen slowly hamnet nodded that was true enough liv filled the bill his mouth tightened as it often did when he thought of her he knew hed tried too hard to hold on knowing didnt tell him how to stop doing things like that he wished it would have he couldnt even blame liv too much the way he did with gudrid liv hadnt sneaked around behind his back shed warned him what she was going to do and then shed done it and if audun gilli made her unhappyor more likely when audun gilli made her unhappyshed leave him the same way as for gudrid no he didnt want to think about her at all and so he asked marcovefa its different with the rulers i should say it is indignation snapped in her eyes to them a woman is nothing but a twat with legs that is how you say it yes if thats what you want to say thats how you say it all right count hamnet agreed gravely as long as a woman has the brains to lie down and open upmarcovefa demonstrated lewdlythat is all the rulers want that was all quite a few men from this side of the glacier wanted in a woman too no woman shamans among them though hamnet said none marcovefa answered this tahpenes chit she didnt think it was possible even when liv worked magic in front of her stupid pointed nose she still didnt think it was possible some people are so stupid you wonder how they stay alive some people are so stupid you wonder why they stay alive count hamnet wanted whatever weapons he could find against the rulers do you think we could stir up trouble between their men and women he asked once the women find out we let women do more things here will they squabble with their menfolk will that turn into anything we can use marcovefa kissed him you have a sneaky wicked way of looking at the worlddo you know that it all depends hamnet said ulric skakki thought he was a naturalborn innocent hamnet feared the adventurer was right otherwise how could he have stayed blind to so many things for so long but even an innocent by imperial standards might look like a sophisticate to someone whod come down from the glacier not long before do you think that might work it mightno way to know till we try marcovefa said but how do we even begin not hard sure enough hamnet did feel like a sly sophisticate he cherished the feeling knowing it might not come again any time soon let tahpenes see how things are here maybe even play things up while shes watching then let her get away she takes trouble for the rulers with her stuck inside her own head let her get away marcovefas eyes widened i would never think of that not in ten thousand years when you have a captive you keep a captive maybe you fatten up a little if you can spare the food but you keep once it formed the picture of tahpenes butchered carcass turning on a spit didnt want to leave hamnet thyssens mind he remembered the smell of roasting mans flesh hed been hungry for it till he realized what it was to the folk who lived up on the glacier people from other clans were quite literally fair game he scowled at marcovefa partly joking partly not you did that on purpose to make me imagine things i dont want to think about as long as you dont imagine eating tahpenes while she is still alive marcovefa shrugged not much worry there not a pretty woman no not hamnet said and then you make me sound like a man of the rulers he did think the invaders strong harsh features suited their men better than their women i am sorry marcovefa said i meant to insult you but i did not mean to insult you that much erright count hamnet said his moreorless beloved from atop the glacier could beand usually wasdevastatingly frank to keep any more arrows from flying his way he asked how can we let tahpenes escape without her knowing she isnt doing it all on her own that is a hard question marcovefa answered the rulers are such fools they think everything is over if you are a captive the men dont try to get away because they know their own folk wont want them back maybe it is different for a woman we can hope so yes hamnet nodded otherwise it would be like a dog you couldnt chase away even if you wanted to dogs marcovefa made a face what good are they they help with the herding but is that enough to be worth the food they eat you people down here dont eat them unless you are starving they are nothing but a waste of time there were no dogs up on the glacier there wasnt enough food up there to support them there was barely enough to support people hamnet thyssen wondered what marcovefa thought of pampered lap dogsdogs that didnt even pretend to earn their keepdown in the raumsdalian empire he also wondered what she made of cats but back to dogs people like them hamnet said and they like people knowing somebody or something likes youthats worth a lot to a lot of people maybe if you cant find people to like you though you have to be pretty hard up to care about a stupid dog marcovefa said a lot of people are pretty hard up count hamnet said he didnt add that hed been that way himself sometimes dogs were easier to deal with than people dogs expected so much less from you again he didnt say anything about cats cats didnt particularly like people they just exploited them parasites with purrs he thought dogs are slaves theyre bred to like people they have no choice marcovefa said which was true enough then she surprised hamnet by adding cats now cats are free i liked cats when i saw them in your empire cats do what they want not what you want i would make a good cat count hamnet needed no more than a moment to nod yes he said i think you would not quite artfully enough tahpenes contrived to meet hamnet away from everybody else will you answer some questions she asked maybe he answered it depends on what they are this bizogot folk it truly has shamans who are women she asked youve seen that why do you even need to ask he said but i cant believe its real tahpenes said the rulers say only men can work magic he shrugged what do you expect me to do about that people can say anything they please sometimes its true sometimes its nonsense we are the rulers we do not speak nonsense tahpenes said stiffly he laughed in her face everybody talks nonsense not all the time but sometimes your folk are people like anybody else youre full of nonsense too we are not like anybody else we are the rulers you have seen our might tahpenes was full of herself and full of pride for her folk ive seen that youre a prisoner ive seen that you have found some things here you didnt know about before if you dont want to believe them what does that make you besides a fool i mean she glared at him then she wiped the glare off her face and gave him a smile instead that made him sure what game she was playing i dont want to be a prisoner any more she said softening and sweetening her voice as much as she could your other choice was getting killed probably after some unpleasant preliminaries hamnet reminded her dont you think this is better going back to my own folkthat would be better tahpenes said i would do almost anything for help to get back to my own folk she looked at him from under lowered eyelids she was about as seductive as a dire wolf she would only have got angry if he told her so realizing as much persuaded him not to bother i have a woman im happy with he said and let it go at that one of those yellowhaired sluts she said scornfully they arent muchskinny wheyfaced dont let marcovefa hear you say that shell turn you into a vole hamnet said she is strong tahpenes admitted wizards from the herd are not supposed to be strong how does she get that way by living on top of the glacier with nothing hamnet thought he didnt intend to explain to tahpenes will you help me get away tahpenes persisted all i have to give you is myself i will do that and gladly count hamnet found himself in a strange position he wanted tahpenes to escape but he didnt want her and he hadand had earneda horror of infidelity he also had a suspicion he thought wellfounded that telling a woman he didnt want her was an insult that would have called for seconds had its like passed between two men and so as sternly as he could he said i didnt capture you just to let you get away again she bit her lip i thought you were a kind man you could have killed me the way we look at things you should have killed me taking prisoners when we can is our custom hamnet said a foolish custom tahpenes said count hamnet wondered what she would have thought if she knew marcovefa felt the same way or maybe she did know marcovefa wouldnt hold back about something like that she would use it for a weapon to make a captive afraid and to make her talk foolish or not its what we do hamnet said and im afraid you picked the wrong man well i wasnt going to ask that ulric skakki the woman from the rulers said tartly i could suck him till the inside of my cheeks turned to leather and hed still break every promise he made me if you made one i think you would keep it maybe i would but im not making any hamnet thyssen couldnt resist asking does ulric know what you think of him if he doesnt its not because i havent told him tahpenes answered what did he do he laughed and said you say the sweetest things darling hes a rogue hes proud hes a rogue tahpenes sighed and the honest man is too honest and the bizogots they would screw me and then cut my throat so i couldnt tell any stories about them she shuddered then you might as well get used to being a captive hamnet said it is a disgrace even for a woman it is a disgrace tahpenes said lying down with a man from the herd is as nothing beside it nice to know what you think of me hamnet remarked not just you any of your folk any of these blond bizogots too she replied nothing personal he thought oh good does that make it better or worse he couldnt decide the truth was the only thing she wanted was to get away from here and shed do anything she needed to doanything at allto get what she wanted she eyed him will you tell the others now tell them i want to go back to my own folk do you think i need to do you think they dont already know easier to parry questions with more questions who can guess what folk of the herd know or dont know tahpenes said maybe they think i am docile the way they are hamnet thyssen burst out laughing he couldnt help himself he didnt remember the last time hed been so surprised or heard anything so funny bizogots docile he said tell that to trasamund by god youll leave here all right but you wont be able to tell your people what you found out tahpenes frowned i dont understand what are you talking about hell kill you for the insult thats what hamnet answered and i will tell you how docile trasamund is he beat one of your men a fellow named parsh at bizogot standdown on the other side of the glacier a couple of years ago what kind of stupid sport is that tahpenes asked two men stand facetoface they take turns hitting each other till one of them cant stand up and swing any more he knocked parsh cold when parsh woke upit took a whilehe cut his own throat count hamnet grimaced he didnt like that memory he would the disgrace of losing to someone not of the rulers tahpenes nodded to herself what parsh did made sense to her even if it didnt to hamnet the woman from parshs folk went on in thoughtful tones bizogot standdown you say no that does not seem docile trasamund uses his hands to tell the weather these days he broke both of them punching parsh and they pain him when a storm is coming hamnet said my brother broke his arm when he was a boy he can do that tahpenes said you have a brother hamnet didnt know why he hadnt thought of her as coming from a family maybe because the rulers seemed too perfectly military for such mundane things as families they might have been stamped from molds they might have been but they werent tahpenes nodded i have two brothers and also a sister she said they will wonder what has happened to me plenty of bizogots and raumsdalians wonder whats happened to their kin too hamnet thyssen said tahpenes only gaped at him hed looked for sympathy from herhed looked but he hadnt found it she didnt care the rulers didnt care to them other people werent human beings it was as simple as that count hamnet didnt know what anybody could do about it the only thing that occurred to him was getting rid of all the rulers which sounded easy enough till you set about doing it dejectedly tahpenes turned away from him i will go back to the encampment now she said id better come with you hamnet said just in case you might happen to wander in some other direction instead by accident of course of course she said as demurely as she could she recognized a joke even if a man from the herd made it she limped only a little your wounds are healing well hamnet said well enough tahpenes agreed the worst wound now is in my spirit because i am a captive count hamnet almost told her about the wounds the rulers had given the bizogots and the empire then he decided he might as well save his breath she wouldnt understand what he was talking about as far as she was concerned the folk on this side of the glacier deserved what happened to them because they presumed to stand against the rulers audun gilli took charge of tahpenes when she got back to the almosttown the leaping lynxes had built the raumsdalian wizard spoke much less of the bizogots tongue than he should have tahpenes was probably more fluent but hamnet didnt think she could get away from him unless he let her that is did you have fun with the little charmer we caught ulric asked she isnt little and she isnt charming other than that well no hamnet paused then added she has a low opinion of you only proves shes a keen judge of character ulric said blithely which left hamnet nowhere to go then the adventurer gave him somewhere because he asked and how did she express her distaste hamnet told him ulric skakki threw back his head and laughed yes ive heard that from her shed be right too if my taste in women were bad enough to include her by god thyssen even your taste in women isnt that bad leave my taste in women out of this hamnet growled oh i see ulric favored him with a mocking bow you get to insult me however you choose but i dont have the right to return the disfavor yes thats a fair bargain all the way around you asked me what tahpenes told me about you hamnet said i only repeated it if i want to know what you think about me i promise ill ask till then im not interested you only repeated it ulric skakki did some repeating himself he also did some more laughing you didnt enjoy repeating it or anything oh no not you youre too good and pure and righ teous for that count hamnets ears heated you make a sport of twisting other peoples words dont you why not its the most fun you can have with your clothes on ulric answered but i dont need to do any twisting here dont worry thoughi love you too he gave hamnet a noisy smacking kiss on the cheek hamnet shoved him away youve done that before i didnt like it then and i cursed well still dont i see and you think i did enjoy it when you twitted me you have an odd way of looking at the world sometimes your grace ulric skakki followed up the mocking title with a mocking bow i ought to count hamnet cocked his fist but he didnt swing unfortunate surprising and painful things happened to people who swung at ulric and still more unfortunately surprisingly and painfully the outlander had a point the fist opened i ought to apologize i suppose and so i do your pardon i beg hamnet bowed stiffly ulric stared be careful your grace if you dont watch yourself youll take all the fun out of life v hamnet thyssen had begun to wonder if he would ever see another raumsdalian besides ulric skakki the man who rode into the leaping lynxes village looked hungry and weary and scared almost to death the bizogots gave him a roast duck and a skin of smetyn after which he perked up remarkably he nodded to hamnet youre thyssen i am count hamnet thyssen yes hamnet said ulric snickered off to one side hamnet didnt care in dealing with the empire his dignity was about all he had to fall back on sorry your grace the raumsdalian said i am gunnlaug kvaran a messenger from his majesty sigvat ii i am the fourth man he sent out did any of the others reach you not a one count hamnet replied gunnlaug muttered something his beard muffled hamnet asked the question he was no doubt intended to and how are things in the empire these days they must be pretty bad if sigvat wants to talk to the likes of me gunnlaug kvaran nodded grimly things couldnt be much worse those cursed rulers are demons in human shape they instead of snickering ulric skakki burst into loud raucous laughter gunnlaug sent him a reproachful look you scorn our troubles you must be skakki i not only must be i am ulric answered and i dont scorn your troubles i scorn godcursed sigvat and i scorn count hamnet and me too we tried to tell you what kind of trouble was heading your way and the thanks he got was an inside view of the dungeons under the imperial palace hamnet loves raumsdalia in spite of everything but hamnet owns a castle and hes a sentimental fool besides me i was just glad to get away a sentimental fool hamnet thyssen had thought of himself as a lot of different things but that was a new one gunnlaug said well you were right if it makes you feel any better not much ulric said hamnet noddedhe felt the same way ulric went on if sigvat told us the same thing it still wouldnt make much difference not any more count hamnet broke in ulric looked surprised but now he nodded then what are you people doing up here gunnlaug kvaran asked fighting the rulers by god trasamund boomed what else is there thats even half as much worth doing i dont understand gunnlaug said youre sigvats man all right ulric said he doesnt understand either were fighting them because we want to count hamnet added not because the raumsdalian emperor wants us to ulric shook his head no thats not strong enough were fighting them even though sigvat wants us to true hamnet said which made gunnlaug kvaran looked unhappier yet count hamnet hadnt thought he could trasamund didnt loathe sigvat quite so much as hamnet and ulric didbut then the bizogot jarl hadnt passed any time in the emperors dungeons rough sympathy in his voice he said well you managed to get here kvaran where none of the other poor sorry southern bastards did so tell us whats going on down there nothing good gunnlaug answered we still hold nidaros or we did when i set out anyway but the rulers are plundering just about everything north of there their soldiers fight as if they dont fear death they mostly dont hamnet said they fear losing more death happens losing is a disgrace if you say so sigvats messenger said bleakly i wasnt finished though they have wizards the likes of which weve never seen the likes of ulric snickered again hamnet thyssen forgave gunnlaug his fractured syntax we tried to tell you he said once more well you were right there i said it again does it make you happy his majesty does say the same thing does that make you happy kicking sigvat in his iron arse might make me happyor not so unhappy anyway count hamnet replied youd only give him a concussion of the brain ulric skakki sounded bright and pleasant eager to be useful will you help us can you help us im supposed to take your answer back to nidaros gunnlaug said so you get to run the gauntlet twice god help you hamnet said and i might have known sigvat would want us to help him he doesnt care a farts worth what happens up here its not raumsdalia ulric said why should he you still havent answered my question said the messenger from the empire can you help us will you what word do i take back to his majesty he has the whole empire hamnet thyssen said we have one wizard from raumsdalia a few shamans and some bizogots one of the shamans was marcovefa but he didnt mention that he went on what are we supposed to be able to do that sigvat cant why are we supposed to be able to do it you are supposed to be able to beat the rulers your grace gunnlaug told him i dont know why and his majesty doesnt know why either but for whatever reason you worry them they want you they want you enough to put a fat price on your head alive or not count hamnet had heard that before hed heard it often enough by now that he had to believe itwhich was not to say it made any sense to him even the rulers can be stupid sometimes he growled and so can sigvat god knows ulric skakki added we have our worries and he has his some of them are the samesome yes but not all you want to beat the rulers too dont you gunnlaug kvaran sounded anxious and well he might for he continued you wouldnt go in with them would you trasamund answered that before either hamnet or ulric could no we aim to boot them off the bizogot plain we aim to beat them back beyond the gap we aim to kill them all if we can you can tell your precious sigvat that you can tell him he cursed well should have listened to count hamnet here too in fact youd better tell him thatyou hear me kvaran i hear you your ferocity gunnlaug said without promising he would take the jarls words back to the raumsdalian emperor hamnet wondered how much it would matter even if sigvat still held nidaros could his messenger get through the rulers again what were the odds bad hamnet was sure sigvat has heard me too by god trasamund said if not for me count hamnet and ulric never would have fared north they never would have gone beyond the gap they never would have seen the marvels on the far side we never would have bumped into the rulers either ulric said we have a lot to blame you for trasamund trasamund bared his teeth in what might have been a friendly smile or might have been something else altogether gunnlaug kvaran wore the expression of an outsider at a family squabble hamnet suspected ulric skakki was shading the truth even had sigvat sent other raumsdalians beyond the gap the rulers would still have broken in in that case the noble and the adventurer would have been fighting them down in the empire instead of up here would that have been better worse or just different no way to know gunnlaug kvaran bowed to him and to trasamund i go to take your reply to his majesty he said not right this minute you bloody idiot ulric burst out stay a while rest eat some more let your horse rest too you still have to make it back across the plains before you even try sneaking through to nidaros that was such obvious good sense not even gunnlaug argued against it very hard plainly a duteous man the messenger had to see that duty also involved keeping himself and his horse fit a couple of bizogots carrying fat geese back from the marshes at the edge of sudertorp lake didnt hurt in changing his mind either he was gnawing on a roasted duck leg when he saw tahpenes and recognized her for what she was he almost dropped the leg in his lap whats she doing here he demanded the laundry a little cooking she sweeps the floors of our huts too ulric answered if you want your horse curried i daresay she could attend to that gunnlaug scowled you are not a serious man skakki his majesty warned me about you and i see he was right thank you ulric replied which left the messenger without much of a reply the adventurer often had that effect on people as count hamnet had found to his own discomfiture tahpenes also eyed gunnlaug with a certain amount of surprise what was going through her mind how much did she care that one set of her folks enemies had managed to link up with the other did she wonder if the raumsdalian newcomer was an avenue to escape one thing she didnt seem to realize was that her captors wanted her to get away they couldnt make that obvious without making her wonder why one day soon though she probably would contrive to escape count hamnet hoped so anyhow then everyone here could relax hamnet spoke to trasamund about that the jarl heard him out then grinned and laid a finger by the side of his nose it might work he said has a halfway decent chance anyhow which is more than i can say for some other notions that have come up they feted gunnlaug kvaran they gave him a fresh horse hamnet and ulric and trasamund and even audun gilli gave him encouraging messages to take back to sigvat ii why not count hamnet thought cynically talk is cheap gunnlaug proved less eager to leave after tasting bizogot hospitality hamnet thyssen didnt know if one of the big blond women with the band took him into a hut and gave him something to remember her by but he wouldnt have been surprised the mammothherders were an earthy folk and tookand gavetheir pleasures as they saw the chance almost all of them turned out to say farewell to gunnlaug when he finally did ride off to the south once more men clasped his hand and clapped him on the back women hugged him and kissed him and wished him well a little wistfully ulric skakki said the only times i ever got fancy sendoffs were when lots of nasty people were chasing me gunnlaug doesnt know how lucky he is hes getting a fancy sendoff for a reason too hamnet replied if were all here telling him what a fine fellow he is yes i know ulric broke in if were all making much of kvaran weve got an excuse for not paying attention to tahpenes now we see if shes smart enough to figure that out too gunnlaug kvaran rode away some of the bizogots trotted after him for as far as half a mile as far as count hamnet was concerned if they wanted to work that hard it was up to them he just watched the raumsdalian messenger get smaller and smaller in the distance when he went to look for tahpenes after the farewells she was nowhere to be found he went and told trasamund the jarl told the bizogots the mammothherders made a great show of beating the bushes for their escaped captive everyone was so disappointed when they didnt catch her may i talk to you your grace audun gilli asked youre doing it count hamnet answered gruffly go ahead erright the wizard was hangdog and slapdash at the best of times since liv had gone to him from hamnet thyssen this wasnt the best of times but he forged ahead i dont want you to be my enemy im not hamnet said which was partly true anyhow he went on if you expect me to be your friend you ask for too much though i suppose so audun said but i would like to be able to put my head together with yours without worry about its getting bitten off would you hamnet thyssen said audun gilli gave back an eager nod hamnet shrugged people want all kinds of things they arent likely to get do you uh still want liv back the raumsdalian wizard asked that question was more interesting than hamnet wished it were he was contented enough with marcovefa she had her quirks but she was bound to think he had quirks of his own and even if he was contented with her that didnt mean he didnt want liv back it didnt mean he didnt want gudrid back either and she was hundreds of miles away married to eyvind torfinn and despised him to boot losing a woman meant something was wrong with you so it seemed to count hamnet at any rate he knew his answer was evasive if she doesnt want me backand she doesntwhat difference does it make it makes a difference audun spoke with doleful conviction i didnt expect this to happen you know im willing to believe you count hamnet wished hed turned his back and walked away when the wizard started talking to him then the hilt of his sword and the hilt of the dagger next to it on his belt started chattering to each other he says he believes us the dagger hilts voice was a high squeaky version of audun gillis he says all kinds of things what do i care the sword hilt sounded a little like the way hamnet had before his voice broke he didnt think he was losing his mind audun gilli had a gift for endowing inanimate objects with sarcastic personalities it was a small magic but one that sometimes had its uses well if he says he believes us why doesnt he sound like he believes us the dagger hilt asked peevishly if hamnet looked down he suspected he would see his face on the sword hilt auduns on the dagger he didnt look down the shrill voice that sounded like his said hes not that good a liar i guess hamnet thyssen snorted he tried to hold it in but he couldnt then he tried not to laugh out loud and found he couldnt do that either tell my cutlery to shut up will you please he said to audun gilli he wants us to shut up the voice that sounded like auduns sounded properly indignant hes got his nerve he does said the voice that sounded like hamnet himself if he thinks im going to shut up hes it cut off right audun gilli finished for it you have an interesting way of making your points sometimes count hamnet said the wizards narrow shoulders went up and down in a shrug people who wouldnt pay attention to me on a bet start listening when their tools do the talking im not your enemy your grace i dont want to be your enemy we already have the same enemy all this other business was getting in the way of that after a considerable pause hamnet said you shame me i dont want to do that either audun answered you dont have to love meyoure not going to love me and who could blame you but for gods sake will you stop treating me like im not there hamnet hit him not quite hard enough to knock him down what was that for the wizard squawked well you cant say i was treating you like you werent there hamnet answered stolidly no i cantand i bloody well wish i could audun said hrmp now count hamnet seemed affronted first you want it one way then you want it the other i wanted you to talk to me not punch me what should i say to you after you took my woman away a lot of people talk with their fists after something like that audun gilli sighed your grace i didnt take liv away from you nobody can do anything like that with her if you dont know im telling the truth you never knew her at all she decided she didnt want to stay with you after thathe kicked at the dirtshe took me not the other way round he hadnt tried not to get takenhamnet thyssen was sure of that what man in his right mind would try not to get taken if a woman like liv decided she wanted him the wizard wasnt wrong the wizard was much too poignantly right you arent talking again audun pointed out afraid not count hamnet agreed trying to count all the different ways im a jackass there are a lot of them welcome to humanity your grace audun said i often wonder why god bothered with us in the first place maybe well know if we ever find the golden shrine hamnet looked out across sudertorp lake as if he expected the legendary temple to rise from its waters whether he expected it or not he didnt get it you dont ask for much do you the wizard exclaimed we went to the ends of the earthby god we went past the ends of the earthand we never saw a trace or heard a rumor the rulers dont seem to know anything about it maybe that means its on this side of the glacier after all count hamnet shrugged or maybe it means the shrine was never anything but a pipe dream i dont know i dont think anyone else does eitherif i had to guess id say nobody ever will if i had to guess id say you were right audun replied well find outor more likely we wont hamnet thyssen nodded i imagine men a thousand years from now will still go chasing the golden shrine by then this will all be forest and only fragments will be left of the glacier he glanced over to audun gilli there im talking to you by god are you happier yes your grace are you mmmaybe yes i suppose i am hamnet gnawed at the inside of his lower lip if you like you can tell liv im sorry you can do that yourself too audun said id rather you did i might say some other things besides and chances are that wouldnt help besides something like that it wont matter if it comes from me or from you not now it wont no not now audun said earlier well no wizards ever found a spell to let you fix now what you made a hash of back then probably just as well things would get knotted up worse than a muskoxwool cape knitted by somebody who never learned to knit cant quarrel with you there and people would make mistakes fixing mistakes what a mess hamnet said life is complicated enough too complicated sometimes audun gilli said cant quarrel with you there either count hamnet turned away he supposed he could deal with the raumsdalian wizard he even thought he might be able to talk to liv again one of these days though he didnt want to do it any time soon showing enthusiasm for either prospect was more than he had in him you know what you look like ulric skakki asked as he and hamnet rode across the steppe with a band of bizogots out searching for the rulers no what hamnet asked as he was surely meant to do you look like somebody who wants to kill something oh count hamnet looked around his eye carefully didnt light on audun gilli who was along to help if the rulers they ran into had a wizard along is that all isnt that enough ulric didnt look auduns way either maybe he was too politeanything was possibleor maybe he really didnt know what was making hamnets stomach hurt either way he went on if you go out there looking to slaughter the first thing you see sometimes you dont worry about staying alive while youre bashing and smashing dont worry about me hamnet said ill be fine right ulric plainly didnt believe him since hamnet knew he was lying he didnt try to insist one of the bizogots pointed east look at the teratorns circling over there lots of themsomething big is dead he said maybe we should find out what no one said no if something big was dead or if more smaller somethings were very likely it or they had got killed and if things had got killed there was a good chance the rulers had killed them hamnet thyssen steered his horse with knees and reins he did watch audun gilli as they all rode toward the carrion birds the wizard seemed rather birdlike himself the way he flapped his arms every time the horse strode audun would never make a picture rider any equestrian trainer down at nidaros would have screamed his head off at such bad form but nobody on the frozen steppe cared about style audun got the job done and that was all that mattered they took longer to get to the teratorns feast than count hamnet had thought they would teratorns were so bigbig enough to dwarf even condors let along lesser vulturesthat they tricked the eye into thinking they flew closer than they really did when they did see why the teratorns were spiraling down out of the sky they discovered it had nothingnothing obvious at leastto do with the rulers a mammoth had fallen over and died teratorns and smaller scavengers stalked around that mountain of meat even on the ground the teratorns stood out and not only for their size their bareskinned heads were wattled and hideously gaudy they let out loud indignant croaks now because they couldnt get at the food they craved lions and dire wolves were stuffing themselves with mammoth meat whenever a teratorn tried to rush up and steal some the beasts that could also kill snarled threats the great birds retreated every so often one of them would leap into the air foxes prowled around the dead mammoth too they also wanted their share of the scrapsor a vulture would do if they couldnt get anything else well this was a waste of time hamnet thyssen said how right you are ulric agreed readily we could have written epic poetry or gone to a fine eatery or played a couple of games of draughts while we rode across the steppe if it werent for those miserable teratorns hamnets ears heated you know what i mean we didnt accomplish anything coming here right again ulric skakki sounded more enthusiastic than ever always a bad sign if not for this dead mammoth we couldve chased the rulers back beyond the gap by now youre making yourself annoying on purpose hamnet said thats better than doing it by accident wouldnt you say the adventurer returned at least i know what im up to audun gilli pointed north across the frozen steppe someone else is heading this way maybe we werent the only ones to wonder what was dead here and how it got that way this way that way any way at all ulric skakki said when somebody writes the history of this war nobody will ever write he can call this fight the battle of the dead mammoth somebody writes the history nobody will count hamnet gave it up as a bad job he looked to his weapons instead with them he had a better notion of what he was doing have they got a wizard with them trasamund asked audun reaching over his shoulder to draw his twohanded sword that hamnet realized was an important questionmaybe the important question if the rulers had no wizard along then audun gilli gave the bizogots the edge but if the rulers did if they did audun was liable to be in over his head marcovefa might scoff at the sorcery the men from beyond the gap used but it was stronger than bizogot shamans or raumsdalian wizards could match count hamnet imagined himself riding back to the leaping lynxes huts and telling liv audun had died valiantly fighting the rulers he wouldnt sound as if he was gloating hed give audun all the credit he deserved and more besides and liv would dissolve in tears and he would hold her and try to console her he laughed sourly realizing what an idiot he was for one thing liv would be furious if audun died while he survived for another if the rulers slew audun they were much too likely to slay him too well we found them ulric skakki said methodically examining his arrows not quite the way we expect to but we found them and now we get to see how sorry we end up that we did i thank you hamnet bowed in the saddle whenever i think things are bad you always remind me theyre really worse courteous as a cat ulric returned the bow nice to know im of some use to you anyhow your grace lets ride trasamund bellowed hamnet thyssen wasnt sorry to follow him he wasnt just riding away from the dead mammoth and the scavengers clustered around it he was riding away from his own imagination and getting away from it might be the best thing he could do the rulers might have been drawn by the teratorns gliding down to try to steal mammoth flesh but they didnt need long to realize they werent the only ones who had been they shook themselves out into a battle line some of them were on their riding deer others on horses they must have seized since coming into the bizogot country they didnt have any live war mammoths with them that by itself raised hamnets spirits and probably those of everyone else in the war band audun gilli gasped theyhave a wizard he choked out hold him off hamnet said urgently well see if we can kill him he glanced over to ulric who nodded theyd done this before or tried to killing enemy wizards was the best way to make sure they couldnt use their spells against you the best way if you could do it that is surveying the rulers line he had no trouble picking out the wizard as usual he was the one who hung back behind his comrades maybe that was cowardice it was bound to be good sense killing the wizard hurt the enemy much more than killing one of their warriors would have as archers on both sides started to shoot ulric asked are you game not especially but i dont think weve got much choice do you hamnet said no i only wish i did well the adventurer spurred his horse forward at a gallop spurting out ahead of the bizogots line hamnet thyssen went with him as his horse thundered toward the rulers he tried not to think about what a tempting target he made three tusks the three tusk clan trasamund roared and he joined the charge too hamnet had no idea whether the jarl intended to go after the wizard too or whether he just wanted to close with the hated rulers as fast as he could wherever the truth lay trasamund distracted the foe from hamnet and ulric trasamund could distract anybody from anything count hamnet had thought the bizogot was larger than life ever since he first met him two years earlier in sigvats palace down in nidaros two years was that all hamnet thyssen had to think about it but he nodded a moment later it seemed much longer an arrow thrummed past his head a moment later so did another one even closer he stopped worrying about how long it had been since he met trasamund worrying about how long hed keep breathing was more urgent a ruler on horse back swung to try to block his path hamnet cut at the swarthy curlybearded man their swords belled off each other sparks flew as iron grated against iron then count hamnet was past his foe looked comically surprised the ruler must have thought hamnet was after him in particular well fellow youre not as important as you think you are hamnet thought that probably hurts worse than a sword cut would have there was the wizard astride a riding deerno newfangled mounts for him for the moment he seemed to have no idea hamnet was closing in on him his attention was aimed at the bizogots line and likely at audun gilli then ulric skakki shot an arrow into the riding deers flank no doubt hed aimed for the wizard but archery from horse back was a tricky business the riding deer didnt shriek the way a wounded horse might have but it did jerk and jump and buck like a wounded horse and the wizard whod expected no such thing went off the deer and onto the dirt with a thump the deer bounded away the wizard scrambled to his feetwhich might have been a mistake because it made him an easier target for hamnet thyssens sword the sharp edge glittered in the sun as hamnet swung the blade it bit into the wizards neck with a noise straight from a butchers shop the impact almost tore the sword from his hand blood sprayed then fountained the wizard let out a bubbling scream hamnet urged his horse into as tight a turn as it could make in case he needed to strike again he saw at once that he didnt he had no idea how the wizard stayed on his feet with blood gushing from him that way stand the wizard did the rulers say what you would of them seemed as hard to kill as serpents the mans eyes speared hamnet his lips shaped a word hamnet had learned only tiny fragments of the rulers language but he thought he knew what that word was you to his horror and dismay the wizards hands came up he started to shape a pass then ulric skakki galloped past and struck with the sword from behind the wizards head leaped from his shoulders body convulsing he toppled and finally died tough bugger ulric remarked i thought the one you landed would be plenty to do for him so did i count hamnet answered well hes gone now he looked like he was still trying to cast a spell on you even with his head already half gone ulric said he did didnt he hamnet said uneasily you hed heard that and things like it too often from the rulers for some reason they worried about him he wished he knew why there were plenty of days when he felt more dangerous to himself than to the invaders from beyond the gap must be nice to have them love you like that ulric said i could live without it count hamnets voice was dry the adventurer chuckled probably quite a bit longer than with it which reminds mehow long are we going to live if the bastards turn on us not long was the first thing that occurred to hamnet but the rulers had no chance to do it they were fighting for their lives outnumbered by the hardpressing bizogots and suddenly without sorcerous support and audun gilli took advantage of that the rulers suddenly started staring at their swords and bows the weapons must have started talking to themthe same spell audun had used again and again but never before so far as hamnet knew on the battlefield audun didnt speak the rulers language he still had trouble with the bizogots tongue but a sword that suddenly started spouting raumsdalian might have proved even more alarming for all the rulers knew their blades were cursing them if audun gilli had any sensenever a sure betthe swords were doing exactly that hamnet looked for trasamund the jarl of the three tusk clan was trading lusty sword strokes with an enemy warrior trasamund fought for the fun of it as a lot of bizogots did a taste that had always struck hamnet as perverse he roared in triumph when one of his great strokes got home maybe the rulers boiledleather corselet kept the edge from his vitals whether it did or not though that blow had to break ribs the invader reeled on his riding deer trasamunds next hack undefended sheared away half his face maybe that broke the rulers maybe they would have decided theyd had enough about then anyhow they broke off the fight and fled back toward the north the riding deer had shorter legs than horses but still fled fast enough to let a good many rulers on them get away we beat em by god trasamund boomed so we did hamnet agreed yes so we did the battle of the dead mammothhuzzah ulric skakki said and if we win another hundred victories just this big they may start to notice us scoffer trasamund said ulric graciously inclined his head at your service your ferocity hamnet thyssen wondered if trasamund would explode but he didnt not after a winning fight he threw back his head and laughed instead vi after the bizogots returned in triumph to the leaping lynxes village hamnet thyssen took trasamund aside and said this cant go on much longer what why not by god the jarl had a skin of smetyn clenched in his big fist instead of a sword hilt but he hadnt started drinking yet well drive the stinking buggers mad thats why hamnet answered they wont let us get away with it much longer either theyll bring more men down from beyond the gap if theyve got em trasamund broke in if they have them count hamnet agreed no one on this side of the glacier knew how many rulers there were or how wide a territory they ruled too cursed many and too wide were the only sure answers but hamnet went on if they dont theyll bring their army up from the empire to deal with usor a good piece of it anyhow and dont you think a good piece of that army could do the job trasamund scowled not if marcovefas magic puts the flyblown fornicators to rout the way its supposed to theres only one of her hamnet reminded him i hope she can deal with their wizards i dont know if she can deal with all of them but i hope so if you think she can deal with the wizards and the warriors you may be asking too much then we deal with them trasamund thumped his own chest we the bizogots the herofolk he broke into rolling verse hamnet thyssen wanted to bash him in the head with a rock and let in some sense unfortunately he didnt see any suitable bashers close by stop that he said when trasamund showed no sign of letting up we dont have that many bizogots herenot enough to beat a real army instead of answering trasamund pulled the stopper from the skin raised it to his mouth and drank a long draught ahh he said smacking his lips when he finally came up for air i needed that why wont you worry about whats going to happen curse it count hamnet demanded i cant make more bizogots trasamund said reasonably well i can but no matter how willing the women are the brats need twenty years before theyre worth anything in a brawl and we dont have that long hamnet snorted ignoring him the jarl of the three tusk clan went on so why are you nattering at me to fix something i cant do anything about they are going to hit us hamnet clung to the rags of his temper by main force what will you dowhat will we dowhen that happens run away where will we go how will we keep the rulers off us once we get there you have more frets than a mammoth has fleas trasamund said and took another swig from the smetyn skin whatever comes will come and god will see to it that it all turns out all right the way he has so far hamnet inquired acid in his voice go away bother me later trasamund drank deep again i want to get drunk i want to screw my brains out what brains hamnet asked more sardonically still go howl the bizogot told him ill worry about your worries but when i feel like worrying about them not now when you were too late coming back to your clan from raumsdalia that was just one of those things that happen it wasnt your fault hamnet thyssen said but if youre too late getting ready for trouble any fool can see coming whos left to blame but you he thought the only way to get trasamund to listen to him was to be brutal he turned out to be righter than hed guessed the jarl dropped the precious skin of smetyn and charged him bellowing like a bull woolly mammoth hamnet was a big man trasamund bigger still they grappled cursing and punching count hamnet managed not to get thrown under trasamund but pulled the bizogot down beside him onto the ground hamnet did his best to knee trasamund in the groin but the jarl twisted and took the blow on the hip well this is sweet ulric skakkis light ironic tones didnt prove enough to get hamnet and trasamund to stop pounding on each other then a bowstring thrummed an arrow stood thrilling in the ground only a few inches from the fighters faces enough ulrics voice got sharper if i shoot again my aim may not be so goodor so bad depending on how you look at things he reached over his shoulder for another shaft cautiously hamnet pushed trasamund away from him the bizogot let him do it neither was sure ulric wouldnt shoot them to make them stop fighting such drastic measures were very much his style hamnet tasted blood when he spat he spat red but no teeth seemed broken hed blacked one of trasamunds eyes dishonors between them seemed even that dismayed him he thought he should have thrashed the bizogot and what were you gentlemen discussing when you decided words werent exciting enough to suit you ulric kept an arrow nocked his words were more piercing though what to do next trasamund answered gingerly rubbing at the eye that had met count hamnets fist lucky it wasnt my thumb the raumsdalian thought our hero here doesnt want to do anything much hamnet said just sit around and wait for the rulers to jump on us probably better schemes than that ulric skakki could also sound judicious when he felt like it if i want to know what you think skakki ill ask you trasamund growled well i dont think we want to wait that long the adventurer said we might have things to do in the meantime you raumsdalians can joke and eat fat goose and screw your women and take it easy trasamund said you already know no true bizogots will take you seriously if i say something though youd better believe theyll hop to it he thumped his chest with his fist and struck a pose hamnet thyssen didnt strike him but he came close then why the demon dont you say something to them he snapped if you let things drift the rulers will call the tune instead must be what he has in mind ulric said helpfully after were dead the lions and teratorns can make the plans bah trasamund stuck his nose in the air and lumbered off after spitting againstill redhamnet sighed and said he reminds me of a bull musk ox in mating season all he wants to do is bang heads and screw ulric said dont forget screwing there had been times when hamnet wished he could but that wasnt what worried him now what are we going to do about it nothing much we can do that wont make things worse ulric replied if dear trasamund comes down with a sudden case of loss of life who takes over for him wont be us hes right about thatthe bizogots wont follow us and the rest of the men are worse muttonheadsmuskox heads if youd ratherthan he is were stuck with him im afraid count hamnet said mournfully and im afraid because were stuck with him too a raven fluttered down out of the sky and landed on marcovefas left shoulder she reached out and scratched its head as if it were a cat it brought its formidable beak alarmingly close to her eye before it croaked something in her ear she croaked back they might have been conversing for all hamnet thyssen knew they were several bizogots stared at the spectacle of woman communing with bird hamnet didnt but only because hed seen it before up on the glacier and during the harrowing descent to the bizogot steppe at last one of the mammothherders worked up the nerve to ask is that your fetish animal wise woman not the way you mean it marcovefa caressed the raven some more it croaked again with obvious pleasure she went on but it still tells me things like what hamnet asked where the carrion is i dont have to watch teratorns and where the carrion is most of the time the rulers are too ah the raumsdalian noble nodded that is worth knowing yes but why hasnt one come to you for a while she shrugged ravens do what they want not what you want if they were only a little worse they would make fair people a little worse how hamnet wondered then he wondered if he wanted to know he ended up not asking what he did ask was where is the carrion these days where are the rulers marcovefa croaked at the raven the big black bird with the shaggy feathers answered it swung its head to look northwest then it swung it again to look almost due south toward the raumsdalian empire you see marcovefa said well so i do hamnet agreed but have the rulers come out of the woods then have the left the empire if they had he thought they were stupid they would have a much easier time feeding themselves inside the empire than up here he wondered if they realized the territory they roamed on the far side of the glacier was more like the bizogot steppe than the empire marcovefa and the raven croaked back and forth some more but all hamnet got from her was another shrug the bird doesnt know she reported why should it care about people who arent dead theyll make us dead if they get the chance the raumsdalian noble said but i dont suppose the raven cares about us while were alive either well maybe about youa little anyhow a little marcovefa agreed it thinks im interesting because we understand each other some if we didnt it would only want to peck out my eyeballs after im gone you say the most cheerful things hamnet thyssen told her the bizogots were more fatalistic than most raumsdalians and marcovefa was more fatalistic than most bizogots part of that might have been her own character part was surely growing to womanhood atop the glacier just as the bizogots had a harsher life than denizens of the empire so marcovefas clan lived in a way that would horrifyhad horrifiedany bizogots who saw it do i tell lies marcovefa asked not here hamnet said she grinned unoffended he went on do you know any way to make ravens interested in live people if we had flying eyes that would help us a lot he told her about the rulers wizard whod turned himself into an owl to spy on the bizogots and raumsdalians a raven is a smart bird but only a bird marcovefa said why should it care plainly she didnt think hamnet would have an answer for her but he did if we can find the rulers we can fight them if we fight them the ravens will get plenty of fresh food maybe including us he thought hed run that risk whenever he went into battle sometimes though it seemed bigger than others marcovefa grinned again this time in delight she blew him a kiss yes that may work if the bird can see so far ahead have to find out she started croaking at the raven it made strange throaty noises back at her she croaked again and again the raven tilted its head to one side if it wasnt thinking things over count hamnet had never seen anything man or beast that was what went on behind those bright jet eyes how much could a bird anticipate hamnet was no bird so he didnt know from everything hed seen ravens were more clever than most other flying feathered creatures but could this one understand the promise of more meat down the line if it did something rather than something else it said something to marcovefa ravens could learn to speak human words but this one wasnt doing that it had its own way of getting ideas across one only vaguely connected to human language had marcovefa needed magic to learn it or had study sufficed he couldnt ask her now whatever she was using she needed to concentrate hard to get meaning from the sounds the raven was making when it finally finished she said it will try maybe it will forget maybe the other ravens wont understand what it needs but it will try as much as we can expect i suppose hamnet expected nothing from the raven that way he couldnt possibly be disappointed anything he did hear from the bird or its fellows would come as a pleasant surprise he looked at life the same way the view had advantages and disadvantages as everything did when things went wrong he had little trouble accepting itmost of the timebecause hed looked for nothing better where he did look for something better as with gudrid and liv disillusionment proved doubly bitter when things went well he tried not to show the surprise too much this is right on the edge of what a raven can do marcovefa said maybe over the edge the bird here is smart even for a raven i dont know if all of them can do what it can she croaked some more at the big black bird count hamnet knew nothing of the language of ravens and knew he never would if he had to guess from tone though he would have said she was telling this one how bright it was it preenedliterally did that mean it understood the praise and accepted it you would have to be a ravenor marcovefato know the bird sprang into the air wind whistled out between its wing feathers as it flapped it wasnt an arrow with a beak the way a falcon was but it could outsoar and outmaneuver a falcon ravens harried hawks for the sport of it then tumbled out of the way in the air to keep the birds of prey from turning on them ravens harried hawks jays harried ravens mockingbirds harried jays kingbirds harried mockingbirds hummingbirds harried kingbirds and dragonflies probably harried hummingbirds hamnet thyssen looked for a lesson there but couldnt find one he liked everything large and fearsome had something small and feisty that annoyed it no not much of a lesson which didnt mean it wasnt true on land as well as in the air right now the bizogots seemed small and feisty the rulers large and fearsome that was how things looked if you were a bizogot or a raumsdalian up here beyond the tree line anyhow the rulers probably had a different view of it the only view of the rulers hamnet wanted was one of their backs as they rode off beyond the gap once more he wondered if he would ever get a view like that he feared he wouldnt even if the bizogots and the empire somehow beat the invaders the rulers would be part of the political landscape from now on the gap would be open from now on too more rulersor even other invaderscould sweep down out of the north the world had got bigger and more complicated when he said as much to marcovefa she gave him a wry smile this happened to me when i came down off the glacier she said everything new everything strange everything she threw her arms wide to show how much her world had expanded youve done well hamnet told her she shrugged people are still people thats the biggest thing the world is strange the animals are strange but people no people are always strange count hamnet said especially women he added but only to himself marcovefa smiled again and nodded but theyre strange the same way here as they are in my clan up on the nunatak on the what hamnet said nunatak marcovefa repeated thats our word for a mountaintop that sticks out above the glacier oh hamnet thyssen had probably heard the term while he was atop the glacier himself and while he was on that mountaintopthat nunatak if he had though it had gone clean out of his mind he wasnt surprised he hadnt been at his best up there none of the bizogots or raumsdalians had he thought for a moment longer it doesnt sound like a bizogot word at all maybe it isnt our songs say other folk were up there when our forefathers came marcovefa answered what happened to them hamnet asked we ate them she answered calmly he didnt splutter and make disgusted noises because she so obviously wanted him to do just that all he said was seems as though you ate some of their words too it could be marcovefas expression was comically disappointed yes shed aimed to get more of a rise out of him one corner of his own mouth quirked upward people didnt get everything they wantednot even a powerful shaman like marcovefa nobody got everything maybe that meant the rulers wouldnt or maybe it meant the bizogots and the empire wouldnt who from each side got how much would tell the tale till the glacier melted and maybe even after that tall dark anviltopped clouds floated ponderously across the sky the air was hot and muggy still and sullen wiping his forehead with the back of his wrist ulric skakki said whew this is the kind of weather youd expect a thousand miles south of here yes and youd complain about it down there too hamnet thyssen had taken off his tunic his hands and face were tanned dark but his arms and torso were pale as a bizogots though the mat of hair on his chest was dark not golden right now his skin was slick with sweat ulric gave the clouds a dirty look if were going to have a thunderstorm i wish wed have it it would wash the air clean of this garbage he shed his tunic too that would be good hamnet agreed but the thunderheads rolled by one after another count hamnet did hear thunder once far off in the distance no rain fell anywhere nearby the air remained close and stuffy marcovefa walked by with her tunic off hamnets jaw dropped ulrics eyes widened unless they were bathing bizogot women didnt go barebreasted in public neither did raumsdalians what are you doing hamnet managed after a couple of false starts trying to stay cool same as you marcovefa mimed a panting fox i never knew weather like this up on the glacier i feel like i am wading in hot soup dont sunburn your uh self ulric said gallantly not looking at what he was really talking about i be careful marcovefa said and walked on anyone who wanted to tell her to cover up would need to be a braver man than either raumsdalian after she was gone hamnet and ulric eyed each other they both shrugged at the same time look on the bright side ulric said maybe shell start a new trend right hamnet said tightly he wondered what he would have done had gudrid or liv acted so scandalously odds were he would have pitched a fit and maybe had a stroke he wondered why he wasnt pitching a fit now partly because marcovefa was a law unto herself no doubt and perhaps partly because hed already pitched enoughor too manyfits about women have i learned something he wondered or am i just too bloody tired to get upset about things right now ulric skakki looked around not in marcovefas direction the adventurers nostrils flared as if he were a dire wolf seeking a scent the air is nasty he said hot and muggy enough and then some thats for sure count hamnet agreed but ulric shook his head not what i meant its bad that way too but i dont like the way it feels do you have any notion of what im talking about no hamnet was nothing if not direct didnt think so ulric gave him a bow that should have been mocking but somehow wasnt it feels like something horrible is going to happen to us any minute hamnet thyssen raised an eyebrow foretelling i didnt know youd gone into the wizard business have you talked with audun gilli or liv about this he didnt think he wanted ulric talking with marcovefa not while she was running around without her tunic the adventurers chuckle said he knew what was going through hamnets mind but his mirth quickly faded i will talk with them by god i dont know if theyll tell me im daft if they dont i dont know whether they can do anything about it better to find out though lithe as a tumbler he got to his feet with a grunt and a creak count hamnet rose too and followed him hamnet also tried to feel the air to him it felt like air hot sticky air but air and nothing else but he thought ulric was letting his imagination run wild that wasnt like the adventurer but neither was his turning wizard audun gilli sat in the shade of the hut he shared with liv he hadnt shed his tunic but looked suddenly thoughtful as ulric and hamnet came up to him maybe he would before long whats up audun asked the look he gave hamnet was slightly apprehensive he might have cleared the air but he knew hamnet would never love him but ulric did the talking finishing have i just got the fidgets on account of this beastly weather or am i feeling something real well i havent sensed anything like that audun gilli answered count hamnet started to give ulric an itoldyouso look but the wizard went on which doesnt have to prove anything have you talked to marcovefa yet id bet shes more sensitive than i am i thought id wait till she puts on more clothes ulric said blandly she might not be distracted but i would be shes not wearing any less than the two of you audun pointed outhed seen her too then hed seen quite a bit of her in fact thats what she told us ulric skakki said it looks better on her though and i know better than to argue with a shaman i do his saucy grin dared hamnet to make something of that hamnet ignored him with a small sigh ulric went on if you say i ought to talk to her i guess ill go do it this time he wasnt grinning when he spoke to hamnet youre welcome to tag along again your grace im not going to talk about anything i dont want you to hear not while im there youre not hamnet thought all he said was i want to get to the bottom of this too the leaping lynxes village wasnt very big finding marcovefa didnt take long she raised an eyebrow when ulric and hamnet came up to her are you two going to try to tell me what to do again she asked an ominous note in her voice hamnet shook his head no this is something else he gestured to ulric skakki ulric told the story one more time he looked marcovefa in the eye while he was doing it if his gaze slipped farther south it wasnt in any obvious way so he said have i got the vapors or is this something we need to worry about marcovefa looked as thoughtful as if she were fully clothed i dont know she said i dont feel this but i havent looked for it either maybe you should hamnet said yes she nodded which made her jiggle hamnet couldnt pretend not to notice but he didnt dwell on it either there was a time and a place for everything ulrics face might have been carved from stone marcovefa swung around in a circle as if she too were casting about for a scent when she came to the northwest she stopped looking startled something hamnet and ulric asked together something she agreed something not good something very not good her grammar was shaky but hamnet understood what she meant what are those bastards trying to do to us he growled suddenly even the damp heat of the day seemed suspicious and unnatural maybe he was starting at shadowsbut maybe he wasnt with the rulers he couldnt be sure before marcovefa could answer a bizogot woman named faileuba came up to the shaman from atop the ice and said i dont feel good she didnt sound good her voice was a sickly whine she didnt look good either her face had a hectic flush and she swayed on her feet marcovefa set the palm of her hand on faileubas forehead then jerked it away again fever she said very much fever a big blond man called eberulf lurched toward marcovefa too somethings wrong with me he muttered before marcovefa could touch him he keeled over he looked the way faileuba did only worse disease hamnet thyssen said or sending sending ulric answered without the least hesitation has to be everything fits together too well and do you remember the rock ptarmigans yes hamnet wished he didnt the rulers had destroyed the whole western clan with a sorcerous pestilence the year before what their dead encampment looked like when trasamunds band found it was the stuff of nightmares marcovefa said yes too she nodded to count hamnet go get liv and audun i dont care if theyre screwinggo get them i need their help this is as very bad a magic as i have seen from the rulers right hamnet muttered he didnt know why marcovefa had picked him to run her errandto rub salt in his wounds but whatever he felt would have to wait unless he wanted to start feeling the way faileuba and eberulf did he hurried back to the hut his former lover and the raumsdalian wizard shared they were both outside it now looking worried as they tried to tend to a couple of sick bizogots i dont care what marcovefa wantswe cant come right now liv sounded harried i dont know what these poor people have whatever it is its nasty its worse than nasty its sorcery from the rulers hamnet said ulric thinks its the same sorcery that wiped out the rock ptarmigans so does marcovefa she says she needs your help good god audun gilli exclaimed was he shocked by remembering what had happened to the rock ptarmigans or by the idea that marcovefa might need anybodys help count hamnet wasnt sure which was more startling either well liv seemed to think that was a complete sentence she nodded to audun what are you waiting for nothing he answered the bizogots they were trying to treat protested feebly audun spoke to hamnet in raumsdalian which they were unlikely to understand best thing we can do for these poor buggers is block that sorcery if were able to marcovefa needs help god so that was what was on his mind hamnet thyssen couldnt pretend he was surprised several bizogots called out to liv and audun as they hurried along the pangs seemed to be hitting more mammothherders seeing people around him suffering count hamnet examined himself for symptoms how could you help doing something like that he felt fine a heartbeat later he felt guilty for feeling fine liv blinked when she saw marcovefa hamnet had forgotten she wore no tunicand if that didnt prove the rulers magic had him worried what the demon would ulric skakki was still on his feet and seemed fine maybe the rulers were aiming at bizogots alone maybe it was nothing but coincidence what do you need from us liv asked marcovefa do you know the yellow stone called lynxpiss marcovefa answered yes liv said at the same time as audun answered it isnt really lynx piss you know its a stone like any other marcovefas nostrils flared i asked of it by its name not by its nature use that lynxpiss stone against the fever and if you have a lodestone it will also help ward against perils of death quick nowno time to waste what will you be doing liv asked i will punish those who send this wicked shamanry marcovefa replied then for one of the rare times since hamnet had known her she hesitated if i can she added here for once the rulers are almost as strong as they think they are this is shamanry different from anything i ever saw up above the glacier liv and audun started arguing about where they might have stowed the lynxpiss stone audun dashed off he returned in triumph with a transparent yellow crystal liv kissed him hamnet thyssen did a slow burn didnt she have more selfrespect than that his own current lover stood there barebreasted but that was different hamnet might not have thought so till liv kissed audun but he did from then on a lodestone liv said does anyone have a lodestone i have a little one ulric skakki said here he pulled a small rustylooking stone from a pouch on his belt and tossed it to liv the shaman deftly caught it why have you got a lodestone hamnet asked ulric only shrugged well theyre fun to play with and theyre interesting and you never can tell when something will come in handy its like a holdout knife you know you can go for years and years without ever needing a holdout knife but when you need one youll need it bad liv and audun were using the lodestone and the yellow crystalwhat was it really tourmalineon a sick bizogot the rock ptarmigans shamans must have tried something like that when their people fell ill much good it had done them count hamnet wished that last handful of words hadnt crossed his mind but he couldnt pay attention to liv and audun or even to his own worries for long because marcovefa said hamneti need your help he started whatever i can give you he said your strength come stand by me set your hand on my bare skin marcovefa suddenly laughed there well if you want it will do i can draw from you i try not to take too much what happens if you do hamnet wondered maybe he didnt want to know maybe if she took too much he would just quietly fall over dead he shrugged so what it was an easier end than most of the ones he could imagine he could or thought he could feel strength flowing out of him and into her noout of him and through her her right arm speared out toward the northwest she might have been aiming at an enemy warrior she might have been but the range here was far longer and the effort required far more because she was drawing on hamnets strength he could sense some of what she was doing with it the link between them was stranger but in a way more intimate than when their bodies joined in the usual fashion he felt her longrange grapple with the rulers wizards they were trying to down her with the same sickness that had felled so many bizogots in his minds eye he saw the sickness as a greenish miasma whether that had anything to do with reality he couldnt have said marcovefa herself might have been the sun not the sun of the bizogot steppe not even the sun of nidaros but the hot fierce sun of the southwestern desert where the manche bandits skulked if she could burn through that ugly roiling miasma it would be like a fresh breeze blowing away the nasty humid air that oppressed the encampment he wondered if the vile weather and the vile sickness were connected one more thing that wouldnt have surprised him but the roiling green stuff he imagined he saw didnt want to burn away indeed it clung ever tighter to marcovefa if it could seize her before she could dispel it he didnt know what would happen then he did know it wouldnt be good without being asked ulric skakki took his left hand the adventurers strength flowed through hamnet and into marcovefa no the shaman from atop the glacier wasnt mocking the rulers and their wizardry any more maybe this wasnt the fight of her life but it was the toughest one shed had since descending to the plains the bizogots roamed maybe ulrics strength tilted the balance before marcovefa had struggled to hold her own against the rulers sorcery now she blazed brighter and brighter in hamnets imaginationif that was what it was the choking fog surrounding her clutching at her did it start to fade or did it draw back as if in fear of the spiritual glow that came from her hamnet had trouble putting it into words but both amounted to the same thing ha she cried aloud across however many miles it was hamnet thyssen felt the rulers wizards flinch away from her that cry might have been trasamunds fearsome twohanded sword swung with all the furious power the bizogot jarl had in him ha marcovefa said again the enemy wizards broke and fled her strengththose who could in much more mundane tones marcovefa told hamnet you can let go of my tit now thank you very much he did you broke them he said yes i did but she didnt take it for granted the way she once had you gave me good helpboth of you did and i thank you for it her eyes rolled up in her head and she crumpled to the ground vii only two bizogots died of the sorcerous plague audun gilli and liv did all they could count hamnet thought they succeeded better than anyone could have expected they werent satisfied wizards seldom were satisfied with anything short of perfection marcovefa was not only dissatisfied she was also furiousand more than a little frightened they could have killed me she told hamnet that evening in the hut the two of them shared they should have killed me if they made their plague strike me first maybe they kill us all the way they killed the rock ptarmigans he nodded thats what enemies try to do you know im glad they didnt think to make you sick firstor maybe they couldnt at long range maybe she sounded dubious and still very angry they arent supposed to be able to do that to me hamnet thyssen sighed everybody except you has been saying the rulers are dangerous all along youre the one whos been going no no theyre easy i can beat them with one hand tied behind my back and ive done it too marcovefas pride flared except when i got hit in the head ive done it every time a good thing too wed be ruined if you hadnt count hamnet said but even if you have beaten them every time it wont always be easy there are lots of them and only one of you and even if you think theyre bad wizards theyre better than anyone else down here below the glacier except you you need to be careful the same way you would have up on the ice the shamans from those other clans up there were as strong as you were right oh yes some of them were stronger marcovefa said at once but they wereareof my own folk not these rulers do you like to think your horse is smarter than you are hold on hamnet held up a hand the rulers are the ones who call everybody else the herd they think they can do whatever they want with other people because they think other people are just beasts i dont want us to think that way if we do how are we any better than they are marcovefa gave him a sharptoothed grin they are much uglier stubbornly count hamnet shook his head thats not good enough curse it im serious about this yes i see you are but i wonder why marcovefa said is it that important i think so hamnet said up on the glacier suppose another clan made a great magic by eating some of its own people would you use that same kind of sorcery yourself eat its own people to make magic marcovefa looked revolted which made hamnet sure hed picked a good example no we would never do that that would be wickedness itself it she broke off and sent hamnet a sour stare all right i see what you are saying good im glad hamnet thyssen hoped he didnt show just how glad he was if marcovefa hadnt seen his point he would have worried about her almost as much as he worried about the rulers she wasnt quite so alien to the bizogots and raumsdalians as they were but she wasnt far removed from it either he must not have kept his face as still as he hoped because marcovefa laughed at him after we beat the rulers then you can bash me over the head she said his ears heated the rulers are a menace because they dont care anything about our ways and dont want to learn you do want to learnand you follow our customs now that youre down here with us you havent eaten mans flesh since you came down from the glacier marcovefa mimed picking her teeth how do you know stop that count hamnet said youre just sticking thorns in me to make me jump and why not marcovefa replied i did some jumping of my own today that was more of a magic than i thought the rulers had in them a warrior with a sword and a helmet and a byrnie could easily beat armorless foes who carried only daggers if he faced a lot of foes like that who could blame him for getting careless but if he stayed careless against an enemy with gear like his own odds were hed end up bleeding on the ground count hamnet didnt know magic worked the same way but he couldnt see any reason why it shouldnt he wondered if he ought to point that out to marcovefa reluctantly he decided not to if she couldnt see it for himself she wouldnt want the lecture she might need it but she wouldnt want it what did you do to the wizards who were sending the sickness he asked instead that seemed safe enoughand he wanted to know i made them stop marcovefa answered past that i dont know i dont care very much either all right hamnet wasnt sure it was up till now marcovefa had thrashed the rulers wizards with monotonous regularity well it would have been monotonous anyhow if it hadnt been so essential if it got to the point where she couldnt thrash them like that if it got to that point the bizogots and the raumsdalian empire were in a lot of trouble as far as count hamnet knew marcovefa was the one effective weapon they had against the rulers if she wasnt so effectivewhat did they have then as far as he could see they had nothing i think i need a slug of smetyn he said its been a hard day harder for me so bring me some too marcovefa said she drank cautiously most of the time being new to smetyn and ale and beer and wine shed hurt herself the first couple of times she tried drinking she hadnt had any idea what a hangover was she did now and respected the morning after again most of the time the way she poured the fermented milk down today said she wasnt worrying about the next morning hamnet didnt suppose he could blame her shed just had a brush with a very nasty death so had he come to that he drank more than a slug himself marcovefa sent him an owlish stare what are you sitting there for she didnt slur her words but spoke with exaggerated precision arent you going to screw me well that question had only one possible answer unless he wanted an unholy row yes some time later he asked is that better he rubbed his left shoulder then sneaked a look at the palm of his hand she hadnt bitten him quite hard enough to draw blood she stretched like a lion after a kill what do you think if it got any better than that i dont know if id live through it hamnet was stretching things but not by much never a dull moment with marcovefa her smile said she liked the answer she drank more smetyn then she said in a little while we do it again ill try he said i may need some magic to hold up my end of the bargain i can do that marcovefa said and hed seen that she could she went on or we could do other things besides just screwing whatever you please hamnet thyssen said they werent prudes up there on top of the glacier they didnt have much in the way of entertainment so they made the most of what they did havelovemaking included and he ended up doing more than hed thought he could there were advantages to having a shaman for a lover there were also disadvantages liv had left him but she hadnt hated him he hoped marcovefa wouldnt hate him either if she ever decided to leave if she did hate him hed need to look for a place to hideand hed need to hope he could find a place like that with a shaman after him what do you suppose the rulers think about us right now ulric skakki came up with interesting questions to make time go by while riding on patrol nothing good i hope count hamnet said ulric dropped the reins in his lap for a moment so he could sarcastically clap his hands brilliant your grace bloody fornicating brilliant a lesser mind would be incapable of such analysis oh bugger off hamnet said which made the adventurer laugh out loud but ulric didnt give up if you were the rulers how would you try to get rid of us annoy us to death hamnet suggested and ulric laughed again but the question got hamnet thinking slowly he said magic didnt workcame close but it didnt work little raids havent worked either whats left using an anvil to swat a flycoming down on us with everything theyve got or do you have some different kind of scheme in mind no not me ulric shook his head to tell you the truth i hoped you did afraid not hamnet thyssen said pity ulric didnt let the chatter stop him from looking around every few heartbeats what do we do if they decide to land on us with both feet like that probably cant fight if they come at us with everybody and his favorite mammoth hamnet said ulric skakki nodded which disappointed him hed wanted the adventurer to tell him he was wrong sighing hamnet went on if we cant hold them off wed better run seems logical ulric agreed next question is where sort of all over the landscape or some place in particular count hamnet smiled in spite of himself chances are going somewhere in particular would be smart oh good i knew you were a clever fellow ulric made as if to clap his hands again hamnet made as if to punch him sarcasm could wear thin as if ignorant of that the adventurer went on now lets see how clever you really are if you have to run somewhere where do you want to run that required some thought hamnet thyssen didnt like the first answer he came up with so he tried to see if he could find a better one to his dismay he couldnt reluctantly he gave the first one the empire better my own people should jail me than the rulers should kill me i suppose yes i suppose so too ulric skakki said and no i dont like it any better than you do but what choice have we got the bizogots are shattered all up and down the plain and as far across it to east and west as we can reach the empire isnt doing all that well but it isnt shattered either well it wasnt when that last messenger made it up here anyhow hamnet said youre right it wasnt then ulric nodded he said nidaros hadnt fallen if it has by now sigvat iis bound to be dead and and thats bound to help whats left of raumsdalia count hamnet broke in ulric showed his teeth in what looked like a grin but wasnt how right you are its no wonder his majesty has brown eyes is it eh hamnet was a beat slow getting the joke then he did oh no no wonder at all by god whatever they find to take his placeeven if its the old drunk who sweeps out the stablesis bound to be better you dont like sigvat do you he stuck his head up his arse when we found the rulers he stuck me in a dungeon when i kept reminding him about that and he stuck us with gudrid when we went up through the gap why the demon should i like him interesting which one you put last ulric murmured oh shut up so im not over gudrid yet so chances are i never will be so what are you going to do about it hamnet said mm when you put it that way probably nothing the adventurer replied all rightback to the empire if we can get there goodsized army of rulers already down there remember if they move up against us why would they do that hamnet said itd be like a sabertooth walking away from a buffalo carcass to chaster after a yappy little fox a sabertooth wouldnt be that stupid ulric admitted im not so sure about people and we havent just yapped at the rulers weve nipped them a few timesand nobody else on this side of glacier seems able to do even that much they have their reasons from coming after us besides theyre afraid of you remember hamnet thyssen laughed bitterly if they are theyre every bit as stupid as you make them out to be too much to hope for though i fear theyre smarter than you are because theyve got some notion of whats dangerous to them ulric said oh i know whats dangerous to me all right hamnet said i ought to after all the mistakes ive made with them you may be dangerous to women that doesnt mean theyre dangerous to you ulric told him if theyre not god save me from running into anything that is count hamnet said you take things too seriously the adventurer said ive had things happen to me that need to be taken seriously hamnet retorted not everybody slides through life with a greased hide the way you do just goes to show you dont know me as well as you think ulric shrugged doesnt matter not really we decided what we needed to decide only thing left now is convincing trasamund that sent hamnet laughing again you dont ask for much oh hell come around hell yell and fuss and bellow till he works all the indigestion out of his system and then hell be fine he doesnt sit around brooding like some people i could name ulric sent hamnet a pointed glance when hamnet suggested a few things ulric could do if he didnt like it the adventurer only laughed that made hamnet offer more suggestions ulric laughed harder hamnet knew ulric was trying to get his goat the adventurer was good at getting what he wanted too instead of swearing any more hamnet subsided into quiet fury that wasnt what ulric skakki wanted come on thyssenswear some more he said you need to get it out of your system too and i dont care if you call me names you wouldnt be the first one god knows if you dont care whats the point hamnet said ulric started to laugh some more but broke off all right fine i give up do what you want to do no matter how idiotic it looks never mind that the rulers worry about you theyre nothing but a pack of fools were all a pack of fools everybody in the whole stupid worlds a foolexcept you that set hamnet swearing again ulric skakki bowed in the saddle which only irked hamnet more if the rulers are so stinking afraid of me why what have i done he demanded theyve trounced the bizogots while i was up here theyve trounced the empire while i was down there im useless is what i am are they better wizards than the ones weve got or are they worse ulric asked i mean raumsdalian wizards and bizogot shamansleave marcovefa out of it theyre better and you know it as well as i do hamnet thyssen snapped why talk about whats obvious ulric bowed again why because its so obvious you dont want to look at it if theyve got better wizards than we doand theyve got em all rightthen they can see things we cant and one of the things they see is that count hamnet thyssen means trouble to them only goes to show theyre not smart all the time hamnet said stubbornly you dont want to believe me you wouldnt believe me if i told you it got cold up here in the wintertime ulric skakki said fine dont believe me but ask your lady love if she says it youd better believe it shes not my lady love hamnet muttered that was part of his problem too he slept with marcovefa he kept company with her he liked herwhen she didnt scare the piss out of him love her the way hed loved gudrid and liv no matter how much he wanted to he couldnt come close she was too strange and she didnt seem to want him to love her either he didnt try explaining that to ulric he would have had trouble explaining it to himself but it was there and it ate at him at the same time as the troubles against the invaders did by the way ulric eyed him he didnt need to explain it the adventurer was alarmingly good at understanding how people worked to hamnet that came close to being magicdark magic lady love or not ask her anyway shell give you a straight answer maybe shell even figure out why the rulers get all weak in the knees when they think about you oh go howl hamnet said but the seed once planted wouldnt go away marcovefa looked at him for all count hamnet could tell she looked into him looked through him why do the rulers fear you she said why do you care so much about why isnt it enough to know that they do no curse it hamnet said as far as i can see its nothing but stupidity they have no reason to do it trasamund is more dangerous to them than ill ever be the bizogots listen to him nobody listens to me here nobody listens to me down in the empire either god knows thats true you worry too much about things marcovefa said hamnet thyssen laughed harshly now tell me something i didnt know but i think the rulers worry too much about me if you want me toby the way marcovefa said it she meant if youre daft enough to want me toi can try a divination to see why i dont know what it will show i dont know if it will show anything try hamnet said if it doesnt do anything else maybe itll make ulric skakki shut up thatd be worth a lot to me all by itself she raised an eyebrow all right she said we see she smiled to herself as she picked up a small earthenware bowl she admired pottery so did the bizogots who got it in trade from the empire their nomadic way of life didnt let them build the kilns they would have needed to make their own bowls and pots and jugs i will be back she told him i need water for this divination i will look into the water in the bowl and see what it shows all right we have scryers who work like that hamnet said she nodded i am not surprised anyone who does magic would think of this easier to keep water in a bowl than to weave a basket that holds it yes count hamnet nodded too the bizogots also had that art raumsdalians didnt no need for it in a land where potters worked in every village marcovefa ducked out of their hut it wasnt far from the edge of sudertorp lake she soon returned carrying the bowl carefully so she wouldnt spill the lakewater come outside she told hamnet the sun will help show what there is to see if you say so hamnet expected the perpetually curiousperpetually nosybizogots to crowd around and watch her work magic but they didnt maybe keeping them away was another magic hamnet couldnt think of anything else likely to do it the shaman from atop the glacier began to chant in her own dialect hamnet thyssen had learned bits and pieces of it but not enough to follow her song follow or not he knew about what she had to be saying she was asking for calm water in which she could see what would happen in days to come she bent low over the bowl still chanting the water inside lay utterly still to hamnet it was only water to marcovefa it would show what lay ahead more clearly than a mirror of polished silver down in nidaros showed a fair ladys reflection then without warning the bowl broke marcovefa exclaimed in surprise the water spilled out and carved a couple of tiny gullies in the dirt in front of the hut i didnt know it was cracked hamnet said it wasnt marcovefa answered but it must have been it wouldnt have done that if it werent hamnet insisted she shook her head no that was part of the scrying look she picked up the pieces of the bowl then dug something out of the dirt with her fingernail she held it under hamnets nose his eyes crossed as he tried to focus a little scrap of crystal so what its more than that she said well what is it then something to do with the divination how could it be it wasnt even in the water it was under the water thats what matters you arent making any sense hamnet said impatiently marcovefa looked annoyednot at him but at herself i cant make sense about thisnot as much as i want to anyhow the scrying broke apart when the bowl did you mean you dont know whats ahead hamnet felt like kicking something we just wasted the time and the bowl no she shook her head again i learned something anyhow you will face the rulers here in the land of the bizogots not down in raumsdalia hamnet said in some surprise maybe there too but when it matters most it will be here and what happens then then the bowl breaks marcovefa gave him a crooked grin he would have thought hed be more likely to see on ulric skakkis face you dont always find out everything you want to know of course not hamnet said that would make things too easy marcovefa nodded even if hed meant it for a sour joke yes it would but if i do not know what happens after the bowl breaks neither do the rulers i saw that much anyhow can you get another bowl and try again count hamnet asked i am not brave enough the shaman answered when the bowl broke and the water spilled that told me i was not supposed to know any more but the rulers know what they are about whatever happens here it happens on account of you im going to go out and punch ulric in the chops hamnet said why for being right ah marcovefa nodded once more yes that makes sense not many worse things a man can do now he thought she was jokingbut if she was she hid it very well i still cant believe it hamnet said im nobody in particular why does this have to land on me why not you it has to land on someone or else it lands on no one and the rulers win without a real fight marcovefa said but you arent nobody in particular who has been beyond the glacier who has been to the top of the glacier too ulric trasamund hamnet thyssen hesitated then produced two more names audun gilli liv so why me one in five is not nobody in particular marcovefa said who has loved a woman from your folk from the bizogots and from my folk only you is that why hamnet was more appalled than anything else he started to blurt much good its done me but swallowed the words he didnt want to anger marcovefa swallowing words around a shaman didnt always help by marcovefas expression she knew what he was about to say even if he didnt say it i do not know if that is why or not she said maybe maybe not but there is more to you than you want to see more to land me in trouble he said that too she agreed which didnt make him any happier maybe also more to get you out though he laughed when was the last time i wasnt in trouble he knew the answer to that whether marcovefa did or not the day before sigvats courier got to my castle to tell me i had to come to nidaros thats when one thing after the other am i one thingor the other she asked sharply of course you are hamnet said you know it as well as i do too you wouldnt be able to stand yourself if you didnt make trouble go aheadtell me im wrong marcovefa preened she tried to pretend she hadnt but she couldnt do it then she said well maybe i am but not just trouble to you trouble to your enemies too you have lots of enemies who count hamnet said me he was convincing enough to make marcovefa poke him in the ribs she didnt kick him in the ribs he supposed to show him she wasnt his enemy yet three days later another rider from the empire came into what had been the leaping lynxes summer village per anders looked relieved to find hamnet thyssen there god be praised he said i bring you a letter from his majesty he took a fancy beribboned multiply sealed rolled parchment from his saddlebag and presented it to count hamnet with the best flourish a weary man could manage oh joy hamnet said as he took it happy day ulric skakki agreed the courier glanced from one of them to the other does the honor of hearing from the emperorof having a letter in his own bright handnot please you no hamnet said shortly sorry andersnot your fault ulric added but either hes going to lie to us or hes going to beg from us or hes going to do both at once his voice elaborately casual he went on so tell medoes the empire still hold nidaros per anders flinched how the demon did you know it was lost well it wasnt the last time a rider made it up here but we sent that poor bugger off with a flea in his ear the adventurer answered its the logical place for the rulers to aim at and theyve got wizards we mostly cant match so sigvat got away did he wheres he holed up now aarhus anders said unwillingly count hamnet whistled under his breath aarhus lay a long way south of nidaros four or five days travel the small sound drew the couriers attention back to him arent you going to read that i dont know am i hamnet asked not at all in jest per anders winced but ulric was rightit wasnt the horse mans fault hed risked his life to obey sigvat ii a man who to hamnets way of thinking had long since proved he wasnt worth obeying hamnet took a certain grim pleasure in tearing the ribbon and cracking the blobby red and green seals well what sort of horse manure have we got here ulric asked as hamnet unrolled the parchment hamnet didnt answer not right away anders was right the letter was in the emperors own hand which made it much harder to read than if one of his secretaries had written it where were they now dead fled how many poor bastards had the rulers found in the dungeons under sigvats palace what did they do with them turn them loose broil them for supper hamnet didnt think the rulers were cannibals but how could you be sure sigvat ii swore hed lost nidaros by treachery maybe it was even true count hamnet couldnt see that it mattered now one way or the other the emperor also swore he would get the capital back by himself which hamnet didnt believe for a minute then he wrote we all need to work together against these savage barbarous foes hamnet thyssen swore under his breath of all the things he hated agreeing with his muchunloved sovereign stood close to the top of the list he wordlessly passed the letter to ulric about what youd expect the adventurer said after going through it faster than hamnet had his toes are scorched and he wants us to come pull him off the fire were already doing more than he knows about hamnet said not a lot of rulers getting down to the empire the ones already down there are bad enough per anders said more than bad enough if you and the mammothherders here can come south to help us sigvat will be grateful both hamnet thyssen and ulric skakki burst out laughing do you think we were whelped yesterday ulric asked no emperors ever grateful for longer than it takes him to pull up his pants again and sigvats worse than most then you wont come anders sounded tragic god help raumsdalia if god would help raumsdalia sigvat wouldnt need us count hamnet said we didnt tell you we wouldnt come but if we do well do it for our reasons not sigvats what reasons have we got ulric seemed genuinely curious what weve got to decide is do we hate sigvat worse than the rulers hamnet replied i know what trasamund and marcovefa will say so do you ulric skakki grimaced well yes they will say that but they dont know sigvat the way we do no theyre lucky count hamnet said that got a laugh from the adventurer and another wince from per anders the poor courier seemed to do nothing but flinch listening to the way hamnet and ulric roasted his sovereignand theirs if you wont do it for sigvats sake do it for the empires he said please i beg you he actually dropped to his knees and held out his hands palms up as if pleading for mercy from foes whod beaten him get up you donkey hamnet said gruffly yes do this is embarrassing ulric agreed i have no pride i have no shame per said staying on his knees why should i be embarrassed i am trying to serve raumsdalia with stewed parsnips on the side i have no doubt ulric skakki said the courier looked blank for a moment then sent him a reproachful stare ulric went on his grace is right get up you wont just have one barbarian invasion on your handsyoull have two we can deal with bizogots weve always dealt with bizogots per anders said dont let trasamund hear you talk like that or youll be talking out of a new mouth in your neck hamnet thyssen warned but anders was right the bizogots were a nuisance to the empire the rulers were a deadly danger to itand to the bizogots as well youll come south then now per did rise and brushed mud from the knees of his trousers im afraid we will count hamnet spoke without enthusiasm as you say not for sigvatbe damned to sigvatbut for raumsdalia reasons dont matter when youre doing the right thing anders said reasons always matter hamnet soundedand wasvery sure of himself ulric skakki looked as if he wanted to argue but held his tongue marcovefa proved willing to go down into the empire again trasamund proved eager neither reaction surprised hamnet thyssen well go well clean them out in the south and then well come back and clean them out here in the north too trasamund boomed he drew his big sword and flourished it above his head by god well run them back beyond the glacier no we wont ulric said dont be a bigger idiot than you can help maybe if were lucky enough we can beat them down in the empire dont ask god for what hes not about to give you who are you to say what god can and cant do the jarl retorted has he been talking to you he has ulric said solemnly and trasamunds eyes widened the adventurer went on he told me dont listen to the big bizogot with the bad temper because he doesnt know what the demon hes talking about trasamund snorted and made as if to cuff him hamnet had seen that ulric could flip anybody who came at him even if the attacker was much the bigger man he didnt bother now he just ducked away per anders wanted everyone to jump on a horse and ride off on the instant that didnt happen the courier must have known it wouldnt the bizogots rode out the next day hamnet thought that was pretty good ulric didnt seem to when hamnet asked him why he answered how much decent weather have we got left hamnet grunted when would the breath of god start blowing down from the north summer up heresummer in nidaros for that mattergot cut cruelly short by the frigid wind off the glacier some years it got cut shorter than others nothing we can do about it any which way except go on as long as we can hamnet said no doubt no doubt by the way ulric said it he would have bundled up the breath of god in a leather sack and stolen off with it if only he could but some things were beyond even his formidable talents i dont know how much good well do hamnet looked at the small makeshift army bizogots from half the clans on the steppe rode with trasamund maybe they would follow the jarls orders maybe notwhich was true of any force of bizogots ever put together they might have counted for something in terms of surprise in pure fighting terms they werent worth much save only marcovefa she could do things no one else could even hope for against the rulers she could yesbut would she no way to know not till she did or she didnt and if she didnt they were all ruined well find out ulric said which echoed hamnet thyssens thoughts much too closely for comfort viii trees thank god per anders pointed toward the southern horizon sure enough a dark smudge of evergreen forest showed up there the raumsdalian courier went on up here in the bizogot country i keep thinking everything is too big too wide i might as well not be there at allnobody would notice if i disappeared well i know what you mean hamnet thyssen said too much landscape no edges anywhere and the sky is even bigger no edges anywhere per repeated yes thats about right it was better when i got to those shabby little huts by the lake then at least i could tell where things started and stopped what do you mean anders shabby little huts trasamund said ominously i tell you there is nothing else like them in all the bizogot country hed complained that the leaping lynxes permanent dwellings made them seem like raumsdalians but to a man from the empire he didnt know well he naturally seemed proud of what his own folk had done youve seen nidaros your ferocity per anders tried to stay polite without backing down next to the palaces and mansions there these uh houses arent impressive yes ive seen nidaros trasamund agreed so what all those fancy palaces and mansions the rulers hold em now per bit his lip that shot went home and it moved count hamnets thoughts in a direction they hadnt found before tell me he said as casually as he could do you happen to know whether earl eyvind torfinn got out of nidaros before the rulers took the place i couldnt say your grace anders answered i dont think he was one of the band who broke free with the emperor though all right thanks hamnet said so maybe eyvind got away and maybe he didnt but that wasnt really what hamnet was thinking so maybe gudrid got away and maybe she didntthat was more like it most of the time you could count on gudrid to land on her feet or on her back if that was what she needed to do but in the chaos of a sack who could say what if she was dead knocked over the head or forced to serve a gang of men till they got tired of swiving her and cut her throat for one last thrill i ought to laugh it would serve her right hamnet thought and part of him did feel like laughingbut not all not all looking around he found ulric skakki gazing at him with ironic speculation did the adventurer know what was going through his mind he wouldnt have been surprised ulric knew more than was good for him about all kinds of things deliberately hamnet looked away ulric chuckled no he wasnt easy to evade as they neared the firs and spruces some of the bizogots muttered among themselves the forest was as strange and unwelcoming to them as the frozen steppe was to raumsdalians the mammothherders complained that they felt all closed in when trees surrounded them some raumsdalians felt the same way but not so many well thyssen shall we look for a border post or just plunge into the woods trasamund asked better to look for a post i think hamnet said they have roads leading south from them the jarl grunted all right makes sense they found what was left of a border station though it had been burned white bones in the ruins said the guardsmen hadnt got away a roador at least a trackdid lead south from it as the bizogots rode in amongst the trees they did more muttering dark aromatic branches hid the sun and most of the sky its like riding inside a tent one of the big blond men said like riding inside mammoth guts another put in smells a good deal better ulric said that didnt seem to encourage them watch out for shortfaced bears hamnet said they like to hide behind tree trunks and then jump out at whatever they think they can kill chances are they wont bother a big band like ours but you never can tell the bizogots didnt like hearing that up on the steppe most of the time you could see danger coming from a long way off that didnt always mean you could get away from it but you could see it the mammothherders didnt care for the idea that it might lurk behind trees neither did hamnet thyssen shortfaced bears werent the only danger or the worst one if the rulers wanted to lay an ambush here they could marcovefa likely had the best chance of sniffing one out but she looked no more comfortable in the forest than most of the bizogots did shed come down into the empire once before which didnt mean she liked it here whats the first town down this road hamnet asked ulric the adventurer might not have been everywhere but he came close its lonsdal isnt it ulric sounded uncertain but only hamnet was sure for politeness sake lonsdal thats right hamnet said ive heard the name but i dont think i ever went through the place you didnt miss much ulric skakki said its about what youd expect up here a hole in the ground with a stockade around it if the rulers have come through i dont suppose its the better for that not many places are count hamnet thought of the rulers plundering earl eyvinds mansion down in nidaros he thought of them laughing drunkenly as they threw ancient codices into the fire one after another he thought of them leering as they pulled gudrids provocative gowns out of her closet would they throw those away would they put them on women of their own or on raumsdalian women staying alive by doing what they could for the new conquerors or would gudrid wearing one of those gowns somehow charm the invaders into leaving eyvind torfinns home intact she wouldnt do it for eyvinds sake hamnet was sure of that but for her own a different story altogether could she bring it off hamnet only shrugged he had no way to know but it was possible maybe just as possible as the mental picture of her corpse naked in a gutter raped to death when they got to lonsdal they found the rulers had been here before them the stockade was down not undermined but blasted by some sorcery much of the town seemed to have burned the stench of death lingered in the air though the carrion birds had taken what they could some people still lived here they peered from the doorways of buildings that survived good god more barbarians somebody shouted in what sounded like despair well fight someone else yelled an arrow arced through the air it landed well short of the raumsdalians and bizogots but served as a warning even so you idiots were not invading you were here to fight the godcursed rulers hamnet thyssen bellowed you always did know how to make friends ulric skakki said much more quietly hamnet waved him to silence the locals went back and forth with one another at last warily one of them came out into the open and approached the newcomers you dont talk like a damned foreigner the fellow said im not hamnet answered were at war with the people who did this to you have you got any food at all you can spare us maybe a little the man said dubiously or maybe more than a little trasamund rumbled do you want to see what damned foreigners can do if you make them angry no the local said but we already had one set of robbers go through here how much do you think they left us and youre another set of robbers he didnt say that trasamund didnt catch it in his voice count hamnet did by the way one corner of ulrics mouth quirked up so did he and by the way marcovefa raised an eyebrow so did she do what you can hamnet said we came south off the bizogot steppe to fight the rulers we cant do it on empty bellies though oh joy the local told him well if you whip em dont chase em back this way dont reckon we could live through it if they came through lonsdal one more timeor if you were right behind em again the locals coughed up some bread and some flat rounds made from rye and oat flour and some smoked meat even more reluctantly they produced a little beer hamnet would have bet they had more than they were showing he couldnt blame them too much for holding back though they had to go on living too they didnt invite any newcomers to use their houses or their beds in fact they made it plain the bizogots and the raumsdalians with them had better keep clear unless they wanted a fight hamnet worked hard to keep the mammothherders from losing their tempers more often than not bizogots responded to a challenge with a fist in the teeth well post guards tonight around our own camp trasamund declared the same as we would anywhere in enemy country he glared at hamnet as if daring him to say they were anywhere else hamnet didnt all he said was sounds like a good idea to me if the people were trying to help are liable to jump on us in the dark whats the point of helping them the jarl asked theyve already had a lot of trouble they think were more of the same hamnet answered if they do jump us theyll find out how right they are trasamund made a fist that doesnt do us much good it doesnt do them much either hamnet said beats the demon out of getting ambushed by a bunch of skulking murderers in the night trasamund retorted set some obvious sentries hamnet said and set some who arent so obvious the locals wont have the nerve to try anything well make them sorry if they do the bizogot said the folk of lonsdal didnt even more reluctantly than they had the evening before they came up with some food in the evening they didnt cheer out loud when the bizogots rode south but they werent far from it hamnet could see that in their faces if you lived in a place like this you had to want the outside world to leave you alone most of the time the folk of lonsdal hadnt got enough of what they wanted riding south hamnet wondered what the rulers would do to thwart him the shortfaced bear that had attacked his comrades that on dying had proved not to be a natural bear at all but a shaman or wizard in sorcerous disguise he asked marcovefa if the enemy had anything like that in mind this time around her nostrils flared as a lions might when it sought a scent after a moment she shook her head saying i feel nothing can they be fooling you he persisted marcovefas nostrils flared again this time in scorn not likely she said but then she hesitated maybe not impossible she admitted and hamnet admired her for that since the sickness spell i think their shamans are not stupid and hopeless all the time hamnet reminded himself that the magicians she mocked were far stronger than the best bizogot shamans and raumsdalian wizards well if you do sense anything dont keep it a secret he said i will not do that she said it didnt have the dont worry little boy flavor it might have before she learned the rulers could be dangerous to her or maybe she was just getting better at not hurting his feelings they hadnt gone much farther before they discovered the rulers were doing their best to stay annoying the road suddenly ended actually no it didnt end but it stopped being usable trees had fallen across it in wild disorder tangled together worse than jackstraws going forwardgoing straight forward anyhowwas impossible magic hamnet asked marcovefa magic she agreed but not new magic they did this a while ago im surprised the folk from lonsdal didnt know ulric skakki said how do you know they didnt hamnet said maybe they did but they werent about to tell the likes of us ulric grunted and gave back a reluctant nod what do we do about it trasamund asked i dont know much about trees he proved he didnthe was speaking the bizogots language but he used the raumsdalian word for trees he had to his own tongue lacked a name for them can we clear them out of the way with magic and go on likely easier to slip into the forest and go around the jam ulric said marcovefa nodded yes this is so often magic can make a mess better than it can clear a mess well all right by the way trasamund said it it wasnt trees all around not even a path through them he muttered something under his breath there there ulric clicked his tongue between his teeth in mockand mockingsympathy you can hold my hand if it bothers you the jarl suggested several other things he could do with his hand none of them had much to do with holding someone elses or with trees come to that ulric skakki only grinned still swearing trasamund plunged into the forest where one bizogot would go others would follow they might not like it much but they would do almost anything to keep from seeming cowards to hamnet thyssen it was only a forest the one down by his castle in southeastern raumsdalia had more broadleafed trees than evergreens while this one was almost all conifers as far as he was concerned though the difference was one of degree not of kind he didnt mind having trees all around him he took it for granted roads were fine when you were traveling but not when you were hunting although the day was cool sweat poured off marcovefa she liked trees and being among trees even less than trasamund did well get back to the road soon hamnet assured her not soon enough she said you know the rulers come from treeless country too ulric remarked maybe they dont like being closed in so they have a pretty good notion our bizogots wont like it either do they wonder about how herd animals think hamnet used the rulers name for other people as little as they can get away with i suspect or likely something less than that ulric said which struck hamnet as cynical and probable at the same time whatever the reason the rulers didnt harass their foes in the forest except for the fallen trees the bizogots breathed loud sighs of relief when they came out into open country once more pointing to an apple orchard ahead trasamund said a few trees every now and then are all right we can go around themwe dont have to get stuck amongst em another bizogot added it wont be like theyre trying to eat us up count hamnet and ulric and even audun gilli exchanged amused glances only someone who didnt know trees was likely to imagine them as predators hamnet thought of the plums near his castle he tried to imagine one of them waylaying passersby the picture didnt want to form remember trasamund said if you see anybody riding a deer hes the enemy kill the bastard before he kills you always a good idea with enemies ulric agreed they hardly ever give you a hard time once theyre dead hardly ever hamnet thyssen said what do you do with the ones who haunt you exorcise em ulric answered at once everybody needs a little exorcise now and then hamnet gave him a reproachful stare which he ignored most of the time travelers coming down from the south would have seen horses and cattle and sheep in the fields not now count hamnet was saddened but not surprised the rulers would have stolen or killed as many animals as they could get their hands on and the local farmers would have fled with the rest off to the west or east or south any direction but the one from which the invaders were coming even without livestock the land seemed rich to the bizogots something else about it surprised them too you use some of the land for one thing and some for another a mammothherder said he might have been talking about a clever piece of sorcery i can tell by what grows and the way you have fences up on the broad trackless steppe fences were only a waste of time and work we have the notion that land belongs to the person who works it hamnet said things were more complicated than that but it would do for a start and it was plenty to shock the bizogot land belongs to the clan he declared he might have been stating a law of nature he probably thought he was different peoples have different customs count hamnet said not always right not always wrong just different land belongs to the clan the bizogot repeated his folk for instance rejoiced in stubbornnessmulishness a raumsdalian would have called it never argue with a blockhead ulric skakki said in raumsdalian you wont convince him and it only irks you who are you calling a blockhead the bizogot demanded also in raumsdalian you ulric answered calmly just because you can be a blockhead in more than one language doesnt mean youre not a blockhead by god i ought to cut your liver out for that the mammothherder said we need skakki trasamunds voice went hard and flat anyone who wants to fight him has to fight me first i dont have to hide behind your skirts if this unwashed ruffian thinks he can take me ulric began trasamund cut him off with a sharp chopping gesture while the offended bizogot shouted angrily i know you dont need to hide the jarl said i know you can cut ottar here into dogmeat too the bizogotottarshouted again trasamund took no more notice of him than ulric had of hamnet not long before he went on we need you too ottar only not so much if i have to choose between the two of you i choose skakki hes not even of our blood ottar said since when do you choose people who sit around all the time over proper nomads before trasamund could say anything to that ulric laughed in ottars face you go back and forth over the same range all the bloody time and you call yourself a nomad have you traveled beyond the gap have you gone up onto the glacier have you ever seen the deserts in the far southwest have you been through the jungles beyond the desert nomad ha he laughed again count hamnet eyed ottar wondering what hed do next when ulric went after a man he flayed him with his tongue would ottar try to wipe out the insult with blood or would he go off somewhere and lick his wounds he did neither he tried to fight back with words jeering talk is cheap just because you say youve been to those places doesnt mean you have ive been through the gap with him ive been up on the glacier with him too trasamund said the hot places i dont know but they wouldnt surprise me ive been in the desert hamnet thyssen added it is the way ulric says it is i havent been in the jungle myselfi havent fared that far south but what ive heard about it from other people makes me believe ulrics been there too ottar looked at him he looked at trasamund and he looked at ulric skakki then shaking his head he rode away from the adventurer hamnet thought that was one of the smarter things he could have done a squad or so of raumsdalian soldiers sat around a fire roasting a sheep theyd probably lifted they looked up in alarm when the bizogots rode down on them a couple of men stared to run but they really had nowhere to run to hold it right there trasamund bawled and hold it they did you arent the new barbarians youre the other barbarians the raumsdalian who spoke sounded almost indignant to say nothing of confused yesthats us the other barbarians count hamnet said hearing perfect raumsdalian come from his lips seeing a swarthy man among the blond mammothherders only confused the soldiers more who the demon are you one of them asked count hamnet thyssen hamnet answered and waited to see what would happen next the name meant nothing to some of them others though jerked as if stung by wasps hamnet thyssen exclaimed the soldier whod asked his name theres a fat price on your head did you know that no but im not surprised hamnet said since the emperor sent a manhe waved toward per andersto bring me back to raumsdalia i dont think you could collect that price right now of course you could be wrong ulric skakki said silkily i suppose so count hamnet said with sigvat ii being wrong was easy his ingratitude towered higher than the glacier and sank deeper than the bottom of sudertorp lake if you trusted him you had only yourself to blame what do we do with them trasamund askeda good practical question what are they doing here ulric addedanother good question hamnet suspected the soldiers were there because theyd been part of an army the rulers shattered a few questions proved he was right ulric asked the stragglers are you ready for another go at the bastards who beat you before some of the raumsdalians nodded without hesitation others just sat there looking unhappy they didnt want another go at the rulers all they wanted was to stay where they were run away from danger and scavenge as they got the chance they might as well be coyotes hamnet thought scornfully come on he told them if raumsdalia loses none of this will do you any good youll just be part of the rulers herd and theyll cull you whenever they feel like it is that any way for a man to live beats getting an arrow through your brisket or some nasty magic coming down on your head a soldier said that will happen anyhow hamnet said it wont happen today maybe because the rulers are busy farther south but if they win down there theyll clean you out up here too or do you think im wrong too by the miserable hangdog expression on the soldiers face he didnt think count hamnet was wrong however much he wished he did i dont ever want to fight those buggers again he mumbled would you rather they came hunting you after they cleaned out everybody else hamnet asked the raumsdalian trooper looked unhappier yet trasamund lost patience with him as the jarl was apt to do or would you rather we rolled over you and then went on and fought the rulers ourselves well use you people if we can but we wont waste time on account of you that persuaded the raumsdalians hamnet thyssen might have known it would they couldnt hope to fight the host in front of them how well theyd fight against the rulers hamnet and trasamund would just have to wait and see but if they were going to build their fighting tail they would have to use odds and sods like these how many bands some only four or five men some perhaps a couple of dozen wandered through the northern part of the empire these days dozens scores hundreds hamnet couldnt know but he thought his guesses were pretty good you can persuade people to do nearly anything ulric skakki remarked as long as all their other choices seem worse if thats not philosophy it ought to be hamnet said ha the adventurer said save that kind of nonsense for earl eyvind there are tricks to riding a horse and there are tricks to driving people thats one of themor it sure looks like one to me to me too count hamnet agreed why else are we here trasamund answered that before ulric skakki could were here to beat the rulers if we dont do that were just pissing into the wind a raumsdalian would have talked about spitting into the wind that made the jarl crude by imperial standards it didnt make him wrong however much count hamnet wished it would have he glanced over to marcovefa without her this motley band of bizogots and raumsdalians had little chance against the invaders beyond the glacier hamnet thyssen shook his head he laughed at his own foolishness without marcovefa this ragtag band had no chance against the rulers none whatsoever were it possible to have less than no chance the band without marcovefa would have yet she herself was almost as alien to her comrades as the rulers were in some ways she was more alien yes rulers who failed at anything important or who found themselves about to be captured often killed themselves to escape what they saw as disgrace but they didnt devour the corpses of their defeated foes hamnet knew why marcovefas folk had become cannibals up atop the glacier meat of any sort was too scarce too precious to let any of it go to waste it made her no less strange no less appalling to those who didnt share her customs one of the bizogots pointed southeast theres one of the godcursed riding deer the godcursed rulers use he shouted men looked to their weapons marcovefa audun gilli and liv were warriors only in emergencies that didnt mean they werent about to fight and their fight might prove harder and more dangerous than anything swordsmen and archers and lancers faced without marcovefa it surely would have been with her the odds improved before hamnet could wonder how much they improvedthe sorceryspread sickness had jolted marcovefas confidencea raumsdalian whod just joined them asked what did the fellow with the yellow whiskers say hamnet swore under his breath he and ulric were both fluent in the bizogots tongue audun gilli per anders and marcovefa could get along in it most of the mammothherders knew at least some raumsdalian but these imperial troopers had never had any reason to learn the northerners speech he translated for them then he spoke to ulric weve got a new complication or an old complication back again oldest cursed complication in the worldexcept for men and women diddling where they arent supposed to ulric agreed he paused seemingly of its own accord his left eyebrow quirked upward nothing personal your grace right nothing personal count hamnet said tightly was it his fault two of his women had diddled where they werent supposed to if you listened to them the answer was yes if you listened to ulric skakki it was also yes hamnet didnt want to listen to any of them either in person or inside his own mind with the enemy out there in front of him he didnt have to either that ruler wasnt alone he was an outrider from a small troop of men seeing so many foes bearing down on them they found no disgrace in fleeing their warriors code was stern but not always senselessly so riding deer were admirable beasts in many ways they showed great endurance their antlers even if bluntertined than those of the deer near hamnets castle made useful weapons all that said they remained slower than horses the mounted bizogots and raumsdalians soon gained on them the rulers had found out about horses since coming down through the gap into the world hamnet knewthe world hed long believed to be all the world there was they kept looking back over their shoulders to gauge how much trouble they were in before long they started reaching for arrows their formidable bows outranged the ones raumsdalians and bizogots carried that wasnt the worry uppermost in hamnets thoughts though have they got a wizard with them he called to marcovefa what she shouted back havetheygotawizardwiththem oh marcovefa said and then i dont think so hamnet had to be contentor rather discontentedwith that he strung his own bow and nocked an arrow the rulers began to shoot first even loosing arrows backward they could hit from a distance their foes found impossible to match a bizogot swore when a shaft pierced the palm of his hand but because horses were faster than riding deer the bizogots and raumsdalians soon started shooting back with some hope of success a wounded deer bounded away from the rest of the troop its rider unable to control it another deer crashed to the ground with luck the ruler it carried wouldnt come through that unscathed and an invader hit in the neck as he turned back to shoot slid off his mount and lay motionless marcovefa began to sing in the saddle not so very long before she wouldnt have tried that she was a better more confident rider than she had been and no wondertill she came down from the top of the glacier shed never imagined animals like horses and riding deer let alone mounted ones the shaman pointed in the rulers direction she might not have known anything about riding deer till she came down onto the bizogot steppe but her magic now was plenty to send them mad they started bucking and bounding over the dreary landscape regardless of what the men on them wanted the rulers couldnt get away and they couldnt fight backthe worst of both worlds but they wouldnt give up several of the men whod been bucked off their deer drew swords and stood backtoback ready to make the best fight they could a couple of warriors whod managed to hang on to their bows went on shooting at the bizogots and raumsdalians as if nothing were wrong theyre tough buggers ulric skakki said not without admiration as he shot an enemy bowman from behind he was not a sporting fighter but he was a very effective one almost makes you wish they were on our side no it doesnt hamnet thyssen growled it only makes me wish they were all back on the far side of the gap where they belong dont hold your breath even if we somehow beat them down here dont hold your breath ulric said theyre part of the mix now im afraid and the gap wont be what it is now for very much longer either huh hamnet didnt get an answer right away he urged his horse up into a gallop so he could cut down an embattled warrior of the rulers but ulrics odd comment stayed in his mind he asked the adventurer about it again after the fighting ended what dyou think im wrong ulric said how can i tell i dont know what youre talking about hamnet replied no eh youre dense today arent you as usual ulric had charm i must be hamnet said otherwise i wouldnt waste time on you that won him a grin you say the sweetest things ulric skakki told him well think about it a little the glacier is melting thats why weve got the gap at all what happens when the glacier melts some more the gap wont be this little thing where you can pee from one side to the other he exaggerated but not enormously pretty soon itll be ten miles wide before too long itll be a hundred miles wide and when it is we might as well call it the highway instead of the gap because we wont have a godcursed chance of keeping anything from the other side out oh hamnet said he plunged his sword into the soft loam to get more blood off the blade that made much too much sense hed had the same thought himself but he hadnt followed it to see where it might lead maybe the golden shrine is under the glacier somewhere and itll come out once the ice melts some more maybe youre an idiot but i hadnt thought so till now ulric said cheerfully dont hold your breath waiting for the golden shrine to show up there thats the best advice you ever got unless somebody was smart enough to tell you to keep away from gudrid before it was too late leave gudrid out of this as always anger filled count hamnets voice when he talked about his former wife this time ulric gave the anger nothing to light on all right he said he didnt even add that if this ragtag army with the strange sorceress beat the rulers it would prop up not only gudrid but also sigvat ii why mention it when hamnet could figure it out for himself hamnet not only could he dutifully did ulric sent him a benign smile watching him do it the adventurer could be dangerous all kinds of ways trasamund walked by carrying the head of a dead ruler by the curly beard none of the invaders had surrendered they had the courage of their convictionsand much good it had done them trasamund seemed happy enough he wasnt dangerous in so many ways as ulric skakki was which didnt mean he wasnt a dangerous man well we whipped this bunch of them anyway he said pausing for a moment so we did ulric agreed nowhow many more bunches do we have to whip before were done how am i supposed to know trasamund asked suspiciously somebody should dont you think ulric asked dont bait him hamnet thyssen said who me the adventurer was the picture of innocence that had to mean he was most likely to be guilty hamnet didnt know how he knew that but know it he did ix the bizogots and raumsdalians rode through the fertile farmland that had been the bed of hevring lake till its ice dam melted through and spilled its waters over the scabrous badlands farther west hamnet thyssen sighed i dont know if i want to see sacked nidaros or not he said sigvats the one who ought to see it ulric skakki said we ought to rub his nose in it so he gets some idea of how many mistakes he made and how big they were count hamnet laughed at him sigvats more likely to get pregnant than to get an idea that hurts too much to be funny ulric said but he laughed anyhow things dont look so bad here trasamund remarked a few houses and barns had been burned hamnet supposed those were places where the locals showed fight against the rulers he didnt see much in the way of livestock either raumsdalians had escaped with their horses and cattle and sheep or the invaders had stolen or slaughtered them but grain still ripened in the fields hardly any fruit trees had been cut down trasamund might not be the best judge of what the raumsdalian countryside was supposed to look like but he didnt sound like a crazy man either local farmers the ones who still survived had learned their lesson as soon as they saw armed men in the distance they fled they didnt wait around to find out whose side the warriors were on as far as they were concerned no warriors were on their side hamnet would have had a demon of a time persuading them they were wrong you got rich you got fat you got lazy marcovefa sounded like a judge passing sentence you bizogots you raumsdalians fat and lazy us rich trasamund said honh not likely but his bluster lacked its usual passionate conviction hed seen what things were like up on top of the glacier and in the mountain refuges that stuck up above the ice by marcovefas standards even the poorest bizogots on the frozen steppe were rich beyond the dreams of avarice how much of nidaros is left do you think audun gilli said can we go around the place or do we need to go through some small part of hamnet did want to see the capital in ruins nidaros was sigvats city and gudrids not his back when he was living in his own castle down in the southeast he wouldnt have minded if something horrible happened to the place so hed told himself then anyhow as hed found before in other ways getting what you thought you wanted didnt always make you happy hamnet wondered if anything would ever make him happy his former wife and the emperor groveling at his feet a slow sour smile crossed his face like sunshine briefly breaking through on a drizzly day he might not win lasting happiness from that but it would do for a little while well audun persisted do we have to go through nidaros well decide when we get closer hamnet said well see how things are around the placethatll tell us whether we need to go in the wizard nodded all right good enough its not as if ive got family there to worry about his mouth twisted hamnet remembered that he himself wasnt the only one to know hard times audun had lost house and wife and children in a fire and spent years after that drinking so he didnt have to think about it per anders pointed ahead is that serai still open or did the rulers sack it no smoke from the chimney ulric skakki said thats never a good sign sure enough the serai was deserted the stench of death lingered in the taproom a corpse mostly skeletal lay behind the bar looks like were on our own for supper and drinks hamnet observed does kind of doesnt it ulric said unless this poor bugger died of old age waiting to get served ive known a few serais like that so have ibut this isnt one of them hamnet thyssen pointed to the skull it bore a dreadful wound most likely from an axe but perhaps from a sword the fellow whod owned itthe tapmandidnt die of starvation yes thats a splitting headache all right ulric agreed then he stooped and lifted a couple of stoppered jars the mans corpse had partly covered and the rulers really are a pack of barbarians from the back of beyond they dont even know how to do a proper job of plundering he scraped away at the pitch sealing one stopper with the tip of his dagger once he could wiggle the stopper he worked it free with the dagger and his thumb and forefinger what have you got audun gilli sounded more than a little interested ulric sniffed then swigged yes thats mead all right pretty good mead too he swigged again as if to make certain audun also looked more than a little interested he looked thirsty as a matter of fact ulric passed him the jar he drank then drank some more then drank some more after that and finally delivered his verdict youre right that is pretty good mead he took another swig just to make sure or just because he wanted to save some for the rest of us ulric said snatching the jar back you might want to be able to walk when youre done too hamnet said mmi might by the way audun gilli said it he wasnt even close to sure hed care about walking let me try some of that trasamund said looking resigned ulric skakki gave him the jar the bizogot raised it to his lips his larynx worked he made at least as big a dent in the mead as audun had when he finally lowered the jar he nodded not bad at all do i get to try it too hamnet thyssen asked pointedly if theres any left trasamund shook the jar and listened to the slosh inside still some anyhow he held it out to hamnet the raumsdalian noble shook it too and hefted it not bloody much youre a pig your ferocityand so are you gilli he drank the mead was as advertisedand there wasnt bloody much of it he drained the jar youve called me plenty worse than that audun said count hamnet threw the jar down on the floor not quite at the wizards feet it smashed even though the floor was only rammed earth audun gilli sidestepped smartly to dodge one flying sherd you deserved what i called you and more besides hamnet said in the flat voice of formal hostility weve been round this barn beforetoo often ulric skakki worked at the stopper on the other jar we dont need to hear it all again he sniffed besides this ones wine he thrust it at count hamnet hereyou go first bribing me are you hamnet said the adventurer gave back a bland smile and a nod instead of making something of it hamnet drank sweet and strong the wine ran down his throat he took his fair share or a little more then lowered the jar pretty good wine he reported deadpan you give me that trasamund started to snatch the jar out of his hands so did ulric they glared at each other they didnt quite square off but they left the feeling that they would if somebody didnt do something in the next few heartbeats hamnet did something he gave audun gilli the jar trasamund and ulric both glared at him audun looked astonished count hamnet was astonished at himself this was the first time hed done anything for audun since the wizard took liv away from him he hadnt meant to all hed meant to do was annoy ulric and trasamund well hed managed that audun wasted no time before sampling the wine as trasamunds had not long before his larynx bobbed up and down not bad at all he allowed after reluctantly lowering the jar ulric grabbed faster than trasamund he drank and made as if to go on drinking trasamund growled deep in his throat like a lion warning a dire wolf it had better clear off from a carcass ulric was not a man to be intimidated like that but he was a man who would share when he felt like it he passed trasamund the wine jar a bare instant before the jarl would have stolen it from him and perhaps started a real fight ahh trasamund said after his first gulp those grapes died happy by god they probably died when pretty girls squashed them with bare feet ulric skakki said he raised a more or less leering eyebrow worse ways to go i daresay ugly girls squashing you with bare feet for instance trasamund was drinking again and almost choked when he stopped spluttering he said is that really how they smash grapes women stepping on them or are you making it up to fool a bizogot who doesnt know anything about wine except that it tastes good by god your ferocity in the fall there are women with purple toes down in the south where the grapes grow ulric said gravely holding up his hand as if taking an oath they have big wooden vats full of grapes and the women get in there and hike up their skirts and trample out the vintage audun gilli finished for him sometimes the men will do it too but its mostly women he pointed at the wine jar trasamund was holding and murmured a charm the jar grew a face a pretty spoiledlooking face in a squeaky voice it said and you can just quit thinking about looking up my skirt too youyou man you there i am working my feet as purple as your nose and youve got your mind in a cesspit animating such things was auduns favorite magical sport my nose isnt purple trasamund might have been answering a woman not an enchanted jug ulric skakki looked artfully astonished you mean that isnt a plum stuck on to the front of your face like a lot of bizogots trasamund had been down in raumsdalia often enough to know what a plum was his whole face turned red if not purple one day you will talk too bloody much skakki youll be sorry for it when you areyoud best believe you will people keep telling me so the adventurer said it hasnt happened yet though one day im going to get tired of waiting trasamund muttered into his beard whatever he said he didnt say it loud enough to get through the facial shrubbery trading insults with ulric was a losing game he gave worse than he got as count hamnet had seenand discovered painfully for himselffighting ulric was also a losing game which left what loving him maybe hamnet thyssen scowled that also struck him as an unappetizing choice hamnet found himself looking east as he rode across what had been hevring lakes bottomland he saw per anders doing the same thing catching sigvats courier at it made him realize he was doing it too a little sheepishly he said if the rulers sacked nidaros not much point looking for the city smoke rising from it is there per blinked no i guess not he answered also sounding sheepish force of habit i know i was doing the same thing hamnet said and ill probably start doing it six or eight more times till i get it through my thick head that that smoke cursed well wont be there he did too late the next afternoon they came close enough to nidaros to get a good look at what the rulers had done to the raumsdalian capital hamnet could have done without it it was almost as hard on him as seeing gudrids naked corpse would have been and nidaros itself hadnt betrayed him even if important people inside the city had nidaros gray granite walls could have held out every bizogot ever born for a thousand years so raumsdalians said anyhow and hamnet thyssen wasnt inclined to argue with the conventional wisdom there those stout walls had held out the rulers for a little while not for long enough the granite blocks didnt seem to have been overthrown no what happened to them was worse it looked as if theyd been melted back into the lava from which theyd formed stone had flowed and run like hot fat if not quite like water what had happened to the men up on those walls when the granite melted nothing goodcount hamnet was sure of that do we want to go in there trasamund wondered aloud depends ulric answered if only a few people lived through the sack if only a few people are back then we can scrounge as much as we need therell be plenty of food and the like but if a lot of the vultures that walk on two legs are prowling around in there were just wasting our time your choice your ferocity lets go up get a closer look the jarl said then we can figure out whether going in is smart or not thats sensible ulric said but what the demon lets do it anyway trasamund sent him a curious look but didnt try to parse the adventurers comment hamnet did and felt his head start to whirl he gave it up as a bad job somewhere not far from the western wall was the house earl eyvind and gudrid had shared the house that looked out on the hevring bottomland did it still stand had the rulers plundered it if they hadnt was anything about the golden shrine still there or had eyvind torfinn managed to pack up all his assembled knowledge when he fled hamnet remarked on that to ulric should we go there he asked or do you think its a waste of time mm you ask interesting questions and i wish to god you didnt ulric plucked at his beard maybe we ought to see eh its not too deep into the city we cant get into too much trouble heading over therei hope oh we can always get to trouble hamnet thyssen spoke with mournful conviction but will we get into worse trouble going in or staying clear interesting questions like i said ulric skakki didnt make it sound like a compliment by the way he said it count hamnet might have come down with a rareand socially embarrassingdisease after a moments thought the adventurer looked pleased with himself why dont we ask the wizards they can tell us what kind of fools we are i already know that were big fools or we wouldnt be here hamnet said i want to know what we can do about it amounts to the same thing in the end ulric answered cheerfully they did talk to the wizards marcovefa audun gilli and liv put their heads together marcovefa looked up at the sun liv opened her arms wide and spread her fingers wide as if to trap a lot of air so she could smell it audun gilli plucked up a pinch of earth and tasted it after that they put their heads together again hamnet got the notion they were deciding on their verdict was that good bad indifferent audun spoke for all of them you can go in if you want we dont think it will make things any worse will it make them any better ulric skakki inquired a heartbeat before count hamnet could ask the same question audun and liv and marcovefa seemed equally surprised they put their heads together one more time when they broke apart again liv gave the answer for them all we dont know that isnt plain well hamnet asked ulric what do you want to do lets go ulric said im a ghoul at heart i do want to see what nidaros is like after a sack maybe itll give us something new to tell sigvat the only thing i want to tell him is where to head in hamnet said grimly when the rulers chased him out of nidaros he found out where he was heading in by god ulric replied i wont say it didnt serve him right hell say that hamnet predicted nothings ever his fault if you dont believe me just ask him per anders also wanted to go into nidaros to see what had become of it they recruited a squads worth of bizogots to go with them and help keep them safe from whatever happened to be loose in the city if the bizogots did some plundering while they were there hamnet was willing to look the other way ulric seemed more than willing he looked ready to do some plundering of his own they made the final approach to the fallen capital on foot no surly gate guards to persuade that were worthy to go in hamnet remarked i wonder if those whoresons tried asking the rulers their snooty questions ulric said if they did they deserved whatever happened to them listening to them per anders looked pained you men are not proper raumsdalian patriots he said stiffly ulric skakki gave back a raucous laugh you just noticed what are you going to do about it hamnet added im going to wonder why his majesty wants anything to do with the likes of you the courier replied simple hamnet said he needs us we can do something he wants done we can give the rulers a hard timeor he thinks we can and then hell figure out some fancy way to screw us ulric said thats the other thing hes good forputting it to people who ought to be his friends thats not fair per said youre right hamnet thyssen agreed the emperors man looked vindicated till hamnet finished sometimes hes a lot worse than that i wonder if the rulers freed everybody they found in his dungeons not likely ulric said nidaros would look a lot more crowded if they were running around loose nidaros didnt look crowdedit looked all but deserted like any big city it depended on constant deliveries of food from outside for survival when those deliveries stopped the people in the city could do one of two things they could leave or they could starve if most of them leftor diedwhat was left and what modest supplies remained might keep a much smaller population going when hamnet and ulric and their companions strode into the city somebody took a look at them and then dashed around a corner well what does that mean ulric wondered are we too tough to mess with or is he getting reinforcements well find outsoon i expect let them come a bizogot said been a while since i killed anything youre a friendly fellow arent you hamnet said i am by godto my friends the blond barbarian said seriously along with the magic that melted the walls nidaros had seen several fires the wind must have been quiet they hadnt spread very far and they hadnt come together in a firestorm still the sour scent of stale smoke lingered in the air the bizogots grumbledcharred rubble offered scant loot what if this happened to eyvinds house hamnet worried then we go back ulric said then we wasted our time coming in thats all anybody can say we didnt know till we tried if the house is gone we think about what we ought to do next that made sense and what else could anyone say they would know when they got there till they got there they wouldnt if they got there the bizogots hadnt gone more than a few steps into nidaros before they drew their swords and nocked arrows no one had attacked them no one but that one fellow had even shown himself but the air shouted danger hamnet took what he thought was the most direct route and it would have beenif not for the barricade across it something moved behind the barricade feel like a fight ulric asked no hamnet said he waited for the bizogots to say they wanted nothing more they didnt not even the friendly warrior along with the others he shook his big blond head hamnet didnt think they were afraid of whatever robbers had set up the barricade nidarosall the buildings in nidaroswas what intimidated them ulric skakki didnt feel like a fight either good he said lets see if we can slide around instead if i remember how these alleys work he soon proved he knew nidaros far better than count hamnet had ever dreamt of doing why were you following me hamnet asked him why not you were heading in the right direction if we could do it the easy way i didnt mind the adventurer answered since we cant you should have been a burglar i have been a time or three ulric said equably he raised his voice a little keep an eye on the doors you bizogots if we run into trouble itll pop out of them to hamnet alone he added i wouldnt have to say that to raumsdalians theyd know but most of these boys never saw a door before they rode down into the empire not five minutes after he delivered his warning three men leaped into the alley in front of his group two of them carried swords the other had an axe they were skinny and toughand looked horrified like a cougar that suddenly discovered it was facing a sabertooth bowstrings thrummed behind hamnet two arrows hit the axeman one got one of the swordsmen another flew past the second swordsman the bizogot whod loosed it curseda short shot but hed missed it the brigand with the axe crumpled the swordsmen ran back into the building from which theyd emerged one was swift as a weasel the otherthe wounded manhobbled through the door they slammed it behind them that was easy a bizogot said even if kolli cant shoot straight kolli let out an indignant yelp it was easy hamnet agreed but it wouldnt have been if four or five more of those bastards had jumped out behind us too the bizogot was thoughtfully silent ulric went up and prodded the axeman with his boot the robber groaned lost in his own wilderness of pain he wouldnt get up again ulric took his weapon anybody want this he asked you can make a lot of trouble with it two bizogots played a finger game to see who got it are you going to finish him hamnet asked while the winner brandished his new toy no ulric said he wouldnt have done it for me so demons take him if his friends havent run away let them take care of it come on they all strode past the axeman a little to hamnets surprise nobody kicked him or did anything else to make him hurt worse he was dying anyhow so that was only a small mercy hamnet wondered whether the three robbers had friends who would aim to avenge them his hand tightened on the leatherwrapped hilt of his sword but the men seemed to have been on their own he and his comrades passed through another block that had burned the bizogots muttered among themselves theyd seen grass fires before no doubt maybe theyd seen a tent or two burn but as with doors big fires fires that chewed up lots of buildings were new to them since theyd come to raumsdalia they didnt like them well hamnet didnt either and to his sorrow hed seen a lot more of them than they had well look foolish if eyvinds house is nothing but charcoal he said yes well have made ashes of ourselves sure enough ulric agreed count hamnet winced lets go find out maybe per anders didnt notice the atrocious pun maybe he just didnt care if he didnt hamnet admired his detachment earl eyvinds house still stood but the front door hung open hamnet didnt think that was a good sign ulric said dont worry about it can you see some ruler or local thief staggering out of here with his arms full of books he laughed the idea to scorn hamnets hand tightened again on the hilt of his sword i keep thinking that if i go in there the first thing ill do is run into gudrid well you bloody well wont ulric skakki said impatiently she isnt here and good riddance to her or did he say gudriddance count hamnet eyed him but ulrics cheery smile was proof against his scrutiny they went inside the adventurer proved right gudrid wasnt there someone had looted the house hamnet had no idea whether it was the rulers or raumsdalian robbers whoever it was seemed to have done a good thorough job all the rich ornaments that had adorned the place were gone so were most of the paintings and woven wall hangings the rest were slashed or else thrown on the floor and trampled when hamnet thyssen saw them he got a bad feeling about earl eyvinds books and sure enough the scrolls and codices eyvind had spent a lifetime accumulating lay torn and despoiled on the floor of his bedchamber hamnet sadly shook his head knowing how much labor a scribe needed to copy a book sometimes people are no cursed good he growled ulric raised one eyebrow you only noticed just now as a matter of factno hamnet answered is anything here worth salvaging per anders asked sure doesnt look like it ulric started to turn away and head back toward the entrance but count hamnet said wait ulric skakki did this time with both eyebrows high hamnet went on when i knew gudrid shed always have secret hiding places for things theyd be clever ones too places where most people wouldnt think to look somewhere in this house shell have more hideyholes yes but will they hold anything we want ulric asked how do we know ahead of time hamnet replied with a shrug how do we know where to look for these ah hideyholes per anders said do we tear the whole place to pieces a lot of thats taken care of ulric pointed out look at things out of the corner of your eye hamnet said i make no promises but i think its worth trying gudrids sly shes not too smarteven if shed say the same thing about mebut she has her own kind of cleverness he looked around the bedchamber whoeverd ruined eyvind torfinns books had also slashed the featherbed eyvind and gudrid once shared feathers floated in the air as raumsdalians and bizogots stirred them up hamnet didnt think gudrid would have secreted anything inside the mattresstoo easy too obvious the bedframe on the other hand which side would she have slept on the right if shed kept the same arrangement shed had with him he poked and prodded at the bedposts on that side and rapped them with his knuckles by god thats as hollow as sigvats head ulric exclaimed when the sound suddenly changed per anders let out an irate cough both ulric and hamnet ignored him it is isnt it hamnet said per coughed again hamnet went right on ignoring him gudrid doubtless had some tricky spring or catch set into the post hamnet felt for it but couldnt find it here let me try ulric said ive had practice getting into places where i dont belong his hands were smaller and slimmer than hamnet thyssens by the way they prodded the bedpost they were also much more knowledgeable well hed said he was practiced at the burglars trade something clicked ha ulric said he reached for the top of the bedpost again this time the top three inches or so came off in his hand ha he said again he reached into the hollow and pulled out a rolled sheet of parchment well well what have we here open it per anders said ulric did he read a little of it then grimaced and shook his head letter from an old lover he said hamnet only shrugged why am i not surprised he went over to the other side of the bed stirring up more feathers as he did and started rapping at the bedposts there one sneeze later he found another hollow come here ulric does this one work the same way if it doesnt she had to pay extrayou can count on that ulric felt the bedpost he nodded uhhuh now we do this and a click rewarded him there you go whats in it per anders sounded intrigued in spite of himself dont know yet ulric turned to hamnet want to do the honors this time plainly he expected hamnet to say no because that was so plain hamnet nodded and said all right ulric had already started to reach into the concealed hollow he drew back and bowed to hamnet as if to say it was all his now that hamnet had the honor he wondered if he wanted it it would be just like gudrid to put something sharp and perhaps poisoned in a hole like this to surprise any stranger who chanced on it but having asked for the privilege he couldnt very well change his mind hed already noticed that his hand was bigger than ulrics he had to squeeze it painfully tight to reach down into the hollowedout bedpost gudrid wouldnt have had any trouble herehe was sure of that just when he started to think this hollowedout space was empty his fingertips grazed something at the bottom he did some more twisting and managed to get it between his index and middle fingers it wasnt a parchment it felt hard and cool and metallic count hamnet drew it up what have you got ulric asked i dont know yet its jewelry hamnet could hardly hide his disappointment he held the thing in the palm of his hand a small gold replica of a building with a domed roof do you recognize it not me ulric skakki replied its not modeled after any place in nidarosid lay money on that what about you per every seen any real building like it no the courier said if i had to guess id say it came straight out of a jewelers imagination seems likely hamnet agreed the piece included a loop through which a chain might go he imagined it nestling between gudrids breasts hed never seen it there he was sure he would have remembered it if he had but how much did that mean anything shall we look for more of these hiding places per asked or do we see they have nothing important in them ulric looked at hamnet thyssen hamnet shrugged he wanted to throw the little gold model away instead he dropped it back into the hideyhole lets get out of here he waited till all the bizogots tramped out of the bedchamber before leaving himself he made it plain he was waiting too so none of them could steal the bauble that earned him a few hard looks had the piece been bigger he might have had a fight on his handsor he might have chosen differently youre a dangerous fellow ulric remarked as they left eyvind torfinns house gold doesnt tempt you gold that had anything to do with gudrid doesnt hamnet answered let it go lets get out of nidaros in one piece anything besides that is a bonus the adventurer grunted well youre bound to be right well have to slide around that barricade again and wed better pick a new way to do it too or those lovely fellows we ran into before will try to make us pay pick your route hamnet said i wont quarrel with you whatever it is i want to get away from herethats all i know what you mean ulric said i can fell the gooses footsteps on my grave too as a matter of fact that wasnt what hamnet thyssen meant he kept rubbing the palm of his hand against his trouser leg as he followed ulric through the maze of alleys that zigzagged between the main streets ulric never seemed to have any doubts about where he was going hamnet did more than once but ulric proved right in the end no one troubled them while they made their getaway maybe god watches over us per anders said in glad surprise as they trotted out through the open gates maybe hamnet and ulric said together neither man sounded as if he believed it well trasamund asked when they got back to the bizogots encampment wasted trip im afraid ulric said count hamnet nodded marcovefa looked sharply at hamnet you had something she said it wasnt a question a trinket of gudrids he said nothing important you think not what do you want me to do he asked irritably go back and get it for you for a moment he thought she would say yes he thought in fact she would insist on coming with him but then she hesitated and finally shook her head no no point she said at last the bone comes from the beast but the bone is not the beast what does that mean hamnet asked she didnt answer x the rulers rode along as if they hadnt a care in the world there were two or three dozen of themmost on the deer that must have come down from beyond the glacier a few riding horses they didnt disdain what they found the bizogots and raumsdalians using a war mammoth led the troop lets go get em trasamund said nobody told him no his force far outnumbered the invaders by the way the rulers paraded along south of nidaros they expected no enemies in this part of the empire as in so much of life what they expected and what they got were two different things their heads twisted toward the oncoming foes in what couldnt be anything but horror despite that none of them made as if to flee maybe they knew it would do them no good since riding deer couldnt outrun horses or maybe running never crossed their minds as hamnet thyssen had seen more often than he cared to remember the rulers were formidable they formed a battle line riding deer on the wings horses near the center and the war mammoth anchoring the whole thing and then one man on a deer rode out in front of the line the fringes and animal tails and sparkling crystals adorning his costume declared what he was a shaman well well ulric skakki said no wonder they think they can take us no wonder at all hamnet said but this bastard never ran into marcovefa he glanced over to her she probably didnt notice him her eyes were on the enemy sorcerer a lion doubtless eyed a fat sheep the same way this fellow in his fancy clothes didnt know he was a fat sheep but he was about to find out with a harsh shoutor maybe it just seemed so to hamnets ears since he knew little of their languagethe rulers rode forward their shaman still held the lead they started to shoot when they were still well out of range or so hamnet would have thought but their arrows landed among the bizogots and raumsdalians a raumsdalian soldier whod joined trasamunds band clutched at his throat and slid from the saddle when trasamunds men answered the enemy archery their shafts did fall short the rulers wizard held up his hand as if defying not only arrows but the whole world then a redshouldered hawk perched on that outstretched hand its talons closed onand inthe wizards flesh somehow his screech of pain resounded over the battlefield he beat at the hawk with his free hand its hooked beak nipped his fingers it pecked at his face marcovefa laughed with the shaman distracted archery went back to normal the bizogots and raumsdalians were well within range of the rulers now men and beasts on both sides began to fall the mammoth trumpeted in anger and distress when an arrow pierced its sensitive trunk the rulers on the great beasts back managed to keep it under control though it was well trainedand they were experienced and their shaman proved not the worst of wizards either even though he was bleeding he managed to make the redshouldered hawk fly off a moment later lightning crashed down out of a clear blue sky not far from marcovefas horse the beast snorted and reared at the thunderclap hamnet hoped she could stay onshe was anything but an experienced rider she managedawkwardly but no equestrian judges stood around doling out style points as the horse came down on all fours marcovefa laughed again count hamnet wondered why then he realized that lightning bolt was intended to blast her black and smoking and that shed successfully turned the stroke sorcerous judges would have given her as many points as the rules allowed the rulers shaman realized the same thing at about the same time as hamnet he threw up his bloodsplashed hands in what had to be despair hed done everything he knew how to doand it didnt work what could he do now but wait for marcovefas revenge hamnet nocked an arrow drew the bowstring back to his ear and let fly the string lashed the leather brace on the inside of his wrist the shaft caught the shaman in the chest right between two glittering chunks of crystal the man threw up his hands once more he slumped down against the riding deers neck i would have given him worse than that marcovefa called hes dying whats worse than that hamnet asked marcovefas feral smile suggested that she knew several answers count hamnet was just as glad he didnt know any of them he didnt have time to worry about them either without the shaman to protect the rulers ordinary fighting men they didnt last long few of them even tried to surrender they sold their lives as dearly as they could hamnet had seen the invaders behave that way more often than not say what you would about the rulers they didnt lack for courage the warriors on mammothback charged again and again but the bizogots and raumsdalians simply rode out of their way and kept shooting arrows at them from the sides and rear after a while the last enemy soldier slumped down on the mammoths back either dead or too badly hurt to go on fighting the mammoth itself must have been almost mad from pain it had nearly as many arrows sticking out of its hide as a porcupine had quills i feel sorry for the poor thing ulric skakki said as the mammoth lumbered off toward the south not its fault the people who trained it are a pack of dire wolves who walk on two legs maybe not hamnet said but if my neighbor has a dog that tries to bite me im going to kill it before it can we ought to kill that mammothput it out of its misery ulric said go ahead count hamnet told him the adventurer gave back a reproachful look you want it dead marcovefa said before either ulric or hamnet could answer she pointed at the mammoth and chanted something in her peculiar dialect the huge beast walked along for another couple of strides then it fell over its sides heaved only once or twice before they stilled it was without a doubt dead good god hamnet said how did you do that i puthow do you say ita clog in its heart marcovefa answered nothing can live with that not vole not fox not man not mammoth it is a very easy spell to make can be countered but easy to make hamnet thyssen looked at her you can kill anyone you want whenever you want she shook her head no no no spell takes some timeyou saw that and i have to see the manor the animalto use it and it can be countered even one of your puny amulets will stop it most of the time i didnt know if the rulers warded their mammoths that way they didnt ward this mammoth shall we butcher it plenty of meat some of the bizogots were already riding over to do just that hamnet wasnt wild about mammoth meat it was tough and gamy but it was meat and it was there he had a little sausage and some hard bread in his belt pouch a bellyful of meateven tough gamy meatdidnt sound bad at all and it didnt turn out bad at all he ate and ate you can stuff yourself like a bizogot by god trasamund said admiringly ive got used to going without hamnet answered when theres plenty i make the most of it here a bizogot used a hatchet to split a bone that had been lying in the fire want some marrow i wont say no hamnet scooped some out with a chunk of meat so he wouldnt burn his fingers the marrow tasted stronger than any that came from cows or sheep or pigs or horses but it was good he suspected even teratorn marrow would be good though he hoped he never got desperate enough to find out let me have a bit of that ulric skakki didnt worry about whether the marrow was hot he reached in grabbed what he wanted and stuffed it into his mouth maybe his fingers and palm were even more callused than hamnets maybe he was just hungrier marcovefa sighed and patted her stomach up on the glacier we dont have feasts like this unless she broke off with a sly smile seems a shame to waste the warriors but when you have game this big i suppose i can see why you dont bother with them you eat people per anders didnt know what things were like up on top of the glacier not really peoplenever anybody from my clan and those are the only true people the shaman answered she smacked her lips but twolegged meat once you cook it well is the best there is better than mammoth better than mutton better than duck better than anything per glanced toward count hamnet was he slightly green or was it only hamnets imagination you can tell her to stop teasing me now he said no matter how she goes on i wont believe her youd better hamnet answered she means it dont you start per anders was determined not to believe by god anders im not joking hamnet said ulric and trasamund nodded to show hamnet meant it hamnet went on they dont waste anything up there anything at all they cant afford to and that includes waste the meat that comes off an enemys carcass per anders looked from one of them to the next he must have decided they werent joking because he got up shaking his head and walked away from them hamnet thyssen let out a sour chuckle see how we win friends wherever we go he said he is a foolish man marcovefa said no hes just a man whos never been up on top of the glacier hamnet said a lucky man in other words ulric skakki put in marcovefa sent him a dirty look i never knew we were poor i never knew we were missing so many things you do not miss what you never had she licked her lips but i do miss mans flesh i had that up there but it would turn your stomachs if i ate it here youre rightit would the adventurer agreed ive eaten a lot of nasty things in my time you cant believe some of the things youll try if you get hungry enough i never did turn cannibal though i havent got a lot to be proud of but thats something by god pooh marcovefa said you dont know what youre talking about mans flesh isnt nasty mans flesh is good like i say the best meat there is well youre welcome to my bodybut only after im done using it ulric skakki said youve already got my body but not for stewing i hope count hamnet added marcovefa thought that was funny after a moment so did hamnet winning a skirmish made everything look better they pushed south picking up more raumsdalians who wanted to fight the rulers some of the men from armies the invaders had shattered had gone home others had turned bandit still others seemed willing to try again as long as they had someone to lead them against the enemy our own officers ran away one man angrily told hamnet what the demon good are they if they wont stand and fight they didnt all run away a new recruit said but most of the ones who did fight got killed he paused then admitted watching them get killed set some of the others running count hamnet made a grinding noise deep in his chest i sometimes wonder whether raumsdalia deserves to live who do you suppose appointed the officers ulric answered his own question sigvat did thats who and what did sigvat do when the rulers got to nidaros he ran away thats what its no wonder the officers take after their master the new recruits stared at him if one of our captains heard you say something like that hed horse whip you said the soldier whod complained that the officers had run he might think so ulric said lightly oh hed do it all right hed the soldier seemed to take his first good look at the adventurer he paused then changed course well maybe not he was mighty fond of his own skin a sensible fellow ulric said of course if we were all that fond of our own skins nobody would ever hurt anybody else for fear of what would happen to him but it doesnt work that way worse luck weve both got the scars to prove it hamnet said and ulric nodded hamnet went on better to dish them out than to wait while they heal up though ulric skakki nodded again so did the raumsdalian soldiers rejoining the fight and so did trasamund always better to give than to receive he said and reached over his shoulder to touch the hilt of his twohanded sword i have a question hamnet said everybody looked at him he asked it how long before the rulers figure out theyve got trouble behind them as well as in front of them what do they do once they realize it thats two questions ulric pointed out if youve got two answers ill listen to them count hamnet said ulric made as if to turn out his pockets and go through his belt pouches hamnet thyssen waited he knew the adventurer was trying to annoy him and would win a point if he succeeded when hamnet just stood there ulric said my guess is it wont be long and when they do realize it theyll turn on us its not like theyve got any reason to be afraid of sigvat too right it isnt hamnet said and thats about what i was thinking too weve better be ready for the worst they can do to us why are you telling me you need to talk to your lady love ulric said without her the best we can hope for is to hightail it off to some place where the rulers wont come for a while not so bad as that but trasamund didnt sound as if he believed it himself we usually say things wont be so bad when we bump up against the rulers ulric said and they usually arent theyre usually worse trasamund had brightened till he finished then the jarl glowered at him curse it why cant you leave that part out because im trying to tell the truth ulric suggested i know bizogots dont always understand the word what do you mean trasamund said indignantly oh you know its true as well as i do ulric sounded impatient to say nothing of tired what gets you people through the winters up there except lies swapped back and forth dont tell me any different either i know better anyone whos passed a winter up on the plains knows better those are just for the sport of it nobody believes them nobody expects to believe them trasamund said when we need to tell the truth we can do it as well as anybody else ive heard plenty of raumsdalian liars too he fixed ulric with a significant stare who me the adventurer said if you can prove anything ive ever said is a lie go ahead and do it how am i supposed to you talk about places nobody else has ever been to youre the only one who knows if theres any truth in you at all hamnets been to some of those places ulric said he knows whether im telling the truth or not thus prodded hamnet said ive told you before trasamund ulric hasnt lied about any places where ive been anyhow i would have let youand himknow about it if he had huh trasamund didnt want to believe him either but he talks about places youve never seen too thyssen as far as anybody knows hes making all that up as he goes along i dont think so and ill tell you why count hamnet said trasamund could have looked no more dubious had he practiced in front of a mirror ignoring his expression hamnet went on heres why when we went up onto the glacier ulric could talk with the people we met there how because hed run into bizogots who spoke a dialect like theirs way over by the western mountains he didnt talk about that before we went up onto the glacier trasamund protested no but hed done it hes done some things you havent done your ferocity and seen some things you havent seen and you might as well get used to it hamnet said oh dont tell him that ulric said now ill be able to lie as much as i please and hell have to swallow all of it wheres the challenge in that wheres the sport making somebody believe a really juicy lie shouldnt be easy you should have to work at it count hamnet exhaled through his nose youre not helping you know how about that ulric said cheerfully anybody would think i was trying to be difficult or something anybody would think you were trying to be skakki trasamund said ulric bowed as if at a compliment trasamund threw his hands in the air marcovefa kept looking back over her left shoulder so often that hamnet asked did you get a crick in your neck when you slept last night no she shook her head i keep looking to find the way north he pointed out the obvious were riding south not always marcovefa said what does that mean what do you sense hamnet asked one day we will ride north again we will need to know the way marcovefa sounded like most of the shamans and wizards hamnet had known she obviously knew what she meant and she just as obviously had trouble telling him or maybe she simply didnt want to he tried his best to make sense of it when will we ride north again how far north will we ride back to nidaros back to the woods back to the bizogot steppe back to the golden shrine marcovefa answered that told him both more and less than he wanted to know where is the golden shrine how will we find it it is where it is we will find it when we need to find it marcovefa shook her head again we will find it when it wants to be found she looked back over her shoulder once more as if she expected it to spring up from the wheatfield theyd just passed a field that might never be harvested youre not helping count hamnet complained as he had with ulric i am giving you the best answer i can marcovefa said it is true do you want me to lie instead it may be true but it doesnt tell me anything hamnet complained marcovefa shrugged before i came down from the glacier if i asked you where nidaros was what could you have told me you would have said it is far to the south if you talked about the bizogot steppe or the forest or the badlands where hevring lake spilled out what would they have meant nothing less than nothing i did not know what any of those things were count hamnet thought about that slowly he asked are you telling me im still up on the glacier as far as the golden shrine is concerned yes i tell you that marcovefa looked pleased that hed understood so well when you need to know you will know till you need to know you dont need to worry about it she might have been pleased but hamnet wasnt you make it sound like im a little child when it comes to the golden shrine we are all little children now marcovefa spoke with what sounded like exaggerated patience she paused maybe your eyvind torfinn is a big child he know more about the golden shrine than most people but no one is more than a big child how could it be otherwise for now the golden shrine is hidden who has seen it to say what it is like have you you know i havent hamnet thyssen answered angrily you might be surprised but all right then neither have i neither has anybody so what is the point of getting all upset we need the golden shrine hamnet said wont it help us against the rulers can we beat them without it we can do whatever we have to do marcovefa was nothing if not evasive more slowly than he might have hamnet realized she was being evasive on purpose youre not telling me everything you know you are not a shaman i am telling you everything you can grasp marcovefa opened and closed her hands i am telling you everything i can grasp too i know more than i understand does that make any sense to you no count hamnet said a moment later he amended that maybe hed known something was wrong between gudrid and him before he understood what it was he didnt like to think of the golden shrine in those terms it was supposed to be good and pure and holy gudrid wasnt you worry too much marcovefa said seriously hamnet thyssen burst out laughing now tell me something i didnt know he exclaimed you should not do this the shaman from atop the glacier made not doing it sound easy as could be he bowed to her how do you propose that i stop wait till we camp tonight she answered i will stop you from worryingfor a while anyway that gave him something to look forward to he would have looked forward to it even more if marcovefa hadnt kept on glancing north she always peered over her left shouldernever over her right maybe that meant something sorcerous maybe it was just her habit and hed never noticed it before now he shrugged he was too proudand too stubbornto ask and when they did camp she kept her promise with an eager ferocity he did his best to match sure enough making love did stop him from worrying for a while anyway you couldnt worry when the world exploded in joy afterwards though afterwards was a different story but hamnet didnt worry long sleep claimed him before his thoughts could get all knotted up even as his eyelids sagged shut he sent marcovefa a suspicious glance he wasnt usually one to start snoring right after love not usually maybebut tonight he was he woke before daybreak the next morning marcovefa lay beside him snoring softly he smiledand waited for all his worries to come flooding back they didnt though his mind felt washed clean almost as if hed got over a fever that left him out of his head for a while was that magic or only a prolonged afterglow was there a difference when she woke up he tried to ask her she didnt want to listen to him do what you need to do today whatever it turns out to be she said yesterday is gone you cant bring it back you cant change it so what difference does it make tell me that i remember it hamnet said stubbornly if not for the skirmish yesterday morning we wouldnt be eating venison for breakfast today you never know but marcovefa smiled i wish you could see this country the way it ought to be hamnet said here south of nidaros this is the heart of the empire but nothing is the same because of the cursed war marcovefa shrugged it is what it is thats all every bit of it even the worst is better than the mountaintop where my clan lives she blinked i wonder what will happen when the glacier melts back and the mountain is part of the rest of the world again not in my lifetime but not so long either no not so long hamnet agreed if it wasnt in his lifetime though he had trouble worrying about it he looked south i hope your clan doesnt come down into a world the rulers are running rulers wouldnt run it once my clan got through with them marcovefa said count hamnet feared she was an optimist but maybe she knew what she was talking about her clansfolk were formidable people they had to be to survive at all up on the glacier in easier circumstances they and the other small thinly scattered clans up there might give anybody a run for his money come on trasamund said when they emerged from their tent we just beat one bunch of those buggers lets ride south and find more of themlots more nobody told him no no nobody told trasamund no still as the raumsdalians and bizogots rode away from their camp ulric skakki brought his horse up alongside hamnets and said sometimes god gives you what you ask forjust to show you youre a fool to ask for it how many more of the rulers do you really want to run into good question hamnet admitted how do you propose to drive them out of the empire if we dont run into them though well thats a good question too ulric said were liable to run into too many of them all at oncethats what bothers me they really have swarmed down here havent they raumsdalias a big tasty dog and it draws plenty of fleas the rulers are worse than fleas hamnet thyssen said and of course this country is better than the land farther north even the bizogots like it better here than up on their steppewell most of them do anyway bread beer fruit ulric said oh theyve got a few berries up there but thats about it smetyn doesnt match beerto say nothing of wine and without bread he shook his head as if to say civilized life was impossible he wasnt so far wrong either a large black plume of smoke rising in the southeast marked some sort of struggle pointing toward it trasamund said we ought to see what that is hes been eating meat again ulric skakki said sadly mammoth meat and venison count hamnet agreed so have you why doesnt it turn you all bloodthirsty because ive got more sense than that ulric suggested that was more polite than saying because im not a bizogot barbarian off the frozen steppe but it amounted to the same thing he didnt have more sense than to keep from following the jarl as trasamund rode toward the pillar of smoke neither did hamnet thyssen the raumsdalian noble caught marcovefas eye are you ready for more trouble he asked her as much as these rulers can give she answered by the way she said it she didnt think that would be much shed beaten their wizards again and again on this side of the gap she was the only one who had hamnet thought about the lands on the far side of the gap the country the rulers roamed was nothing specialit reminded him of the bizogots territory somewhere over there though would be better land land like raumsdalia and the realms to the south what kind of people lived on it and what kind of wizards did they have there if they could keep the rulers penned up on those cold and nearly useless plains that was a worrisome thought it was also a thought he didnt have time for now he could see what was burning a village just too small to be a walled town most of the black greasy smoke poured from one building an oil store house hamnet wondered he didnt have time to worry about that either the rulers were still sacking the village they were killing the men who fought backand some of the ones who didntand amusing themselves with the women atrocities didnt seem to change much from one side of the glacier to the other the rulers might have laughed when they saw the raumsdalians and bizogots riding toward them more easy enemies to get rid of they must have thought a man came out on a riding deer to face the oncoming foes alone he was either a wizard or a maniac hamnet knew which way he would have bet when the wizard pointed at the incoming arrows they fell out of the sky then all at once they didnt any more one of them just missed puncturing the enemy shaman every line of his body shouted astonishment he pointed again as if to say listen when i tell you something but the arrows thanks to marcovefa didnt listen one of them grazed the rulers riding deer the animal bucked hamnet was sure he would have done the same thing he was also sure he would have been ready for it it caught the ruler by surprise though next thing he knew he was sitting on the ground with raumsdalians and bizogots thundering toward him on horse back he pointed at a lancer and the raumsdalians spearpoint missed him the next attackers sword bit the wizard let out a shrill shriek that seemed to hold more indignation than pain how could this be happening to him werent such torments reserved for folk of the herd evidently they had been up till now no longer once the first swordstroke went home the rulers magic seemed to melt away like snow in springtime by the time the army swept past him and into the village he wasnt good to look at any more the rulers in the village cried out too in surprise and dismay their wizard hadnt been used to seeing his magic fail they werent used to going unprotected against their enemies magic but marcovefa filled them with terror they couldnt even fight back with their usual dogged courage they ran pellmell throwing aside their swords to flee the faster killing them as they ran didnt seem sporting to hamnet thyssen then he remembered the battle in the woods the year before when a glancing blow from a slingstone put marcovefa out of action the rulers had used a spell much like this against the raumsdalian army hamnet led they hadnt been embarrassed to terrify their foes or to slay them even though they couldnt fight back marcovefa had held that spell at bay till she got knocked cold was sending it back at the rulers now a measure of revenge if it was hamnet hoped she found it sweet not all the raumsdalians had been panicked by the rulers magic so now a few of the enemy fought back in spite of marcovefas spell hamnet got a stinging cut on the back of his hand from one stubborn warrior the man lay sprawled in death on the grassmuch good his courage did him the last thing the villagers had expected was to be delivered from their tormentors they cheered and capered at the same time as they mourned some of the women seemed eager to give their rescuers what the rulers would have taken by force nine months from now some of the babies would probably have the fair hair and light eyes that marked the bizogots and their byblows now this is a welcome trasamund said as he disappeared with a buxom brunette ill give her something to remember me by ulric skakki raised an eyebrow and well hope she doesnt give him something to remember her by he mimed scratching furiously at an intimate place you take a chance whenever you lie down with a woman count hamnet paused considering and i suppose she takes a chances whenever she lies down with you of course she does ulric mimed a bulging belly this time well yes that too but it isnt what i meant hamnet hesitated again wondering exactly what he did mean slowly he went on you can wound a lover in ways you cant wound somebody who isnt you take a chance that youll get hurt or that youll hurt the other person life is full of chances so you betand sometimes you lose ulric said if you dont bet at all no one notices when you die because you were hardly alive to begin with hamnet thyssen grunted hed gone years not bettingnot betting his heart anyway hed risked his life again and again with a hole in the center of it the chance of losing it hardly seemed to matter at last he fell in love again and then he fell on his face again women are strange creatures you cant live with them but you cant live without them either he said do you suppose they say the same thing about us why are you asking me ulric skakki returned people have called me a lot of different things but i dont think anybody ever said i had to squat to piss thank you hamnet said the adventurer raised a questioning eyebrow hamnet explained if i ever needed a cure for romantic thoughts you just gave it to me we aim to please ulric said loftily and you dont need a cure you just need better aim yourself sometimes that gave hamnet something new to chew on xi a raumsdalian scout galloped back toward hamnet thyssen mammoths he shouted stacks of mammoths hamnet tried to imagine mammoths piled one atop another he felt himself failing which was bound to be just as well how far are they he asked do the rulers know were here are they heading this way the scout pointed south over his shoulder not very far he said as he reined in his blowing horse not far enough by god when you get to the top of the next little swell of ground youll see em yourself they didnt spot meor i hope like anything they didnt anyhowbut they were coming toward us like they mean business and i bet they do how the demon do we stop em marcovefa count hamnet called did you hear what he said i heard she answered what do you want me to do about it narfi asked a good question how the demon do we stop them hamnet said will the spell you used against the war mammoth in the last fight work again can you use it over and over till all the rulers mammoths fall down dead if nothing wards them it will work marcovefa seldom lacked for confidence i can use it again and again if they have stacks of mammoths i cannot kill them all though i get too tired it is like screwingsometimes all you can do is all you can do heh hamnet said uneasily only marcovefa would have connected lovemaking and murderous magic it never would have occurred to him anyway in his mind the two amounted to the same thing regardless of whether or not they really were form line of battle he yelled the rulers are heading this way with mammoths marcovefa will take care of them for us i hope he added but only to himself well finish off the buggers on riding deer or horses or rabbits rabbits ulric skakki said stringing his bow you never can tell hamnet answered he pointed south himself there are the ones on mammoths those war mammoths might not have come in a stack but they surely came in a swarm hamnet thyssen wasnt sure hed ever seen so many of them all in a line several rulers sat atop each one the man who guided it a lancer with a long spear and anywhere from one to three archers they shouted when they spied the raumsdalians and bizogots ahead of them any time youre ready count hamnet told marcovefa in lieu of shrieking for gods sake do something about them her crooked grin said she had a good notion of what he wasnt saying he was embarrassed but only a little he couldnt work up a whole lot of shame over fearing war mammoths who in their right mind didnt marcovefa didnt her grin got wider more mammoth meat than we can eat plenty for big birds big foxes she promised hamnet couldnt see dire wolves as big foxes but she did she pointed her right forefinger at the closest war mammoth and chanted the little tune in her own dialect hamnet thyssen waited for the war mammoth to drop dead he waited and he waited and he waited some more and nothing happened marcovefa stared at her index finger with the indignant reproach a man might give his bow if the string snapped when he needed it most she aimed again she chanted again hamnet waited again nothing happened againor possibly nothing still happened um i dont mean to fuss or anything but if shes going to do something she ought to do it pretty soon ulric said it doesnt look like the magics going to work today hamnet told him well well isnt that interesting ulric replied between the two of them theyd given themselves perhaps the most casual death sentence in the history of the world do you know whats wrong count hamnet asked as marcovefa sent her forefinger another black look they are warded they must be warded by the way she said it she might have accused the rulers of gambling with loaded dice still scowling at her finger she went on i did not think the rulers would figure out what i did so fast some of them must have got away after you killed that one mammoth hamnet said and she nodded bleakly he asked if you cant kill this lot what can we do to them fight them they are still flesh but marcovefa couldnt help adding they are a whole great glacier of flesh count hamnet would have called them a mountain of flesh but it amounted to the same thing either way trouble deadly trouble why arent the miserable things dying trasamund demanded that was a good question if the mammoths didnt start dying the bizogots and raumsdalians would technical difficulties count hamnet answered that being easier than admitting marcovefa wasnt up to murdering mammoths at the moment trasamund might have been a barbarian from the frozen steppe but he wasnt a stupid barbarian he understood what hamnet meant when hamnet didnt say it she cant do em in eh not right now doesnt seem that way anyhow hamnet replied so what do we do about them then the jarl inquired fight them what else can we do another answer did suggest itself to hamnet thyssen but if he screamed run awayeven more to the point if he matched action to wordhe wouldnt win trasamunds respect in fact hed throw away as much of it as he already had fight them right the bizogot said tightly his folk had tried that against the rulers time after time up on their home terrain theyd lost time after time too trasamunds three tusk clan was a shattered wreck although hed been coming back from the empire when the invaders swept down through the gap and beat its warriors oh come on ulric skakki sounded absurdly cheerful itll be as simple as a bizogot in a dice game youll answer for that skakki trasamund said as soon as weve walloped these scuts youll answer to me looking forward to it ulric still sounded happier than he might have count hamnet turned to marcovefa all rightyou cant work the spell you would have wanted to can you do anything else to keep the mammoths from trampling all of us again he didnt say by god youd better be able to he didnt say it no but he thought it very loudly he must have thought it loudly enough for marcovefa to pick it up or maybe his face gave him away she smiled and said everything will be all right but even she didnt sound sure of that for she went on they have better warding than usual for thembeasts and men wonderful hamnet said betterwarded mammoths than usual and more mammoths than usual too put them together and you hadwhat a disaster was the first thing that occurred to him one of the raumsdalians whod joined his band must have come to the same conclusion with a wail of despair the man wheeled his horse and fled long before the rulers drew close enough to harm him somebody ought to slaughter the worthless coward trasamund growled hes not worth wasting an arrow on ulric replied trasamund looked disgusted you only say that because hes one of your folk no sooner were the words out of his mouth than a bizogot galloped away just as fast as the raumsdalian had a moment earlier hes not worth wasting an arrow on either ulric skakki observed i thank god he is no man of my clan bad enough he is any kind of bizogot trasamund still lookedand soundedrevolted hamnet thyssen wondered why if marcovefa couldnt stop the rulers mammoths what would keep the invaders from rolling over this makeshift army and then going on with their war against sigvat and whatever was left of the raumsdalian empire here in the south nothing hamnet could see ulric had to be thinking along the same lines for he said maybe we should all run away our chances here dont look so good do they we can beat the rulers why did we come back down into raumsdalia if we didnt think we could beat the rulers trasamund said angrily i am not going to run from them any more i have done too much running more than any selfregarding bizogot should ever do did you really plan on fighting all the war mammoths in the world at the same time ulric exaggerated but by less than hamnet wished he did trasamund set his massive jaw and nodded ulric sighed the bizogot jarl wasnt going to listen to anything or anybody right now ulric said if you insist on getting killed yourself do you have to insist on killing all your friends too i insist on nothing trasamund pointed off toward the north there is plenty of open space you can save your skin if you love it so much go ahead and run see if i care the adventurer bowed in the saddle as always your ferocity i thank you for the encouragement you arent funny either trasamund added always saying one thing when you mean the otherit gets old skakki it gets old literary criticism and generalship both from the same man who could have imagined it ulric was so ostentatiously calm he made hamnet thyssen think trasamund had struck a nerve the adventurer went on i will run when you do your ferocity have you ever known me to run when you didnt trasamund wanted to say yes to that when he opened his mouth hamnet could all but see the word on the tip of his tongue but he didnt let it out hamnet knew why he didnt too he couldnt since he was a truthful man he answered well no as grudgingly as he could there you are then ulric skakki said here you are then here we all are then here we all are then in the same place here we all are then in the same boat if you have any good ideas about how we all get out of it togetherexcept running away i meanid love to hear them as trasamund had before he said if we cant beat the war mammoths we have to beat the rulers finding out how you propose to go about that would be nice ulric observed hamnet thought so too trasamund glared instead of answering regretfully hamnet decided the jarl had no answer or rather he had the same old answer fight like a demon and hope you came out on top hamnet would have liked that one better if it hadnt already proved wrong so often by ulrics expression he felt the same way with trasamund so notoriously hard of listening though why point it out count hamnet glanced toward marcovefa again where are their wizards he asked her if you can do something about them maybe you can do something about the mammoths a little later not much later he hopedthe massive beasts were getting closer alarmingly fast marcovefa looked angry and frustrated at the same time dont know where the vole pukes are she snarled they pretend to be nothing but ordinary warriors she said something that sounded incendiary in her own dialect in irate raumsdalian she added pretend too stinking well too what did that mean did the rulers wizards know they were facing marcovefa hamnet thyssen couldnt think of anything else it was likely to mean the rulers had little trouble against any other wizards theyd run into on this side of the glacier marcovefa though they respectedand very likely feared of course they also seemed to respect and perhaps even fear hamnet himself and if that didnt say they werent as smart as they thought they were hamnet didnt know what it was likely to say trasamund pointed toward the oncoming mammoths we should advance against them he said the worst thing you can do is meet the enemys charge standing still hamnet would have thought the worst thing you could do was not meet the charge retreat and flight didnt seem to enter trasamunds mind at all count hamnet wished they didnt enter his if you were going to fight and not run trasamund gave good advice hamnet booted his horse forward all along the line raumsdalians and bizogots were doing the same nobody seemed enthusiastic but nobody hung back hamnet usually admired that kind of dogged courage today he wondered if it wasnt harebrained not dogged there they are marcovefa exclaimed but by then arrows were already starting to fly whatever marcovefa did to the rulers wizards she would have to do on her own or so hamnet thought till he saw a host of raumsdalian lancers burst from an orchard off to the east they took the rulers in the flank spearing men on riding deer and rushing toward the enemys war mammoths he wondered how she could conjure up so many men and make them seem so convincing then he recognized the fellow leading the raumsdalians baron runolf skallagrim an old acquaintance of his and a recent comradeinarms marcovefa knew runolf too but could she have remembered him well enough to put him at the head of an imaginary army why would she do that when adding one more imaginary warrior was bound to be easier theyre real hamnet exclaimed theyve got to be real ulric skakki looked quite humanly surprised you mean your ladys not just spitting phantasms at the rulers phantasms my left one hamnet answered look tell me thats not runolf skallagrim in charge of them and ill say theyre phantasms well bugger me blind ulric said gravely after looking baron runolf had commanded the garrison at kjelvik another northern town hed fought the rulers with hamnet and marcovefa the winter beforeand fled with them when a slingstone knocked marcovefa out of the fight and let the rulers terrifying wizardry prevail and hed let hamnet and his friends leave kjelvik for the bizogot country when sigvat wanted to haul hamnet down to nidaros and make him pay the price for failure count hamnet hadnt seen runolf since coming back to raumsdalia hed assumed that either the rulers or sigvat had done for his old friend hed never been gladder to find himself wrong the rulers hadnt expected to get attacked from the flank as well as the front hamnet thyssen had seen what surprise could do to raumsdalians and bizogots the rulers might be vicious invaders from beyond the glacier but they were also human beings when everything went the way they expected it to they were as near invincible as made no difference when taken by surprise they proved no less immune to panic than anybody else runolfs men slammed through the rulers on riding deer they would have slammed through a like number of bizogots too the blonds who roamed the steppe below the glacier didnt have lancers armored head to foot in plate and chain or the big heavy horses they would have needed to carry those armored lancers some of runolfs troopers even rode armored horses that didnt mean they could face mammoths on equal terms but a charging lancer was something warriors on mammothback couldnt ignore a couple of raumsdalians drove sharp steel into the bellies and legs of the rulers immense mounts mammoths liked getting speared no better than any other animalsor any peoplewould have they screamed and bled and were lost to the fight most of the time the rulers wizards would have done something horrible to runolf skallagrims knights before they got close enough to threaten the riding deer let alone the mammoths not here not today whatever sorcerers the rulers had with them had frustrated marcovefa by not showing themselves she frustrated them by blocking not only the spells they aimed at her force but also the ones they tried to use against runolfs men all that left the fight pretty much the way it would have been if there were no such things as wizards and shamans and if anything it left the rulers even more discomfited than they would have been if merelyif that was merelystruck in the flank by surprise trasamund bellowed in delight when one war mammoth after another turned around and lumbered off to the south run cowards run he roared after the retreating rulers cant stand it when real men come up against you can you yes run you scuts one of the main reasons the rulers were running was a woman not a man hamnet thyssen almost pointed that out to trasamund almost but not quitehe didnt feel like quarreling with the jarl and he had worries of his own retreating southward the rulers only moved farther into the raumsdalian empire he wanted to drive them out of it not entrench them in it more deeply mammoths also moved faster than horses if the rulers on mammothback intended to get away he couldnt do anything about it marcovefa might have but the enemys wizards still left her as thwarted as she left them that added up to a victory of sorts for the rulers though not one they were likely to appreciate hamnet rode toward runolf skallagrim well met by god he called that you thyssen baron runolf answered his own question ill be damned if it isnt i figured the bastards on the mammoths would have done for you by now or else the emperor thats funny hamnet said though he wasnt laughing bugger me blind if it isnt i figured either sigvat or the rulers wouldve done for you by now too runolf laughed he was older and grayer than hamnet and less inclined to brood about things as far as hamnet knew runolf had never had a woman betray him which might or might not have meant something nah not me he said now the rulers have become close a time or three but i managed to talk sigvat out of it did you hamnet said deeply impressed more luck than i ever had how the demon did you pull that off i told his courier id rise against him if he tried to arrest me runolf answered stolidly sigvat mustve believed me because he hasnt given me any guff since good for you ulric skakki said good for you he turned to hamnet you see youre too loyal for your own good sigvat got away with doing all kinds of things to you that he never would have dared to try if hed been a little bit more afraid of what youd do to him maybe said hamnet in lieu of admitting that the adventurer had a point he brought things back to the business at hand you popped out of those trees at just the right time runolf well i wouldnt have done it if i hadnt seen the rulers all tangled up with your people runolf skallagrim said you mess with war mammoths when you dont have to youre sorry you did everybody in raumsdalias found that out the hard way everybody up on the bizogot steppe too count hamnet agreed trasamund gave what had to be the most reluctant nod hed ever seen from the jarl looks like you were in the middle of a straightup fight with the rulers runolf remarked they didnt have a sorcerer along you havent got one along yourself he shook his head thats not right i know its not i saw whatshernamemarcovefawith you yes shes here hamnet said she and the rulers wizards seemed to battle one another to a standstill better than what any raumsdalians have been able to dothats for sure runolf said yes i know hamnet left it there ulric skakki and trasamund probably understood why if runolf didnt hamnet didnt feel like spelling it out for him up till now marcovefa had thrashed almost all the sorcery the rulers aimed her way shed had trouble with the disease they sent against the bizogots but shed won straightup contests of sorcerytill this one was she weaker than usual had the rulers had an uncommonly strong wizard among the ones facing her hamnet thyssen didnt know but he was sure he needed to find out marcovefa was the only edge hed had on the enemy if he didnt have that edge what was he supposed to do next nowhat could he possibly do next marcovefa toasted a chunk of ridingdeer liver over a fire she seemed more interesting in eating than in answering hamnets questions while she ate she answered most of them with shrugs hamnet persisted he always persisted no matter how little good it did him no matter how much it irritated people who had to deal with him marcovefa scowled at him when she finished the liver she said i dont know what all it was we won why worry about it would we have won if runolf skallagrim hadnt been there to give us a hand hamnet answered his own question i dont think so maybe we would have i think we would have marcovefa said one way or another i always come up with something always hamnet mimed a slingstone bouncing off the side of her head i dont think so nothing like that this time she said a little better magic than usual thats all nothing to worry about given half a chance hamnet always worried too are they finding better wizards than they did are they learning to block what you do better than they did will they be able to beat you one of these days one of these days soon he meant but he managed to swallow the last word they learn a little anyone who isnt very very stupid will learn a little marcovefa answered but they will not beat me you dont need to worry about that she had her own brand of arrogance trasamund didnt think anybody could beat him sword in hand any good warrior felt that wayif he didnt wouldnt he run from any battlefield maybe wizards needed that same kind of certainty to do what they did all right by the way hamnet said it he made it plain it wasnt marcovefa shook her head do i have to screw you to get you to believe me i do that if you need it i want to believe you because youre telling the truth not because youre screwing me they arent the same thing hamnet said stubbornly as long as you believe me why doesnt matter marcovefa said why matters ive believed too many lies before and ive believed them for too long hamnet insisted believe we dont lose it is true marcovefa told him how can you know that hamnet demanded how because i am what i am because i am who i am marcovefa said how much can you foresee he asked her you couldnt tell ahead of time that that slingstone was going to hit you it could have killed you as easily as not then what would have happened to our fight then i wouldnt be here prophesying to you now marcovefa didnt sound very interested in arguing mighthavebeens but that doesnt change anything else count hamnet muttered to himself by god why wouldnt it how are we supposed to win without you i dont know anything about supposed to she said i know is i know is not those matter supposed to who cares he kept trying to get answers out of heryes he was stubborn she kept on not giving them shed said everything she intended to say or maybe everything she knew how to say if he didnt like it too bad he didnt like it and he thought it was too bad runolf skallagrim had about as many raumsdalians with him as hamnet did hamnet offered to yield command to him runolf shook his head keep it and welcome your grace he said the bizogotsll listen to you better than they would to me and our own folk will listen just as well or just as badly hamnet said or just as badly runolf agreed without even blinking what have you got in mind doing next fighting the rulers keeping ourselves fed staying alive if we can what else is there hamnet thyssen answered not bloody much not right now the other raumsdalian noble said were on our own we dont have to worry about orders from anybody else anybody higher feels kind of funny doesnt it feels pretty good if you want to know what i think hamnet said when we got orders from the emperor how much good did they ever do sigvat could always take a bad situation and make it worse well baron runolf sounded uncomfortable like hamnet he was a man of deep loyalty he hadnt had his nose rubbed so deeply in the cost of giving his loyalty to someone who didnt deserve it that thought set hamnet laughing runolf skallagrim gave him a quizzical look he didnt explain runolf wouldnt have thought it was funny but who could have imagined that gudrid might be training for sigvat they were unfaithful and cruel in different ways but so what the infidelity and the cruelty were all that really counted climbing up onto his horse and riding south let him stop brooding about that at least for a little while the trouble with following the rulers was that they were as bad as locusts when it came to sweeping up everything in their path hamnet almost hoped another battle would come soon then his forces could feast on the riding animals that fell in the fighting not much to feast on here the crops were still growing in the fields too many of them were growing untended the rulers had either killed or run off the peasants who would have tended them they werent ripe yet more than a few fields had broad swaths trampled through them where the rulers had ridden how much about crops did the invaders understand anything at all why should they when nothing like that would grow on the lands they were used to roaming the bizogots didnthamnet had seen as much the fields and grass would keep the horses fed till fall anyhow that was something but people the rulers might not care about crops but theyd made close to a clean sweep of livestock horses cattle sheep pigs chickens ducks geese turkeys gone bones at abandoned campsites told where many of them went maybe some of the farmers had taken some of their animals with them when they ran away from the rulers hamnet thyssen hoped so both for their sake and because it would bother the invaders no matter what had happened to the beasts though they werent here now to feed his fighters bizogots went on eating meat that was higher than hamnet cared to stomach ive done it ulric skakki said its nasty but its better than starving unless it poisons you hamnet replied its getting to where it smells pretty poisonous im still here ulric said dont know what that means maybe i can eat like a goat or a teratorn were all starting to stink like goats hamnet said god knows i wouldnt want to stink like a teratorn well no neither would i ulric admitted like smaller vultures teratorns stuck their bare wattled heads deep into the corpses of longdefunct beastsand people sometimes you could smell them on the wing it shouldnt come down to anything like that hamnet said youre right it shouldnt ulric nodded sagely so why do you sound like a man whos whistling to keep the ghosts away is that how i sound thats about it i dont even believe whistling keeps the ghosts away ive never run into a ghost on the loose on its own have you the only ones i know about are the ones the wizards magic up hmm the adventurer frowned in thought no come to think of it i havent either all that whistling must work better than we think count hamnet snorted nice to know ill be laughing while we starve to death glad to be of service your grace if you laugh hard enough youll wear yourself out and starve faster you should thank me again for my act of mercy i should do all kinds of things youll never see from me hamnet replied you can chalk that up as one more all right i will ulric could be most dangerous when he seemed most accommodating but will you answer one more little question for me i dont know ill try hamnet said cautiouslyhe recognized and flinched from that mild tone what is it are the rulers really getting the hang of marcovefas magic and of how to use their own against her against us i should say youd do better asking her count hamnet said which wasnt an answer and wasnt intended as one i will if i have to ulric skakki said dont much want to though questions like that can hurt a wizards confidence and sometimes thinking they can do something is what lets them do it for real and if anybody but marcovefa is likely to know youre it he aimed a forefinger at hamnets broad chest as if it were the point of an arrow if hamnet felt like a target all right he muttered under his breath at last he said i think they may be gaining there are lots of them and only one of her after all the other thing is she hasnt been quite the same since that slingstone got her close now but not the same what do you think mm you may be right ulric said so where does that leave us what are the odds shell get the missing bits back if she does when will she do it thats more than one question hamnet thyssen pointed out so it is give me an inch and ill take whatever i can get ulric filled a pipe he had no trouble scrounging tobacco down here in the empirethe rulers didnt think it was worth stealing he lit the pipe with a twig he stuck in the fire his cheeks hollowed as he sucked in smoke i believe you hamnet said a lot of girls have likely believed you tooand then regretted it the next day oh no they never regret it the next day ulric said smugly but he stopped asking questions about marcovefa questions hamnet couldnt answer questions he didnt want to think about once the questions got into his mind though they didnt want to go away marcovefa was the best weapon the bizogots and raumsdalians had against the rulers if she wasnt weapon enough what were they supposed to do give up hamnet ground his teeth till one of the back ones hurt he was damned if hed do that or maybe he was damned if he wouldnt runolf skallagrim came up to him whats chewing on you hamnet he asked you look like a dire wolf carried off your cub we won that fight a few days ago remember let your face know it all right runolf was an earnest decent fellow he came out and spoke his mind most of the time that made count hamnet like him better not today how many more will we have to win hamnet wondered as many as it takes my knights can wallop the stuffing out of those savages runolf didnt lack for confidence either sure they canas long as marcovefas able to hold off the rulers magic hamnet wished he hadnt had to say that it only made him worry more she will just tell her not to stop any more stones with her head hey baron runolf thought that was funny hamnet didnt rise up and clout him which proved he liked him but he didnt laugh either and that sent runolf away in a huff xii one day the wind started blowing cool down from the north the bizogots smiled hamnet thyssen sighed not the breath of god not yet he said but its a reminder there is such a thing just what we need per anders said the courier didnt seem to have gone up to the bizogot country till he came after hamnet and his comrades maybe it will stop blowing every winter once the glacier finally melts that would be something baron runolf said mild all winter long by god id love it you think so ulric said you go far enough south youll find places where its mild all winter long id like that too trasamund put in let me finish if you please ulric said places where its mild all winter you dont want to be there in the summertime either you broil or you boil depending on whether its dry or sticky if the winters warmer so is the summerthats the rule well if thats the rule it must be fit for the rulers right runolf skallagrim said what should we do with em broil em or boil em either one both hamnet said talking about its easy though doing it takes more work runolf chuckled ah well if youre going to complain about every little thing ulric thought that was funny hamnet again didnt this time he made himself smile he could occasionally get away with hypocrisy because no one suspected he would stoop to such a thing the raumsdalians and bizogots mounted and spread out and rode south looking for the rulersand for food coming across a flock of sheep the invaders had somehow missed made everyone happy oh trasamund said when i have a choice i like muskox meat better but his heart wasnt in the grumbling been a couple of thousand years since musk oxen ranged this far south hamnet said in those days the glacier covered everything down to just north of nidaros no gap thennot the smallest thought of one nothing but ice good times by god the jarl said things on the far side of the gap stayed where they belonged they didnt come down and bother honest men to put hamnet in his place he added or raumsdalians ha bizogots are the ones who steal hamnet retorted even a guestfriend cant go into an encampment and come away with everything he brought you dont miss it you raumsdalians all have too many things anyhow trasamund said you sound like marcovefaonly she says the same thing about ordinary bizogots too count hamnet replied trasamund grunted her folk dont have enough that is nothing but the truth by godnot enough i saw that with my own eyes and you raumsdalians have too much everybody knows its so we bizogots we are just right he thumped his chest with his right fist why was i sure you would say something like that hamnet asked dryly because down deep you do have some notion of the truth trasamund said runolf skallagrim couldnt make hamnet laugh but the bizogot did that was the silliest thing hamnet had heard in weeks trasamund got angry because he started laughing the jarl took himself seriouslyhe always did but before he could heat up his argument or start a fight a horn warned that somebody off to the left had spotted the enemy when trasamund reached over his shoulder to grab for his sword hamnet knew the bizogot didnt intend to use it on him hamnet thyssen made sure his sword was loose in the scabbard too he saw no rulers not yet so it wasnt time to string his bow he looked around for marcovefa without her neither sword nor bow was likely to matter much she waved to him if her confidence was damaged it didnt show that was all to the good she called out but he couldnt catch what she said he cupped a hand behind his ear marcovefa rode closer well fix them you see if we dont she said sounds good to me hamnet said the weather is better i hope it will help my magic marcovefa seemed to think better meant colder having lived almost all her life atop the glacier she probably did when hamnet did spot the rulers they were herding along a swarm of raumsdalian prisoners unlike marcovefas folk they didnt eat people not of their bloodor hamnet didnt think they did whether they slaughtered them for the fun of it unfortunately might be a different question still theyre nothing but guardsnot real warriors hamnet called we can beat them the raumsdalians and bizogots cheered hamnet hoped he wasnt lying too much if the rulers had a wizard along things might get more complicated the same was true if they attacked their captives even if they didnt he wondered what his followers would do with that flock of raumsdalians how would they feed them how would they house them people couldnt stay out in the open forever not with the breath of god beginning to stir even this far south of nidaros winter would be hard he didnt want to become a herdsman of people himself one thing at a time he thought first beat the rulers then worry about what comes after that he knew when the invaders spotted his oncoming warriors some of them started shooting into the crowd of captives others swung swords still others rode out to face his men one of them plainly was a wizard he held up his hand palm out as if ordering the attackers to stop marcovefa laughed her left hand twisted in deft passes surprise seemed to radiate from the enemy wizard when he discovered his magic didnt work the way he wanted it to marcovefa laughed again louder she reached out toward the rulers wizardand then she stopped laughing because whatever spell she aimed at him didnt work the way she wanted it to either he stayed on his riding deer and aimed more magic at the raumsdalians and bizogots that also failed he and marcovefa seemed able to stymie each other but no more hamnet wondered what marcovefa thought of that he knew what he would have thought of it nothing good how anxious was she about being able to work magic as anxious as a man who had trouble rising for his woman that was the only comparison that occurred to the thoroughly unsorcerous raumsdalian noble when it did he wished it hadnt worrying about rising to the occasion only made you less likely to rise the next time then marcovefa gestured againthis time count hamnet judged angrily and the rulers wizard threw up both hands as if he were shot he clutched at his chest a moment later he fell over and a moment after that all the rulers bows and arrows caught fire their swords suddenly seemed as limp as if they would never do their women any good again if his weapons failed in his hand hamnet knew what he would do hed run away what else could you do with no hope of fighting back the rulers seemed to come to the same conclusion they rode off toward the south a few of their captives had the wit and spirit to throw rocks after them but hamnet didnt see that they hit anyone as soon as the rulers were out of rock range the rescued raumsdalians turned and welcomed the army that had saved them the sad irony was that it hadnt saved all of them but it had saved most here and there someone wept because a spouse had died or got badly wounded at the last instant before freedom returned hamnet didnt know what he could do about that and then his head came up suddenly and sharply someone in the crowd of captives was calling his name two someones in fact a man and a woman no he said softly for the voices were familiar they called again they waved even more insistently than a lot of the other raumsdalians they were filthy and haggard and scrawny but he recognized them anyhow no he said again and covered his eyes with the heels of his hands eyvind torfinn went on shouting and waving so did gudrid ill kiss you if you want me to gudrid said by god ill kiss you and ill mean it too if it please you your grace ill kiss you earl eyvind added dont do me any favors hamnet saidto which of them he wasnt quite sure he was sure he wished he had something stronger than water in the tin canteen he wore on his left hip arent you lucky ulric skakki murmured no curse it hamnet answered as far as im concerned the rulers were bloody well welcome to gudrid as for eyvind torfinn he shrugged he couldnt make himself dislike the scholarly earl even if eyvind was married to his former wife there you see ulric sounded amused that only made hamnet thyssen want to hit him have you got any food eyvind asked anything at all weve been empty a long time horse meat venison from riding deer maybe a little mutton some mammoth meat its not too fresh but its what we have hamnet answered he tried not to look at gudrid it wasnt easy earl eyvind bowed low whatever you can spare god knows we arent fussy not now a rich noble in nidaros he would have had every chance and every excuse to be fussy before his shudder now said he might have eaten worse things than stale mammoth meat eating nothing for instance was much worse than that seeing the sorry state the rescued captives were in raumsdalians and bizogots started feeding them seeing the sorry state hamnet thyssen was in ulric handed him a skin and said here drink this expecting sour ale or maybe even smetyn count hamnet did smooth strong wine slid down his throat he eyed ulric with respect where did you find this oh somewhere along the way the adventurer said airily do you mind if i hamnet nodded toward eyvind torfinn go ahead you do know hell give it to gudrid next dont you ulric said yes i know that hamnets voice was rough as a rasp he shrugged as if to say what can you do then he leaned down and handed earl eyvind the wineskin the other noble caught the rich bouquet a broad astonished smile spread across his haggard face it got broader yet after he swigged then sure enough he passed it to gudrid she eyed hamnet i dont suppose youd slip hemlock in there and poison eyvind just for the sake of getting me she said her tone declaring that she didnt really suppose any such thing dont blame me for the games youd play yourself count hamnet replied even more harshly than before if you want to drink drink if you dont give the skin to someone else who can use it plenty of sorrylooking people were eyeing it with jealous zealous attention gudrid drank hed been sure she would she tried to provoke him as automatically as she breathed after blotting the ruby wine from her lips she handed the skin back to eyvind torfinn as if to claim it for their own eyvind had better sense he gave it to the haggard raumsdalian hanging over his left shoulder god bless you friend the haggard man said and drank deep then he passed the wineskin to a woman beside him ulric skakki meanwhile gave earl eyvind a chunk of meat and gudrid another they both tore into it raw theyd traveled up in the bizogot country and even beyond the gap they could live rough if they had to they were used to better things though where did the rulers catch you hamnet asked before answering earl eyvind had to gulp down an enormous mouthful of meat hamnet was amazed not to see his throat swell like a snakes when he did it south of here eyvind said once the way internal was clear he took another big bite and choked it down before adding we never expected to see you herenot that were sorry we did were doing what we can hamnet thyssen said i dont know if it will be enough but were trying gudrid was eating as greedily as eyvind wine and meat seemed to distract her from hamnet at least for the moment just as well ran through his mind per anders asked eyvind is the emperor still safe who cares ulric skakki murmured but the imperial courier plainly did he was the last time we saw him earl eyvind replied that was some little while ago though as far as i know he isnt in this sad herd of people count hamnet tried to imagine sigvat ii emperor of raumsdalia shambling along in the midst of so many other captives he tried to imagine the emperor sleeping on the ground and grubbing up roots and insects like any other unfortunate the picture made him want to smile maybe he was smallspirited to relish the idea of someone elses misfortune if he was he would just have to live with it what are you going to do with us gudrid asked after some fairly monumental swallowing of her own what she really meant of course was what are you going to do with me she thought of herself first last and always but hamnet answered the question the way she asked it anyone who wants to fight the rulers is welcome to join us we have a few extra horses and some spare weapons neither whitebearded eyvind torfinn nor decorative gudrid made a likely warrior and the rest she persisted i dont know hamnet said ill have to talk with trasamund and ulric and runolf and audun and liv and marcovefa liv marcovefa gudrid didnt try to disguise either her disdain or her amusement thats right hamnet did his best to ignore them both we have to send you toward a place where youre likely to get food figuring out where to find a place like that may not be easy you cant send us away gudrids voice went shrill to hamnets amazement she came up with a reason he shouldnt eyvind knows more about the rulers than anybody else from this side of the glacier well so he does count hamnet admitted deciding he couldnt very well deny it but whats that got to do with you we may need him but how are you going to help us drive the rulers back through the gap the farther away from trouble you go the better for everybody youll even be safer somewhere away from the fighting you wont need to worry so much about starving either eyvind wont help you unless im with him gudrid turned to her current husband will you she asked ominously if ground sloths and glyptodonts rose up against the rulers i would gladly help them right now eyvind torfinn replied gudrids jaw droppedshe wasnt expecting mutiny from that quarter earl eyvind was even more pliable than hamnet had been back in the days when he was wed to her hearing him tell her no almost made her former husband laugh out loud im not going anywhere without you gudrid declared when shed recovered somewhat you need someone to take care of you and you know it to hamnet thyssens disappointment that held a measure of truth i expect i can manage earl eyvind said whether you believe it or not im not entirely helpless thats what you think gudrid hardly bothered to hide her scorn marcovefa ambled over gudrid eyed her the way a bird might eye a snake marcovefa paid next to no attention to gudrid not at first she pointed toward eyvind torfinn we need him you have me eyvind said hamnet waited for marcovefa to dismiss gudrid he waited as he knew with more than a little anticipation gudrid had a knack for ignoring him and getting under his skin like a tick she did not have the knack for outfacing marcovefa as far as hamnet knew nobody did marcovefa pointed at gudrid gudrid flinched then made a good game try at pretending she hadnt we need you too declared the shaman from atop the glacier what gudrid sounded as if she couldnt believe her ears what hamnet thyssen knew only too well that he couldnt believe his we need her too marcovefa said then she spoke directly to gudrid again we do need you too she shook her head doesnt anybody listen to anything any more why in gods name do we need her count hamnet demanded she isnt worth anything thats not what you used to think gudrid said with a smile all the more provoking because it was so sweet well i know better now hamnet replied you taught methe hard way marcovefa ignored their sniping i dont know why we need her i only know we do she eyed count hamnet do you want to tell me you know these things better than i do hamnet wanted nothing more unfortunately he couldnt no but but me no buts marcovefa sounded as imperiousand as imperialas sigvat ii if you do not believe me ask audun gilli ask liv they will tell you the same asking them was the last thing count hamnet wanted to do noit was the next to last thing he wanted to do keeping gudrid with them was the last thing the very last thing by god i will he growled and stormed off he found liv before audun that made things worse but not worst what is it she asked as he approached with determined stride he told her exactly what it was does marcovefa know what shes talking about he asked can she know cant we get rid of gudrid the last question was the one that really mattered to him marcovefa knows all kinds of things liv said slowly sometimes she knows without even knowing how she knows i could do a divination to see if she is right here would you hamnet hated how eager he sounded but couldnt help it yes liv gave him a crooked smile i suppose i should be grateful youre not asking whether we can do without me you hurt me hamnet answered as steadily as he could but you didnt hurt me because you enjoyed hurting me theres a difference how complicated is your divination not very questions with yes or no answers usually arent she took from her pouch a small disk of shining white stone pierced near the edge moonstone she said threading a thong through the small hole what is the magic hamnet asked i ask whether gudrid should stay with us then let the stone fall down over my heart liv answered if she should it will stay close to my skin if she should not it will leap away seems simple enough he said she nodded and began chanting in the bizogot language she wasnt exactly asking the question or not in so many words hamnet judged that she was priming the moonstone so to speak so it would do the asking for her then she put the thong over her head and let the stone fall down between her breasts though she showed next to none of herself in the doing hamnet had to look away he still remembered how his head had lain there well he asked roughly livs halfsmile said she knew he wanted to reach inside her tunic to find out whether the moonstone disk was clinging to her gudrid would have worn a halfsmile too but hers would have been full of sardonic triumph as well livs was if anything sympathetic and so was her voice when she said i am sorry hamnet but the magic tells me marcovefa was right damnation hamnet thyssen burst out she cant be god knows gudrid is nothing but trouble gudrid is trouble liv agreed gravely but i would have to say she is not nothing but trouble if she were the spell would tell me marcovefa had made a mistake i dont think she has damnation hamnet repeated he turned on his heel and shambled off feeling almost as betrayed as he had when liv left him for audun gilli the idea of keeping gudrid around tempted him to sit down on the ground somewhere and slit his wrists the certainty that his former wife would laugh if he did was one of the things that kept him from drawing dagger or sword marcovefa had no trouble reading his face when he walked up to her you see we do need the stupid vole after all that made gudrid splutter which gave hamnet a certain somber satisfaction ulric skakki turned away before smiling trasamund laughed out loud which won him a venomous stare from gudrid hed enjoyed her charms in days gone by she didnt like it when someone else was as faithless and heartless to her as she was to her former lovers hamnet was too stubborn to give up easily give me one good reason why we need gudrid he said because i tell you so marcovefa answered somewhere laterher gesture encompassed all the time from the next instant to the moment when the glacier melted away for goodit will be better if we have her than if she is off doing mischief somewhere else what do you mean doing mischief yes gudrid was irate too i dont do mischief i do what i have to do count hamnet laughed at that so did ulric so did trasamund raucously gudrid looked daggers at each of them in turn i mean what i say marcovefa told her i dont waste my time and everybody elses with a pack of lies the way you do gudrid took a deep breath no doubt intending to deny it something in marcovefas face made her keep her mouth shut if she lied about lying marcovefa could give her the lie that convoluted logic brought a smile to hamnets face his smile made gudrid steam hed had things happen that he liked less well it is decided then eyvind torfinn said maybe a lot of what had just gone and had flown over his head or maybe he was willing to pretend it had for the sake of peace and quiet and maybe that wasnt the worst idea in the world maybe they all needed to do more of it yes hamnet said and he couldnt help sighing it is decided ulric skakki looked at the trees he looked at the sky he looked down at the scarred backs of his hands then he looked over at hamnet thyssen who was riding next to him ever have the feeling somethings about to go wrong but you dont know what now and then hamnet answered not soon enough usually well we can all say that ulric told him ive got it nowcurse me if i dont feels like something crawling on the back of my neck and no its not a stinking louse its more like what i felt up by sudertorp lake i didnt say it was a louse but why are you telling me tell marcovefa maybe she can do something about it there you go the adventurer laughed cheerily you see youre not always as foolish as you seem hamnet bowed in the saddle be careful or youll turn my head or maybe my stomach with flattery like that maybe both at once so you can be sick down your own back i do believe id pay money to watch that ulric skakki raised his voice marcovefa what do you want you noisy man she asked thats me ulric agreed not without pride i thought you ought to know i have the bad feeling were running into trouble oh you do do you again even though ulric had been right before marcovefa didnt sound particularly impressed she wasnt mocking but she wasnt convinced either why do you say that because i do thats why ulric answered im not out of my mindor i dont think so anyhow how often does a crazy man know he is crazy marcovefa returned more often than youd think look at hamnet here ulric said marcovefa laughed hamnet didnt kindly leave me out of this he said its your feeling its got nothing to do with me at least not till we find out exactly how crazy you are i thought youd known that for a long time the adventurer said if you put it that way i have hamnet thyssen returned i wasnt going to come right out and tell you so though no of course not youd go and talk behind my back instead ive met people like you before i have ulric might have been a dancing girl scolding a mercenary who was trying to coax her into bed rather than his usual self when he shook a finger under hamnets nose though the raumsdalian noble decided hed gone too far so did marcovefa enough of this foolishness she said you want me to find out whether youre right dont you if you can ulric sobered as fast as hed got silly i mean i know weve been in trouble before and well be in trouble again if we didnt land in trouble again it would be because weve given up on everything were trying nowor else because were dead thats not what im worried about something not very far away is going to mean trouble for us pretty soonor i think it is the hair at the back of my neck thinks it is well we will see marcovefa took two thin flat nearly transparent crystals out of a rabbithide pouch she wore on her belt when she held them parallel to each other in front of her face they remained transparent but when she turned one so it was perpendicular to the other the square where the two of them met became dark how do they do that hamnet asked i dont know marcovefa answered with a shrug that said she also didnt care much but when i look through the darkness all i see is what put us into danger dont look toward gudrid hamnet thought hed already lost that fightlost it twice to marcovefa and to liv his chances of winning it now didnt strike him as good enough to make reopening it seem worthwhile what do you see when you look through the the he groped for a word to describe the crystals spars we call themspars from the land of ice marcovefa said which struck him as an oddly nautical name to come from a mountaintop above the glacier as for what i see she went on she slowly turned in a complete circle with that curious darkness held in front of her right eye when she started a second revolution count hamnet was sure that whatever ulric skakki had imagined was imaginary when facing southeast she suddenly stopped he was sure that what hed been sure of a moment before was wrong few sensations were more disconcerting than that it was as if an earthquake had shaken the country inside his head well you are right two times now marcovefa told ulric what is it do you know can you tell he asked somehow by not gloating he sounded more smug than he would have if hed bragged about how fine his hunches were marcovefa shook her head something thats all maybe it wont be trouble now that we know its there or maybe it will be worse hamnet wished she hadnt added that lets go deal with it whatever it is ulric said would we do better running away hamnet asked i didnt looked for you to play the coward thyssen trasamund said im not by god count hamnet replied theres trouble and then theres trouble some kinds you can face others youd do better to stay away from if you run toward one of those youll be sorry afterwards if youre still around hes right marcovefa said which silenced trasamund she looked at hamnet again i dont know this time well just have to find outor else run away without finding out if we do that itll come after us whatever it is ulric skakki spoke with mournful certainty i say we need to see whats what hamnet didnt argue any more he walked over to his horse and swung up onto it so did the others he winced when he saw eyvind torfinn and gudrid on horse back they made him wonder if he wasnt bringing trouble with him instead of riding toward it but marcovefa seemed willing enough to let them ride along some people here already thought hamnet had spoken up once too often he kept quiet now marcovefa and ulric leading the way they rode out hamnet thyssen kept close to marcovefa but let her stay in front she smiled at him over her left shoulder every so often as if his attentiveness amused her it probably did what a warrior could do to keep an accomplished shaman safe is keep other warriors away from her hamnet thought spells reached farther than swords but swords could strike faster what they rode through seemed ordinary raumsdalian countryside so many ups and downs trasamund grumbled the glacier had never lain this far south never ground everything flat beneath its massive weight hills and dips persisted here where theyd been leveled up in the lands the bizogot was used to forests lay well back from the road hamnets head swiveled from left to right from right over to left if the trouble came from either side hed be ready for it hed see it anyway after a moment he realized that might not be the same thing if the trouble came from straight ahead hed see it from even farther off he hoped he would anyhow if the trouble was some gigantic pitfall he shook his head he couldnt believe ulric would have sensed such a thing and it wouldnt be a danger unless they came in this direction on purpose marcovefa also seemed alert she was as bright as a songbird head up eyes sparkling nostrils flaring with excitement hamnet wondered if he was imagining some of that but he didnt think so sure enough a moment later she started to laugh so thats what this is all about she said what he asked they thought they could set a trap for us marcovefa held up a hand as she reined in everyone else stopped too what kind of trap count hamnet asked i dont knowyet she said pointing out toward the peacefullooking landscape ahead whatever lies beyond that beyond what this time ulric got the question out ahead of hamnet it seemed more than reasonable enough to the raumsdalian nobleman not evidently to marcovefa her nostrils flared againthis time count hamnet judged in exasperation some sort of sorcerous barrier lies ahead she said as if to a group of idiot children whatever is behind it ulric skakki is the trouble you rightly felt in back of hamnet audun gilli spoke in a low voice i dont sense anything up ahead neither do i liv answered also quietly but her wizardry is stronger than ours she may be right i know audun said thats what worries me what do we do now even trasamunds big voice was unwontedly soft we smash the barrier then we smash what lies behind it marcovefa sounded as eager as if she were a young girl going to her lover just like that hamnet said yes just like that she aimed a peremptory forefinger at the barrier only she could sense when she spoke again she used her own dialect of the bizogot tongue ulric might have been able to follow it but hamnet couldnt he also couldnt deny it had an effect the peaceful scene ahead wavered as someones reflection in a pool would waver if he dropped a pebble into the water then it disappeared as a reflection would if someone dropped in a handful of pebbles it had concealed a swarm of sabertooths and lions and dire wolves and shortfaced bears roaring and snarling they sprang toward hamnet and his comrades xiii did we really have to ride toward this hamnet thyssen asked without conscious thought his hands strung the bow and found an arrow to set on the string to tell you the truth i would have been glad enough to do without it ulric skakki replied he was readying his bow with quick competence too marcovefa started laughing again hamnet and ulric looked at her as if shed lost her mind so did everyone else which made hamnet feel a littlea very littlebetter in the next minute or so unless he was luckier than he deserved to be he was much too likely to end up torn limb from limb will you share the joke he asked they put a mask on an illusion and think it will serve she said count hamnet thought it would serve too the sabertooth heading his way was almost close enough to spring if he didnt let fly in the next few heartbeats it would he had to hope he could hurt it and scare it away if he didnt he preferred not to think about that even if he did frighten off the sabertooth he would have to worry about a lion or a shortfaced bear next he preferred not to think about that too but feared he had little choice then marcovefa pointed once more at the oncoming beasts laughing still she cast another spellto hamnet thyssens relief a brief one as soon as the spell struck home hamnet cried out in astonishment so did the rest of the raumsdalians and bizogots rather than a swarm of ferocious wild beasts a ragged gaggle of naked rulers rushed toward them the invaders from beyond the gap must have sensed that their covering spell had failed for they stopped in confusion looking quite humanly astonished a man behind themwell out of bowshot behind themmust have been the wizard whod set the barrier and disguised his countrymen as beasts he seemed astonished too astonished and infuriated he hadnt expected to be found out let alone outdone the sabertoothturnedruler would have done better to keep coming hamnet shot him in the belly he said oof loud enough to let hamnet hear him clearly then he shrieked a good deal louder than that the rulers were brave strong and stubborn warriors but hardly any man from any folk could have hoped to stay silent after that kind of wound as if the shriek were a signal most of the other riders let fly more of the broadshouldered burly men went down the rest turned and ran as fast as they could the rulers seldom fledtheir stern way of making war frowned on falling back for any reason but maybe their code of honor or whatever it was granted dispensations when they got caught with their breeches down hamnet seldom sympathized with their predicaments but with that one he did watching them pelt back toward him only made their wizard angrier he wasnt nakedhe wore the rulers usual fur and leather decorated with a shamans fringes and crystals hamnet was busy speeding the departing warriors on their way with arrow after arrow but he kept glancing at the enemy sorcerer with the men routed the wizard was the only danger left he must have felt marcovefa was the only danger to himand he might well have been right even across more than a furlong hamnet could see him quiver with rage the ruler aimed his finger with as much purpose as marcovefa had ever shown count hamnet waited for her to swat his spell aside the way she had with the concealment and shapeshifting sorceries instead to his horrified dismay she swayed in the saddle she might have taken a sharp right to the chin she shook herself the way someone whod taken a sharp right to the chin might do the snarl that followed made the efforts of all the rulers masquerading as beasts seem halfhearted beside it that made hamnet thyssen feel better even if she had a foe worthy of her she didnt seem downhearted about it and the rulers wizard did seem astonished that she still sat her horseor maybe that she hadnt burst into flames hamnet got the feeling he would be vulnerable to anything marcovefa did to him before he could find out trasamund yelled forward after them kill them all the stinking direwolf turds by the way the bizogots and raumsdalians spurred ahead they were every one of them relieved to be chasing naked men and not battling lions and sabertooths hamnet understood that how could he not when he felt the same way but marcovefa swore in her own dialect all those men and horses between her and the enemy shaman must have blocked the spell she wanted to cast she paused and began another one while she was doing that the rulers wizard also turned and ran like most of his folk he was short and stocky he showed a fine turn of speed even so marcovefa held out her hands the enemy wizard sprang into the air higher than a man had any business doing when he came down he ran even faster marcovefa said something that should have scorched his backside all over again hamnet realized shed intended to destroy him not just singe his breeches never mind hamnet said you broke two masks and you beat him she gave him a look that was anything but satisfied these foolish little people i shouldnt only beat them i should make them sorry their mothers ever let them out of the nest she went right on scowling at the corpses of the rulers whod been magicked into predators shapes the bizogots and raumsdalians also scowled at them that count hamnet understood how could you steal anything from a naked man he needed longer to fathom marcovefas annoyance but then he didto her the bodies lying on the ground were wasted meat you want to pick out a plump one dont you he said we all should she said they could feed us for a couple of days you leave so much on the ground it surprises me your carrion birds arent too fat to fly we dont eat mans flesh not unless were starving hamnet said even then we dont talk about it later up on the glacier we are always hungry marcovefa answered hamnet nodded hed seen the truth of that she went on but the flesh of someone from another clanthat is not mans flesh not to us and these are not just from another clan they might as well be from another world hamnet felt the same way about them but he said you have narrow rules for who is a man and who is not ours stretch wider a good thing tooif they didnt what would we do with you knock me over the head while im sleeping i expect she answered matteroffactly if might be safer for you if you did your wizards are even weaker than the rulers that means i can be more dangerous to you than i am to them yes you can be hamnet said do you want to be do you want to tell everyone what to do all the time like the rulers if marcovefa said yes to that he wondered if he ought to knock her over the head but she shook her head no i dont want people telling me what to do why should they want me doing the same thing if everybody thought that way wed all be better off hamnet thyssen said marcovefa looked at him as if that were the silliest thing shed ever heard dont hold your breath ulric skakki was more serious than usualalmost painfully serious in fact i want to work this out he said toasting some muttondefinitely not haunch of rulerover a fire that night i smelled trouble so you did count hamnet sounded blurry even to himself he had a big mouthful of mutton too charred on the outside bloody on the inside i thought you were daft but marcovefa didnt thats twice now right ulric started to take a bite then pulled the smoking meat away from his face and blew on it too blasted hot where was i oh yes marcovefa she could tell i wasnt just jumpy and she could tell where the trouble was same as she did with the sickness shes the reason we went southeastshe knew it was there cant argue with you hamnet didnt want to argue anyhow he wanted to eat so did ulric he managed to bite the mutton without burning his mouth but that only made him talk and chew at the same time so suppose she wasnt along suppose we went straight south or southwest instead of southeast we never would have run into those rulers and my hunch would have been worth its weight in goldknow what i mean hmm hamnet chewed both mutton and ulric skakkis paradox he found them both tough at last he said my guess is if youd smelled trouble when marcovefa wasnt along or if no one had smelled trouble at all we would have ridden southeast and run into it we would have found some reason to do that and the rulers would have taken us by surprise mmmaybe ulric still didnt seem happy if you dont like my answers go ask marcovefa yourself hamnet told him by god i will the adventurer jumped to his feet and hurried over to the fire by which marcovefa sat chatting with audun gilli and liv ulric stooped beside her they spoke for a little while then ulric straightened his face before a peculiar expression as he came back what did she say hamnet asked dont ask foolish questions no doubt because he spoke her dialect ulric could imitate marcovefas accent in raumsdalian very well he also did a good job of mimicking the sniff she could put in her voice caught by surprise hamnet burst out laughing well its good advice he said when ulric looked miffed if you dont ask a question how are you supposed to know its foolish the adventurer persisted is that a foolish question hamnet wondered it probably wasnt lately too many questions that seemed foolish turned out to have answers of lifeanddeath importance are you turning phi los o pher hamnet asked if you are why did we bother rounding up earl eyvind we didnt do it on purpose it just happened ulric said im sure you were thrilled when we rounded up gudrid with him thrilled but of course hamnet said tightly ulric skakki gave him an impudent grin hamnet hastened to change the subject where do we go from here what can we do to make sure the rulers dont wreck raumsdalia wait till they kill sigvat and then beat them ulric answered without the least hesitation the cynicism in that took count hamnets breath away the look on his face must have said as much because ulric laughed harshly what do you think im joking no i think youre not and i think i ought to cry for raumsdalia because youre not hamnet said dont waste your tears do you suppose sigvat would cry for you ulric skakki answered his own question if you do youre a different kind of fool from the one ive seen sigvat only has tears for himself and what kind of fool have you seen hamnet thyssen asked as dispassionately as he could youre too stubborn for your own good youre too innocent for your own good and you dont know enough about women for your own good before hamnet could say anything to that ulric added well no man knows enough about women for his own good but you knew even less than most of us poor twits if you dont believe me go ask gudrid i was going to say marcovefa ulric replied if you want to go ask gudrid well you can do that you want to know what i think though if you do it only proves youre a fool about women anybody who wants to have anything to do with that one he gave a theatrical shiver eyvind seems to hamnet said by god eyvinds a fool about women even a fool about women like you should be able to see that ulric said and count hamnet nodded because he could ulric patted him on the back there you see if you can see that maybe hes a bigger fool than you are and they said it couldnt be done hamnet got up and walked away from the fire ulrics laughter pursued him the question hamnet thyssen had asked ulric kept gnawing at him what could they do to beat the rulers they didnt have enough warriors to do it in battle hed banked on marcovefas magic to make up the difference in manpower now he saw that while it could make up some of the difference it would need strange and unusual help to make up all of it what that help might be he unfortunately couldnt imagine marcovefa didnt want to talk about it everything will be all right she said when he raised the subject do you know that hamnet persisted does your magic tell you so if it does is it bound to know what its talking about everything will be all right as long as you dont keep bothering me she paused if you do keep bothering me like this you can find someone else to bother i have listened to as much as i want to hear do you understand me he couldnt very well not understand her yes he growled and swung his horses head away so he could ride off by himself no matter how big a fool about women he was he could see he was on the edge of losing this one how much bigger a fool would that make him he looked around ulric skakki was out of earshot that was something anyhownot much but something a scout from the rear guard galloped up to the van rulers the raumsdalian shouted rulers coming down from the north lets bag them trasamund said they may not even know were anywhere close by if theyre just coming down into the empire chances are they think its all over down her except the mopping up if they do theyre wrong runolf skallagrim declared yes lets welcome them to raumsdalia swinging about and heading north again was a matter of minutes hamnet stayed away from marcovefa instead of asking her what she would do maybe he could learn maybe since he didnt talk to her she rode over and talked to him that was bound to be a lesson of one kind or another which kind hamnet wasnt sure he wanted to know shall we look like them marcovefa said will that surprise them and make things easy for us what do i know hamnet answered talk to trasamund and ulric and runolf if they think its a good idea go ahead and do it marcovefa talked to the others they say to go ahead she told hamnet so i go ahead the rulers will see the spell not us we do not see anything out of the sameness out of the ordinary you mean hamnet said do i i suppose i do marcovefa shrugged and got busy with her magic she didnt explain it the way she often did she simply went ahead with the spell hamnet thyssen looked at his comrades they didnt look like rulers to him shed told him they wouldnt he felt obscurely disappointed even so there were the rulers they were on mammoths and deer and rode through the empire as if they had not a care in the world when they spied the bizogots and raumsdalians in front of them they waved cheerfully their foes looked like friends to them anyhow the two bands had got quite close to each other before one of the real rulers called out something in their incomprehensible language hamnet and a few others had learned tiny fragments of that tongue no one he led spoke it well enough to fool someone for whom it was a birthspeech the men on his side did the best they could they kept their mouths shut frowning the broadshouldered curlybearded man repeated himself hamnet recognized the same syllables over again he also caught the annoyance in thechieftainsvoice whatever the ruler said he expected some kind of answer and he wasnt getting it which meant lets hit em hamnet trasamund and runolf all shouted the same thing at almost the same time ulric wasted no time on chatter he simply drew his bow and shot the man whod called out to people he thought friends the ruler looked almost comically astonished when the arrow sprouted in the middle of his wide chest he slid off his riding deers back more rulers tumbled from their mounts count hamnet cut one down before his foe had even drawn his sword doing something like that wasnt fair which didnt mean it didnt work only a few of the enemy warriors aboard riding deer found much chance to fight back bizogot and raumsdalian archers also did everything they could to shoot the rulers on the war mammoths and to shoot the mammoths themselves as often as they could if the beasts went wild with pain they wouldnt do what their masters wanted them to but a mammoth plucked a raumsdalian trooper out of the saddle with its trunk and threw him to the ground his terrified shriek cut off abruptly when the mammoths forefoot crushed the life from him from everything hamnet had seen even large animals didnt like stepping on people like it or not the mammoth did it as other war mammoths had before maybe the rulers had some training trick to get the best of their reluctance the illusion is broken marcovefa called get back out of slingstone range hamnet yelled at her she made a face but for once did as he asked without arguing almost getting her skull smashed before made her less than eager to risk it again another ruler yammered nonsense at hamnet it wasnt nonsense to the man from beyond the gap of course but it meant not a thing to the raumsdalian noble give up hamnet shouted back the ruler either didnt understand or didnt want to their swords would have to speak for them then iron rang against iron sunbright sparks flew hamnet wondered whether two swordsmen fighting in dry grass or on dry moss had ever started a fire then as he beat the rulers blade aside the instant before it would have ruined his face he wondered if he would live through this a bizogots arrow caught his opponent in the ribs the ruler grunted and then screamed hamnet finished him with a stroke to the neck body contorting in death spasms the invader crashed to the ground hamnet looked for someone else to fight the unfair skirmish was almost over one of the war mammoths was still fighting even though arrows pincushioned it a few real rulers kept up the struggle against the ambushers but they fell one after another surrender hamnet shouted in the rulers languagethat was a word hed made sure he learned from the few prisoners his side had taken only a handful of the invaders ever did it most preferred death in battle to what they thought of as the worst of disgraces for his trouble he got abuse showered on him now the surviving rulers made it plain they werent about to give up he couldnt understand much of what they called him but he was sure they werent tossing him endearments if they dont want to they dont have to trasamund said he drew his bow took careful aim and shot one of the rulers off the war mammoth still in the fight the rest of the enemy warriors cheered they saw nothing wrong with dying quitting was another story die they did marcovefa tried her heartstopping sorcery on the mammoth but it didnt work she shrugged warded she said the spell is easy to block too bad a lot of meat there trasamund shrugged oh well well still butcher the deer and the horses that went down i wish it were easy to put the mammoths out of their misery one way or another hamnet thyssen said he imagined himself wandering around with needles and skewers jabbed into his flesh that had to be something close to what the great beasts were feeling nowand they didnt even know why it had happened well if you want to ride up close and try for a shot in the eye the way trasamunds voice trailed off told what he thought count hamnets chances were after a moment he went on of course if you miss the mammothll likely stamp you into the mud that did cross my mind yes hamnet said since it was your good idea you can try it for a heartbeat he feared trasamund would challenging a bizogot could be dangerous because he might feel compelled to meet the challenge no matter how preposterous it was but the jarl shook his head ive seen it tried thanks he said ive even seen it work once or twice and ive seen what happens when it doesnt this time his pause had a meditative quality to it not pretty you sure arent ulric skakki agreed or isnt that what you were talking about he had a knack for hearing and responding to the bits of talk that would start the most trouble we were talking about putting mammoths out of their misery trasamund eyed ulric might be worthwhile doing the same thing to you only misery im in right now is from the company i keep the adventurer said i can put myself out of it if i want toall i need to do is ride away he made as if to do just that hang on hamnet said all right since its you that asks ulric said you havent insulted me any time lately anyhow i dont quite know why not but you havent give me a chance and im sure i will hamnet replied where do we go from here what do we do next ulric struck a pose do i look like an oracle am i the golden shrine he looked down at himself if i am the architect could have done better my body is a templebut not that one your body is a trasamund broke off he was bigger than ulric skakki and thicker through the shoulders but no one could accuse the adventurer of being soft a temple to your foul mouth the bizogot finished and looked pleased with himself for coming up with something while youre as pure as snow is black ulric said trasamund started to nod then almost hurt himself stopping when he heard the whole gibe he sent ulric a venomous stare i did not believe there really were things like snakes till i finally saw one down here no matter what some fasttalking raumsdalian traders said when i got to know you though i understood what they meant ah well ulric gave back an elaborate shrug for a long time your ferocity i felt the same way about vultures trasamund purpled before they could turn insults into a brawl count hamnet said now children that made them both glare at him which washe supposedbetter than having them glare at each other he went on the idea is to fight the rulersremember if we fight each other we help them we dont do ourselves any good but we can have some fun ulric was in no mood to be helpful you want fun go to a brothel trasamund growled this is war curse it we have to smash the rulerssmash them do you hear think so do you ulric wasnt about to give up his sport and here all the time i thought the idea was to hand them flowers when they came by flowers is it trasamund told him what he could do with his flowers it struck hamnet as uncomfortable especially if he used roses you too ulric said sideways he paused for a moment we didnt kill all of them i dont think some will go on south and tell the rest of the rulers where we are thats part of the idea eh trasamund said we want them to come after us then we can deal with them i wish the raumsdalian armies down south would give us a little help hamnet thyssen said they havent yet not so far as anybody can tell too right they havent ulric agreed the generals are probably afraid of the rulers and we know too bloody well that sigvats afraid of them we have to do it on our own then trasamund spoke with a certain lonely pride every bizogot jarl saw his clan as being alone against its neighbors trasamund was bound to see this force as alone against the world he wasnt so far wrong either what if we cant do it on our own ulric skakki went on trying to get under his skin this time it didnt work trasamund eyed the adventurer with something close to infinite scorn then we die he said bravely i hope not even ulric found a good comeback for that count hamnet didnt even try he didnt want to die bravely he wanted the rulers to die bravely and if such a thing were possible he wouldnt have minded seeing sigvat ii die bravely too raumsdalians and bizogots turned and moved south again hamnet pushed them to move fast he had his reasons though he didnt speak of all of them if the warriors moved fast enough maybe they would leave the followers behind he could hope he would leave eyvind torfinn and gudrid behind anyhow but no matter what he hoped it didnt happen gudrid had kept up as they traveled through the gap and beyond the glacier and she kept up now every once in a while she even grinned at him she knew he didnt want her around his not wanting her around had to give her one more reason to stay the rulers took a while but they proved able to learn from experience they stopped sending big armies against the band marcovefa backboned instead they began to put raiders all around them the way dire wolves would if they were harrying a herd of musk oxen now one outriding bizogot now two or three raumsdalians would go missing sometimes they would take enemies with them sometimes not but the band began to shrink hamnet didnt want to push marcovefa about it it seemed too small a matter to fuss about too small a matter to draw the notice of a large talent after the fourth time a small party of outriders got picked off he changed his mind the force needed scouts if he couldnt send them out without sending them out to get killed he had a problem and so did his little army i see what i can do marcovefa said when he told her what was wrong maybe i ride with some scouts see if i can lure the rulers into coming after us they get a surprise then yes that made hamnet wish hed kept his mouth shut we cant afford to lose you you know that he said foolishness marcovefa sniffed any shaman who knows anything should be able to beat these foolish rulers then she sighed but your shamans and wizards dont know much do they we used to think so hamnet said now you and the rulers have taught us some lessons wed rather not have had you were like this marcovefa closed one eye and squinted through the other one you were all like this so you didnt know it the rulers are like this she opened the one eye a little wider you need to be like this she opened both eyes very wide then she winked at hamnet youre bound to be right he said ignoring the wink but even if you are you cant always stay away from arrows or slingstones and we cant do without you even if you think we should be able to you have a trouble a problem you bring it to me now you dont want me to fix it marcovefa said where is the sense in that losing scouts is a problem hamnet thyssen agreed losing you is a catastrophe then he had to explain what a catastrophe was worse than a problem much worse but you wont lose me marcovefa said dont think so anyway you dont think so hamnet echoed discontentedly dont you see that isnt good enough without you were nothing you are more than you think you are marcovefa said you dont know how much you are you have no idea do you mean me or do you mean all of us hamnets wave encompassed the ragtag army hed helped build yes marcovefa answered making herself as annoying as if she were ulric skakki count hamnet fumed but only to himself which he asked i mean you and i mean everyone marcovefa said it is not a question with only one answer if you were not stronger than you think the rulers would have won a long time ago dont you see that well maybe hamnet thyssen wasnt sure he wanted to see it hed got used to looking down on himself why not when everyone else did that was how his thoughts ran anyway losing first gudrid and then liv did nothing to make him feel better about himself either no maybe marcovefa said it is a truth an important truth too maybe hamnet said againhe didnt want anyone making him happy against his will all i know is whenever we went up against the rulers in any kind important fight before we climbed to the top of the glacier and found you we lost the only reason we climbed it was because it gave us one chance in a thousand to get away from the rulers if we stayed down on the bizogot steppe the mammothriders would have killed us all smiling marcovefa shook her head not so simple no sure enough count hamnet didnt want to believe anything then what were we doing up there i think the golden shrine sent you marcovefa sounded as matteroffact as if shed said something like i think the three tusk clan sent you no matter how matteroffact she sounded she made hamnet thyssen gape how do you know something like that how can you did god tell you he didnt believe god went around doing such things he was sure god didnt do them with him he wished god did god didnt tell me anything i dont know this is true but i think so we all need the golden shrine now maybe never in all the time since it disappeared do we need it more marcovefa said how long had the golden shrine been lost hamnet didnt know if hed ever heard a number of years eyvind torfinn would know if anyone did what he didnt know about the golden shrine nobody knew hamnet thyssen didnt feel like asking him dealing with earl eyvind was too likely to mean dealing with gudrid as long as hamnet didnt have to do that he didnt want to but he couldnt help wondering how many people down through the ages had been sure their time was the worst one possible they would have been sure they had to have the golden shrines help too no matter how much they needed it they wouldnt have got it some would have gone down to ruin without it others he supposed would have got through on their own clumsily he tried to explain that to marcovefa it seemed very clear inside his own headmuch less so when he put it into stumbling words she heard him out then said things are worse now as before she sounded very matteroffact very sure how can you know they are hamnet demanded i know what i know and time is not all strung together in little pieces like beads on a string time is all of it at once marcovefa said hamnet muttered to himself that sounded like nonsense to him till he remembered how shed led the little band of bizogots and raumsdalians to the edge of the glacier to the very spot where an avalanche would make the descent less steep less difficult but the avalanche hadnt happened yet when they got there shed seen it through time but she hadnt quite seen it in time then the time came round and they were able to climb down why dont you know where the golden shrine is then hamnet asked the question didnt interest marcovefa it is where it is it is where it needs to be when it is appointed to show itself show itself it will appointed to show itself count hamnet wondered what that meant and whether it meant anything marcovefa must have thought so he didnt ask her to explainhe didnt think what she said would mean anything to him he couldnt see couldnt conceive of all time as a single thing he wondered if his inability was a curse or a blessing xiv this time it was the breath of god the wind howled down from the north howled down off the glacier the ice might have retreated but it was a long way from gone the wind might have traveled a long way too but it was as cold as if it had blown but a few miles hamnet thyssen had coldweather gear so did every other raumsdalian in his ragtag army down in the far south beyond the empires reach ulric skakki insisted there were countries the breath of god never touched hamnet had traveled far enough south to find that likely even if he couldnt testify to it from personal experience but men in these parts knew they had to stay warm through the winter or die so hamnet donned furs with resignation most of the other raumsdalians felt the same way the bizogots by contrast gloried in the cold weather snow trasamund exclaimed about time everything up in the three tusk country would be covered in white by now gods dandruff ulric said he could take as much cold as anyoneslipping through the gap to the lands beyond the glacier in the middle of winter proved that but he didnt enjoy it the way the bizogots did why you blasphemous vole trasamund blurted a raumsdalian would have called ulric a toad or a snake but creatures like that couldnt survive up on the frozen steppe the jarl did the best he could with what he knew your servant your ferocity ulric gave back a mocking bow trasamund had put on mittens which made it hard for him to wag a finger under the adventurers nose again he did his best you should not speak so he said severely if you do maybe god will not choose to show us where the golden shrine lies dont you think we should be pure of mind pure of heart pure of speech to deserve to learn where the shrine is to count hamnets amazement ulric shook his head hamnet hadnt thought of trasamunds argument and it seemed to him to carry weight but ulric said if god is waiting for people who are pure of mind and heart and speech the golden shrine will stay hidden to the end of time a good thing too because people who are that pure are hardly people at all you turn everything upside down and inside out trasamund complained ulric gave him another bow your servant he repeated trasamund swung at him hamnet could have told the bizogot that was a mistake even if he had been baited but hamnet never got the chance ulric skakki turned trasamund upside down and almost inside out he grabbed the jarls arm then dipped wheeled and threw trasamunds startled shout cut off abruptly when he hit the ground not enough snow had stuck yet to soften his landing count hamnet helped him up how the demon did he do that trasamund mumbled shaking his head to try to clear it hes done the same thing to me hamnet said reasoning that misery loved company and it was true he knows some wrestling tricks ive never seen before i know a trick too trasamund growled how about bizogot standdown hed won that brutal game against the rulers as hamnet had told tahpenes while she was a prisoner no thanks ulric said if you want me to admit your head is harder than mine ill do it you dont have to prove it on me you but trasamund couldnt call him a coward not after all theyd been through together since the word stuck in his throat the jarl tried a different tack will you show me that flip one of these days maybe not right now ulric answered dont you think we ought to ride most of the bizogots and raumsdalians were already mounted quite a few of them had watched trasamunds sudden unexpected overthrow no one had seen hamnet fly through the air though the thud he made on landing brought palace servants running to see what had collapsed neither of them had got badly hurt but trasamunds dignity and pride took a worse beating the bizogot did some more muttering another time then he said aloud in the meanwhile i will take out on the rulers what i think about you its all right by me ulric said cheerfully if i were the rulers chief id start running right now trasamund muttered yet again dont push him too hard hamnet said why not what other fun do i have these days ulric eyed him with a mild and speculative air or should i start in on you instead if you want to hamnet answered stolidly i can take it better but that means you dont give so much sport take what you can get count hamnet advised we need trasamundwithout him the bizogots fall apart like a snowball slamming into a rock nobody cares whether im happy or not nobody even cares whether im here well i would have said the same thing ulric told himif hamnet left himself open for a thrust the adventurer would deliver so hamnet thought anyhow till ulric went on but marcovefa thinks youre wrong remember ill argue with you any day i think twice before i decide shes made a mistake hamnet thyssen did remember what marcovefa had said about him remembering it didnt mean he believed it it made him profoundly uneasyhe didnt want to carry so much weight in the scales of the world what he mostly wanted was to go back to his castle down in the far southeast and be left alone he knew he was no more likely to get that than any of his other wishes marcovefa doesnt know everything there is to know he said after a pause he hoped wasnt too obviousif it was it would make a liar out of him all by itself ulric skakkis knowing smirk said it did she may not know everything but she knows a demon of a lot more about this business than you do go ontell me she doesnt make me believe it he folded his arms and waited however much count hamnet wished he could he didnt even try he couldnt make ulric believe it and he couldnt make himself believe it either whether he liked it or not whether he wanted to or not he did carry weight he wondered if he would have any say in how it got used you wont if the rulers kill you he thought that was as true for him as it was for marcovefa her safety mattered to him his own didnt seem to try as he would he couldnt get very excited about it with a slow shrug he said we needed to ride a while ago were still gabbing instead yes your grace ulric saidmockery in the guise of respect one of his favorite barbs hamnet didnt rise to it ulric sighed sure as the demons trasamund gives better sport pity hamnet methodically checked his horses cinches and girths when he was satisfied he swung up into the saddle ulric was only a moment behind him the raumsdalians and bizogots rode in a mass compact enough to let them keep an eye on their outriders the rulers wouldnt have an easy time picking off a few men anyhow hamnets eyes went this way and that this way and that they kept coming back to marcovefa she might think he was important in the fight against the rulers he knew she was fagersta was a town of no particular importance hamnet thyssen had a hard time believing even the people who lived there would have said anything else it wasnt very big or very small it wasnt very rich it sat by a stream deep and wide enough for small boats but not for ships because it was right in the middle of the empire and no foreign foes had come anywhere near it for at least two hundred years people had torn down the wall that once surrounded it and used the timber and stone for buildings the rulers had gone through fagersta some time earlier in the year they hadnt razed it why bother theyd plundered some theyd stolen livestock from the surrounding farms theyd killed and raped enough to keep themselves both safe and amused and then theyd gone on their way as soon as the locals saw the mix of raumsdalians and bizogots approaching from the north they sent out a man with a flag of truce that was about the only thing they could have done the breath of god swirled snow all around so fagersta didnt discover it had new visitorsand the visitors didnt discover there was such a place as fagerstatill they were almost on top of it oh the herald exclaimed in glad surprise when he got a better look at the newcomers you arent those people he didnt say what he really thought of the rulers perhaps in case he proved wrong about who these strangers were no we arent hamnet agreed gravely in fact we want to kill those people trasamund added his accent and his long golden beard announced that while he wasnt a ruler he wasnt a raumsdalian either the local herald eyed him as warily as a shepherd might eye a sabertooth that was sensible of the man as trasamund was at least as deadly as one of the big cats the local soon noticed other big blond warriors among those who might be of his own kind you arent those people he said again this time he added but who the demon are you under the circumstances it was a more than reasonable question i am trasamund jarl of the three tusk clan trasamund struck a pose on his horse he was wasting his time the raumsdalian knew more of bizogot clans and their jarls than he did about riding a war mammoth after a moment trasamund saw as much he simplified things im with you raumsdalians the rulers are my enemies oh the man from fagersta seemed to understand that anyhow whether he believed it was liable to be another question but youre a foreigner he said and waited as if hoping trasamund would deny it when trasamund didnt the local sighed didnt know much about foreigners till a couple of weeks ago dont much fancy what we found out neither there are different kinds of foreigners hamnet thyssen said the local only grunted he wasnt disagreeing but he also wasnt enthusiastic about the prospect hamnet asked what did the rulers do to this place and who are you anyway well my names hrafn maering said the man from fagersta he let out a bleak chuckle what did they do to this place anything they pleased pretty much you can see fagerstas got some chunks bit out of it his wave took in the burned and overthrown buildings all over town glumly he went on me i was lucky if you want to call it luck they killed one of my second cousins and they forced my wifes sisterbut only two or three of em and they werent especially trying to hurt her just to have a good time shell be all right we expect soon as she gets over the worst of the horrors and she isnt with child count hamnet nodded soberly hrafn was right as these things went his family was lucky one death one not too brutal rapeyou could pick up the pieces and go on after something like that there still was a family to pick up the pieces and go on some lines in fagersta would be destroyed altogether others would have a handful of people trying to recover after much worse disasters when did the rulers ride out of here ulric skakki asked which way did they go hrafn maering eyed him doubtfully too his sharp features werent those of a typical raumsdalian but he spoke the imperial language without accent and he also spoke with the air of a man entitled to get answers from other people it was only maybe ten days ago hrafn said they went that way he pointed somewhere between south and southeast have any idea how many of them there were runolf skallagrim inquired not for sure hrafn said they rode these funny deer you know by the way he said it the deer were harder to count than horses would have been but then he added they had eight maybe ten war mastodons with em chances were hed never seen a mammoth in his life till the rulers rode theirs down into the empire mammoths were creatures of the frozen steppe beyond the evergreen woods to the north mastodons by contrast roamed the forests of the empire and the lands on its borders they were common in the mixed woods near hamnets castle no wonder then that hrafn called the rulers great mounts by the wrong name somebody none too familiar with sabertooths might easily call them lions by mistake hed be wrong but he wouldnt be very wrong you could end up dead as easily and in most of the same ways from a sabertooth as from a lion and the rulers would have been just as much trouble riding mastodons as they were on mammothback hamnet wondered what the invaders thought of mastodons they would surely have found some by now he also wondered whether the rulers could turn mastodons into riding animals they would have a new supply of mounts if they did when he asked the first question out loud ulric said they probably think mastodons are delicious and hamnet couldnt even tell him he was wrong because a mastodon like a mammoth was a lot of meat ambling around in one con ve nient package taming mastodons would take a long time killing and cooking them on the other hand well lets go after the buggers trasamund said hrafn maering surely spoke for all the survivors in fagersta what about giving us a hand youre here youre alive you can put the town back together yourselves hamnet said the best thing we can do for you is kill the rulersif we can sigvat would do better by us hrafn said he looked very surprised when all the raumsdalians and bizogots within earshot started laughing fit to burst he got mad when none of them would explain why im going to report this to the mayor hrafn said hell tell the chief of the diocese and hell tell the provincial governor then the governor will report you to the emperor and then youll be in trouble hamnet and his companions laughed harder than ever hrafn maering looked bewildered hed come out with the most fearsome threat he knew how to make and these people took it for a joke count hamnet didnt know whether to envy the local or feel sorry for him he still lived in his secure little world or thought he did the great virtue of the raumsdalian empire was that it had let generations of people just like hrafn live out their lives without needing to worry about barbarians coming down over the border its drawback was that when order broke down the locals had no idea what to do good luck to you hamnet told him and meant every word of it god keep you ulric skakki added also in tones of great sincerity you poor sorry bastard even trasamund sounded sympathetic no matter how rough his words were they left hrafn staring after them as they rode past fagersta he is a sorry bugger ulric said he doesnt know whether to crap or go blind hes already blind hamnet thyssen said the question is whether hes better off that way what he has to see these days isnt pretty and he only got a glimpse of it when the rulers went through there he would have seen more if they stayed longer trasamund said thats hamnets point ulric told him yours on the other hand is under your hat trasamund needed a moment to understand what he meant when the jarl did he and ulric had a fine time sniping at each other as they rode south in pursuit of the rulers after a while ulric came up with something new to talk about all right he said weve driven the rulers away raumsdalia is free again what about the bizogots trasamund demanded oh the rulers slaughtered them all they arent there any more ulric said trasamund bellowed irately the adventurer held up a hand fine fine the bizogots are free again too thats more like it trasamund said but im still talking about raumsdalia ulric skakki said he turned to hamnet the rulers are gone the empire is free yes you already said that hamnet said what am i supposed to do shout huzzah suppose you already did ulric said what happens next how do we make something thats broken stand on its own two feet again sigvat wont think theres any trouble hamnet answered hell just start giving orders and expect everybody else to follow them and anybody who doesnt want to will end up in a dungeon if sigvat tries that now hell end up in a dungeonif hes lucky ulric said more likely hell end up dead he nodded toward runolf skallagrim or am i wrong depends on which orders he gives runolf said uncomfortably he was as loyal as they cameif not to sigvat then to the idea of the raumsdalian empire if he starts throwing his weight around hes in a lot of trouble you arent wrong about that skakki i can hope hes too smart to try it ulric and count hamnet both guffawed so did trasamund tell us whats so funny eyvind torfinn said walking up we could all enjoy a joke like that laughing still ulric did tell him have you ever heard anything more ridiculous in all your born days he finished one could do worse than his majesty has done earl eyvind said sure he could have killed me outright instead of leaving me to rot in that hole under the palace count hamnet said eyvind torfinn turned red hamnet went on i was hoping the rulers would chuck him into the same cell i had but no such luck he spread his hands too bad eh i can certainly understand how you have cause to feel resentment toward him your grace eyvind said stiffly resentment isnt the word your splendor hamnet thyssen answered what i want to do is i want to hunt him with hounds since i didnt get the chance to do that i wouldnt have minded if the rulers hunted him with mammoths which they did the only trouble is they havent caught him yet more stiffly still eyvind said i fail to see why you continue to prosecute this war against the invaders then for raumsdalia not for sigvat for raumsdalia hamnet said theres a difference whether you can see it or not and what would raumsdalia be without sigvat eyvind asked coldly better off by god count hamnet said better off ulric skakki whooped and clapped his hands early eyvind looked from one of them to the other as if hed just discovered them in his apple let me rephrase that what would the empire of raumsdalia be without its emperor oh the empire needs an emperor no doubt about it hamnet said but it needs sigvat the way a man with a bloody flux needs a purge he set ulric laughing and clapping again eyvind torfinn looked pained he is doing the best job he can thats what im afraid of hamnet said not only ulric but trasamund laughed then even runolf skallagrim smiled if the times ever settle down his majesty will not thank you for the way you speak of him eyvind said when he did thank me i wound up in his godcursed dungeons hamnet exclaimed i dont want his thanks if he leaves me alone ill thank him dont hold your breath your grace ulric said he rounded on earl eyvind and if the times ever do settle down your splendor youll know whom to thank wont you not sigvat he got raumsdalia into this mess because he didnt want to listen to count hamnet or to me or to trasamund or to anybody else who actually had some notion of what was going on and i hope you recall who rescued you from the rulers that wasnt the emperor either that was hamnet here i am not ungrateful eyvinds words couldnt have had sharper edges if hed chipped them out of ice nevertheless he is not the rightful sovereign of this realm sigvat is and if thats not a judgment on raumsdalia bugger me with a mammoth tusk if i know what would be trasamund said earl eyvind threw up his hands this discussion is pointless he said and walked away he means we dont think hes right trasamund said hes not used to anybody who doesnt ill tell you something ulric said hamnet here would bloody well make a better emperor than sigvat even a blind man can see that i should hope so trasamund said a blind man even a blind musk ox could see that hamnet started to laugh then he saw runolf nodding too and realized it was no laughing matter if runolf could nod at the idea of replacing sigvat plenty of other people would do the same thing he had to nip it in the bud if he was going to nip it at all i dont want to be emperor he said but raumsdalia needs you yes that was runolf skallagrim raumsdalia needs somebody who isnt sigvat raumsdalia needs almost anybody who isnt sigvat but raumsdalia doesnt need me hamnet said i wont sit on that throne no matter what if we proclaim you everyone will accept you ulric said sigvats made his name stink like a dead ground sloth i will not sit on that throne hamnet repeated you may not have a choice baron runolf said we wouldnt do it for your sake wed do it for raumsdalia no hamnet thyssen drew his sword the blade had some nicks and some rust he needed to hone it but the point was still sharp which was all that mattered now if you try to name me emperor ill fall on this thing you know me every one of you knows me am i lying if you want to get rid of me keep on in the direction youre already riding ulric and runolf and trasamund eyed him they eyed the sword they eyed one another runolf skallagrim let out a long sigh i think he means it i know bloody well he means it ulric skakki sounded disgusted he scowled at count hamnet youre stubborn when it does you good and youre stubborn even when it doesnt you might as well be a mountain sheep the way you always want to butt heads your servant sir hamnet bowed as ulric often did he didnt let go of the sword if you were my servant maybe youd listen to me once in a while ulric flicked a finger toward the blade put that silly thing away we wont make you ventilate your liver no matter how tempting it is if he wont do it one of you other raumsdalians ought to trasamund said how about you skakki youre sneaky enough and to spare you are joking my dear fellowarent you ulric said in convincing amazement a cabbage has as much noble blood as i do which is to say not a drop so what if you dont tell people wholl know trasamund said most of the time you would be right ulric said but youd be wrong often enough to fill raumsdalia full of civil wars all the real nobles would look down their noses at me i wouldnt by god hamnet said if you can do the job youre welcome to it far as im concerned you couldnt be worse than sigvat there you see trasamund said triumphantly hurrah for ulric i oh shut up you blond fool ulric said i see runolf here looking like grim death is what i see and runolf is more your usual kind of noble than hamnet is i would want an emperor of noble blood runolf skallagrim said slowly whats the point to noble blood if not to show who deserves to rule well then why dont you take the crown ulric said youre a baron so youre fit enough and youre not sigvat which gives you a leg up all by itself you wouldnt need to worry that youre stealing the throne from me because i dont want it any more than thyssen does me emperor of raumsdalia me runolf sounded flabbergasted then he started to laugh thats the funniest thing ive heard in i dont know when ever i bet he laughed some more maybe eyvind torfinn would take it on trasamund said hamnet started to say something about that but swallowed it he had nothing in particular against the idea of emperor eyvind the idea of empress gudrid if she were empress how long would he last as long as he could outrun her henchmen he guessed and not a heartbeat longer but his comrades already knew as much what point to beating them over the head with it if gudrids word became law ulric was another man with a fine future behind him well trasamund said and then maybe not i do believe thats one of the smarter things youve ever come out with ulric said i wouldnt have thought you had it in you trasamund said something pungent ulric grinned and nodded which spoiled it for the jarlas ulric no doubt intended hrmph trasamund said all i want to tell you is this empire cant be anything much if none of you bastards wants to take charge of it nobody argued with him there either that also seemed to disconcert him snow sleet cold rain snow again more and more of it yes the breath of god was blowing hamnet thyssen thought longingly of raumsdalias far southwest where thing like this didnt happen of course the far southwest had manche raiders and poisonous serpents and scorpions to say nothing of earthquakes that could flatten towns in the blink of an eye count hamnet thought of serpents again when gudrid came up to him and said i need to talk with you so what he turned away i dont need to talk with you oh yes you do she sounded very sure of herself but then when didnt she he didnt care i dont need to listen to you either he said and walked away she came after him she set a hand on his arm to slow him down angrily he shook her off the last thing he wanted to feel was her touch you are going to hear me she said expecting as usual to get her way i should have left you for the rulers he said harshly you could try telling them what to do and see how they like it dont be more stupid than you can help gudrid said with a shudder ive already done that hamnet answered you cured me of iti hope will you please listen to me when was the last time shed said please to him he couldnt remember it had been years he was sure of that he shook his head anyhow if youve got anything that needs saying you can tell it to ulric or trasamund and you can leave me the demon alone dont you care about raumsdalia yes and i know you dont all you care about is youand sticking pins in me so you can watch me jerk and twist and bleed well find somebody else because i dont want to play any more you fool you could be emperor he stared at her then he laughed in her face which made her stare at him are you out of your mind i dont want the bloody job i wouldnt take it on a golden platter ive been saying so to everyone who wanted to listen i suppose that lets you out but i mean every word of it you could be emperor gudrid repeated as if he hadnt spoken how can anybody not want to be emperor believe me its easy hamnet answered i dont want to i wont and nobody can make me not you not trasamund not ulricnobody not marcovefa either gudrids voice was sly but hamnet shook his head not marcovefa either she has the sense to believe me when i say something like thatunlike some people i could name she ignored his sarcasm he might have known she would she always did think what you could do if you were emperor she said everyone would have to do what you told him to do or else hed pay for it the look he gave her made the breath of god seem warm by comparison i could send you to the dungeon i could take your head and nail it to the north gate to warn other people not to be like you dont be silly you wouldnt do that she might have been talking to a foolish little boy before he could tell her that he would she went on if you really wanted me dead you would have killed me yourself a long time ago you had your chances nobody would have said anything much not then hamnet thyssen bit down on that like a man unexpectedly biting down on a cherrystone why hadnt he killed her when he found out she was unfaithful not just once but again and again i loved you fool that i was he growled now gudrid laughed at him you just wanted somebody around who could make you feel bad you made a mess of things with liv the same way and youll do the same thing with marcovefa you cant be happy unless youre unhappy what sort of nonsense is that hamnet said but like what shed come out with a moment earlier it sounded much less nonsensical than he wished it did she laughed again knowingly this time you can tell it isnt nonsense if you werent such a fool you would have figured it out for yourself long since did she want him to hit her would she get perverse pleasure of her own from seeing what she could goad him into he breathed out hard through his nose say whatever you please you will anyhow but i can prove youre wrong how her chin lifted defiantly he took a certain sour pleasure in noting how the flesh under her jawbone had started to sag she wasntquiteimmune to time except for being married to you again nothing would make me unhappier than being emperor he said and i still dont want to do it so much for your fancy talk think of all the women you could have just with the wave of a hand gudrid said screwing is one thing caring is anothernot that you know anything about that hamnet said not that you know anything about either one gudrid retorted hamnet didnt hit her then either though his hands balled into fists he turned and walked away once more when she started to come after him again he walked faster pretty soon he left her behind he stood out in the middle of a trampled field wondering how much good that did him inside the empire warfare slowed down during the winter food and fodder were hard to come by that didnt always stop the bizogots who could get by with less than raumsdalians could and it didnt stop the rulers either the country they sprang from was no richer than the bizogot steppe they kept striking at count hamnets band sometimes with warriors sometimes with wizards sometimes with both they didnt try to wipe out all the bizogots and raumsdalians in arms against themtheyd learned the hard way that that didnt work not when marcovefa was involved but their nuisance raids went on he posted a couple of bizogots out in a temptingly open position and put himself and marcovefa and half a troop of raumsdalian archers and lancers in a forest not far away marcovefa cast a light masking spell to try to make sure the rulers wouldnt notice the ambush what if their shaman spots the spell hamnet asked her i dont think he can but if he does those bizogots out thereshe pointed toward the exposed menare lucky because the rulers go and bother us somewhere else he didnt want the invaders to do that but held his peace if marcovefa didnt think an enemy sorcerer could detect her magic she was likely right if she turned out to be wrong hamnet would try something else that was all hed guessed right or baited his trap the right way inside of a couple of hours a dozen or so rulers came out of the barebranched woods to the south the bizogots out in the open played dumb a little longer than they would have if they were nothing but ordinary pickets but only a little they werent out there to throw their lives away but to get the rulers to do that instead when they couldnt ignore the men bearing down on them any more they turned their horses and trotted off in hamnets direction one of the rulers pointed at them the horses slowed then stopped baby magic marcovefa said scornfully a pika could do this you can break the spell then hamnet asked oh yes but not yet no point yet marcovefa said let them get closer up came the rulers on their riding deer they soon could have shot the bizogots out of the saddle but they didnt chances were they wanted to have fun with them because of their own horror of being captured they often amused themselves by tormenting prisoners the bizogots should have dismounted and run when their horses faltered they just sat there instead the spell must have seized them too it didnt seem like baby magic to hamnet thyssen but marcovefa had different standards her face wore a foxy look of intense concentration hamnet peered out toward the rulers they were in easy archery range close enough for him to see their grins one of them nodded toward the two bizogots they all laughed the laughs sounded nasty to hamnet maybe that was his imagination maybe not too they seemed to have no idea his troop was anywhere nearby marcovefas masking spell was working anyhow when things happened they happened all at once one instant the rulers wizard was laughing and joking with his friends the next his riding deers antlers caught fire hamnet heard his startled squawk and the animals screech of pain at the same time the magic holding the bizogots and their horses dissolved they galloped for the cover of the woods loose hamnet called his mens bowstrings thrummed several ordinary rulers tumbled off their riding deer the ones who didnt fall turned and raced south as fast as their mounts would go charge hamnet bellowed at the top of his lungs horses were faster than riding deernot much but enough none of the rulers made it into the trees from which theyd emerged some went down fighting others seeing themselves about to be captured cut their own throats or plunged daggers into their chests their wizard had somehow suppressed the flames that sprang from his riding deers antlers like a shortfaced bear at bay he turned to face marcovefa and the raumsdalians with her he yammered something in his unintelligible language marcovefa only laughed that seemed to infuriate him more than anything else she might have done instead of aiming a spell at her he drew his sword and charged the riding deer obeyed him as if it were unhurt that impressed hamnet more than he wanted to admit it did the wizard no good at all bows twanged his magic turned a few arrows but it couldnt turn them allnot when marcovefa worked against him it couldnt he and the riding deer went down together their blood steamed in the snow too bad in a way hamnet said we might have got some interesting answers if wed been able to question him hes dead that is interesting enough marcovefa said they are all dead let the rulers worry about them let the rulers try to guess what happened to them yes let the rulers worry count hamnet might have liked it better had one enemy warrior got away to tell his friends exactly what had happened then he could hope they would stop trying to pick off sentries but leaving them in the dark about their fellows fate wasnt the worst thing in the world either look a lancer pointed up into the sky the ravens are already circling waiting for us to leave and the vultures hamnet said and then he spotted a truly enormous bird high in the air and a teratorn cursed scavengers the trooper said dont want them gnawing my bones when im gone what difference does it make then marcovefa asked better that the scavengers eat you than that the enemy does the lancer stared at her no doubt thinking she was joking she smiled back knowing she wasnt xv even well south of nidaros the breath of god pressed hard hamnet thyssen had expected nothing else the glacier might fall back one day it might vanish altogether but it still ruled the weather through most of raumsdalia life went on so did the war against the rulers raumsdalians and bizogots knew how to handle themselves in blizzards the invaders from beyond the gap did too bands of curlybearded men on riding deer appeared out of the swirling snow when they met marcovefa they soon regretted it when they didnt their warriors were a fair match for hamnets men and their wizards had more strength than liv and audun and the handful of other sorcerers whod joined them hamnet found his army getting forced north no matter what he did heand more to the point marcovefacould only be in one place at one time if the rulers struck in two or three places at once they were bound to break through somewhere they were bound to and they did he hated going north not only did it mean the rulers had retaken the initiative it also made the weather worse every mile seemed to mean more snow thicker clouds and worse cold and every mile farther north also seemed to mean worse foraging he got tired of listening to his belly growl everything will turn out all right this is still rich country marcovefa said to you maybe count hamnet said irritablyyes he was hungry all right youre happy if you can charm mice out from under the snow why not meat is meat marcovefa said shed done that more than once she ate mouse stew and toasted mouse with every sign of enjoyment shed eaten voles and pikas up on top of the glacier and mice and rabbits werent much different raumsdalians and bizogots caught rabbits but they drew the line at mice if they got too much hungrier though they might have to undraw it marcovefa went on up on the glacier not so much snow to hide under animals here have it easy people here have it easy too yes yes hamnet had heard that too often enough to get tired of it but what seems easy for you doesnt always seem easy to us you dont seem to have figured that out yet as long as everything will be all right what difference does it make marcovefa said as long as hamnet drummed his fingers on his thigh things dont look all right to me by god you dont see far enough said the shaman from atop the glacier well how am i supposed to hamnet thyssen waved a mittened hand through the blowing snow im lucky if i can see the nose in front of my face as a matter of fact he couldnt see it right now a woolen scarf helpedsometo keep it from freezing marcovefa who also covered her nose and mouth laughed at him that is not what i meant i am talking about time if im going to live happily ever after gods hidden it from me mighty well hamnet agreed she looked at him all he could see were her eyes and eyes by themselves showed surprisingly little expression even so he guessed hed disappointed her sure enough she said no one lives happily ever after living hurts dying hurts if you are lucky enough to find someone to love you die or the other person dies and that hurts too that hurts maybe worse than anything or you stop loving each other hamnet said harshly yes or that marcovefa agreed so why talk nonsense about happily ever after you always do know how to cheer me up hamnet told her i think ill go fall on my sword now if he was looking for sympathyand he washe didnt get much marcovefa shook her head not yet she said you still have too many things to do first later if you want to but not yet no eh nothing made hamnet more intent on doing something than being told he couldnt who the demon would stop me who the demon would care i would that was what he wanted to hear marcovefa only shrugged and said go ahead and try you see then demons take me if i dont hamnet was suddenly sick of carrying the world around on his shoulders he tramped away kicked at the snow till he found some rocks and propped his sword up in them point uppermost it would hurt for a little while but not long if he fell properly then the rest of the fools could bollix things up to their blundering hearts content no one would be able to blame him any more he positioned himself with great carehe didnt want this to last any longer than it had to disgusted with the world disgusted with himself he fell forward instead of piercing him the blade went with him and he measured the length in the snow one of the rocks that had held up the hilt caught him in the pit of the stomach oof he saida most undignified noise he spent the next couple of minutes fighting for breath when he finally got it back he climbed to his feet rubbing the sore spot someone less determinedsomeone less pigheadedwould have given up there hamnet thyssen had always prided himself on his stubbornness he brushed snow off himself then started to laugh why was he bothering methodically he set up the sword again he braced it more firmly this time and threw himself down as hard as he could the sword snapped a rockmaybe the same one as last timegot him in the pit of the stomach once more oof he repeated this time it really hurt for a moment he thought hed killed himself even if he hadnt stabbed himself at last though he managed to suck in a shuddering breath and then another he wouldnt perish for lack of air he wouldnt perish from falling on that sword either he picked up the nub with the hilt hed had no idea the blade was flawed maybe one of the blows hed exchanged with the rulers had cracked it if hed gone on fighting a little longer suddenly he would have been most embarrassed or maybe god just didnt intend to let him die right now he looked at the broken sword for a long time then he muttered an obscenity and threw the hilt and nub away as hard as he could snow puffed up where the fragment landed after another oath he brushed more snow off himself he started back toward camp he was perhaps halfway there when he realized he still had his dagger and could slash it across his throat or slit his wrist he didnt suppose it would break in his hand but the black moment had passed he went on walking anyone have a spare sword hamnet asked i do ulric skakki said what happened to yours broke hamnet mimed snapping a stick with his hands just like that one of the adventurers eyebrows rose what were you doing with it trying to kill myself hamnet said ulric laughed ask a stupid question you deserve the answer you get he rummaged in the leather sack that held his worldly goods then handed hamnet a sword in a battered leather sheath here you go itll probably suit you better than me anyhow a little long and clumsy for my taste but youre bigger than i am thanks count hamnet drew it he tried a few cuts kind of pointheavy he remarked better for slashing than for thrusting thats what you want if youre fighting from horseback ulric said i hope i will be hamnet said foot soldiers were at a grim disadvantage against mounted men who could strike from aboveand who could leave infantry behind in a matter of minutes trasamund had been trimming his nails with a clasp knife that must have come from inside the empire finishing the job he looked up and asked why did you want to kill yourself this time the time before hamnet had warned that he wouldnt let himself live if anyone tried to make him emperor now now he only shrugged the impulse had passed and seemed to have belonged to someone else it seemed like a good idea at the time kill rulers instead the jarl said when theyre gone you can do whatever you want to yourself till then you have more important things to worry about thank you so much hamnet thyssen bowed i dont know what id do with my life if i didnt have someone to run it for me not my job trasamund shook his head you want someone to run your life you need a woman since you have a woman she has to do it he seemed as pleased with himself as a geometer with a new proof reminded of marcovefa hamnet was already reminded why and how hed broken his sword he didnt like to think about that he would probably go through it again and again in his nightmares but which would be the more terrifying dream the one where the sword snapped or the one where it didnt what are we going to do to keep the rulers from pushing us back farther ulric asked if marcovefa could lay eggs if she hatched out twenty more like her wed have a pretty good chance or if she could be in four places at once she cant hamnet said bleakly were lucky she can be one place at once by god i know what we need to do ulric skakkis bright assured tone made hamnet certain that whatever he proposed it wouldnt be anything they could actually manage and it wasnt we need to go back to the glacier climb it again and bring back some more shamans like her go ahead hamnet said hurry back ill see you here in three or four days right but of course ulric grinned at him they were both spouting nonsense and they both knew it the difference was it amused ulric and didnt come close to amusing count hamnet wouldnt help anyhow trasamund said the other shamans would come from different clans theyd likelier go after marcovefa or one another than the rulers why should they care about a bunch of people theyve never seen before if youre going to complain about every little thing ulric said trasamund snorted after a moment ulric went on well all right how about this instead of these shamans we set all the shortfaced bears moving against the rulers they mostly dont sleep through the winter the way black bears do thats hamnets voice trailed away hed started to say it was ridiculous but it wasnt what came out of his mouth was thats not a halfbad notion it isnt by god trasamund agreed bears are trouble if theyd go after the rulers that would give those miserable mammoth foreskins all kinds of grief have mammoths got foreskins ulric sounded intrigued it only matters to another mammoth hamnet assured him now we need to see whether marcovefa laughs at us for coming up with a foolish notion or whether she thinks she can make a magic like that i meant it for a joke you know ulric skakki said so what count hamnet answered a shipwright means a mast to hold the sails that doesnt mean a drowning man wont hang on to it to keep his head above water lets go talk to marcovefa yes lets trasamund started away from the fire not long before hamnet thyssen had wished he were dead and done his best to make his wish come true now he was going off to find marcovefa with a new scheme to bedev il the invaders that was very strangejust how strange he didnt think about till much later marcovefas eyes glinted when she saw hamnet you see she said it is not so easy after all never mind that he answered and she laughed out loud he and trasamund and ulric skakki took turns explaining what they had in mind hamnet finished with an eager question can you do that it is a thought of weight it may be a thought of merit marcovefas gaze went far away as she weighed possibilitiesor for all hamnet knew impossibilities after a long pause she said it may be yes have we here men of the bear clan have we men whose spirit animal is the shortfaced bear raumsdalians didnt define themselves in those terms bizogots did marcovefa whose people sprang from bizogot stock must have known as much i will ask among the folk who come from the free plains trasamund said then his bluntfeatured face clouded the plains that once were free i should say if marcovefa noticed the amendment she paid no attention to it find one of them she said bring him to me i will see what i can do i promise nothing but i will try off trasamund went he came back half an hour later with a scarred bizogot he introduced as grimoald he is of the bear claws clan he said sure enough grimoald wore a necklace of claws good marcovefa said these are the claws of the shortfaced bear she sounded likeand wassomeone making sure they are grimoald said those are the only bears in the bizogot country trasamund said they have others down here and we saw still others beyond the glacier but if a man is of the bear claws clan they are the claws of the shortfaced bear all right fine marcovefa said shall we move these bears against our foes if you know how shaman i would like to do that grimoald said if i can help you do it i will you can marcovefa told him are you allowed to take off those claws may i hold them you may grimoald lifted the necklace off over his head and handed it to her i would not do this for any stranger but for a foe of the rulers i will do anything i can i am a foe of the rulers marcovefa said you may doubt many things but you should not doubt that she gave the bear claws an oddly tender look as she held them in her hand she might almost have been holding a newborn baby not these souvenirs of one of the most dangerous beasts the world knew of course a baby would grow up to be a creature that made a souvenir of shortfaced bear claws hamnet scowled wishing that hadnt crossed his mind the song marcovefa crooned was also oddly tender it sounded more like a lullaby than a charm off in the distance though hamnet heard growls and snarls that didnt seem at all soothing youre sure this spell is aimed at the rulers grimoald asked so hamnet wasnt the only one that chorus alarmed marcovefa gave the man from the bear claws clan a brighteyed almost carnivorous smile i am almost sure she said almost now grimoald sounded genuinely frightened thats not good enough if they come after us shes having you on count hamnet told him are you sure the bizogot sounded anything but convinced then he took a long look at marcovefas face her smile plainly was hiding a laugh grimoald saw as much he looked as sheepish as a bizogot was ever likely to well i guess you are he said to hamnet he is marcovefa agreed she handed back the necklace grimoald made haste to put it on again marcovefa added what these shortfaced bears can do to the rulers they will do thats good grimoald clutched some of the claws they clicked together almost like worry beads hamnet thyssen hoped the invaders would soon be the ones doing the worrying if they were it didnt show right away skirmishing between the rulers and the raumsdalians and bizogots went on every day sometimes hamnets men had the advantage sometimes they didnt a week after marcovefas magic they were farther north than they had been when she tried the spell overall then the rulers had advanced more than theyd retreated maybe i should go climb the glacier again ulric skakki said we could use more fancy shamans well so we could hamnet said but we need you around here too you know you say the sweetest things ulric batted his eyelashes at hamnet how do i know i can believe you though you probably say them to everybody oh for gods sake hamnet exploded im not trying to seduce you a good thing im as dull and normal as you arei like women too ulric said im sure all the women are delighted to hear it hamnet said well now that you mention it so am i ulric was undeniablyand annoyinglysmug hamnet might have gone on harassing him but a whitefaced bizogot came into the encampment calling his name im here hamnet said standing up to let himself be seen whats gone wrong now by the fellows tone he was sure something had all the fellow said was youd better come with me count hamnet had to saddle his horse before he could that did nothing to make him any more enthusiastic especially when the horse didnt want to exhale to let him tighten its girths he kicked it in the ribs that did the trick ulric was saddling his mount too cant let em play games with you he said no hamnet nodded he asked the bizogot should marcovefa see this too whatever it is the man didnt need long to think about that he nodded by god she should all rightgo get her hamnet told him she can ride double with me that way we wont waste any more time nodding again the bizogot hurried away what do you suppose it is marcovefa asked as they started to ride he didnt want to say anything much to me only that it was important thats more than he told me hamnet thyssen answered i figured it out myself thoughi will say that they followed the bizogot across snowcovered fields toward a stand of pines ahead hamnet wondered if they were riding into an ambush he made sure his sword was loose in its scabbard maybe marcovefa would scent that kind of danger ahead he could hope so which didnt mean he was sure of it he checked the sword again marcovefa gave no sign of sensing trouble but that was not to say that she seemed happy oh she said the corners of her mouth turning down do you know what this is about hamnet asked i have a pretty good notion anyhow she answered and fell silent again hamnet muttered under his breath which did him no good at all they rode into the woods the bizogot seemed to be following the trail hed made riding back to the camp all of a sudden he reined in there he said and pointed between two pines something lay in the snow behind them though branches obscured the view whatever it was hamnets horse didnt like it the beast sidestepped and snorted nostrils flaring what is it ulric askedexactly the question in hamnets mind see for yourselves the bizogot answered his face all screwed up when hamnet glanced back at marcovefa he saw she was wearing the same expression yes sure enough she had an idea of what was going on he got down from his horse and tied the reins to a branch marcovefa slid down too ulric skakki also tethered his horse i always love a little excursion during the day the adventurer said brightly dont you no hamnets voice might have come from a talking boulder he drew his sword before pushing past the pines in the way so did ulric marcovefa let them take the lead maybe that meant she thought she needed protection more likely it meant she thought they thought she needed protection she was alarmingly good at taking care of herself hamnet stopped in his tracks behind him ulric made an involuntary noise full of disgust a shortfaced bears head lay in the snow its blood staining the white with red no footprints led away from it neither did a trail of blood drops it might have been dropped there by magic as soon as that thought crossed hamnets mind he realized the bears head probably had been this is the rulers answer to your magic he asked marcovefa she nodded nothing else does it break your spells ulric asked or does it just say they know the spell is there and they defy you she reached out with a mittened hand as if feeling the air in front of her when that didnt tell her what she wanted to know she stepped past hamnet and ulric stooped beside the bears head and laid her hand just above one ear she recoiled her mouth twisting the spell is broken she said can you restore it count hamnet asked and then on second thought is there any point to restoring it i think not marcovefa answered i could do it but they would only break it again they would have an easier time breaking it again because theyve already done it once and they know how the bizogot whod found the bears head came up behind them now you know he said now we know hamnet agreed you could have told us back at the camp it would have saved a lot of time no the bizogot spat in the snow some things you need to see for yourself when grimoald hears of this the war against the rulers will be to the death for him they have desecrated his clan animal hamnet thyssen found himself nodding the bizogots took such things as the deadliest of insults ulric skakki sometimes enjoyed being difficult for the sake of being difficult he said but grimoald wears the bearclaw necklace why should he care if someone else goes hunting it is not the same thing the bizogot seemed shocked that ulric couldnt see as much grimoald hunted with reverence he killed with reverence not like this he pointed to the bears head which did indeed seem a sad dejected object it may have mattered to grimoald yes ulric was determined to be difficult today how much did it matter to the beasts they ended up dead either way it matters that wasnt the scandalized bizogot but marcovefa to the bears spirit it matters very much whether it was killed by a warrior with respect and awe or by an enemy in hate and you know this because ulric said he was bound to be teasing but marcovefa answered anyhow because i do because i can feel it ask any shaman they will all tell you the same people tell me lots of different things ulric said figuring out whats true is half the fun this is true marcovefa declared do you say i am lying hamnet thyssen would not have cared to say any such thing to her evidently ulric didnt either which struck hamnet as uncommonly sensible of the adventurer well no ulric allowed but i do say you could be wrong i could be marcovefa said with the air of someone making a great and undeserved concession i could be yes but i am not as i tell you ask liv ask audun gilli if they tell you i am wrong they know less of magic than i think they do never mind all this fancy talk said the bizogot whod found the shortfaced bears head what do we do now the first thing i must do is tell the bear i am sorry for the indignity it suffered marcovefa answered in the bizogot language commonly used on the steppe north of the empire then she switched to her own dialect hamnet could follow only a word here and there he got just enough to gather that she was doing what shed said she would maybeevidentlythe apology made her feel better whether it did the same thing for the bear he was less sure ulric skakkis upraised eyebrow probably said he harbored some of the same doubts if he did though he didnt come right out and say so challenging marcovefa once was not for the faint of heart challenging her more than once very bold or very very foolish at last she seemed satisfied with what shed done she picked up what had to be a symbolic handful of snow and dropped it on the head then she returned to the usual bizogot language to say we can go now it is appeased after a moment she looked south toward the rulers camps it is appeased she repeated it is but i am not when marcovefa said she wasnt appeased she meant it marcovefa commonly meant what she said her cold fury puzzled hamnet the bears killed rulers they must have he said the next day why not expect the rulers to kill bears she looked at himlooked through him rather i do expect them to kill bears killing is part of war killing like that she shook her head no what can you do about it anything they will pay oh they will pay marcovefa was still looking through him he wondered whether her eyes saw any of the real world then he wondered how real the world was and whether what she saw wasnt truer closer to the absolute heart of things than the campfire and the snow and the smell of horses on the breeze he didnt know he was trapped forever in mundane reality and the orderly succession of time marcovefa had proved she wasnt she went on their doom hangs over them like a crag of ice may it be so hamnet said how do we make it fall on them what abruptly marcovefa seemed back in the hereandnow hamnet realized she had no idea what shed just said it shook him less than it might have hed seen the same thing from her before and from others who trafficked in magic as well he told her what shed told him she looked at him in surprise i said that im not making this up you know he answered no you are not marcovefa sounded more sure than an ordinary person had any business being well whatever else she was an ordinary person she wasnt if i said it and i do not know that i said it it is likely to be so from anyone else something like that would have been lunacy coming from marcovefa it made an odd kind of sense or hamnet thought it did anyhow which might have proved nothing except that his own grasp on sanity was starting to slip how do we make their doom fall on them he asked again i cannot tell you that i wish i could she said it will come when the golden shrine is found again it will hamnet wondered if she would have any idea shed come out with that she did yes it will the doom of the rulers and finding the golden shrine are bound together how hamnet asked eagerly marcovefa spread her hands they were callused and scarred the hands of a person whod worked hard all her life to survive up atop the glacier not even shamans had an easy time of it i do not know she replied when it happens you will see her smile pulled up only half her mouth and so will i and it will surprise both of us what do we do in the meantime hamnet said fight the rulers what else can we do if they win if they evade their doom prophecy melts like snow on a southfacing slope in summer hamnet thyssen scratched his head then how is it prophecy if we fight them hard they wont win i hope they wont anyhow marcovefa said but you arent sure hamnet persisted i am sure of what i know but one of the things i know is that i dont know everything there is to know marcovefa replied he scratched his head again does anybody know anything he asked of course just not enough by the way marcovefa said that she meant it to be reassuring to hamnet it was anything but he didnt push it any further though if he did he feared he would end up feeling like a dog chasing its own tail compared to trying to understand what prophecy meant riding out on patrol was a relief he knew what he was doing there looking for enemy warriors he knew what he would do if he found them too either fight or run away depending on how many of them there were he didnt mind having marcovefa along either since on patrol they werent trying to understand the whichness of what if he came across one of the rulers shamans chances were marcovefa could beat the man that thought unfortunately brought hamnet back to the whichness of what not long before he would have taken it for granted the marcovefa could beat the rulers wizards he still thought she could but he wasnt sure any more that couldnt be a good sign neither could the way his force of bizogots and raumsdalians kept falling back toward the north if this went on theyd retreat past nidaros before long when would they end up back in the great northern forests again when would they end up on the bizogot plains beyond the forests it would not be so bad marcovefa said when he asked her about it not to you maybe hamnet answered but this is better no she said things are as they are meant to be this is as it is meant to be i do not worry about it no matter what happens you dont hamnet said well i do by god suppose something happens to you what would we do then we cant beat the rulers without you weve already proved that curse it you proved you did not beat them yes marcovefa said you did not prove you could not beat them hamnet saw the difference no matter what he saw to him it was too subtle to matter if the bizogots and raumsdalians hadnt beaten the rulers without the shaman from atop the glacier what were the chances they could suddenly start doing it now woefully slim he thought he caught motion from the corner of his eye it wasnt the kind of motion he was used to the kind a man on a horse made riding deer had a gait with more upanddown to it the rulers probably thought horses were the ones that moved oddly that was their worry not his one of the raumsdalian troopers in the patrol also spotted the enemy riders theres some of the bastards he said and strung his bow in one quick practiced motion lets drive em off he swung his horse toward the south sounds good to me count hamnet said also stringing his bow have they got a wizard with them he asked marcovefa yes i think so she didnt sound worried about it but then when did she the rulers didnt need long to realize their foes had seen them they could have pulled back into the trees but they didnt even though their patrol was smaller than the one hamnet led they didnt charge forward either they held their ground so they could shoot from mounts that werent moving with their recurved bows they made formidable archers their arrows fell among the bizogots and raumsdalians before hamnets men could hit them marcovefa swore in her dialect a shaft had grazed her hand a moment before hitting the leather of her saddle it didnt pierce the saddle and wound her horse good luck went through hamnets mind then marcovefa slumped over unconscious or dead poison hamnet gaspedit was the first thing he thought of he grabbed her and steadied her so she wouldnt fall down and get trampled her eyes had rolled up in her head he saw nothing but white when he peeled back an eyelid nothing to do but flee when their main shield was taken away the rulers pursued for a little while their harsh jeers said they had a good notion of what theyd done but again horses outdistanced riding deer hamnet thyssen wondered if it mattered xvi marcovefa lay in front of hamnet splayed over the saddle like a stag killed in the hunt by the time the patrol got back to camp she wasnt dead her heart beat and her breathing stayed steady but try as hamnet would he couldnt rouse her he led her horse the arrow that had grazed her still stuck up from the animals saddle something was strange about the point it seemed to be made not of iron or bronze or chipped stone or carved bone but of leaves of some sort leaves of course had no business hurting anyone unless they were poisonous even then hamnet had never heard of a venom that could strike so swiftly from such a small wound hed never heard of any such thing no but the rulers had when people in the camp saw marcovefa all limp and pale it as was if theyd had their hearts plucked from their chests some of them hung backthey didnt seem to want to know any more others rushed forward is she slain trasamund demandedas usual he came straight to the point hamnet thyssen shook his head no its sorcery wheres liv wheres audun they rushed through the crowd what happened to her audun gilli asked that did count hamnet pointed to the arrow it only scratched her but shes been like this ever since it did get her down liv said hamnet obeyed liv and audun steadied marcovefa so he could dismount without dropping her then he carried her to the tent the two of them shared and laid her down on a fur robe there audun uncinched the saddle from marcovefas horse instead of pulling the arrow out of it he lugged the saddle after hamnet was that excessive caution or common sense hamnet would have liked to blame the wizard for it but found he couldnt liv tied back the tent flaps to let in more light then she stooped by marcovefa as hamnet had before her she checked the other shamans pulse and peeled back an eyelid marcovefa showed no signs of consciousness i dont think she will die right away liv said as much consolation as she had to offer no neither do i if hamnet said it maybe it would come true but how could the rulers dothisto her liv was silent that hardly surprised hamnet no wizard liked to see another wizardespecially one more powerful than shebrought down but then his voice even more hesitant than usual audun said i think the arrowhead is made with mistletoe he spoke in raumsdalian even now he wasnt fluent in the bizogots tongue foreign languages werent easy for him livs raumsdalian was also imperfect what is this mistletoe she asked audun sent hamnet a look of appeal the only trouble was hamnet didnt know how to say mistletoe in the bizogots language he did the best he could he explained what mistletoe was he wondered if that would mean anything to liv the bizogot steppe was treeless of course so why would she know anything about the parasites that grew on trees but she did her eyes widened hed forgotten what a deep blue they were levigild the hero she exclaimed count hamnet had heard a good many bizogot tales or legends or whatever they were that one was new to him though by auduns blank look it was new to him too what happened to this levigild hamnet asked his mother wanted to make him safe from all the danger she could liv answered she got everything in the world to promise not to harm him but she forgot about the mistletoeto her it wasnt worth remembering god didnt like what she was doing because he was afraid levigild would be a rival so he had a blind man make an arrow with mistletoe for a head he shot it not even knowing levigild was anywhere near him the arrow hit levigild in the chest and he died this arrow only grazed marcovefa hamnet said she isnt deadshes just out can you bring her back i would not know where to begin against mistletoe liv said which was exactly what hamnet didnt want to hear reluctantly he turned to audun gilli use the man whod taken one woman from him to save another he wouldnt have if he thought he had any other choice if audun did save marcovefa how would she show she was grateful however she wants to and damn all youll have to say about it hamnet thought what can you do for her gilli he asked roughly god audun said i dont know if i can do anything im not a healer you know that you know what kind of wizard i am thyssen as if to remind hamnet a cheap burntclay cup grew lips and said he doesnt ask for much does he heal her from a sorcery nobody knows anything about sure that sounds easy hamnets ears heated he did know what kind of wizard audun gilli was worse luck you knew something about the wound anyhow he said you cant blame me for hoping no one should be blamed for hoping liv said softly not ever yes you can say that cant you hamnets voice was bleak enough to make her flinch but his desperation drove him to speak directly to her again please see what you can do to help her liv me but i told you you knew about this levigild hamnet thyssen was proud of himself for coming up with the legendary bizogots name well yes but liv struggled to put what she was thinking into words hamnet i told youi know nothing of mistletoe except the legend i would never have recognized it audun did that remember yes i know the look count hamnet sent audun gilli failed to annihilate him though not from lack of effort it did make him turn red which seemed a less than adequate substitute hamnet went on but since he doesnt want to try i was hoping you might we cant beat the rulers without marcovefa you know it isnt that gilli doesnt want to try the cup said puffing out ceramic cheeks it never should have owned its just that he doesnt think he can do her any good crackpots everywhere hamnet said sadly liv flinched again perhaps for a different reason this time even the cup winced count hamnet continued i would ask this if marcovefa were not my lover i would ask this if she were a man we need her the fight needs her i know i understand i believe you liv looked and sounded dreadfully unhappy but i dont know what i can do here i dont know if i can do anything and failing might be worse than not trying at all how hamnet demanded is that even possible worse is always possible that wasnt livit was audun better may not be but worse always is nothing is so mucked up that you cant muck it up worse if ive learned one thing in life by god thats it hamnet thought it over reluctantly he decided audun had a point all the same he said if you leave her like this shes liable to die what happens to us if she does what happens to me if she does but that was a different questionin most ways he supposed a lesser question we will do what we can for her hamnet and for you liv responded to what hamnet had said and to what he hadnt audun gilli couldnt have looked less delighted if shed told him he needed a tooth pulled and they were all out of poppy juice but he didnt walk away or say no and count hamnet gave him grudging respect on account of that what can you do hamnet asked our best audun answered how good itll be he shrugged we just have to find out thats all so we do coming from livs mouth it didnt sound like such a pronouncement of doom she studied the inert marcovefa as she might have studied a track on bad ground then she asked audun what do you think the charm with the moonstone perhaps perhaps audun said in tones of deep skepticism in an aside to hamnet thyssen he went on if we set a moonstone under her tongue with the proper spell it is supposed to kindle her mind and make her wits sharp that sounds like exactly what she needs hamnet exclaimed more slowly reacting to the wizards tone he added why arent you happier about it because most of the time it doesnt do what the grimoires claim it does audun gilli answered take any book of recipesyoull find a few that dont turn out a dish youd want to eat its the same way with sorcery i shouldnt wonder if its the same way with everything and the moonstone spell is like that it sounds better than it eats if you know what i mean ive made it work liv said not all the time but sometimes anyhow then you cast it this time if you have faith in it its more likely to do what you want it to audun said ill try it yes liv hesitated before adding if thats all right with you hamnet of course why do you even ask hamnet said she cant speak for herself now if anyone has the right to speak for her its you liv said so if you dont trust me to work the magic ah i see he nodded as far as i know you dont have anything against marcovefa thats the only thing that would make me say no go ahead liv rummaged in one of the pouches she wore on her belt and then in another one at last she nodded here we are she held a small moonstone in the palm of her hand the stones soft luster reminded count hamnet of the motherofpearl ornaments that sometimes came up into the empire from the lands by the shore of the southern sea youre going to put that under her tongue he asked when liv nodded he went on what do you do if she swallows it ive never seen that happen liv gave the moonstone a thoughtful look its small and smooth it should pass hamnet eyed the stone too after a moment he found himself nodding again when he didnt ask any more questions liv slid the stone into marcovefas mouth marcovefa smiled but didnt open her eyes liv started to chant she used an oldfashioned dialect of the bizogots language but not so oldfashioned that hamnet couldnt follow most of it she called on the moonstone to banish the baneful mistletoe livs hands twisted in quick assured passes hamnet watched audun gilli watching them every once in a while the raumsdalian wizard would nod or smile in appreciation of what they were doing one skilled stonecarver might have watched another work with mallet and chisel the same way oh very nice audun murmured at one point in the proceedings hamnet didnt see anything that struck him as special but he knew he would have also missed most of the fine points of what a stonecarver was doing when a stonecarver finished his work he had some carved stone he could point to then anyone could judge whether hed done well or not so well when liv finished shed have what with any luck at all shed have marcovefa fully restored to herself count hamnet hoped for nothing less livs voice rose so may it be she said and pointed a callused shortnailed index finger at marcovefas faceor perhaps at the moonstone still in marcovefas mouth despite the winter chill sweat soaked her hair and ran down her face she pointed she waited expectantly and nothing happened marcovefa lay there her chest rose and fell her color stayed good but her eyes didnt open she didnt revive oh a pestilence audun gilli said softly liv looked much more distressed than marcovefa did she was also panting from the effort shed put forth it didnt work she said as if that were the worst thing she could think of right this minute it probably was it doesnt seem to have hamnet said would trying it again do any good would your trying it do any good gilli using the raumsdalian wizards family name instead of his individual name was less than friendly but it was as much as hamnet could do audun gilli didnt take offense now as he hadnt before ill try if you want he said i dont know how much good it will do but ill try and he did from the beginning he even took the moonstone out of marcovefas mouth and put it back in before starting his spell that made her smile again but didnt revive her his spell was different from livs he used raumsdalian in place of the bizogots language where liv had almost ordered marcovefa to return to herself audun cajoled her none of the differences mattered even a coppers worth as she had before marcovefa still lay there she wasnt dead but she wasnt among those present either what are we going to do hamnet thyssen heard the despair in his own voice we fought the rulers before we ever met marcovefa liv said we can go on fighting without her neither hamnet nor audun gilli said anything to that they could go on fighting yes they had to in fact and they had fought before the only trouble was they hadnt fought with anything resembling success could they now hamnet had to hope so but he couldnt see how thank you for trying he said halfbowing first to audun and then to liv we need her liv said simply maybe earl eyvind will have some notion of what to try next audun said hes not a wizard but he knows a lot so he does hamnet said morosely audun might have suggested that he ask gudrid that would have been less appealing offhand hamnet couldnt think of anything else that would have been eyvind torfinn and gudrid were eating together when count hamnet found them back in nidaros neither of them would have dreamt of sucking the marrow out of a sheeps leg bone while sprawled out near a fire but hamnet had seen on the journey through the gap that they could rough it when they had to he stood waiting to be noticed gudrid ostentatiously ignored him he didnt mind if anything he preferred having nothing to do with her to having anything to do with her earl eyvind took longer to see hamnet was there than he might have though at last he did what can i do for you your grace he asked well your splendor its like this hamnet thyssen told him what had happened to marcovefa and about the moonstone spell liv had tried i see eyvind said slowly how very unfortunate hamnet never did have much luck with women but this is ridiculous gudrid sounded amused your splendor will you please tell this person i came for your advice not for hers hamnet said oh you can talk straight to me hamnet dear gudrid said its not my fault you dont know what to do with them if you find them again count hamnet spoke to earl eyvind will you please tell her i will kill her if she opens her mouth again about marcovefa will you tell her i am not joking will you remind her well have a demon of a time fighting the rulers without marcovefa and will you also remind her how much she enjoyed their company the last time she ran into them what earl eyvind did say to gudrid was i think you would do well not to provoke count hamnet my sweet i think you would do very well indeed as a matter of fact gudrids eyes flashed she didnt take kindly to anyone who tried to tell her what to do but for a wonder she kept her mouth shut or maybe it wasnt a wonder maybe it was the murder writ large across hamnet thyssens face whatever it was her silence kept him from grabbing his sword and keeping his promise instead he asked earl eyvind what do you know about magics made with moonstones i assume liv told you the legend of levigild the hero eyvind said gudrids eyes glinted again but she stayed quiet one of her gifts was gauging just how far she could goad hamnet without endangering herself shed pushed right to the edgealmost over itthis time because she hadnt realized how upset he was not only for himself but for their cause she did count hamnet nodded she used his name in her spell i think but it didnt do any good all right eyvind torfinn said hamnet didnt think it was before he could say so earl eyvind went on other legends also accrue to the mistletoe you know that was the kind of thing i was hoping you could tell me about hamnet said gudrid yawned enormously hamnet kept pretending she wasnt there which was the best thing that could have happened to her i will tell you what i know eyvind paused to gather his thoughts hamnet pictured him riffling through an enormous codex inside his head that probably wasnt how it worked but the end results were about the same eyvind said you will of course have met the custom of kissing under the mistletoe on the night of the winter solstice dont bet on it gudrid murmured hamnet went right on ignoring her as long as she insulted him alone and not marcovefa he could with effort hold his temper he nodded to earl eyvind yes of course your splendor excellent by the way eyvind beamed hamnet might have been a promising pupil i dont see what thats got to do with anything here though hamnet said well neither do i eyvind admitted it was the first thing that came to mind thats all it was on the top page of the codex between his ears hamnet thought eyvind continued the powdered leaves if drunk are sovereign against the falling sickness but the arrow gave her something like the falling sickness hamnet protested i am telling you what i know of mistletoe and its uses earl eyvind said stiffly if it does not correspond to the womans symptoms i am not responsible for the discrepancy hamnet wanted to hit him even if he did though he realized eyvind wouldnt understand to the scholarly noble this was a scholarly problem no more and no less eyvind torfinn didnt seem to grasp that without marcovefa to oppose them the rulers could do pretty much as they pleased against this ragtag force of bizogots and raumsdalians do you know of any charms for waking people out of a long sleep count hamnet asked eyvind shook his head i am afraid i do not lacking any sorcerous capabilities myself i never extended my investigations in that direction listening to hamnet might put anyone into a long sleep but i dont suppose thats magic gudrid said no probably not hamnet agreed gudrid looked unhappy hed told her before that he didnt much care if she insulted him she evidently hadnt believed him too badhed told the truth she told so many lies herself she had to expect them all the time from other people can marcovefa eat can she drink can we sustain her until such time as we find a means to defeat this sorcery earl eyvind asked they were all good questionsperhaps eyvind had a better connection with reality than hamnet had thought he spread his hands i dont know the answers to any of those we just have to see thats all if we can take care of her youre rightthat buys us time if we cant the face he made told what he thought of that prospect yes whod give you a tumble then gudrid said she was lucky hamnet thyssen walked away from her not toward her he went over to one of the cooks kettles and dipped out a bowl of barley mush the mush had bits and shreds of mutton in it a baby could have got it down with no trouble with any luck at all an ensorcelled invalid would be able to do the same if she couldnt the game was up it was about that simple he dipped a horn spoon into the mush and blew on it the way he would have before feeding a baby then worriedly he slid the spoon between marcovefas flaccid lips she smiled she ate she swallowed but her eyes didnt open and she showed no sign of being aware of herself hamnet looked at the good and ignored as much of the bad as he could he gave her another spoonful then another then another before long the bowl was empty he wiped off her chin she was no neater than a baby would have been he didnt care she wouldnt starve to death it soon became plain she had no more control over her bodily functions than a baby did grimly hamnet took care of that too had gudrid come by to mock him then but she didnt this time her notion of how far she could push him proved good liv did come by i will help you keep her clean if you let me she said and sooner or lateryou will know when better than i doher time of the month will come chances are you would sooner have me deal with it chances are youre right hamnet said scrubbing his hands with snow i thank you for the kindness she would do the same for me liv looked at him so would you i think even now i hope so hamnet hesitated then he said too bad it didnt work out yes i think so too liv gave back a nod and a smile and a shrug but it didnt and we cant very well pretend it did that felt colder than the snow against his skinand yet in another way it didnt i cant imagine talking with gudrid this way hamnet said that didnt work out either well the difference is you and i dont hate each other or i hope we dont liv said you and gudrid she shook her head and didnt go on hamnet thyssen started to deny it no matter what gudrid felt about him what he felt about her couldnt be hate could it what else would you call it then he asked himself and found no answer thank youi think he said slowly you just showed me something about myself i didnt know before im not sure i did you a favor liv said im not either thats why i said i think hamnet answered what are we going to do now try to keep her fed and watered and clean liv said try to find a magic that will lift the mistletoe spelleither that or hope it wears off on its own a lot of spells do you know not quite what i meant he told her pretty soon the rulers will realize we cant beat back their magic any more theyll see we arent aiming strong spells at them then theyll jump on us with both feet the shaman from the three tusk clan bit her lip you shame audun and me i didnt mean to hamnet said quickly by god liv i didnt you might as well have meant it if you didnt her voice was bleak its not as if you werent telling the truth marcovefa could beat the rulers audun and i cant weve seen that its not your faultnot your fault in particular count hamnet said nobody on this side of the glacier can beat the rulers weve seen that too so has sigvat ii and i hope he likes it he didnt need anyone else to tell him that he hated the raumsdalian emperor we should be able to beat them wed better be able to livs shiver had nothing to do with the breath of god it could have come at high summer if we cant whats to stop them from stomping us underfoot like a mammoth stepping on a vole or if they dont do that whats to keep them from driving us back through the trees and up onto the bizogot steppe again nothing hamnet thought not a single solitary thing but he didnt want to make liv feel worse than she did already so he said why does that worry you its your homeland after all but its so much poorer than raumsdalia i didnt understand that before i came down here but i do now liv had never been one to hide from unpleasant or inconvenient truths if the rulers hold the empire they can come after us up on the steppe any time they chooseespecially since more and more of them keep riding down through the gap they can squeeze us from north and southsqueeze us till theres nothing left the shadows under her proud cheekbones might have been shadows of fearor maybe hamnets imagination usually no more energetic than it had to be was for once running away with him i hope things dont work out that way he said so do i liv answered but however wonderful i think hope is keeping it gets hard she looked at him was she hoping he would tell her she was wrong if she was he had to disappoint heragain he thought bitterly whats to keep the rulers from stomping us underfoot whats to keep them from driving us back through the trees and out onto the bizogot steppe as winter went on count hamnet remembered livs questions again and again he also remembered the response that had formed in his mind when he heard them nothing liv turned out to know which questions to ask and hamnet turned out to know the answer he counted staying alive a victory he counted every time his ragtag force managed to sting the rulers another retreats on the other hand ulric skakki joked about them this country looked a lot better from north to south than it does from south to north hamnet didnt laugh which seemed to irk the adventurer hamnet also didnt much care whether ulric was irked or not by then they were north of nidaros again they hadnt passed right by the capital that distressed eyvind torfinn and even more loudly gudrid to hamnet it didnt matter one way or the other marcovefa drank she ate she sometimes smiled though she hardly ever opened her eyes she gave no sign of coming fully to herself without her the raumsdalians and bizogots did what they could against the rulers what they could do wasnt enough or even close the rulers confidence swelled with every new triumph too they regained the arrogance theyd shown before marcovefa taught them they didnt know everything there was to know and when you rode to a fight expecting to win you were more likely to do just that when you rode to a fight expecting something to go wrong raumsdalians began slipping away from the army maybe they thought they could do better for themselves by giving up the fight and grubbing out a living under the rulers maybe they were right too we bizogots dont quit by god trasamund told runolf skallagrim one cold evening your folk shouldnt either youre right they shouldnt baron runolf agreed politely i dont know what to do about it though kill anybody who wants to run away the jarl was nothing if not direct if we catch them trying to sneak off we do kill them runolf said the trouble is we dont catch many you need to try harder trasamund said we need to do all kinds of things runolf skallagrim replied we need to beat the rulers again for instance if we do that people will think our chances are better so they wont want to run out on us we can hope they wont anyway he eyed count hamnet how do we go about that thyssen i wish i knew hamnet answered bleakly marcovefa has to wake up trasamund said well how do we make that happen runolf asked even more bleakly hamnet shrugged i wish i knew our wizards have tried ive watched them do it the only trouble is theyve had no luck its in gods hands now i think and gods done nothing but drop things since he let the glacier melt through so these stinking rulers could plague us trasamund sounded bleak himself runolf sent him a measuring look too the way you say that youll be the next one to try and run from trouble no trasamund didnt even bother to shake his head im in this till the end with the rulers swarming down the way they do i have nothing to go back to they hold my clans grazing grounds the few free three tusk bizogots are all here with me were not a big clan any more but were tough if youve got nothing to go back to you may as well fight hamnet thyssen said the ones who think they can slip away and go back to being peasants with the rulers taxing them in place of the empire theyre all raumsdalians trasamund broke in thats not what i was going to say hamnet told him doesnt make it any less true the bizogot replied those are the ones we have to worry about count hamnet stubbornly finished his own thought but if they desert what kind of fight can we put up trasamund said we came down here with an army that was mostly bizogots hamnet said we can go on that way if we have to we can get driven out of the empire that way he thought but didnt speak words of ill omen aloud trasamund did it for him we came down here with an army that had marcovefa in it too without her were buggered is what we are well in that case why do you blame the raumsdalian soldiers for leaving the fight when they see the chance runolf skallagrim asked they figure they wont make any difference one way or the other and it looks to me like theyve got something they may not help us lose if they desert hamnet said sure as sure they wont help us win and ill tell you what theyve got trasamund added theyve got yellow bellies thats what runolf scowled at him the raumsdalian veterans hand began to slide toward the hilt of his sword enough both of you count hamnet said wearily too much were all doing the best we can if we fight amongst ourselves we only help the rulers if they dont fight they help the rulers too trasamund didnt want to let it drop enough i said hamnet got between the bizogot and baron runolf fight me first if you have to fight somebody no that wouldnt be a good idea either ulric skakkis voice came from the gloom beyond the firelight turning toward it hamnet saw that he had a nocked arrow in his bow hamnet has it straight were supposed to fight the enemy not ourselves but we cant fight the rulers either runolf said thats why men are slipping off yes we can ulric said we cant do it right now thats all theres a difference if your men have too many potatoes in the head to see it youve got to keep banging at em till they do you make it sound easy runolf skallagrim said the adventurer grinned at him there in the gloom it is easy to sound that way but we arent whipped yet quite xvii hamnet thyssen stared glumly at the snowcovered trees fires burned in a clearing in the woods but for audun gillis small spell to get them started the men and the handful of women who still remained with him might have had to do without chunks of meat from a shortfaced bear toasted over the fires the bear was a fierce hunter but no match for hungry men hamnet liked bear meat well enough he wished he didnt have to eat it now though he wished he were closer to raumsdalias heart close enough to go on eating beef and mutton he glanced toward marcovefa she still hadnt come back to herself he had no idea whenor ifshe would audun and liv had done everything they knew how to do it wasnt enough she ate and drank if you put food or water in her mouth sometimes she smiled or frowned in her sleep that was as close as she came to real life but without her all of hamnets wishes were in vain he couldnt help thinking she would have laughed and solved the mistletoe spell in a heartbeathad the arrow struck someone else that reflection did him no good at all nor her either she didnt seem to be getting any worse with such small encouragements hamnet had to console himself none of the shortfaced bear went to waste the raumsdalians might not have thought to roast the chitterlings but the bizogots did when the bizogots lit on a carcass they left nothing but bare bones behindand theyd split those for the marrow inside up on the frozen steppe everything had a use it had to have one because the steppe held so little that also held true for the forest as count hamnet knew too well towns in these parts had survived because they got grain from farther south with the rulers loose in the empire the towns wouldnt get any this winter how many people would starve before spring one worry led to another hamnet walked over to ulric skakki who was doing his own rough cooking how long can we last in the woods hamnet asked without preamble why till we starve of course ulric answered lightly he took his gobbet out of the flames and blew on it when he tried to take a bite he grimaced still too cursed hot well it wont be for long god knows not in this weather can we keep going here till spring hamnet persisted or would we do better to head back up onto the steppe ulric didnt answer right away the meat had cooled enough to let him eat it after a heroic bite and swallow he said wed have plenty up there in the springtimethats for sure all those waterfowl coming to nest yes hamnet thyssen nodded that endless profusion of ducks and geese and swans the question is how do we keep from starving in the meantime ulric took another bite in due course he said eating something is a pretty good plan youre being annoying on purpose hamnet said you noticed the adventurer made as if to kiss him enough foolishness too much foolishness hamnet growled ulric skakki looked at him as if hed just said something very foolish ignoring that hamnet stubbornly pushed ahead the foraging isnt good here you know it as well as i do maybe better it isnt good anywhere during the winter ulric pointed out which was nothing less than the truth this is the hard time of year lots of people go hungry before the snow melts do you think the rulers are hungry hamnet asked i hope so ulric said which was something less than a yes what are we going to do hamnet asked a question better aimed at god perhaps than at ulric skakki fight give up do whatever you please me im going to make sure i dont go hungry at least for a while the adventurer took another large bite of bear meat thus encouraged hamnet thyssen went away runolf skallagrim crouched in the snow in front of another fire talking with eyvind torfinn hamnet supposed he was glad eyvind had stuck with them the earl knew a lot that might prove useful the only drawback to having him along was having gudrid along with him she was also eating a chunk of bear grease ran down her chin count hamnet turned away before their eyes could meet if he talked to her they would only have another row he didnt feel like it right this minute he didnt feel like much of anything except maybe lying down in a snowdrift and not getting up again trasamund methodically stropped his sword blade the jarl looked like a man who expected more fighting and aimed to do the best he could with it he nodded to hamnet thyssen crouching beside him hamnet nodded back he might quarrel with trasamund but it wouldnt be the soulscarring kind of slanging match hed have with gudrid did you think when we met in the emperors palace it would come to this he asked the bizogot not me by god trasamund hardly looked up from his careful stropping i never dreamt there were folk who could beat the bizogots fog spurted from his nostrils as he snorted shows what i know eh shows what we all knew hamnet answered do you still think we can win if marcovefa comes back to herself weve got a good chancea decent chance anyway otherwise trasamund shrugged well who knows he left off stropping tested the edge with his thumb and grunted in satisfaction then he glanced over to hamnet have you tried horning her awake no hamnets mouth twisted in distaste it would be like lying with a corpse you wouldnt be doing it for fun trasamund said deliberately youd be doing it because it might work if i thought it would thatd be different hamnet said but i havent go any reason to think soand neither do you somethings got to the jarl said if magic doesnt screwings not likely to hamnet almost wished hed picked a fight with gudrid and magic cursed well doesntour magic anyway i know thats why i think we should try something else trasamund said she wouldnt even know it was going on hamnet scowled at the bizogot ive never been one to enjoy laying women who were too drunk even to know i was there it wouldnt be sport trasamund insisted hamnet thyssen got to his feet too right it wouldnt he strode away before trasamund could say anything more maybe trasamund would have taken up the argument again the next morning he never got the chance though because the rulers struck at the raumsdalians and bizogots at first light riding out of a snowstorm and sending clouds of arrows ahead of them as they came one sentry came out of the swirling snow a couple of minutes before the invaders from beyond the gap struck the main encampment how he escaped ambushor perhaps the rulers sorceryhamnet never found out he never would either because the man died in the fighting that followed but if the sentry hadnt brought at least a little warning the rulers would have stormed in by surprise and that would have ended that as things were a countervolley greeted the attackers it tumbled several of them off their riding deer and slowed the charge from the rest that let some of the men hamnet led jump on their horses and storm forward and it bought enough time for the rest to retreat instead of getting caught in their clearing the bizogots and raumsdalians could shoot from the cover of the trees more rulers and riding deer went down for a while hamnet hoped the enemy had bitten off more than he could chew but then more rulers struck the defenders from the east hamnet realized that theyd planned a twopronged assault but the prongs hadnt come together at quite the right moment struck from the front and the flank now he found himself in a poor position to criticize the foe for faulty generalship what are we going to do runolf skallagrim howled fight as much as we have to then try to get away hamnet answered if youve got a better notion id love to hear it i was hoping you did runolf said had the attack gone the way the rulers doubtless drew it up before they launched it it would have finished things even without surprise again something must have gone wrong somewhere hardly anything in war ever worked just the way you planned it hamnet had learned that the hard way many years earlier now he reaped the benefits of it such as they were survival considering the alternative he wasnt sorry to take it even if he would have wanted more why werent you ready for this gudrid screamed at him they might kill me wouldnt that be a shame hamnet nocked an arrow and shot at a shape he saw dimly through blowing snow harsh guttural curses said hed hit someone they also said he hadnt killed his man he wished he would have why werent you ready gudrid asked again if youre so unhappy go back to where we rescued you from the rulers hamnet said im sure theyd take you again oh she spat at him but it fell short in the snow you are the most hateful man in the world now maybe you understand why i always thought we were so well matched count hamnet returned gudrid said something that should have steamed all the snow for miles around hamnet bowed which only made her come back with something hotter yet he paid less attention to her than she no doubt wanted him to another ruler on a riding deer came out of the swirling snow hamnets arrow caught the deer in the neck blood fountained all the redder for being displayed against the white the deer went down so did the warrior atop it hamnet thyssen urged his horse forward drawing his sword the ruler was still scrambling to his feet when hamnets cut caught him just below and in front of the left ear he let out a bubbling shriek and clutched at the spouting wound hamnet slashed again the ruler fell scrabbling in the snow he tried to push himself upright once more but crumpled instead satisfied he was out of the fight count hamnet rode back and nocked another arrow he was glad the bow hadnt fallen in the snow in his charge runolf skallagrim was bleeding from a nicked ear like scalp wounds ears bled so much that anything that happened to them seemed much worse than it really was runolf might not even have noticed how much blood spattered his mailshirt weve got to pull back thyssen he said were for it if we stand and fight much longer now tell me something i didnt know hamnet answered bitterly do you have any notion how much i hate running away from those whoresons again though any notion at all i probably dont runolf admitted but how do you feel about them murdering the lot of us im against it hamnet said which jerked a laugh from baron runolf i didnt say i wouldnt runjust that i didnt like it and i cursed well dont well neither do i runolf said but im with youi like getting murdered even less and thats whatll happen to us if we stick around much longer i know hamnet thyssen hated admitting that which didnt mean he had any choice he asked the most important question he could find is marcovefa still safe she is runolf assured him adding skakkis got her up onto a horse he didnt mean mounted he meant tied aboard a pack horse like a sack of dried peas all the same count hamnet nodded ulric will know how to take care of it all right an arrow from nowhere hissed through the air between them hamnet nodded again in spite of himself yes wed better get moving about time runolf skallagrim said nothing but relief in his voice i only hope it isnt past time it turned out not to be the rulers had had as much of the fight as they wanted at least for the moment if their pincer claws had worked better it was hamnet supposed ever so slightly reassuring to find they could make mistakes like anyone else they didnt pursue very hard the forest wasnt their favorite ground any more than it was the bizogots at another time hamnet would have tried to turn that against them as things were he had to content himself with taking advantage of it liv and audun gilli and a raumsdalian soldier whod been a doctors helper did what they could for the injured they extracted arrows from wounds bandaged and sutured and used both leechcraft and sorcery to stop bleeding against pain they could offer very little has anyone got any poppy juice called the soldier whose name hamnet thought was narfi no one said anything after a small silence narfi swore so did the man whose hurts he was tending hamnet thyssen was too worn and weary and gloomy to swear he kept looking north how long before they were out on the bizogot steppe again what could they hope to do if the rulers pushed them out of raumsdalia altogether not much he thought not bloody much but theyd already spilled too much blood to be able to give up now and chances were the rulers wouldnt let him give up anyway for whatever reason they were convinced he was somehow especially dangerous to them so was marcovefa hamnet only wished he could see why marcovefa was dangerous to them he knew that and theyd found a way to silence her only luck no stray arrows in the last fight pierced her she couldnt do anything to defend herself against them not now nobody seemed able to do much against the rulers maybe they would end up holding everything from the gap down to raumsdalia if they ended up knocking sigvat ii over the head that might almost be worth it hamnet sighed almost was one of the cruelest words in the language hed hoped the rulers would be satisfied with trouncing their foes once and would leave them alone for a while afterward but hed also seen how wide the gap between what you hoped for and what you got could yawn he kept scouts as far south in the forest as he could to give warning in case he didnt get what he hoped for and he didnt as he discovered sooner than he wanted to the scouts were all raumsdalians the bizogots by the nature of things knew little of woodscraft one of runolf skallagrims men rode back to the camp calling theyre coming god help us theyre all coming what do you mean all hamnet asked hoping the scout meant anything but what it sounded like he meant no such luck every ruler in the world the excited man gasped war mammoths everything i just saw the front end of it but theres got to be a demon of a lot of it i didnt stick around to see have they gone mad trasamund rumbled they dont need all that to squash us its like dropping a musk ox on a mosquito maybe the emperor is dead eyvind torfinn said with sigvat gone theyd have nothing to fear in the south and could concentrate all their power against us we may be the last force in the field against them hamnet refused to believe it they had nothing to fear in the south with sigvat alive he said they proved it too again and again they might need to worry if they did knock the sorry scut over the head then theyd run the risk that somebody who knows what hes doing would take over and start fighting back earl eyvind looked sorrowful hamnet didnt care as far as he knew sigvat had never thrown eyvind into a dungeon for the horrendous crime of being right hamnet feared he himself had to plead guilty to that one gudrid by contrast lapped up his words with vampire avidity he knew exactly what that meant if by some accident the rulers didnt slaughter everyone here and if by some bigger accident sigvat triumphed in the south she would tell the emperor everything hamnet had said then hamnet would go back to the dungeon or maybe to the chopping block and she would have her reward at some other time hamnet would have hated her for that he couldnt afford to indulge himself now theres no chance we can fight them he asked the raumsdalian the man shook his head his eyes were wide and frightened i didnt know there were that many of the buggers around he replied clutching at straws count hamnet turned to liv and audun gilli any hope its a fancy bluff with magic blowing up their numbers the way you blow up a pigs bladder before you put it on a stick bizogot shaman and raumsdalian wizard both turned south in the same motion they made a more natural pair than hamnet ever had with liv he could see as much however little he relished what he saw the two of them tasted the frigid air like hunting hounds seeking a scent livs lips moved as she murmured a spell auduns hands twisted in quick abbreviated passes they both stiffened at the same time audun flinched as if someone had slapped him liv went nearly as pale as the snow that lay all around its no bluff she said softly they really are that strong they want us to be able to feel how strong they are god help us audun added what do we do then hamnet asked run they said together liv went on if marcovefa were awake she might be able to slow them down since she isnt she shook her head even her lips had gone colorless if we run well likely have to leave the woodsleave raumsdalia hamnet said wouldnt break my heart trasamund said i know but you arent a raumsdalian count hamnet said and thank god for that the bizogot exclaimed we do almost every day ulric skakki was rarely shy about dipping his oar in the water trasamund glared at him should i be so glad youre no clansman of mine he answered his own question youd best believe i should youd make nothing but trouble in among the mammothhide tents i cant help it if your women like my looks the adventurer said blandly which won him another glare from trasamund enough both of you hamnet said do you think we can fight the rulers and hope to win ulric and the jarl looked at each other ulric shook his head without the least hesitation trasamunds response was slower and more reluctant but in the end the same hamnet didnt think they could fight the invaders either he thought theyd have to be suicidal to try but the others might have disagreed with him since they didnt he said then lets get away while we still can thats the smartest thing ive heard from you for a long time ulric told him i love you toobut not right now hamnet said ulric skakkis laugh seemed equal parts scorn and appreciation he ambled off to see to his horse they got moving before the rulers came down on them count hamnet stayed behind to command the rear guard you shouldnt liv told him if anything happens to you our cause is ruined marcovefa said so and i think shes right he shrugged you cant go on asking other people to put their lives on the line for you unless you put yours on the line with them every so often they wont follow your orders if you dont and demons take me if i see why they ought to some things are more important than a little fight like this liv insisted hamnet shrugged again the glare she gave him put to shame the ones trasamund had aimed at ulric skakki blue blue eyes blazing she went on all right then if you must stay behind i will too and i will keep you alive if i can you dunderhead and ill stay audun gilli added no you go on the rest will need magic too and youve got more than any of the others with them liv said audun looked mutinous which was putting it mildly he was no hero but he didnt want his woman in more danger than he wasand who could blame him for that no doubt he also didnt want liv staying behind with her former loverand who could blame him for that either but when he tried to protest she said go just go she looked as if she would draw her dagger if he said another word sometimes all the argument in the world wouldnt do you a corroded coppers worth of good audun gilli had the sense to recognize that this was one of this times he mooched off kicking at the snow because he could find no better vent for his feelings you dont have to do this hamnet said to liv not for my sake dont talk about what you dont understand she answered a response that almost precluded conversation as he waited for the rulers he eyed the troop of bizogots and raumsdalians who waited with him they seemed steady enough if they were impressed that hed chosen to stay behind too they hid it very well livs glance said i told you so she wasnt his lover any more though so he could ignore her without suffering for it later audun wasnt so lucky mastodons roamed the woods by hamnets castle in southeastern raumsdalia they ate acorns and chestnuts and other nuts along with leaves and roots there wasnt enough to support them or the mammoths of the northern steppe in these northern forests that made the sight of eight or ten war mammoths coming through the firs and spruces toward him all the more jolting they dont belong here his mind shouted the rulers on the mammoths backs didnt care what he thought the invaders shouted to one another in their harsh braying language first one then another pointed straight at him how they could pick him out from anybody else in the rear guard he didnt know but they could you see liv said quietly she got i told you so into half as many wordsnot a bad trick hamnet didnt answer what could he say when the rulers started shooting all the arrows seemed to head straight for him every soldier on every battlefield since the beginning of time had to feel the same way but hamnet feared it was literally true this time he threw up his shield just in time to deflect one that would have got him in the face the arrow skipped off the bronze facing and over his head he breathed a sigh of relief then he wondered why he bothered no matter what marcovefa thought whether he lived or died mattered little to him but he was too obstinate not to make the best fight he could he shot a ruler off a riding deer thenmore by luck than by designhit a war mammoth in the trunk with another arrow the woolly mammoth wore armor of leather dipped in boiling wax as did a lot of the rulers it was almost as good as chain mail and much lighter but the mammoths masters hadnt tried to armor that sinuous flexible trunk hamnet wouldnt have wanted to try either and the trunk was as sensitive as a mans nose or perhaps as sensitive as his hands the war mammoth trumpeted in pain and indignation one of the men on its back patted itroughly through the boiled leather count hamnet thought the ruler meant to show sympathy more than they were in the habit of doing for any men not of their own kind no good deed went unpunished the mammoth could still use its wounded member it plucked up the ruler and threw him down in the snow in front of it his terrified shriek cut off abruptly as the mammoths right foot crushed the life out of him the great beast left one red footprint out of four for some little while after that the other warriors who rode on it sat very quietly trying their best not to remind it they were there well done liv said warmly it wont matter much in the long run weve got to pull back any which way hamnet answered he didnt want her praising him it reminded him of what theyd been not so long before he hadnt lain with a woman since marcovefa went down wasnt life complicated enough without fresh temptations an arrow zipped past his head venomously close he realized what a bad position he was in to be worrying about any kind of temptations fresh salted or pickled then one of the raumsdalians in the rear guard pointed and exclaimed what the demons that for a moment hamnet thyssen thought it was nothing but blowing snow then he realized that while it was blowing snow it wasnt nothing but blowing snow it was blowing snow and sorcery the sorcery packed it together tighter than blowing snow had any right to get and gave it a shape distinct from the randomly blowing snow all around it that shape was much too much like a mans but it was bigger than a man had any business being and it had much larger arms it also had an awareness to it an awareness that hamnet immediately thought of as wolfish why he couldnt have said not consciously the feeling welled up from the place that made his balls want to crawl up into his belly and his hair stand straight on the back of his neck not only that its awareness centered on him or perhaps aimed at him those long snowy arms outstretched it strode purposefully in his direction it left no footprints red or otherwise he might have known all along that it sought his life in particular part of him had known all along the part that made his balls crawl up and his hackles rise he nocked an arrow and let fly it was a shot he could have been proud ofstraight through the heart if a snow dev il had a heart evidently not for it didnt fall it did laugh at him its laughter was winter wind congealed all the cold and emptiness in the world boiled down to a pint count hamnet had pierced its heart without harming it the snow dev ils laughter pierced his heart too pierced it and almost froze it shut dont be foolish he thought you did that to yourself years ago before he could even wonder what he meant liv started a spell it was in a dialect of the bizogot language so oldfashioned he could hardly follow it he would rather have tried to gallop away though he had no guarantee his horse could outrun a thing half made of gale then liv switched to urgent raumsdalian quick shoot it again what good will that do what good will anything do yes the snow dev il had done its best to freeze hamnets heart and its best was better than hed dreamt possible shoot it liv slapped his face his shocked bellow wasnt so loud or so shrill as the war mammoths had been when he shot it but was no less startled no less outraged he almost shot liv but instead he drove another arrow through the snow devileasy now when it was so close as chunks of ice broke to start an avalanche did they scream if they did they surely let out a cry like the one that ripped from the snow dev il when hamnets second arrow struck this shaft unlike the one that had gone before it wounded the sorcerous apparition noit slew wind had made the snow dev il coalesce and wind tore it to pieces in the blink of an eye one heartbeat it was about to lay hold of count hamnet what would have happened then he didnt know only that it would have been nothing good but the snow dev il was gone the next heartbeat gone as if it never existed well shot liv yelled well spelled hamnet yelled back somewhere among the rulers a shriek almost as full of torment as the snow dev ils burst from a mans throat maybe the snow dev ils throat was meant for such sounds a mans assuredly wasnt how much of himself had the enemy wizard poured into his sorcerous creation enough to ruin himworse than ruin himwhen it was all lost at once but for that shriek hamnet might have kissed liv or she him with it still echoing inside them they both fought shy of that the torment it held put out passion the same way a brass candlesnuffer dampened flame a nod sufficed hamnet then you did what you needed to do he told her she nodded her face half proud half horrified at what shed unwittingly inflicted on the rulers sorcerer i wouldnt want to do that to anyonenot even one of those people liv said with shudder count hamnet grunted he wouldnt waste any grief on you even so liv insisted remembering what the other wizard sounded like after the snow dev il perished hamnet decided she had a point another arrow snarled through the air between him and liv maybe the archer who loosed it couldnt decide which of them he would sooner have killed maybe the next bowman wouldnt have any trouble making up his mind or maybe hed just turn out to be a better shot do you think weve given the main force enough time to get away hamnet thyssen asked yes and i think you had better get away liv answered that snow fiend or whatever you want to call it only makes things plainerthe rulers want you dead and they dont care what they do to get you that way hamnet grunted again he didnt think he was important in the grand scheme of things and resented that anyone should think so when he didnt ordering the raumsdalians and bizogots with him to fall back meant he didnt have to dwell on what anybody else thought the rulers came after the rear guard but less enthusiastically than theyd attacked at first a wounded war mammoth and a wizard dreadfully disabled if not dead gave them pause they were men like any others no matter how they tried to disguise it with ferocity getting reminded of that reassured hamnet a little theyre going to let us get away one of the raumsdalians sounded even more relievedand even more surprisedthan hamnet was somewhere ahead of him the main force would be heading where up onto the bizogot plains where else were they likely to go and not nearly far enough behind him the rulers were getting ready to pursue them somehow or other his friends would have to take along the stillunconscious marcovefa that brought something else to the top of hamnet thyssens mind ask you a question he said to liv its hard to ask anything else she replied as if she were ulric skakki then she nodded go ahead he gave her trasamunds suggestion finishing has that got any chance of working or is it as disgusting as it sounds to me he expected it would disgust her even more not least because she was a woman to be taken unawares so to speak but she gave it her usual careful consideration at last she said well i dont see how it could hurt whats the worst thing that could happen you get her with child you might do that when shes awake too butbut hamnet had to work to make himself quit sputtering but do you think it would do any good i dont know it might connect her to this world againor of course it might not liv answered maybe its worth a try who can say if she knew why you were doing it i think shed forgive you if that makes you feel any better it didnt or not much hamnet rode on wishing hed kept his mouth shut xviii the bizogot steppe again hamnet thyssen could imagine no gloomier words no gloomier setting but his being here had nothing to do with his imagination for better or worseas things seemed mostly for worsehere he was in truth he could see a long way except for the south where the woods that marked raumsdalias frontier still lingered on the horizon he might have been able to see forever he knew he couldnt but the illusion was very strong it felt all the stronger because hed come out from among the trees so recently they didnt simply cut down how far you could see they also made the eye focus more clearly than it had to here on the plain hamnet didnt see any war mammoths coming after the battered remnant of the force that still resisted the rulers he didnt see any of the invaders on their riding deer he didnt miss them either if he never saw them again he wouldnt have shed a tear when he said as much to ulric skakki the adventurer shrugged an elaborate shrug well neither would i ulric said but that doesnt mean i dont expect to see them before long i know hamnet bared his teeth in something that wished it were a smile theyll be along sooner than we wish they would i never thought the rear guard would be able to do as much to them as we did good for you by god ulric said good for liv count hamnet said she deserves the credit if not for her that snow dev il would have slaughtered the lot of usstarting with me he shuddered at the memory had those frozen arms closed on him he didnt know what would have happened the only thing he knew was it would have been about as bad as anything could be ulric raised an amused eyebrow if you listen to her tell it your grace youre the hero me hamnet snorted thats ridiculous all i did was stay alive and i didnt think id manage that ridiculous eh ulrics eyebrow climbed higher yet hamnet hadnt thought it could audun gilli doesnt think so the way hes moping around he thinks livs going back to you any minute now he may think so i dont hamnet said yes i know ulric skakki but then youve always been blind to what women are really thinking havent you hamnet opened his mouth to deny that indignantly then he closed it without saying anything when he opened it again after some thought what came out was i wouldnt be surprised no no youre always surprisedthats what im trying to tell you ulric said count hamnet made as if to hit him laughing ulric ducked you know what i meant youre being difficult on purpose hamnet thyssen said ulric doffed his fur cap as if at a compliment hamnet might have know he would but continued anyhow besides not only is liv not my woman any more ive got another one well so you do ulric allowed but does it still count when shes gone into hibernation i dont know hamnet said slowly then he told the adventurer what trasamund had suggested ulric never wasted time making up his mind you ought to try it he said at once even if it doesnt work how are you worse off how are any of us worse off eh the ideas disgusting hamnet said i dont see how ulric skakki answered no more than bedding a woman after shes had too much to drink if you tell me youve never done that ill call you a liar to your face and if she cares for you to begin with she wont mindnot as long as you dont make a habit of it anyhow mmpf hamnet said ulric could be much more persuasive than trasamund was i still dont think itd do us any good how are you worse off if it doesnt ulric repeated it wont hurt you to try ive heard some people even enjoy it hamnet made as if to hit him again ulric had to duck faster this time as he did he added it wont hurt marcovefa either not unless youre even clumsier than i think youow hamnet did hit him that time you deserved it hamnet said thats what you think ulric said did you ask liv about this what did she tell you she told me i should hamnet answered reluctantly well then you ought to listen to her ulric skakki said count hamnet scowled its like forcing a woman by god it is forcing a woman thats never been my notion of a good time besides any man who forces a woman whos also a wizard will probably end up a eunuch or if he doesnt hell wish he did because something worse will happen to him i could point out that youre a stiffnecked idiot ulric said you dont need to i already know that hamnet told him im so glad but that isnt what i was going to say ulric looked and sounded exasperated i was going to say that you force a woman you dont know or maybe a woman you hate you and gudrid now leave gudrid out of this hamnet said in a voice that might have blown straight off the glacier it wasnt that he hadnt thought of forcing her and then cutting her throat or maybe his own he had one of the things that held him back was the conviction shed be laughing at him even while one of them or the other gurgled toward death ulric made placating motions i was i was heres what i was trying to tell you you dont hate marcovefa right you know i dont youd better know i dont hamnet said yes yes fine wonderful the adventurer said if you love her if you do this with loveor with something as close to love as your wizened little soul has in ityou wont be forcing her if it works if she wakes up shell thank you and i thank you for your sweet and generous compliment hamnet thyssen said ulric doffed his cap again i am your servant your grace youre the south end of a northbound horse is what you are hamnet said the cap came off once more you say the kindest things but kindly let me finish if it doesnt work if you dont rouse her the rulers will kill all of usyou her me everybodypretty soon anyhow it wont matter so either youll do some good or you wont but i dont see you hurting anything much that made much more sense than hamnet wished it did it made so much sense he couldnt think of a thing to say in reply instead of saying anything he turned his back and walked away from ulric skakki the adventurer called his name count hamnet kept walking if ulric had laughed hamnet might have turned back with murder in his heart but ulric for a wonder had the sense to keep his mouth shut tramping along staring down at his own feet his head full of unhappy thoughts hamnet almost bumped into someone that made him look upand wish he hadnt you might say excuse me gudrid told him she was the last person he wanted to have anything to do with then which only proved god didnt pay attention to what he wanted as if i didnt know he thought sourly aloud he said i might do all kinds of things none of them has anything to do with you oh i know that you might screw the blond savage for instance when she isnt awake to tell you what a miserable count hamnet knocked her down it wasnt quite a punch but she landed in the snow suddenly enough to startle a squawk out of her breathing hard hamnet said ive listened to everyone else about that i dont have to listen to youand i dont intend to either gudrid got to her feet she was ready to say something more hamnet could read it in her eyes but whatever she read in his eyes made her shut her mouth with a snap after a cautious pause all she did say was well if youre going to be that way about it youd best believe i am hamnet growled he strode away from her as he had from ulric skakki like ulric gudrid realized her usual mockery wouldnt be a good idea now this time hamnet tramped along with his head up if he kept an eye out for trouble maybe he could steer clear of it he walked away from runolf skallagrim runolf hadnt given him advice about marcovefa but that didnt mean the other raumsdalian wouldnt and he walked away from trasamund the jarl had already told him what he thought that wouldnt stop trasamund from doing it again trasamund liked to hear himself talk and he was stubbornly convinced he was right all the time a whole great swarm of mistakes hed made werent enough to convince him otherwise but was he making a mistake this time whatever i do it will be wrong everybody will blame me for it whatever it turns out to be hamnet muttered but that wasnt the worst he knew what the worst was whatever it turns out to be ill blame myself for it did he want to blame himself for doing nothing or for doing something either one might be wrong if he did nothing things wouldnt change that seemed obvious if he did something his suspicion was that things wouldnt change anyway then he would have done something he would much rather not have and would have done it for no reason his mittened hands folded into fists it will be wrong he said again marcovefa would have laughed at his dithering he could hear her inside his mind she never seemed to have doubts yes and look what not having them got her hamnet thought stamping along by himself didnt do him any good he went back to the camp liv was feeding marcovefa bits of broiled hare and giving her sips of water melted from snow if marcovefa couldnt chew and swallow she would have starved by now as things were shed lost flesh her skin stretched tight across her cheekbones theyd all done the best they could to give her enough but feeding her as much as she would have eaten on her own wasnt easy any change hamnet asked liv shook her head none i can find she might have said morehamnet could see that she might have but she sensibly didnt she understood hamnet well enough to know that trying to push him toward something was more likely to make him go away from it trasamund and ulric skakki had never figured that out actually hamnet wasnt so sure about ulric say what you would about the adventurer but he was a clever fellow chances were he knew how hamnet worked sometimes though he used what he knew for his own amusement not for what others might think of as the general good count hamnet brought himself back to what lay before him is she wet he asked let me see liv reached under the waistband of marcovefas trousers as she might have with a toddler she shook her head again no shes still dry i changed her not long ago she paused shes eaten about as much as it looks like shes going to too all right ill take her to my tent for the night hamnet bent and lifted marcovefa yes shed lost weight since the mistletoe arrowhead struck her down her lips shaped a smile as hamnet straightened with her in his arms her eyelids fluttered but her eyes didnt open not for the first time hamnet wondered how much went on inside her head and not for the first time he owned himself baffledhe had no way to know keeping marcovefa from freezing while the breath of god blew was hardly easier than keeping her fed they swaddled her in furs and blankets and hoped for the best so far the best had been good enough she hadnt even got frostbitten fingers or toes raumsdalians knew a lot about fighting cold bizogots knew even more hamnets tent had thick mammothhide walls with the long dark hair still on the outside it was crowded for two but that was all right it let their body heat warm the air inside faster no one but he would know what went on inside the tent well marcovefa might but he didnt really believe she would that was what had held him back ever since trasamund suggested what he suggested the idea reminded hamnet too much of lying with a corpse but if he tried it once after it failed he could tell trasamund and ulric skakki and liv and gudrid and runolf skallagrim and anyone else who asked him that it had failed then maybe people would leave him alone he could hope so anyhow of course the odds were that after it failed the rulers would overrun them pretty soon in that case he would be too dead to need to justify himself to anybody he looked at marcovefa there in the gloom barely pushed back by one sputtering fatstinking lamp she might have lain peacefully asleepbut he knew too well she didnt if it does some good shell forgive you if it doesnt shell never know he thought the same thing had occurred to him many times before what had always stopped him was that if it did no good he would know maybe it was worth one try for the sake of the fight against the rulers he knew he wouldnt be doing it for his own pleasure and a moment later he knew he was talking himself into doing what hed intended not to do and so he did no one would be able to say any more that he hadnt done everything he and anybody else could think of he still had trouble believing it would make a difference when nothing else had but there isi suppose there isthe chance im wrong as if ive never been wrong before he made love to her as if she really were there with him as if she could enjoy it too if he was going to rouse her didnt he need to rouse her in a different way first or did he was the connection between this and waking her entirely mystical was it entirely imaginary even as he moved that struck him as much more likely he finished then he pulled up his trousers and put marcovefas back onto her even with the tent flap closed even with the two of them in that small space it wasnt warm in there then he waited and he waited and he waited a little longer and when nothing happened he went on waiting till the lamp ran out of fat and went dark plunging the inside of the tent into something that would do for darkness absolute till he met the genuine article and then weary and despairing he lay down beside marcovefa he didnt intend to fall asleep no matter what he intended he did what happened in that fight how did i get back here why dont i remember did i get drunk last night i dont feel hung over hamnet thyssen opened his eyes that did him some gooddaylight leaked in through the tent flap and a bit more under the bottom of the tent marcovefa was sitting up beside him for a moment he simply accepted that then more slowly than he might have he took in what it meant by god he whispered it worked it really did what did she asked before he could answer she repeated i dont feel hung over and went on but why am i soso tired its like i havent done anything for a long time so even sitting up like this wears me out yes hamnet nodded dizzily its just like that as a matter of fact what are you talking about marcovefa by contrast sounded irritable her stomach rumbled im hungry she declared as if daring him to doubt it its like i havent had enough to eat for weeks its just like that too hamnet told her will you please make sense shed gone beyond irritableshe sounded as if shed hit him if he didnt do what she told him in a hurry i dont know if i can but ill try hamnet thyssen told the story as quickly as he could marcovefa heard him out she stayed quiet for some time afterwards then she said we are on the steppe again not in the forest if you are making some kind of joke with me why would i do that hamnet said all you have to do is stick your head out of the tent youll find out whether im telling the truth about that yes marcovefa admitted another silence followed then she asked what is this mistletoe i never heard of it we dont have it up on top of the glacier im not surprised hamnet said its a small plant it grows on trees i dont even know whether the rulers knew about it before they came down into the empire maybe they learned about it from a raumsdalian wizard or maybe they found out about it by themselves i dont suppose well ever find out any which way they used it on you and for a long time all the magic we could think of to use didnt do a thing against it and you ended up screwing me awake marcovefa laughed why didnt you think of that sooner i couldnt believe it would work hamnet heard the dull embarrassment in his own voice well i owe trasamund an apology i wont be sorry to give it to him either he muttered something under his breath what is that she asked i said it didnt seem right to take you when you werent there to know what i was doing almost like taking an animal that made her laugh again this time in surprise all these big animals you have down hereyou could do something like that i never thought of it before but this worked so i dont mind and if it didnt work i wouldnt mind then either because i wouldnt know i finally figured that out for myself hamnet answered it was about the last thing we had left to try can i get something to eat now marcovefa asked with my belly full i will figure out how to pay the rulers back if you can get up they should have something over at the fires hamnet said if you cant get up ill bring you something you need to get your strength backits been a while she tried she plainly didnt have an easy time of it but she managed how long has it been she asked wobbling hamnet told her she shook her head in disbelief and i dont remember anything after i got hit not anything at all i wondered how i came to the tent not how half a season passed away but my body tells me half a season did well come on hamnet said youre here again and a good thing too not having you told us how much we need you by god he hesitated then added and ive missed you i would have missed you marcovefa said i didnt miss anything hamnet made do with that he left the tent first then held out his hand to help marcovefa she blinked against the light when she emerged and swayed like a sapling with the breath of god blowing but she stubbornly stayed on her feet theyd slaughtered a musk ox the night before chunks of the carcass lay in the snow no worry about keeping meat at this time of year only about keeping scavengers away from it pretty soon when the sun turned the weather would warm upbut the scavengers wouldnt go away ulric skakki was worrying a couple of ribs off a larger slab of meat alert as a lion he looked up the instant he registered motion out of the corner of his eye but while motion didnt surprise him one of the people making the motion did what have we here he said jumping to his feet and giving marcovefa a courtiers bow the face is familiar but the name itll come to me im sure then he raised an eyebrow in hamnets direction and one word was plenty and trasamund turned out to be right hamnet said who would have imagined it everyone but you thought he might be ulric answered you see you have a magic wand after all that made marcovefa laugh till she almost fell over it made hamnets ears feel as if they were on fire how much more meat is left on that slab he asked gruffly enough for her and me oh i expect so ulric ambled over to toast the ribs hed taken hamnet cut off two for marcovefa and then two more for himself i could eat these raw marcovefa said we would do that every so often up on the glacier not always enough dried dung for a fire raw meat isnt bad ive done it too hamnet said go ahead if you care to i like them better cooked though well so do i marcovefa made her way over toward the fire she still swayed but she managed hamnet followed he was ready to grab her if she faltered but she didnt he judged she was running more on determination than strength well determination would serve at least for a little while she didnt cook her meat for very long but tore at it with strong white teeth hamnet let his char a bit more on the outside he wasnt so desperately empty as she was he and liv had done their best to feed her while she was beyond herself but he knew they hadnt done well enough ha trasamund shouted the moment he saw marcovefa the jarl pointed a beefy forefinger at hamnet thyssen i told you so took you long enough to listen didnt it you tell me all kinds of things hamnet said i suppose youre bound to be right every once in a while so much for an apology trasamunds answer was brief definite and highly obscene had he said it in a different way hamnet would have tried to kill him as things were he only grinned marcovefa giggled she could do that at the same time as he ate anything noisier might have made her slow down that shout from the bizogot made other people stick their heads out of their tents to find out what was going on they might be so many marmots when a fox yips marcovefa said she had an excuse to pause shed stripped one rib of meat and was about to start on the other ill want more after this she told hamnet nobody will stop you he said but he wasnt quite right trasamund came over and gave marcovefa a big smacking kiss after he broke away from her muskox grease gleamed on his lips liv embraced her so did runolf skallagrim and audun gilli everybody wanted to make much of her she wanted to eat and she did ulric skakki nudged hamnet nice to have hope again isnt it the adventurer said in a low voice hope count hamnet tasted the word in some surprise he nodded it seemed even richer and more mouthfilling than muskox marrow hope he said it again savoring the taste yes by god it is weve been a sad raggedy lot latelyplague take me if we havent only the stubborn buggers stuck at all trasamund said well things will look better soon you can boil me for an egg if they dont you can boil all of us if they dont hamnet said the bizogot jarl didnt try to tell him he was wrong the fuss over marcovefa finally brought eyvind torfinn and gudrid out of their tent well well the scholarly earl said what do we have here hale again are you what splendid news if gudrid thought the news splendid she hid it very well she glanced over to hamnet dead in bed just like you she said not deadjust asleep and better that than a foe in bed hamnet retorted they eyed each other with complete mutual loathing not for the first time hamnet wondered why she didnt back the rulers since he opposed them the only answer hed ever found was that they likely didnt want anything to do with her even in bed she couldnt care for that well too bad i am hale yes i have hamnet to thank that i am hale marcovefa said to earl eyvind she eyed gudrid who suddenly lost her bluster this side of murder hamnet was unlikely to do much to her magic offered marcovefa so many unpleasant possibilities gudrid started cutting up meat for breakfast marcovefa went over and got herself some more from a different chunk of the muskox carcass gudrid watched her warily count hamnet wondered whether marcovefa could work any magic at all weak as she still was when gudrid brought her meat to the fire it exploded into brilliant white flame gudrid let out a startled shriek she thrust her hand into the snow so the sudden burst of heat must have burned her eyvind torfinn hurried over to her how bad is it he asked anxiously nottoo gudrid looked at her hand no not too but only luck it isnt that horrible bitch she sent marcovefa a glare full of daggers if you would leave off quarreling with her and with count hamnet you would give her no excuse for harassing you eyvind torfinn sounded earnest and sensible that of course did him no good with gudrid how am i supposed to eat she shrilled theres nothing left of that piece of meat try another one then yes earl eyvind was sensible im sure everything will be all right this time im not but gudrids only other choice was going hungry she worried another gobbet off the carcass marcovefa whose new rib had cooked in the most ordinary way imaginable sat there smiling and watching her do it gudrid muttered to herself hamnet thought she wanted to tell marcovefa to look away but didnt have the nerve he doubted whether he would have had the nerve himself more than a little apprehensively gudrid took the new piece of meat over to the closest fire it didnt burst into white flame it burst into searing green flame instead gudrid squalled and soothed her hand with snowalthough again the real damage seemed small how am i supposed to eat she asked again plaintively this time marcovefa smiled marcovefa seemed to gain strength far faster than finally getting enough to eat again could account for by the end of her first day awake she wasnt far from where she had been before the rulers wounded and enchanted her so it seemed to hamnet thyssen anyhow did you enjoy making gudrid squawk he asked her yes she said matteroffactly did you enjoy it too some hamnet felt uncomfortable admitting it but he would have felt more uncomfortable lying good she should leave you alone if she has not got the sense to do that she will find out other people will not leave her alone me for instance marcovefa hesitated something she rarely did but maybe i should have just slapped her instead of using a spell even one that is not so big what why hamnet asked because the rulers curse them they felt it i could tell they know i am awake again marcovefa said oh the small word carried a lot of freight theyll try to do something about that wont they yes marcovefas brief answer was freighted too i am dangerous to themand so are you me everybody says so but i wish i could believe it hamnet said who woke me you did marcovefa said could anyone else have done that i do not think so do we have a better chance with me or without me with me i think and you put me back in the fight that doesnt make me dangerous it makes you dangerous count hamnet insisted and you are you know it and the rulers know it and they know about you too and they fear you marcovefa told him the rulers dont fear much of anything hamnet despised them which didnt mean he didntreluctantlyrespect them say what you would of them they made formidable foes they fear us not just me us marcovefa sounded so certain she challenged hamnet thyssen not to believe her and then she did something altogether different she changed the subject you know how you got me to wake up yes i finally listened to trasamund hamnet answered that isnt something you want to do every day not if you have any sense this is not what i meant you should know it is not marcovefa said severely you know what you did to make me wake up of course i know what i did hamnet said if it had been anything else i would have tried it sooner i was not awake then i did not wake up till the morning i am awake now marcovefa waited with what hamnet took to be quickly shrinking patience a heartbeat or two more slowly than he should have hamnet realized why her patience might be shrinking well then he said after the light dawned lets see what we can do about that what they did was what theyd done the night before as hamnet had known it would be it was a great deal better with both of them awake to take pleasure in it afterwards marcovefa stroked his cheek we do all right together that was less than enormous praise but enough to make hamnet nod how much more can you hope for he said even managing to keep that much would be better than hed done with gudrid or liv as if picking the thought from his mind marcovefa said i am surprised you did not kill that mouthy woman while i lay asleep she is like a fleashe bites and jumps away and then bites again i came close a couple of times count hamnet admitted but people talk if you kill a woman let them she is gone after that and no one has to listen to her any more marcovefa said ruthlessly hamnet didnt care to think about that thinking about it was too likely to tempt him to do it he changed the subject instead the rulers wizards can sense youre yourself again marcovefa nodded i said so i was not spinning fables theyll come after you then theyll come after all of us hamnet thyssen wanted those to be questions they came out as flat statements she nodded again it is as we said this morningi am sure they will they are not fools they would not be so much trouble if they were if i were fighting us i would come after us once i got such news would you not too right i would hamnet said regretfully there you are then marcovefa might have been a schoolmistress going through a proof in geometry back in his school days hamnet had never imagined lying naked on a mammoth hide with a schoolmistress most teachers in raumsdalia were men most of the ones who werent were neither young nor attractive he supposed that rule was bound to have exceptions but hed never met one again he hauled his thoughts back to the business at hand how can we beat them but that wasnt the question he really needed to ask he asked the one that was can we beat them they would not worry so much about us if they did not think we could marcovefa answered how hamnet asked bluntly i dont know we will have to find that way marcovefa asked a question of her own do you think you can find the way again most of the time hamnet would have said noit was too soon and he not young enough but he found he could after all so he did as hed seen before having a shaman for a lover wasnt the worst thing in the world no indeed xix sudertorp lake was thawing spring was in the air so were countless thousandsmillions more likelyof waterfowl all bound for the marshes around the lake to breed in years gone by the leaping lynxes would have settled in their stone huts to live off the fat of the land as long as it lasted no more the rulers had smashed that bizogot clan and marcovefa didnt want to go back toward the eastern edge of the lake where the leaping lynxes village stood why not hamnet asked her so did trasamund so did liv so did audun gilli so did ulric skakki so did runolf skallagrim and everyone else who knew her it is not lucky she answered when people tried to argue with herand a lot of them didshe added are you the shaman or am i liv and audun had magical talents of their own neither claimed talents to match hers though earl eyvind tried to use logic against her logic he had in plenty though no more sorcerous talents than one of the ducks that dabbled in the chilly lake marcovefa heard him out she respected logic and knowledge having heard him out she smiled and repeated it is not lucky after a moment she continued you may go there if you think you must if you have no joy of it do not blame me eyvind torfinn spluttered that makes no sense he complained then goyou and your wife marcovefa said see what happens to you you sound as if youd be glad to get rid of us eyvind told her you said it not me marcovefa replied hamnet thyssen wasnt sure how much eyvind knew about gudrids feuds with practically everyone else more than the scholarly earl let on odds were he was sure eyvind stopped arguing with marcovefa he was also sure neither eyvind nor gudrid left the band of bizogots and raumsdalians still in the field against the rulers and he was sure the rulers were moving against that band though cautiously scouts reported squadrons of the invaders along with their riding deer and war mammoths both to the north and to the south for the time being though the rulers didnt try to close with their enemies they seemed content to gather strength for the fight once it did begin they wont fool around when they come after us this time will they trasamund said grimly think of it as respect from the enemy count hamnet told him ive been thinking of it that way all along ulric skakki said even so i could do without the honor if you cant well in that case youre foolish in ways i never gave you credit for which ways did you give him credit for now trasamund sounded intrigued ulric answered without the least hesitation well hes foolish about women of course and he trusts people too bloody much and theres his confounded stubborn sense of duty he watched the jarl nod eagerly then continued with a certain relish his voice hadnt held before but for sheer blockheaded stupidity give me a bizogot every time trasamund swore at him ulrics grin was raw impudence hamnet thyssen considered the adventurers charges you son of a whore he said i cant even tell you youre wrong i am your servant your grace ulric skakki replied did i mention your deplorable habit of speaking the truth when a lie would serve you better no i dont believe i did well no matter emperor sigvat would have more to say on that score hamnet expressed a detailed opinion on what his majesty could do about it sigvat ii would have had to be improbably limber to accomplish even a quarter of it trasamund guffawed ulric grinned again hearing hamnets suggestions runolf skallagrim asked whos that youre telling off nobody important hamnet said only the emperor runolf looked troubled you really shouldnt joke like that thyssen havent you seen what happens when you do too right i have hamnet said but whos joking hes right you know ulric said by baron runolfs scowl he knew nothing of the sort sighing ulric spelled it out for him if sigvat were important the rulers would go after him as hard as they could right are they doing that are they doing anything close to that not likely what are they doing theyre pulling their warriors and mammoths out of raumsdalia so they can come after us how important does that make sigvat runolf skallagrim grunted well all right if youre going to put it that way but you still shouldnt say rude things about the emperor id say them to his face if he were here count hamnet told him he deserves a lot of the blame for whats gone wrong if he hadnt decided the rulers werent dangerous the empire would be better off i dont know if we could have beaten the rulers but we would have given them a better fight id bet on that since runolf didnt answer hamnet hoped hed made his point up in the sky an arrowhead of geese flew toward sudertorp lake and another and another there were also ducks and swans and snipes and coots and every other sort of bird that lived on water or by it they knew what season of the year it was or would be soon hamnet thyssen didnt know how they knew but they did trasamund eyed the waterbirds and shorebirds too mosquito season any day now he said dolefully the bugs knew when to hatch hamnet didnt know how they knew either he only wished they didnt when spring came to the bizogot steppe it came in a rush one day the snow lay thick and drifted on the ground the next it was gone and everything was green and growing with flowers splashing the plains with color it couldnt really have happened so fast could it looking back count hamnet supposed that was impossible but it didnt seem so at the time sudertorp lake had already thawed the new years growth around the lakeshore sheltered the incoming birds ulric skakki baited a hook with bits of offal and pulled several fat trout out of the lake fishing fascinated the bizogots most streams up here held nothing to catch because they froze top to bottom during the winter as it so often was sudertorp lake was different ulrics catch fascinated hamnet for another reason how did you happen to have a fish hook he asked the adventurer i have all kinds of things ulric replied with dignity never can tell when one of them will come in handy where did you get the hook hamnet persisted down in raumsdalia ulric could be maddeningly opaque when he told the truth as if to explain himself further he went on the bizogots dont make em you know even if they did theyd carve em out of bone they wouldnt use bronze hamnet gave up all right so ulric found a way to take advantage of something where nobody else could what was so surprising about that the rulers skirmished with the scouts the bizogots and raumsdalians set out they didnt seem eager to close with them though hamnet wondered at that actually he wondered less than he marveled theyre afraid of you he said to marcovefa thats the only thing holding them back if they were smart they would strike soon she answered but they are the rulers they are not smartnot as smart as they think they are not as strong as they think they are either he looked at her how long did you lie there with your spirit disconnected from your body marcovefa shrugged as if to say that was of no account if i had stayed all together we would not have come up here onto the steppe she said we need to be up here why count hamnet asked bluntly she only shrugged again i do not know yet when the time comes i will know i think i will anyhow what happens if you dont hamnet inquired then maybe the song does not have the ending the singer first intended to give it marcovefa said but i do not think it will turn out like that when i need to know something i know it till then till then i only think i need to know it she could be almost as maddening as ulric the one thing she lacked was his smiling insolence but if she only thought she needed to know something now hamnet couldnt be too angry at her for not actually knowing it he didnt suppose he could anyhow more and more rulers came down from the direction of the gap and up from raumsdalia as far as fighting strength went they could have crushed their foes in a couple of hours if not sooner but more than fighting strength went into the balance so did sorcerous strength there thanks to marcovefa the rulers felt less confident when bizogots encamped their mammothand muskoxhide tents scattered all over the landscape each one pitched wherever its owner happened to want it raumsdalian army encampments werent much neater no one in the empire had seen much point to imposing order on something likely to get torn down the next day as they were in so many ways the rulers were different hamnet thyssen had seen that the moment he first set eyes on one of their camps out beyond the gap they pitched tents in rows and in squares no matter where they were each of their camps always looked like all the others and when a troop encamped in different places night after night each mans tent always sat in the same place in the grid their warriors always knew where to find a friend or a superior or a shaman their beasts were always tethered in the same positions that had its advantages especially in emergencies it was one more reason they beat the bizogots and the raumsdalians far more often than they lost to them count hamnet watched from the natural dam of rocks and dirt and underground ice that contained sudertorp lake as more and more of those dark squares filled the lowlying lands to the west war mammoths and riding deer went back and forth among the encampments count hamnet supposed men on foot did too but most of them were too far away for him to see he turned to ulric skakki i didnt know they had so many men he remarked and quickly went on if you say life is full of surprises ill bash you over the head with a boulder in that case id have to be bolder than i am to say it the adventurers eyes twinkled as a matter of fact theyve got more men than i figured too what are we going to do about it hamnet asked heavily good question ulric said what are we going to do about it if he couldnt be difficult one way he would be another i was hoping you might have an answer hamnet said you should always hope that way when things dont work out youll be properly disappointed as usual ulric was most outrageous when he sounded most reasonable sooner or laterprobably soonerthe rulers will decide theyve got enough mammoths and men and magicians to smash us flat hamnet said then theyll set out to do it how do you propose to stop them i expect ill fight ulric answered if fighting looks hopeless i expect ill run not many more choices are there well theres always dying hamnet said ill do that so will you but you can bugger me with a pine cone if ill do it by choice ulric said marcovefa walked over to them eating greasy goose and duck agreed with her she wasnt holloweyed any more and her cheekbones no longer showed as sharp promontories under tightwrapped skin what are you two going on about she asked dying only ulric could make the word sound so cheery marcovefa looked back at sudertorp lake at the marsh plants springing up all around it and at the waterfowl whose wingbeats sometimes made speech difficult because of their astounding abundance she turned and looked at the rulers encampments to the west then she looked down at the mossy boulder she was standing on and at the ice that still survived in the shadowed crevice between it and the dirt around it and then she started to laugh whatever was going on in her mind it was so funny that she had trouble stopping laughing still she kissed ulric before hamnets jealousy could flare she kissed him too as he held her her shoulders shook with mirth whats so funny he asked dying she said oh there will be a great dying all right that might have been the best joke in the world she laughed so much she got the hiccups hiccuping and giggling and shaking her head she ambled back toward the forlorn encampment the bizogots and raumsdalians had set up just south of the earthen dam i knew i was a funny fellow ulric skakki remarked but i didnt think i was that funny neither did i hamnet assured him now we need to find out one more thing ulric made a questioning noise hamnet explained whether you really are when the rulers finally decided they were ready to move forward against the ragtag band of bizogots and raumsdalians still opposing them they took their time forming a battle line maybe they wanted their foes to see everything they had and to despair if so they knew how to get what they wanted hamnet thyssen had never seenhad never dreamt ofso many war mammoths drawn up side by side hed never imagined so many riding deer all in the same place more than a few rulers were on horse back too the invaders had quickly learned to make the most of what this new land offered them they couldnt keep that large a force fed for long soon the mammoths and deer and horses would strip every growing thing from the ground around their encampments even sooner hamnet thought the enemy warriors would eat everything bigger than a mosquito of course the rulers didnt have to hold their army together long as soon as theyd disposed of their foes they could disperse across the broad bizogot steppe trasamund shaded his eyes with the palm of his hand i wonder how many of them i can kill before they finally drag me down he said i wonder if wed have a better chance fighting somewhere else hamnet didnt want to talk about running not with trasamund unlike ulric the jarl would take it the wrong way seeing what the rulers were about to hurl at them made him cast about for ways to do it though some of us can get away maybe most of us can ulric himself came closer to directness but he added i dont know how much of a fight well ever put up afterwards if we do ride out how much of a fight can we put up here and now runolf skallagrim asked a painfully cogent question we need to stay here marcovefa said this is where we make our stand fear and doubt filled everyone else she seemed serene what do you know that we dont hamnet asked her why what i know of course she sounded surprised he needed to ask and that is he persisted it certainly is marcovefa agreed for a moment he was furious then slowly he realized it was one of those things she might know but had no words for hed seen that before with her and with other shamans and wizards sometimes it all came together at the proper moment sometimes of course it didnt if it didnt this time he couldnt imagine their getting another chance several men on riding deer moved out in front of the rulers war mammoths their wizards marcovefa said they think that if they can kill me first everything else is easy are they right hamnet blurted yes this time yes she nodded with as little fuss as if hed asked her whether the sun was shining can they do it trasamund found a more urgent question still i dont know marcovefa answered still calmly with what seemed like irrelevance to count hamnet she added the glacier is melting then she said if they do not kill me i will kill them hamnet liked the sound of that much better but the rulers were going to have their try first marcovefa gestured to the men around her as if to say they would be none too safe if they stayed close to her neither hamnet nor any of the others moved more than a pace or two the enemy wizards put their heads together they might have been talking about some game and so they were but to the victors here went life the wizards separated again one of them pointed not at marcovefa but at the sky above her head lightning crashed down though the day was bright and sunny and clear but it didnt strike marcovefa instead it smote the earthen dam a couple of bowshots north of where she stood steam rose from the riven ground another bolt of lightning struck again marcovefa deflected it more steam spurted from the dam enclosing sudertorp lake and marcovefa laughednot a mirthfilled laugh but one that made hamnets hackles rise god might have laughed that way thinking of a particularly nasty joke marcovefa pointed down toward the rulers wizards fools she shouted in her own dialect you dig your own graves fools they couldnt have heard herthey were too far away even if they had heard her they wouldnt have understood her hamnet thyssen barely did ulric skakki saw the same thing what is she going to do he whispered i dont know hamnet whispered back im not sure she knows herself but whatever it is i wouldnt want it aimed at me the rulers wizards must have felt the same way the one whod pointed at the sky extended his hand again not above marcovefa this time but straight toward her fire spurted from his outstretched finger fire that hamnet somehow realized was powered by all the enemy magicians together that spear of flame took only a couple of heartbeats to fly from the ruler to marcovefa she gestured with her right hand instead of cremating her the fire also smashed against the earthen dam the sound of that impact was like redhot iron dropped into a bucket of water but magnified a hundredfold when the fiery gout also went wide the rulers wizards seemed to slump on their riding deer theyd tried two strong weapons and failed with both now their manner said it was marcovefas turn she looked toward the dam of earth and rock and ice the dam toward which shed deflected their spells when she did the rulers lead wizard let out an anguished howl count hamnet heard clearly no matter how far away the man was the wizard knew what would happen next even if hamnet didnt marcovefa chanted in her own dialect hamnet understood a word here and thereno more ulric knew more of the speech of the folk who lived atop the glacier he lost his usual air of studied calm she cant do that he yelped can she do what hamnet asked then marcovefa did it she swept both hands upward then theatrically brought them down now she criedhamnet understood that with no trouble at all and the earthen dam erupted all the ice within it either melted or turned to steam boulders flew high into the air one of them came down just a few yards in front of the rulers wizards only frantic passes from marcovefa kept the stones from squashing her and her companions hamnet thyssen noticed all that but only peripherally once a couple of thousand years before nidaros the imperial capital had stood by the eastern edge of hevring lake then the glacier retreated and the weather warmed the dam of earth and ice that held in hevring lake melted and collapsedand the lake poured out what had been its bottom was some of the most fertile farmland in the empire and the lands to the west for mile after mile after mile were scabby wrecked badlandsall that remained after a flood bigger than human imagination could grasp poured through count hamnet didnt have to imagine a flood like that he watched one with his own eyes as marcovefas magic melted the dam that had restrained sudertorp lake for so long it burst free the roar of those rushing waters dwarfed anything hamnet had ever heard from the throat of lion or bear how high was that frothy muddy stonefilled wall of water as tall as ten men twenty more he didnt know not exactly he knew it was tall enough and to spare somehowsorcerouslyhe heard the rulers wizards scream even through that immense roaring their leader tried to do something to deflect the doom thundering down on them marcovefa clapped her hands once in what had to be admiration for the effort the lead wizard wasnt strong enough even with all his friends behind him even if he would have had the strength he didnt have the time he needed to shape the kind of spell that might have done some good the wall of water struck him struck the rest of the wizards and swept them away in less than the blink of an eye it smashed into the war mammoths behind the wizards a few minutes earlier hamnet had thought that the line of great beasts was one of the most fearsome things hed ever seen now he had to change his opinion he got a few brief glimpses of mammoths tossed like bathtub toys on the flood other than those the heart of the rulers armed might vanished without a trace so did all the warriors on riding deer and horses so did the neat squares of tents that were the rulers encampments so did well everything in the path of what had been sudertorp lake god trasamund saidthe most reverent hamnet thyssen had ever heard him sound even marcovefa was impressed i didnt think it would do that she murmured what did you think it would do ulric skakki inquired drown them that yes marcovefa said but all this this is more than i bargained for hamnet suspected it was more than anyone would have bargained for there off to his right less than a bowshot away sudertorp lake was emptying like a pot with a hole in its side all of them still had to shout to make themselves heard over the roar of the water god trasamund said again this time on a different note what is it count hamnet asked the lake will run dry yes the bizogot said no more water here no more marsh around the edge what will the waterfowl do when they come here to breed it was a good question and one hamnet hadnt thought of after a moment he said back in the day the birds must have come to hevring lake the same way hevring lake went away but we still have waterfowl i suppose we still will once sudertorp lake dries out too mm youre likely right trasamund replied he turned to marcovefa if the rulers hadnt broken the leaping lynx clan the lynxes would all want to kill you for ruining their hunting grounds if the rulers hadnt broken the leaping lynxes and done everything else they did marcovefa wouldnt have needed to break the dam hamnet said sooner or later it would have melted through by itself though they couldnt have kept their easy springs and summers forever theyd had them he thought fondly of all the duck and goose fat hed eaten near sudertorp lake but trasamund was right this hunting ground would never be the same even now waterfowl and shorebirds were flying up in alarm as the meltwater lake drained ulric pointed off to the west a mammoth just washed ashore over there must be a mammothi couldnt see anything smaller that far away is it moving hamnet asked he couldnt spot it maybe he didnt know where to look no ulric said and then i dont know about the water birds but the teratorns and the vultures and the ravens will feast like never before let them eat the rulers let them eat the war mammoths let them raise their chicks on the riding deer trasamund said i rejoice that they enjoy this bounty from the invaders eyvind torfinn and gudrid came up to stare at the spectacle marcovefa had unleashed my my the earl said what an amazingly opportune coincidence excuse me did i say something funny no one answered him for some little while hamnet and marcovefa and the others were too busy laughing dont you pay attention to anything ulric asked at last didnt you see the thunderbolts coming down out of the sky didnt you hear them or are you blind and deaf neither i hope eyvind replied with dignity but surely those thunderbolts could not have causedthis they didnt hamnet pointed to marcovefa she did probably luck with her taking the credit for it gudrid muttered what do you say marcovefa needed only four words to suggest that if she didnt like the answer gudrid would go into sudertorp lake and come out the way ulrics distant war mammoth had gudrid did own a firstclass sense of selfpreservation uh nothing she said quickly nothing at all justclearing my throat she nodded yes thats all i was doing nobody called her on it marcovefa had to know she was lying but putting her in fear must have been almost as good as pitching her into what was left of sudertorp lake hamnet thyssen looked back at the lake was he imagining things or was the water level already a good deal lower i wonder how long itll take to empty out altogether he said if we knew the volume and the rate of flow it would be easy to calculate earl eyvind replied and if a teratorn knew how to play the trumpet he might end up emperor sigvats bandmaster ulric said eyvind torfinn sent him a reproachful look the adventurer took no notice of it trasamund bowed low to marcovefa this is vengeance i thank you for it all the bizogots thank you for it this is better than vengeance marcovefa said you are a wise woman no one doubts it as if to emphasize that the jarl bowed again but tell me if you will what can be better than vengeance victory is better marcovefa answered in getting vengeance you can throw yourself away to no purpose but killing here you have vengeance and you have not thrown yourself away trasamund weighed her words it is so he said at last wonder in his voice by god it is so he bowed even lower this time count hamnet looked out to the west again all he could see where the rulers army had been were raging waters how many miles did the flood already stretch how many more would it reach wandering bizogots and beasts and perhaps even the odd ruler who hadnt joined in this attack would get swept away without ever knowing how or why the dam at the west end of sudertorp lake had broken down that would matter to themfor a very little while in the larger scheme of things it hardly counted the rulers are ruined theyre wrecked hamnet said he liked the sound of that so much he repeated it liv and audun gilli shyly approached marcovefa forgive us for not offering help but liv began we thought you could take care of it for yourself audun broke in and we were right liv said by god were we ever audun stared in awe at the rampaging lake he whistled in admiration we didnt know what you were going to do whatever it might be we didnt expect this his wave encompassed the torrent how could anyone expectthis liv said turning back to marcovefa she asked did you the shaman from atop the glacier shook her head i knew we could beat the rulers i knew we would beat the rulers how they showed me themselves when they threw thunderbolts and fire toward me and i sent them into the dam that showed me the way i told them they were digging their own graves and i was right as trasamund had before her liv bowed to marcovefa i am glad it showed you the way then to hamnets surprise she also bowed to him if you hadnt helped keep her safe and if you hadnt brought her back to herself we wouldnt have won this is why the rulers feared youand had reason to it would have been all right without me hamnet said yes i think so too if anyone was less ready to give hamnet thyssen credit than he was himself it had to be gudrid i do not that was marcovefa and not even gudrid thought arguing with her was a good idea sometimes marcovefa sounded like anyone else others hamnet wondered whether god spoke through her she wouldnt have said so she would have laughed at him but how else could she seem so knowing so authoritative she awed and alarmed even other wizards shed awed and alarmed the rulers and with reason theyd tried their best to kill her only their best turned out not to be good enough when she finally turned the tables they found out how good her best could be that lesson wouldnt need repeating as if thinking along with him trasamund said with luck we can deal with the ones who trickle through the gap now i think most of the rulers who were going to come already got here and most of the ones whod already got here got swept away hamnet added yes the jarl nodded he smiled amazing how happy one word can make you isnt it if you have to pick one word that ones more likely to than most hamnet answered smiling still trasamund nodded while everyone else kept looking west and watching the floodwaters rampage across the bizogot steppe eyvind torfinn chose to look east he suddenly stiffened as if transfixed by an arrow only his right arm moved to point out into what had been the middle of sudertorp lake hamnet thyssens gaze followed earl eyvinds outthrust forefinger hamnet suddenly found himself transfixed too how long had those graceful gilded domes those delicate columns lain under the water had anyone imagined they were there had they been there when the glacier rolled down from the north too how long had they been there before that is it hamnet asked yes this once eyvind torfinns nod was as authoritative as anything marcovefa could manage that is the golden shrine xx and so it was count hamnet realized hed seen those domes before in miniature he needed a moment to remember where then he did in the jewel hidden in earl eyvinds bedpost how old was that jewel anyhow a moment later he realized it had to be eyvinds not gudrids for she said it cant be everybody knows the golden shrine is only a tale for childrenand foolish children at that that is the golden shrine trasamund said it must have hidden under the lake all this timeand under the glacier before that because once upon a time the glacier stretched down farther than this true once the glacier stretched down almost as far as nidaros i was thinking about that not long ago hamnet thyssen said hevring lake melted through and made the badlands off to the west thanks to marcovefa sudertorp lakes gone and done the same thing its nonsense gudrids laugh had a brittle edge its impossible even a fool should be able to see that only a fool would say that marcovefa replied awe lit her face as she pointed out toward the structure in the emptying lake that is assuredly the golden shrine it cant be gudrid repeated how do you know it is its a shrine its golden it just appeared out of nothing like a miracle ulric skakki ticked off points on his fingers as he made them what more do you want egg in your beer youre making fun of me gudrid said shrilly when you say silly things you can expect other people to make fun of you ulric observed gudrid glared at him hamnet saw that but he didnt think the adventurer did ulrics eyes were fixed firmly on the golden shrine up till now going through the gap and beyond the glacier was the most marvelous thing i ever did i imagined it always would be now i see i was wrong hamnet nodded he hadnt dreamt he could do anything more amazing than to pass through the gap and see what lay on the far side of the glacier either he hadnt even thought the glacier had a far side hed believed it went on forever like ulric hed been wrong when gudrid went on protesting that the buildings the emptying lake revealed couldnt possibly be the golden shrine hamnet cut her off with a sharp chopping gesture most of us are going over there no matter what you think it is you can come with us or stay behindwhichever you please you cant talk to me that way she said no he looked at her i just did he turned away she went on complaining but he ignored her after that the bizogots and raumsdalians whod come this far had mounted for a last desperate battle against the rulers they greeted marcovefa with thunderous cheersmuch of their joy no doubt was transformed relief that they wouldnt die in the next few hours she blushed like a girl as she waved to them which only made their cheers redouble and they took up a chant the shrine the shrine the golden shrine it could have sounded better since some spoke raumsdalian and others the bizogots tongue no one seemed inclined to criticize before long marcovefa and the ragtag armys other leaders were also on horse back the rest of the warriors behind them they rode east along what had been the southern shore of sudertorp lake it was a shoreline no more as sudertorp lake was a lake no more waterfowl flew in wild confusion hamnet hoped they would find new nesting grounds even if the golden shrine was visible now he wasnt sure how anyone could reach it sudertorp lake might be vanishing but wouldnt its bottom prove impenetrable ooze that glued men and horses in place and might suck them down never to be seen again earl eyvind had another thought after so very long how much could have survived in there im astonished the buildings themselves have now that you mention it so am i hamnet thyssen said well see thats all were here its here however it got here we cant do anything else but find out can we eyvind shook his head it is the golden shrine marcovefa said it is as it is meant to be we will see what we are meant to see learn what we are meant to learn what will that be hamnet asked she gave him a dazzling smile if i already knew i wouldnt learn anything would i even as they rode toward the golden shrine more and more of it emerged from the lake the outgoing flood should have wrecked it but seemed to have left it unharmed of course if it truly had lain under the glacier for centuries uncounted that should have ground it to powder obviously no such thing had happened when hamnet thyssen wondered why not out loud earl eyvind said it is the golden shrine if the ordinary laws of nature applied to it it would be something else altogether it is the golden shrine because those laws do not apply that is not the only reason but it is a compelling one the old man is right trasamund rumbled that made eyvind torfinn look imperfectly delighted at the agreement marcovefa nodded without any opinions about his age he seemed happier then its the golden shrine hamnet said whatevers wrong with us whatevers wrong with the world now the shrine can fix it an ancient verse says we take no more away from the shrine than we bring to it earl eyvind remarked marcovefa nodded again this time so did ulric skakki frowning trasamund asked what the demon does that mean hamnet would have said more or less the same thing if the jarl hadnt beaten him to it eyvind torfinn only shrugged the text may be corrupt and it is certainly obscure we shall be able to do what the author could notwe shall discover for ourselves what he meant seems plain enough to me ulric said but then he waved his hand i may be wrong god knows the truth may be hiding under what looks plain the same way the golden shrine hid under sudertorp lake i wonder why nobody out in the lake ever looked down and saw it it did not wish to be seen marcovefa replied talking about a building in that way should have been nonsense hamnet had the feeling it wasnt i suppose it didnt want to get crushed when the glacier rolled down from the north either ulric said which had already occurred to hamnet it must not have had it wanted that be sure that would have happened she said ulric started to answer then seemed to think better of it count hamnet didnt blame him he wouldnt have known how to answer that either a goose flew up from its nest wings thundering audun gilli pointed at what looked like a paving stone half covered by lakeside plants isnt that the start of a road out to the shrine he said hamnet was on the point of saying he thought that was ridiculous before he could marcovefa nodded briskly yes i do believe it is she replied at that hamnet swung down from his horse and walked over to the nest the goose had abandoned he picked up and hefted an egg what are you doing marcovefa asked what with everything else thats gone on i wondered if wed found the nest of the goose that lays the golden eggs he answered doesnt seem that way though too bad replacing the egg hed taken he mounted again marcovefa scratched her head maybe her folk didnt tell that story but she didnt ask any questions audun was right that road did lead out toward the golden shrine and next to the shrine even golden eggs werent important enough to worry about how long had it been since men last visited the golden shrine how long had it been since the glacier rolled down from the north and covered it hamnet thyssen asked earl eyvind the scholar only shook his head and spread his hands thousands of yearsthats all i can say if you ask me how many thousands well for this your guess is as good as mine thousands of years seems close enough ulric skakki said count hamnet wasnt inclined to argue with him to look at it though the golden shrine might have vanished from human ken day before yesterday or for that matter it might never have vanished at all the tiles that decorated the outer walls were decorated with what looked like an elaborate sinuous script but if it was writing it wasnt writing of a kind hamnet had ever seen before he glanced toward the widely traveled ulric skakki when he caught the adventurers eyes ulric only shrugged he couldnt read those sparkling tiles either he and hamnet both looked at eyvind torfinn eyvind wasnt so widely traveled but he was widelyand deeplyread that might count for more then again it might not if you are wondering gentlemen i must confess that i have never seen the like he said oh hamnet couldnt hide his disappointment ulric was looking around most of the lake bottoms just mud and gravel the way youd expect he said but not this road and not the ground right in front of the golden shrine youre right hamnet wondered why he hadnt noticed that himself maybe because the road leading toward the golden shrine seemed so ordinary no mud or gravel fouled the flagstones they werent even wet they should have been but they werent which meant they werent ordinary either even if they seemed to be neither was the grass growing in front of the golden shrine it was grass not some underwater weed it grew there as if the shrine had been standing in the sun for all these years hamnet knew better but the illusion remained convincing trasamund chuckled nervously next thing you know that door will open and a priest or shaman or whatever you want to call him will come out and bid us good day dont be more ridiculous than you can help gudrid snapped eyvind torfinn coughed my dear in our present state of knowledgeor rather of ignorancecalling anything ridiculous would be well ridiculous hamnet reached out and tapped trasamund on the arm once upon a time you said wed fight it out in front of the golden shrines door if you still want to try it your ferocity im ready the jarl started to reach over his back for his great sword then he stopped and laughed and shook his head let it go thyssenlet it go with this in front of me i can do without the sport unless you think your honors touched of course if you do ill gladly oblige you right now letting go is better hamnet said glad trasamund didnt want to hold him to their promise he nodded to marcovefa you must have expected all this not me she said i always thought beating the rulers would have to happen up here on the bizogot plain i didnt understand why that was so till just before the end and the golden shrine who could expect the golden shrine you hope you imagine you never expect a goose alighted in a puddle on what had been the bottom of sudertorp lake the bird seemed bewildered at the changes that had turned its world all topsyturvy hamnet thyssen understood how it felt the road ran straight to the golden shrine had it really lain there under the waters of the lake had it really lain under the glacier even longer like the shrine the road showed no signs of any such mishap had they been somewhere elseperhaps not even on or in or of this world at alland suddenly appeared here when the rulers were swept away however tempting that was count hamnet couldnt believe it both the roadway and the golden shrine gave the impression of belonging where they were he couldnt have said why or how they did but it was so he slid off his horse and walked toward the doorway a polished brass knocker was fixed to the door just below eye level why isnt it green with patina he wondered when the golden shrine wasnt drippingwhen it wasnt ground to dusthe had no idea why that detail puzzled him but it did gudrid laughed harshly when he reached for the knocker instead of the latch do you truly think someone will open it she jeered i dont know what to think right now hamnet answered and if you think you do know youre wrong the knocker swung smoothly in his hand he rapped with it once twice three times the clear sharp sound echoed out over what had been sudertorp lake the goose in the puddle took off hamnet paused then knocked three more times oh well so much for that ulric skakki said now try the latch hamnet was reaching for it when the door into the golden shrine swung open on silent hinges magic he thought or maybe the power of god is there any difference a woman in a golden robe looked out at him and his companions good day she said that was what he heard anyhow although it didnt match the motion of her lips trasamund laughed raucously ha he told gudrid dyou see do you she pointed her nose to the sky pretending not to hear welcome the woman went on we havent had visitors in oh quite a long time she wasnt very large her hair was light brown her eyes somewhere between green and hazel by that and by her cast of features she might have been either raumsdalian or bizogotor both or neither she speaks my dialect marcovefa said and then oh it must be a translation spell if the rulers sometimes use them why should we be surprised the folk of the golden shrine do too it is a translation spell the woman in the golden robe agreed in a way marcovefas words made good sense to hamnet in another how are there folk of the golden shrine he asked this place has mm been through a lot hasnt it yesand no that is the only answer i can give smiling the woman stood aside come in you will see for yourselves there was only one problem with that no one wanted to stay behind and hold the horses after some argument hamnet said well just tether them then i dont think anyone will steal them not on the grounds of the golden shrine he glanced toward the priestess in some embarrassment her smile didnt falter all she said was i think you are right they are also unlikely to stray one by one the raumsdalians and bizogots dismounted they queued up behind count hamnet the horses hardly needed tethering they seemed content to crop the grass growing outside the wall youll be the first one in ulric told hamnet someday somebodyll write your name in a history book now tell me something that matters hamnet said ulric chuckled hamnet walked through the door and into the golden shrine it was warm in there not warm as if summer were here but warm as if the glacier had never rolled south warm as if the breath of god never blew some of the plants that grew in the courtyard lived far far to the south in lands where the breath of god didnt reach others hamnet thyssen had never seen before on this side of the glacier or the other he pointed to one of them have those grown here since before the ice began to swell he asked you might say so the priestess answered or you might not why do you talk in riddles marcovefa demanded this is the golden shrine this is the place where there should be answers not more questions the answers are here the priestess assured her whether you can understand them all that i fear is one more question she smiled to show she wasnt mocking marcovefa more priestesses and priests came out to greet the awestruck newcomers like the first one they might have been raumsdalians or bizogots or they might not have the one thing hamnet was sure of was that they werent close kin to the rulers as hamnet had eyvind torfinn pointed to some unfamiliar flowers where do these come from he asked why they grow here the priestess said i see that yes earl eyvind nodded but where did they come from before they grew here they grew out in the world before the glacier came down the priestess replied her eyes twinkled as she waved to include her colleagues so did we things outside the shrine have changed more than they have here how much more eyvind asked have you yourself been here since before the glacier advanced put that way the question sounded innocuous what if hed asked are you thousands and thousands of years old that would have meant the same thing but it wouldnt have sounded the same oh nonot even close you had to call us forth the priestess said if you hadnt we would have gone on in nearnothingness till someone else did a day a month a year a century where we were none of them mattered very much we noticedabout the way you would notice an itch after we scratched it was gone and once it was gone it was forgotten could the rulers have uh called you forth hamnet thyssen used her term for it having no better one of his own the priestess frowned i do not like to say anything is impossiblethe fullness of time often makes a mockery of the word but i will say knowing what i know of the rulers that the idea strikes me as most unlikely what do you know of the rulers trasamund asked if youre so mighty why didnt you do something about them those are two separate questions a priest remarked coming up beside the priestess whod done all the talking till now he had a handsome face and a light pleasant voice he didnt seem dangerous hamnet wondered how much that proved very little unless he missed his guess the man went on which would you rather we answer either trasamund said both no ulric skakki shook his head tell us why you didnt do something about the rulers how do you know we didnt the priest said smiling they were stronger than you in almost every way yet you prevailed how because i found a spell that poured sudertorp lake out onto them marcovefa answered proudly the priest didnt lose his smile and how do you think that spell came to you he asked what did you know of lakes living up atop the glacier all your life how did he know that marcovefa hadnt said anything about it not in his hearing did he recognize her dialect that was the only thing that occurred to hamnet but it also struck him as unlikely the golden shrine had lain under sudertorp lake all the time marcovefas folk lived up there hadnt it or maybe these priests and priestesses were simply wizards who put not only the rulers but also marcovefa to shame marcovefa might have thought the same thing if you can give me that spell without my knowing it why dont you rule the world instead of staying under a lake she asked because we have enough sense not to want to rule it the priest answered the priestess beside him nodded hamnet thyssen hoped the man in the golden robe spoke the truth if the fellow didnt well what can you do about it hamnet asked himself he didnt see anything what could a butterfly do about a mammoth try not to be there when its feet came down that was all ulric skakki still held a small tight smile on his facethe smile perhaps of a man fighting hard not to be impressed or not to show how impressed he was now youre in trouble he told the priest now you dont have ice or water covering you up any more now all the cursed fools in the world will make tracks for this place expecting you to show them how to be wise his grin grew even tighter and more selfmocking as he added were here after all they will be disappointed the priest said fools often are the priestess agreed but not all of you here are fools if you were you would not have done what you did not all of us hamnet wondered he also wonderedand knew he would wonder for the rest of his lifehow much theyd really done themselves he couldnt know for certain and he couldnt blindly accept whatever answers he got here he knew he was a fool but he hoped he wasnt that kind of fool here is one thing more for you to think about the priest said no one takes away from the golden shrine even a barleycorn more than he brought to it i knew a verse to that effect eyvind torfinn exclaimed proudly ulric bowed to the man in the golden robe one of his eyebrows quirked as he straightened you can say that i may even believe you when you do but do you think it will do you any good do you think fools will pay any attention if they did by god they wouldnt be fools well we will worry about that when the time comes the priests voice stayed mild it has not come yet eyvind torfinn had gone over to another priest and was doing his best to talk the mans ears off hamnet had never seen him so excited well here he had his hearts desire with some men that was one particular woman with others it was gold and jewels piled high all earl eyvind had wanted was to find the golden shrine hed never dreamt he would but now he had gudrid could also see that women werent the first thing on eyvinds mind more particularly she could see she wasnt the first thing on his mind or on anyone elses hamnet could tell she didnt fancy that if she wasnt the center of attention she had trouble believing she was real liv and audun gilli were talking with a priestess the woman in the gold robe nodded and gestured liv looked entranced audun astonished maybe they wouldnt take a barleycorn away with them but count hamnet would have bet they were gaining something hamnet laughed not altogether pleasantly to the priest and priestess before him he said good thing youre up here on the bizogot steppe and not in raumsdalia emperor sigvat would try to tax you or make you tell him whatever you know or try to close you down to his surprise they looked amused some things never change the priestess said i dont suppose we expected this to be different from the way it was in the old days in the old days hamnet echoed what did that mean to these people are those the days before the glacier moved south this last time yes she said what were things like then do you know what things were like before the glacier came forward time before last hamnet wasnt eyvind torfinn but if you werent curious about ancient days in a place like this you probably had no pulse there were empires and kingdoms and wandering tribes people were people the priestess said and when the glacier moved a lot of them died so were the descendants of the ones who lived hamnet said you would be unlikely to derive from anyone else the priestess smile didnt keep hamnet from blushing do you remember those days yourself were you here for them he persisted how did this place survive when the glacier came down on top of it i was here for some of those days the worst time when people saw they couldnt stop the glacier and despaired she answered but as i said i have not been here for all the days since not in the usual sense of the word those days went around me not through methat is the best way i can put it but the glacier didnt go around the golden shrine the glacier went over it then sudertorp lake covered it hamnet said that is so the priestess agreed then how hed already asked once would asking twice do any good marcovefa touched his arm let it go she said i know more shamanry than your folk do these folk know more than that much more than i do they will not be able to explain it could you explain taming a horse to a baby making messes in its drawers i am not a baby hamnet thyssen said stubbornly your friend may have said that i did not the priestess assured him i she broke off suddenly she didnt look mild or amused her eyes flashed that wasnt aimed at hamnet he would no more have wanted it to be than he would have wanted a longbow aimed at his bare chest from five paces where is the woman who came in with you the priestess demanded marcovefa stood beside hamnet liv and audun were still talking with that other priestess a sinking feeling filled hamnet gudrid he asked if that is her name the priestess sounded impatientand angry where is she she has gone where she is not welcome the garden courtyard had several entrances one of course opened onto the outside world who could guess where the others led the priests and priestesses here already knew if they didnt want strangers around who could blame them hamnet thyssen wouldnt have left the courtyard without getting someones leave first but gudrid always assumed she was welcome anywhere im sure she meant no harm hamnet said though he wasnt sure of any such thing he wondered why he defended his former wife even knowing she wouldnt have done the same for him the only answer he found was that the two of them belonged to the same time he might have put in a good word for a ruler whod wandered away from the crowd you may be sure of that i am not the priestess turned away from him and spoke to her colleagues all of a sudden hamnet stopped being able to understand her he looked over at marcovefa she shruggedshe couldnt follow what the priestess was saying either an irate squawk came echoing out of one of the dark entranceways hamnet sighed quietlyyes that was gudrid take your hands off me she said i didnt do anything two priests steered her back out into the courtyard one had hold of each elbow she tried to kick one of them but his leg wasnt there when her foot swung through hamnet couldnt seen how she missed him only that she did he could also see that he wouldnt have tried antagonizing those men their faces warnedwarned him anywaythey had no patience for foolishness the priestess gestured the two priests let go gudrid came forward all the same plainly she didnt want to as plainly she had no choice i didnt do anything she repeated louder this time why did you go off where you had no business going the priestess asked in a voice like beaten bronze gudrid looked innocent she did it very wellcertainly well enough to have fooled hamnet before that made him distrust it now i didnt know i wasnt supposed to she said wideeyed i was just looking around is that so the priestess said by god it is gudrids eyes got wider and more innocentseeming than ever beside hamnet marcovefa stirred he thought he knew why he wouldnt have used gods name in this place not if there was the slightest chance he might be forsworn with gudrid as heartache had taught him there was always that chance gudrids right hand went to one of the pouches on her belt her expression changed from innocent to horrifiedshe didnt want that hand doing any such thing it opened the pouch even so what her hand took from it was a jewel on a chain the chain was of some silvery metal but hamnet didnt think it was silver the jewel might have been an opal but was more brilliant and shed more coruscating rainbows of light than any opal hed ever imagined he could see why gudrid would have admired it that shed been rash enough to take it appalled him did you bring this into the golden shrine the priestess asked surely knowing the answer already gudrid made a ghastly attempt to smile as she shook her head nno she said not even she with all her gall could keep her voice from wobbling how did it end up in your belt pouch then i gudrid paused i just grabbed it because i liked the way it looked wouldnt do she did manage to put a better face on it than that i wanted a little something to remember the golden shrine by a little something the priestess raised an eyebrow do you have any idea what you stole she gestured the jewel in gudrids hand flared bright as the sun gudrid squawked hamnet wondered if it burned her evidently not she showed no pain do you the priestess repeated hamnet noticed the woman didnt say what it was or how important it was in a place like this even such a marvel might be no more than a toy he wondered whether gudrid was too flustered to see that he suspected she might be ii meant no harm she quavered he would have pitied her even knowing what he knew he would have he disliked himself because that was true which didnt mean he could help it the look the priestess gave her made the glacier seem warm do you recall what you heard when you came in here the goldrobed woman asked nobody told me not to go looking at things even now gudrid tried to rally she said something obviously true something which also pulled attention away from the sorry truth that she hadnt just looked it didnt work hamnet hadnt thought it would maybe gudrid hadnt either but shed tried the priestess voice though remained implacable no that is not what i meant no one leaves the golden shrine with more than heor shebrings to it did you hear that i didnt think you were talking about things gudrid tossed her head i thought you people meant spiritual silliness spiritual material under the one stone what is the difference the priestess said count hamnet had never heard that name for god before the priestess went on we meant what we said we commonly do and so you will take no more away than you brought a priest strode up to gudrid she handed him the jewel and the chain he made them disappear hamnet couldnt quite see how the priestess pointed her forefinger at gudrid she murmured something in a tongue hamnet didnt understand gudrids eyes went blank a look of idiocy spread across her face eyvind torfinn cried out in anguish in his own way he had to love her she will never remember anything of her time here the priestess said never nor may she ever return that is her punishment face softening slightly she spoke to earl eyvind she will regain her wits such as they are when she leaves this place be thankful the golden shrine knows mercy even for those who may not deserve it eyvind bowedcreakily as an old man would i am thankful priestess gudrid would be too if she knew she will not the woman in gold sounded altogether sure eyvind torfinn sighed and bowed again taking his courage in both hands hamnet thyssen said may i ask you something priestess not about that woman i know you were also connected to her once the judgment is made and will only grow harsher if you push me i was wed to her once yes but i will not say anything about that hamnet replied i want to know what to tell emperor sigvat about the golden shrineand everything else thats happened slightly but unmistakably the priestess lip curled oh him tell him this she spoke four words in another language hamnet didnt know he repeated them after her till she nodded satisfied they are truly ancient from the time before the time before the glacier last advanced she said hamnet repeated them once more but what do they mean he asked when this emperor sigvat hears them he will know the priestess promised and so will you with that count hamnet had to be content xxi not everyone whod gone into the golden shrine wanted to leave so soon liv and audun gilli seemed to be learning things so did marcovefa trasamund and runolf skallagrim looked as if they were enjoying a safety they hadnt known for too long ulric skakki might have been a sponge he was soaking up as much as he could he might not be able to take away more than hed brought but he seemed ready to try eyvind torfinn though kept twisting like a man in pain and hamnet noted that the priests and priestesses seemed steadily less welcoming the men and women in gold steered the strangers toward the doorway by which theyd come in gudrid came along with everyone else she could walk but not much more her eyes stayed blank a thin shiny line of spittle ran from the corner of her mouth down to her chin may god keep you safe said the priestess whod ensorcelled her what is god yes ulric was still doing his best to come away with something the priestess smiled at him as she opened the door why exactly what you think he is that might have been true but it wasnt helpful thank you so much ulric said with a bow his grin was wry happy to help the priestess answered sweetly the adventurer laughed and spread his hands owning himself beaten as soon as gudrid walked outside her face cleared she looked around behind her oh the golden shrine she said then she went on toward her horse her interest in the place seemed to end right there hamnet thyssen decided that the priestess had been merciful after all where do we go now trasamund asked wherever we please the rulers are beaten marcovefa said that was true now would it stay true how many more invaders would come through the gap what would happen when they did hamnet decided to worry about that when it happened if it did for now he had other things to worry about the priestess gave me a message to take to sigvat i dont understand it but she said he would and so i need to go south anyone who wants to come with me is welcomeid be glad of the company but ill go alone if i have to ill come ulric said i want to see him get this message from the golden shrine i dont know how these people can be so sure hell understand it he doesnt understand much i will come with you too marcovefa said i have my reasons she didnt explain what they were hamnet didnt press her about them instead he asked did you understand what the priestess told me no she shook her head from not just before the last time the glaciers moved but from the time before that her eyes went wide with awe i had never dreamt of so deep a time who would have who could have hamnet said only the folk here i wonder if these are the same ones who saw that distant day nothing about this place would surprise me any more nothing marcovefa said count hamnet nodded he felt the same way his horse seemed happy enough to ride away from the golden shrine it had no trouble staying on the narrow road that led from the shrine to the former shore the mud to either side of the road seemed as thick and wet and uninviting as it had when hamnet rode out onto the lakebed toward the building from days gone by trasamund looked over his shoulder hamnet understood the gesturehe not only understood it in fact but imitated it in a low voice trasamund asked do you think well ever come back here come back hamnet started to laugh i never thoughti never dreamtwed come here once ill worry about doing it again some other time well when you put it that way trasamund also chuckled sheepishly i was looking at that wall of war mammoths i was looking at the rulers shamans out ahead of them meaning no disrespect to marcovefa but i thought i was a dead man i thought we were all dead i was angry because i hadnt got as much of my revenge as i wanted how far has that wall of water gone now hamnet murmured how much has it carved up probably just kept going till it smashed up against the mountains trasamund pointed far off to the west maybe theres a new lake over there now the clans that roam that part of the plain must be mighty surprised whered all this water come from he mimed a surprised bizogot very well are you riding south with me or will you head back up toward the gap hamnet asked him im with you for now trasamund answered unhappily my clan is broken one of these days i may go back with luck we can keep more rulers from coming down into our land but thats for another day not this one the bizogots arent ready to try anything so grand he sighed my folks not really ready for anything and the empire is count hamnet suspected there would be endless uprisings and revolts and attempted breakaways all he wanted to do was stay clear of them whether hed get what he wanted he would just have to see a few of the bizogots whod stuck with the band rode off across the steppe on their own with the rulers crushed theyd try to find a clan to which they could adhere or they might try to live on their own hamnet wouldnt have wanted to try that but the bizogots knew this country more intimately than he ever could off in the distance a man on a riding deer saw strangers on horse back approaching and rode away from them as fast as his mount would take him not all the rulers were dead then well that would have been too much to hope for most if not all of their wizards were that mattered more than anything the surviving warriors might make brigands but brigands were a nuisance they wouldnt overrun the bizogot steppe or overthrow raumsdalia i do wonder what those words mean marcovefa said hamnet wasnt sorry to think about something besides the fall of empires so do i he answered had hamnet been coming north the scraggly fields of oats and rye ahead wouldnt have been worth noticing much less talking about since he was riding south out of the great dark forests that marked the raumsdalian empires northern border those sad little fields took on more meaning were back in the country where crops can grow he said pointing toward the weedy green ulric skakki nodded so did runolf skallagrim and eyvind torfinn and audun gilli raumsdalians themselves they understood what that meant north of these fields people either brought grain up from where it would grow or did without living by hunting and gathering like bizogots back in civilization earl eyvind said perhaps incautiously huh trasamund said a scornful sniff i didnt see the golden shrine showing up in raumsdalia eyvind torfinn opened his mouth then closed it again that might have been the wisest thing he could have done if it was civilization it was no more than the ragged edge the local farmers didnt want to hang around and talk things over with men on horse back who carried weapons they ran their livestock off into the woods pines and firs and spruces didnt stop growing south of the forest line it was only that other plants could claw out a foothold there along with them they ought to know we arent rulers we dont ride deeror war mammoths either runolf said even if they know its not obvious theyd care ulric pointed out whats that supposed to mean baron runolf had served the empire his whole life and took its inherent goodness for granted ulric skakki had also served it for many years as far as hamnet could see ulric took nothing for granted ill tell you what he said now it means they think raumsdalians would be just as happy to plunder them as the rulers would and you know what else your excellency id bet theyre right runolf skallagrim spluttered we are his majestys soldiers by god all the more reason to run wouldnt you say ulric replied runolf spluttered some more he looked to hamnet for support hamnet had none to give him he sided with ulric here seeing as much baron runolf eyed him as if he were in the habit of accosting young girls hamnet sighed runolf was a decent sort men like him had been raumsdalias backbone for generations they had their limits but within them were solid as iron hed been a man like that himself till too much to do with sigvat turned him into another kind of man altogether well that was nobodys fault but the emperors if sigvat didnt care for the kind of man hamnet was now he had only himself to blame riding up alongside him ulric spoke in a low voice what do you suppose dear sigvat will do after you give him the message from the golden shrine depends on what it means hamnet answered i feel like a seed that hasnt sprouted but i dont know if im a lily or a stinkweed well your grace ive got news for you ulric said if those folks in the fancy gold robes have anything good to say about sigvator to himtheyre dumber than i think they are or maybe were dumber than they think we are because we cant see how wonderful sigvat really is hamnet thyssen considered that then he shook his head no im sorry but no ive been stupid all kinds of ways but if i were that stupid i wouldve died a long time ago i feel the same way ulric said of course we could be wrong yes we could i used to think the glacier stretched north forever so the gap couldnt melt all the way through count hamnet sighed shows what i knew didnt it but if sigvats a good emperor if hes done even a lead slugs worth of good against the rulers i think ill go ride off and find a land somewhere that isnt so wonderfully ruled come up to the plains trasamund boomed even if youre dark youd make a pretty fair bizogot im not trying to butter you up eitherive said the same thing before so you have hamnet agreed and maybe i will or maybe ill go way down into the south so i dont have to think about the glacier at all any more ulric here has seen more of that part of the world than i have too hots as bad as too cold ulric said worse maybe when its too cold you can put on more clothes or make a fire when its too hot what can you do sweatthats about it and too hot will kill you just as easy as the breath of god will not too hot right now not too cold either hamnet said lets ride down toward nidaros while the weather stays good on their way to the capital they skirted the badlands hevring lake had gouged out after its earthen dam broke they rode across the rich cropland that had been lakebottom when the edge of the glacier lay not far north one of these days eyvind torfinn said wheat and barley may grow on the bed of sudertorp lake around the golden temple thats bizogot country by god trasamund declared it is now yes earl eyvind said when the weather was colder nomads roamed near nidaros too two thousand years ago nidaros was a hunting camp beside a meltwater lake no one can say what the weather will be like two thousand years from now trasamund muttered discontentedly ulric skakki said no one eh what about the folk in the golden temple eyvind inclined his head you have something therethey may be able to do that but even if they can i dont believe they will do you after brief consideration ulric answered well your splendor when youre right youre right gudrid looked from one of them to the other as they talked about the golden shrine hamnet watched her she heard them she understood them she knew there was such a thing as the golden shrine she seemed to have some idea that theyd gone there but she hadnt the faintest notion that shed been inside the shrine herself hamnet didnt think she ever would the priestess there knew what she was doing all right he snorted quietly as if that were in doubt because the land east of what had been hevring lake rose and because nidaros towers rose even higher the capital was visible from a long way off less smoke rose above it than had been true before the rulers sacked it i wonder if any enemy warriors are still skulking in the ruins hamnet said if one of them puts an arrow through dear sigvat what the priestess told me back at the shrine wont matter she said you were to give those words to the emperor marcovefa said i think that means you will give them to him i think it means he will not die before you do it i think it means you will not either in that case i ought to ride away from nidaros not toward it hamnet said if you do chances are you will find that sigvat is not in nidaros marcovefa answered and where he is chances are you will be there too you cannot flee your fate it will find you no matter what you do hamnet sighed she was likely right oh ill go on he said whatever this word im carrying is i do want to let him have it ulric grinned wickedly how dyou mean that just the way i said it hamnet replied ulrics grin got wider raumsdalian guards manned the gates of nidaros once more they started to laugh when hamnet told them sudertorp lake was gone and the golden shrine had reappeared at last you blockheads where the demon do you think all the rulers went runolf skallagrim demanded angrily why we ran em out of course said the sergeant or whatever he was in charge of the gate crew that only got him more abuse from the travelers he might have used his petty authority to try to keep them out of the capital in which case he might also have ended up dead in short order but marcovefa gestured and the gate crew and her companions all saw sudertorp lake flood free and destroy the rulers host and then saw the golden shrine gleaming on the lakebed what do you think now hamnet thyssen asked the underofficer an ominous rumble in his voice pass in folks pass in that worthy replied and added a sweeping arm gesture to the invitation i dont know whether youre lying or not but i dont intend to mess with people who can work wizardry like that congratulations ulric skakki told him maybe youre not as stupid as you look the underofficer scowled but he didnt do anything more than scowl that might have proved ulrics point the raumsdalians and bizogots rode into nidaros count hamnet had traveled through nidaros streets after sigvat fled and the rulers plundered the city nidaros was better off now than it had been then if he hadnt seen it then he would have given up on it in despair now soldiers seemed to stand on every street corner swords and spears shining in the sun nobody did anything much where the armed men could see but too many houses and shops were still obviously empty people could prowl alleyways and break into places like that without much trouble maybe some of them were locals returning after they escaped the sack of the city maybe others were squatters whod make good neighbors once they settled in but hamnet would have bet most were looters and thieves a body hung from a makeshift gibbet a placard around its neck said i stole grain the corpse was fragrant and bloated enough to have hung there for some time it might make other ambitious gentlemen thoughtful or on the other hand it might not i wonder what the palace is like ulric remarked what will you bet it looks better than anything else in the city hamnet said if sigvat has any money left in the vaults hell spend it on himself first and everybody else afterwards i didnt get to be as rich as i am by taking foolish bets ulric told him how rich are you trasamund asked ulric peered inside a belt pouch sighed shrugged and didnt answer even the gesture was enough to make beggars clamor for coins the soldiers on guard duty did nothing to hold them back begging had never been illegal in nidaros if more people were begging now than ever before times were harder than theyd ever been and if the soldiers hadnt served sigvat most of them would have been begging too hamnet remembered that no banners had flown above the imperial palace when he went through nidaros after sigvat fled those banners were back now he nodded to himself when he noticed them sure enough sigvat looked out for sigvat first last and always some of the guards in front of the palace had seen hamnet and ulric before you one of them exclaimed yes us by god hamnet answered so you ran away with the emperor and then came back did you the guardsman turned red you cant talk to me that way i just did hamnet said and ill kill you if you annoy me much more my conscience wont acheive killed plenty of men better than youll ever be in your wildest dreams that he meant itand that he could do itmust have been only too plain to the unhappy guard what are you doing here anyway the man demanded im bringing his majesty a message from the golden shrine hamnet gave back the exact literal truth all the guards laughed now tell me another oneone ill believe the mouthy trooper said he is telling you what you should believe for it is so eyvind torfinn said who are you granddad and what the demon do you know about it the guardsman snarled i am earl eyvind torfinn and i know about this because i was inside the golden shrine with count hamnet here i am baron runolf skallagrim and so was i runolf said the guards put their heads together two authentic noblemen neither one known to be in bad odor with the emperor had vouched for count hamnet ulric skakki and hamnet exchanged small tight smiles which of them sigvat liked less was an interesting question ulric hadnt spoken up for hamnet nor did hamnet blame him his word might have done more harm than good there was a classic solution to this kind of problem and the palace guard whod done the talking found it i cant decide on my own he said ill send one of my men in to see what his majesty wants to see what some fancier flunky wants you mean hamnet thyssen enjoyed saying what was on his mind hed got in trouble for it before he might again he enjoyed it anyhow although the guardsman reddened again he almost shoved one of his troopers toward the doorway they protected go find out his majestys pleasure sigvats pleasure was bound to be something young and pretty and sweetly rounded a sour nobleman like hamnet didnt come close the ironic glint in ulrics eye said he was thinking along those lines too this time neither of them said anything after a few minutes the guard whod been sent in to enquire came back with astonishment all over his face his majesty wants to see him he exclaimed in obvious disbelief he does the talky palace guard seemed even more amazed well fry me in dung and call me a bizogots dinner what was that trasamund rumbled ominously maybe the guard hadnt noticed him or liv till then if he hadnt he wasnt doing his job as well as he might have he offered a rather sickly smile no offense intended im sure im not trasamund said if i thought you were worth killing id argue with count hamnet for the privilege but my guess is youll choke to death on your own foot one day before too long another guardsman snickered at that the mouthy one gave him a look composed of three parts vitriol and one part flaming pitch the unlucky guardsman tried to pull into his mailshirt like a turtle pulling into its shell hamnet interrupted that little drama saying sowe can go in i guess you can the guard replied then we will hamnet said dismounting and he did his companions right behind him the inside of the palace was more like the rest of nidaros than hamnet had expectedwhich only meant the rulers had plundered it more thoroughly than hed thought even carpets and wall hangings had disappeared theyd probably been cut up to help keep the invaders tents warm for all hamnet knew the flood from sudertorp lake had swept some of them away a workman stood on a ladder scrubbing at something on a wall most of the big graffito was gone now but hamnet could still make out one of the striped beasts of prey the rulers called tigers the rulers might no longer be a menace here below the gap like riding deer and bighorned bison tigers seemed likely to stay around runolf skallagrim also eyed the graffito i wonder what that tiger was hunting he remarked probably sigvat hamnet answered the servitor leading him and his comrades to the throne stopped in horror how dare you say such things he squawked how dare you oh its easy hamnet assured him i just open my mouth and out they come yes and look how much fun youve had because of it ulric said eyeing them as if theyd suddenly sprouted fur and stripes and fangs and claws the servitor said his majesty will not be pleased thats all right son hamnet said cheerfullysigvats man was much younger than he was after the rulers after climbing the glacier after the golden shrine im not going to worry about the emperor of raumsdalia after the golden shrine the servitor echoed but thats nothing but talkisnt it surethe same as the gap melting through is nothing but talk count hamnet said its as real as roasted armadillo ulric added not knowing what to make of that the servitor fell silent but his eyes were as nervous as a restive horses just outside the throne room more guards relieved hamnet and his companions of their weaponsof most of them anyhow hamnet still had a holdout knife in his boot top by ulrics quirked eyebrow the guards had also searched him less perfectly than they might have no wizard checked to see if sigvats men had missed anything as one had when hamnet and ulric first met trasamund here not everything around the emperor was back to normal yet walking into the throne room underscored that sigvats throne had been of gold and ivory and glittering jewels now a stout wooden chair probably taken from a palace dining room replaced it all the rest of the rich ornamentation in the throne room was gone too maybe the gold had helped weigh down the rulers as the unleashed waters of sudertorp lake washed over them but hamnet thyssen doubted whether lighter pockets and belt pouches would have made much difference the emperors surviving ministers looked leaner and poorer than they had the last time hamnet saw them so did sigvat ii the robe he wore might have suited a tolerably prosperous trader before the rulers chased him out of nidaros he wouldnt have been caught dead in it hamnet grudged a bow your majesty he said gruffly ulric skakki followed his lead so did trasamund and so did audun gilli the man of least account among those whod begun this adventure sigvat scowled he was still as sensitive to slights as hed always been whats this nonsense about sudertorp lake and the golden shrine he snapped your majesty it isnt nonsense count hamnet said everyone with him nodded except gudrid she would never testify about the golden shrine as quickly as he could hamnet told the emperor what had happened sigvat looked down his nose at him you expect me to believe this nonsense you had better believe itit is true that wasnt hamnet the emperor wouldnt have believed him it was marcovefa she stared straight into sigvats watery brown eyes believe itit is true she repeated sigvat obviously didnt want to just as obviously he found himself compelled to he looked angry and frightened at the same time marcovefa might be sure her sorcery didnt measure up to that of the golden shrine but it outdid anything raumsdalians could match all right then all right sigvat said furiously so you did go inside the golden shrine well what kind of message did those people in there have for me in spite of everything he preened a little it must be importanti must be importantfor them to know about me i must be important yes that usually lay at the heart of sigvats thoughts i carry the message your majesty count hamnet answered they told me it was very ancientnot from before this last time the glacier ground south but from the time before that yes yes the emperor sounded impatient give it to me then whatever kind of seed hamnet was he would sprout now as you say your majesty so shall it be he took a deep breath then spoke the first strange word the goldenrobed priestess had imparted to him mene suddenly he no longer seemed to see sigvat iis throne room but another one one hed never imagined before much less seen and somehow everybody else in this throne room saw that one with him and saw the fierce swarthy curlybearded man plainly not a ruler even if he had something of their aspect in the strange robe staring at the writing on the mudbrick wall to the left of the throne on which he sat hamnet had never seen those characters before either but he knew they said mene as hed been bidden to do he said it again mene in his visionif it was but a vision if he wasnt really therehe saw the glowing word appear once more he saw the curlybearded king or emperor for surely the man could hold no lower rank gasp and turn pale under his dark skin tekel hamnet thyssen said slowly beginning to grasp the words he carried tekel sprang into being on the wall to the swarthy kings left he gasped and clapped a horrified hand to his forehead he was beginning to understand too was sigvat hamnet couldnt tell he dwelt more in that other world that lost and ancient world than this one and he realized whether sigvat followed now hardly mattered the raumsdalian emperor would in a moment count hamnet intoned the priestess last word upharsin what had to be that last word appeared on that wall in fiery letters suddenly hamnet thyssenand he was sure everyone else in the throne roomsaw that wall and that ancient chamber no more an enormous set of scales presented itself in one pan lay a heavy stone weight in the other stood that curlybearded king in his odd royal robes the scales were free to swing the one with the weight sank down the one with the king from those unimaginably distant days rose he could not measure up to that which tested him and then without warning the figure on the scales rising pan changed it was no longer the nameless forgotten king from a bygone age instead it wore sigvat iis face and his robe hamnet didnt doubt what he saw or what it meant no one who saw that could misunderstand it you dont measure up either your majesty he thought no your former majesty as abruptly as it had engulfed him the vision faded he was back inside the raumsdalian emperors throne room with all his senses once more along with everyone else in there he stared at the emperor under that terrible merciless scrutiny sigvat ii went red and then white a ghastly attempt at a smile played across his face it flickered and went out like a guttering flame he opened his mouth to say something but what could a man say after that count hamnet had never imagined a condemnation straight from god but that came closer to describing what hed just witnessed than anything else he could conceive sigvats mouth stayed open likely for no better reason than that hed forgotten to close it without a word one of the imperial ministers turned away and then another and another and another sigvat did make a sound then a small one the sound a wounded man might make when he was trying to hide his pain trasamund walked up to him with rough sympathy the jarl set a hand on sigvats arm youd better go now while you still can he said not unkindly you hang around here somebodys going to stick a knife in you and quick what did i do to deservethat sigvats wave took in everything everyone had just seen maybe he thought nobody would give him an answer but count hamnet did you didnt do anything to stop the rulers but after other people took care of that for you you came back and tried to pick up the reins youd dropped lots of people would have thought you had no right but the folk from the golden shrine did more than think they went and showed you they went and showed everybody else too ulric skakki added did he sound amused hamnet thought so sigvat also must have because he started to reply trasamund forestalled him saying if you hustle youve still got a chance to get out of the palace alive leave your robe for whoever needs it next go somewhere a long way off change your name and try and pretend you never heard of nidaros that struck hamnet thyssen as good advice better than he would have given sigvat it must have struck the suddenly exraumsdalian emperor the same way he slid down off the poor makeshift throne and made his way toward the entrance to the throne room by the time he got there he was trotting eyvind torfinn bowed to hamnet what is your will your majesty he asked no hamnet said sharply no by god you cant make me wear the crown and neither can anybody else if you try ill go up to the tallest tower and throw myself out on my heador else ill just fall on my sword hed tried that before and failed he didnt think he would if he tried again id rather die than be emperor of raumsdalia and i mean it if you want the job your splendor you can have it hamnet remembered that would make gudrid raumsdalian empress he couldnt think of a better reason to go see what the hot countries in the distant south were like but earl eyvind shook his head even if gudrid looked furious when he did thank you but no the scholarly noble replied the emperor should bein times like these had better bea stronger man than i maybe we can dice for the crown ulric suggested loser gets it we should care more about the empire than that earl eyvinds voice was starchy with disapproval but he said no more how could he when hed just turned it down himself somebodyll grab it before too long ulric said hamnet nodded but he was thinking as long as it isnt me xxii hamnet thyssen didnt linger long in the imperial palace true hed brought bad news for sigvat ii straight from the golden shrine but he had brought bad news for the raumsdalian emperor the aura of glamour surrounding the first was enough to let him get out of the palace unscathed he didnt think he would have lasted more than a few hours at the outside had he tried to hang around he didnt see sigvat alive or dead maybe the emperor really had got away and was busy memorizing his new name stranger things had happened before hamnet first met trasamund he would have irately denied the possibility since then hed gone beyond the gap hed climbed to the top of the glacier and met the folk who lived up there hed gone inside the golden shrine all of those were at least a little stranger than the chance that sigvat might act like a sensible human being ulric skakki didnt overstay his welcome either he waited impatiently with hamnet for grooms to lead their horses out of the stables well your grace what now he asked im going home hamnet said simply anybody who tries to drag me out again will have to lay siege to the place if its still standing anyhow what if its not the adventurer was as full of annoying questions as ever his twisted grin said he knew as much god knows in that case hamnet shrugged maybe ill keep on going south the way ive talked about or maybe ill turn around and go up onto the steppe and see what kind of bizogot i make he was about to ask what ulric intended to do but ulric beat him to the punch again and what about marcovefa what about me marcovefa asked from behind them they both jumped she went on why do you ask somebody else do you think i cannot take care of myself are you so foolish mmi hope not for once in his life ulric sounded faintly embarrassed he asked me what i wanted to do and i told him i was going home count hamnet said then he asked about you and you answered before i could i didnt know what you were going to say anyhow i will come with you i will see your home after all you have seen mine marcovefa said whether i will stay after thatshe smiledwe can both find out ulric nudged hamnet take her up on it he stagewhispered you wont get a better bargain do you think im too stupid to figure that out for myself hamnet said by your track record yes ulric answered the worst of it was hamnet could hardly tell him he was wrong marcovefa glared at the palace guards and grooms where is my horse she demanded do i have to start turning people into voles to get the rest of you to do what you should be doing anyhow the servitors all but stumbled over one another in their haste to do what she wanted this is how it ends ulric said not sadly but in a matteroffact way we did what we set out to doenough of it anywayand now we go back to taking care of things for ourselves he sketched a salute luck thyssen maybe well run into each other again one of these years maybe we will nothing would surprise me any more hamnet clasped the adventurers hand while grooms led out their horsesand marcovefas me im heading south myself ive had enough of ice to last me a long time ulric said hed made noises like that before maybe he meant them or maybe he aimed to throw any possible pursuers off his trail he did ride south which soon separated him from hamnet and marcovefa who made for the east gate hamnet could have gone out the south gate just as well his keep and the lands surrounding it lay far to the southeast but ulric skakki had it right breaking apart was how things ended or so hamnet thought till somebody let out a deep bass yell behind him he looked back over his shoulder here came trasamund bulling his horse through traffic so the locals glared at him you wont get away from me like that the jarl boomed i guested you as long as i could up on the plains about time you pay me back the way a guestfriend should by rights hamnet laughed and sketched a salute at your service your ferocity trasamund bowed in the saddle and started to laugh himself but abruptly choked it off you may as well forget the title without a clan to rule i dont deserve it any more the worlds a miserable place youve seen the golden shrineyouve gone into itand you say that shame on you marcovefa told him it is trasamund insisted we never would have seen the golden shrine if the rulers hadnt wrecked the bizogots and they started with my clan more to the world than your clan hamnet said more to the world than raumsdalia too oh then why arent you riding off to god knows where with ulric skakki trasamund said youre going back to the one little piece of ground that belongs to you id go back to the tents of the three tusk clan except they arent there any more he wiped away a tear whether real or rhetorical count hamnet wasnt sure youre welcome to come along with us if you care to hamnet said as a guestfriend should my home is yours for as long as you care to stay there the jarl bowed in the saddle again well i do thank you for that and like i said ill take you up on itfor now anyway if i wander off one of these days it wont be on account of anything youve done i dont expect it will i mean but i dont know if i can stay in one place the rest of my days neither do i marcovefa said well neither do i hamnet thyssen said well all find out as long as i stay away from nidarosand as long as nidaros troubles stay away from mei suppose ill get along wherever i am he reached out and set a hand on marcovefas arm the company is pretty good are you trying to sweettalk me she asked not right this moment hamnet said when we stop to rest tonight well see how i do then by the way she laughed he had a good chance of doing well but her laugh cut off as shouts and screams and the clash of blade against blade rang out behind them from the direction of the palace oh god trasamund said its starting already isnt it cursed fools didnt waste any time what happens in a bizogot clan when the jarl dies and nobodys set to succeed him hamnet asked trasamund grunted as much of a concession as hamnet was likely to get what do we do now marcovefa asked the martial racket was getting louder and coming closer we get out of here quick as we can hamnet urged his horse up into a trot the only thing worse than getting stuck in the middle of a war is getting stuck in the middle of a civil war that makes more sense than i wish it did trasamund said he and marcovefa booted their horses forward too to hamnets relief nobody at the eastern gate recognized him whats going on back there a guard asked pointing in the direction from which he and his companions had come sounds like the whole worlds going crazy it does doesnt it hamnet looked as blank and innocent as he could all we want to do is get on our way before whatever it is catches up with us smart the guard said solemnly one of the other soldiers at the gate said somebody who went through a few minutes ago said the emperor was leaving town again that doesnt seem right does it i mean those stupid rulers or whatever the demon they are havent given us so much trouble lately why would his majesty want to leave now then count hamnet marcovefa and trasamund looked at one another as if animated by the same puppeteer they shrugged at the same time hamnet thyssen lied straightfaced i dont know anything about that either well all find out i guess the guard eyed his colleagues who nodded he waved to hamnet pass on through thanks this time hamnet was altogether sincere probably no one since the golden shrine had done him a bigger favor than this gate guard who waved him out of nidaros what was liable to happen in the capital over the next few days wouldnt be pretty he and marcovefa and trasamund hadnt got more than eight or ten yards out of the gate before one of the guards howled in dismay looking back over his shoulder hamnet saw the man had clapped a hand to his forehead a theatrical gesture but plainly heartfelt those idiots those godcursed idiots the guard cried theyve started a fire that only made hamnet ride harder he neither knew who they were nor wanted to find out whoever they were he agreed with the guard anybody who started a fire inside a city was an idiot at least the breath of god isnt blowing trasamund said if it were whatever the rulers hadnt ruined in nidaros might go up in flames and i dont think the maniac with a torch cared hamnet said somebody ought to cut him in half and leave the pieces where people can see them trasamund said thats what wed do up on the steppe anybody else who gets ideas can see what theyd cost him i hope somebody does count hamnet said but it isnt my worry thank god raumsdalia can sort it out without me he sat straighter on his horse as if a heavy weight had lifted from his shoulders have you got any idea how good it feels to be able to say that you can stay in your castle place for a while marcovefa said shrewdly sooner or later though the world will come looking for you again hamnet thyssen didnt argue with her she was much too likely to be right he just said later i hope he and marcovefa and trasamund rode away from nidaros and from the new plume of black smoke climbing above it sweat ran down marcovefas face does it get this hot every summer down here she asked most summers anyhow hamnet said he didnt find the weather especially hot but then he hadnt spent most of his life atop the glacier how do you stand it marcovefa asked its pretty warm all right trasamund added all what youre used to hamnet left it there people who grow up south of here wouldnt be able to stand the winters in the bizogot country he didnt say anything about the winters in marcovefas homeland he wasnt sure hed be able to stand those himself more and more of these broadleaved trees i think they look funny suddenly marcovefa turned into a connoisseur of forests although shed never so much as imagined a tree broadleaved or otherwise till she descended from the glacier what good are they theres always the wood hamnet said he took that for granted but marcovefa wouldnt even trasamund might not and some of them have nuts that are good to eat and in the autumn before the leaves fall off they turn red and orange and gold for a little while the forest looks as if its on firenot in a bad way you understand its beautiful but it never lasts ive seen a little of that trasamund said and marcovefa nodded the jarl went on ive never understood why the leaves change colors before they die i cant tell you i dont think anyone else can either hamnet said my best guess is it just happens the way a mans hair goes gray when he gets older maybe trasamund lost interest in the question he pointed toward something at the edge of the woods good god whats that a mastodon hamnet answered havent you seen them before coming down into raumsdalia ive had glimpses but thats all the bizogot stared and stared it looks like a woolly mammoth if you can imagine a woolly mammoth made by somebody whos heard about them but never seen one its back is too flatit ought to slope down like this he gestured ive seen woolly mammoths hamnet pointed out he might as well have saved his breath trasamund went on as if he hadnt spoken its ears are the wrong shape theyre too big too and look at the funny way its tusks curl and mammoths are supposed to be almost black not that that treebark brown i guess youd call it they can be pests hamnet said they raid orchards and they trample down grain fields you dont bother to tame them do you trasamund asked ive heard that lumbermen sometimes do mastodons are big enough and strong enough to shove tree trunks around better than just about any other beasts but apart from that no hamnet replied we hunt them though we use the meat and the hides and the ivory and the hair woolly mammoth hair is better trasamund said its longer and thicker i like the color better too which is all very well im sure only we havent got any woolly mammoths in raumsdalia plenty of mastodons in the forests near my castle theyre nuisances there thats the other reason we hunt them to keep them from tearing up the crops how much farther to your castle marcovefa asked to her mastodons were only a little stranger than mammoths shed come to know both beasts since descending from the glacier maybe a weeks travel a little less if we were in a tearing hurry hamnet answered how long do you aim to stay marcovefa asked and then how long will we stay i dont know how long ill stay a while anyhow till things settle down a bitif they ever do hamnet said and i cant really say how long youll stay can i you have something to do with it if i decide you make me angry and dont make me happy i go marcovefa said but she added so far you haventquite trasamund guffawed high praise thyssen better than ive done with women up till now hamnet said as calmly as he could maybe ive learned something maybe marcovefa just puts up with more than gudrid or liv did he glanced over at her what do you think me i think you know me better than to think i put up with much marcovefa replied so far you are not too bad in bed or out trasamund started laughing again hamnets ears felt as if theyd caught fire he made the most of it he could saying thank youi think youre welcomei suppose marcovefa told him but she was smiling when she said it now trasamund laughed at both of them they took no notice of him lacking encouragement he eventually ran down they all rode on in what washamnet hopeda companionable silence somehow news of sigvats fall spread faster than hamnet had imagined it could he thought he and marcovefa and trasamund would be the outermost ripple of news from the pebble that had dropped in the palace at nidaros but they werent whenever they stopped in a village or a town people had heard that the emperor was emperor no more some of them had even heard that hed fled because the golden shrine judged him unworthy to rule i heard that all right said the tapman at a serai about halfway to hamnets keep dont know that i believe it but i heard it till all this talk started i dont know that i believed there was any such thing as the golden shrine people talk about it sure but people talk about all kinds of things that arent real but ive never heard em talk about it the way they do nowadays so maybe theres something to it after all its true hamnet said solemnly marcovefa and trasamund nodded hamnet went on i wouldnt mind another mug of ale its tasty i thank you for thati brew it myself the tapman said not without pride as he dipped up another mug for hamnet he continued you folks sound like you know what youre talking about hamnet had listened to a lot of tapmen in his time he knew this fellow wasnt necessarily saying he believed them we do trasamund said we were there where at the golden shrine or in the palace no the tapman didnt believe theyd set eyes on either place both marcovefa told him he didnt call her a liaryou had to be very bold or very stupid to do thatbut disbelief still stuck out all over him she nudged hamnet say the words againthe words you got from the golden shrine mene mene tekel upharsin he felt sure he was pronouncing them badly but chances were no one else born into this age of the world could have done any better these words were extinctexcept thanks to the priests and priestesses of the golden shrine they werent marcovefa murmured a spell suddenly hamnet saw himself saying those unimaginably ancient words to sigvat ii by the way the tapmans jaw dropped so did he hamnet also saw those words on the wall saw the longforgotten kings awe and fear and sigvats as well and saw the balance in which they were both weighed and found wanting the vision faded fast which was nothing but a relief well trasamund asked the tapman were we there or not you were the man whispered i dont know how but you were how did you come to be at the heart ofwell everything maybe it just worked out that way hamnet said maybe the golden shrine or godif theres a differencemeant it all along i dont know i dont expect i ever will im beginning to think the how doesnt even matter however it happened we were there thats all you didnt even say anything yet about sudertorp lake breaking free and drowning all the rulers and their shamans trasamund observed if the tapmans ears could have pricked erect like a dire wolfs they would have i didnt think i should hamnet said marcovefa worked the magic i only watched it and keep me alive and bring me back to myself marcovefa said the tapmans eyes got bigger and bigger anyhow not quite all of them drowned hamnet said but i dont think theyll kick up much trouble for a while by god youre not making any of this up are you the tapman said hoarsely you really saw those things you really did those things too we saw them hamnet agreed we did them then what are you doing here the tapman said nothing ever happens here no one who doesnt live in gufua knows its here or knows its name nobody cares to either that sounds plenty good to me at least in a place where well stop for the night count hamnet said marcovefa and trasamund both nodded hamnet went on sometimes what you want most is not to need to worry if uh gufua can give us that were glad to take it till the tapman named the hamlet he hadnt known what to call it his companions nodded again if youll tell your stories and work your spells for the folk here you neednt pay for food and lodging the tapman said hamnet looked at marcovefa and trasamund then he set silver on the bar i mean no disrespect but payings the better bargain he got more nods from them have it as you please the tapman didnt seem sorry to scoop up the coins it was only a thought the bedchambers are upstairs after filling his belly with roast pork and barley bread hamnet went up to one of those bedchambers he made sleepy lazy love with marcovefa then he slept nothing bothered him till morning if he hadnt had somewhere else to go he might have been tempted to stay in quiet forgotten gufua as the road came out from behind a stand of trees trasamund pointed somebody up ahead of us well so there is hamnet said what about it are you worried about one man let him worry about us im not worried about him the jarl replied with dignity a bit surprised to see him is all not many people on the road these days or so it seems would you go traveling if you thought the rulers would kill you or ordinary bandits would knock you over the head hamnet said if i had to trasamund said stubbornly this fellow has to marcovefa sounded as certain as only she could who is he you sound as though you know hamnet said a traveler maybe marcovefa was being annoying on purpose or maybe whatever told her what she knew about that man also told her to keep it to herself hamnet shrugged if they caught up with the stranger hed find out then and if they didnt the fellow didnt matter they were gaining hamnet needed a bit to be sure but eventually had no doubt neither did the lone man he tried to get more out of his horse but it seemed to have nothing left to give either it was a horrible screw to begin with or hed already ridden it into the ground by the way it carried itself hamnet guessed the latter bugger me with a thornbush trasamund said after a little while i know who that is so do i hamnet thyssen clicked his tongue between his teeth i didnt want to say anything i kept hoping i was wrong well no such luck marcovefa raised an eyebrow after everything that happened you still believe in luck hamnet had no answer for her we ought to but trasamund broke off shaking his big fair head who the demon knows what we ought to do a little more time went by the man in front of them turned in the saddle and shook his fist werent you satisfied in nidaros he shouted furiously do you have to follow me and gloat too we didnt hamnet said only a chance meeting sigvat he wouldnt look at marcovefa hed talked about chance to the tapman in gufua too but it was as dead a word as luck and hed never imagined calling the emperorthe former emperor nowby his bare unadorned name likely tell sigvat jeered well if you want to kill me i suppose you can but ill make the best fight im able to he started to draw his sword how many times had hamnet wanted to kill him hed thought he had plenty of reason to do it too sigvat was rightit wouldnt be hard but what was the point now go your way hamnet said if i never see you again that will suit me well enough you might want to take the south fork not the one that runs southeast im bound for my castle and i dont promise you a warm welcome if you turn up there in a low voice sigvat said i heard skakki was heading straight south too bad trasamund said and you made more enemies than just our lot you know sigvats mouth twisted i did what i could to make more enemies i believe that hamnet thyssen said you wouldnt have dared talk to me that way when i was on the throne sigvat said flushing angrily the demon i wouldnt hamnet retorted i tried to tell you the rulers were more trouble than you thought and i was cursed well right but you didnt want to listen and finally you flung me in your dungeon so you wouldnt have to that didnt make me wrong though you found out too bad you managed to run from nidaros after the rulers beat your armies i was hoping theyd pitch you in there so you could see what it was like wed never had an invasion like that i thought you were exaggerating things to make yourself seem more important sigvat said you would have done that marcovefa said so you judged hamnet from yourself by the way sigvat scowled at her that shot struck too close to the center of the target i turned out to be wrong he said but i thought the chances were good that i was right and so you almost pissed the empire straight into the chamber pot hamnet said if not for marcovefa you would have no wonder the golden shrine didnt think you measured up i wouldnt have believed that either if i had any choice sigvat said you have none none at all trasamund said that is not a judgment from man it is a judgment from god everyone who was in your throne room knows it sigvat wanted to call the jarl a liar the urge was written all over his face only one thing stopped him hamnet judged trasamund was obviously telling the truth instead sigvat said go ahead and mock i hope it makes you happy as obviously he hoped anything but to hamnet trasamund said we ought to knock him over the head hes too stupid to learn anything from all the mistakes he made if the golden shrine had wanted him dead soon it would have taken care of things hamnet said this is worse he was the emperor of raumsdalia now no one will hearken to him for the rest of his life however long he lasts if he doesnt learn that much he wont live long but i wont stain my hands with his blood as far as im concerned hes not worth killing sigvat went from red to white curse you thyssen he whispered you cant hamnet said matteroffactly youve already cursed yourself nothing you throw at me will bite he gestured to his companions we may as well ride on what if thisthingtries to shoot us in the back trasamund said hes got a bow he wont he cant marcovefa sounded sure as only she could hamnet believed her sigvats grimace of impotent fury said he did too they rode past sigvat hamnet didnt look back no arrows came hissing after him he never saw sigvat once the second emperor of raumsdalia of that name again he never heard that anyone else did either a stone keep warded by a wooden palisade fields and orchards around it woods of oak and elm and ash and hickory and chestnut off to the east where raumsdalias border petered out hamnet pointed toward the keep hasnt changed much since i went away he said did you expect it to trasamund asked you never can tell hamnet answered if weve seen anything the past few years weve seen that farmers weeding in the fields looked up as the travelers rode by not many folk came this way as hamnet had reason to know one of the peasants called that you count i think so hamnet said which made the fellow grin you take care of whatever you needed to do out in the world another farmer asked most of it for a while hamnet replied the man nodded about what you can hope for he went back to weeding marcovefa eyed hamnet yes this is your country these are your people i never tried to tell you anything different he said a shout rolled out from the palisade who comes hamnet thyssen with friends hamnet answered is everything well gris youll see for yourself soon enough his seneschal said and then not to hamnet open the gates by god they creaked open theyd creaked before hamnet rode away too his retainers stared at his companions are those what they call bizogots a man asked doubtfully he might have been talking about glyptodonts or other beasts he didnt look to see in this part of the world were bizogots sure enough trasamund rumbled marcovefa stirred but she didnt argue her folk sprang from the bizogots even if they didnt think of themselves as belonging to them any more mischief in his pale eyes trasamund went on i wouldnt be surprised if you were a raumsdalian thats right the man said automatically his friends realized trasamund was joking half a heartbeat before he did they laughed at him he went red hamnet looked around everything looked pretty much the way it had before he rode off to answer sigvats summons he hadnt thought hed stay away so long or do so much while he was gone as he dismounted all the time between then and now might have fallen away or it might not have how much trouble did you have this past year he asked well there was some gris admitted we heard some new barbarians got loose up in the north dont think we saw any ourselves but plenty of people running from them came by they going to cause more trouble no i dont think so hamnet answered thanks to you marcovefa said and slipped an arm around his waist the men and women in the courtyard murmuredmore at the gesture hamnet judged than at the news they wanted him wed or at least attached they wanted an heir so things would stay smooth after he was gone he put his arm around marcovefas shoulder thanks more to you he said she nodded she wasnt shy about taking praise the locals murmured on a different note hamnet went on sigvats off the throne that brought surprised exclamationsthe news hadnt got here anyhow did you cast him off it gris asked no not really hamnet replied and the last couple of words brought fresh muttering ignoring it he continued the golden shrine had more to do with it outcry this time hed known there would be he told the story and spoke the words in the forgotten language hed delivered to sigvat ii marcovefa worked her magic again so his retainers could get some sense of the power those words had gris said whos emperor then if sigvat isnt how come youre not another man asked hamnet before he could say anything because i dont want the throne because id rather come home he answered several of the locals nodded they understood that urge to return to the familiar it wasnt always a good urgehamnet thought of the trouble he could have missed if gudrid hadnt drawn him like a lodestone for so longbut it was strong he turned back to gris when we left nidaros nobody was on the throne theyll likely fight it out to see which greedy fool gets to set his fundament there but were so far from the center of things i dont think any civil war will touch us here hope not anyhow the seneschal considered odds are decent he said at last so what will you do now that youre back about what i was doing before hamnet replied i liked it well enough except when things got in the way things gudrid sigvats summons the gap melted through the rulers the invasion the war the dungeon sudertorp lake pouring out as if god were pushing itand maybe god was the golden shrine mene mene tekel upharsin things what about you people gris asked trasamund and marcovefa by the way he used the last word he was giving them the benefit of the doubt trasamund spoke first ill stay here a while anyway ive got nothing to go back to up on the plainsthe rulers made sure of that marcovefa eyed hamnet as she answered i will stay as long as i am happy if i am not it will be time to go he nodded thatll do i hope you stay a long time ill try not to make you unhappybut you never can tell if ive learned anything since i went away thats it you never can tell and i will try not to make you too unhappy with me marcovefa said hamnet nodded again that was as close to a promise as hed ever got from her and more than hed come to expect she looked around this is not much like the top of the glacier but it is not a bad place most of the time it isnt hamnet agreed what more could you say of any place not much not as far as he could see good to have you back lord gris said heads bobbed up and down in the courtyard as long as people thought it was good they would help make it so hamnet didnt know how long he could stay here peacefullyno you never could tellbut he aimed to make the most of it however long it turned out to be
