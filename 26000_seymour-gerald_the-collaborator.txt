gerald seymour the collaborator prologue it was a hot afternoon stinking hot and the sun beat up from the concrete path dazzling him a ridiculous afternoon to be out in a london park hed met friends for lunch arranged long back on the south side of the park two guys from college days but theyd had their girlfriends in tow like trophies which had made him feel awkward as if he not they were the intruders and truth was hed been bored because the togetherness of the couples seemed to shred the spirit of mischief that ran in him some called it happy go lucky and his dad jack the lad and hed wanted to be gone before the loss was terminal it had all been too damn serious which seldom fitted well with him hed eaten the meal coughed up his share of the bill and walked away from the underground station had crossed kensington road and gone into the park over rotten row and been within a few yards of the dogleg lake before his mind had kicked back into gear by now the couples would be talking mortgages and future prospects he was in the park where heat reverberated off the scorched grass and concrete there wasnt half a square centimetre of shade close to him and it was a pretty silly place to be no skateboarders or football to watch no promenade of strippeddown girls he looked for a bench to flop down on he wasnt stressed by the heat or the lack of entertainment his own little world gave him no grief but it was damn hot the bench he saw was blurred but a haven he heard far away the shouts of children playing at the waters edge but round the bench there was quiet his eyes were nearly closed as he sank on to the wooden slats which grilled his backside and lower spine jumbled thoughts loitered in his mind home parents work food getting back to the northeast of the city money all easily discarded with his eyes sealed against the light maybe he dreamed maybe he dozed time slipped on a july afternoon on the last day of the first week in the month the idyll was broken excuse please a clear uncluttered voice an accent he jolted upright im sorry i eddie deacon never considered that responding might change his life push it on to a road unrecognised and unexplored his eyes snapped open he saw the girl dark hair light skin dark eyes hadnt been aware of her coming to the bench might even have been there when hed taken his seat mutual apologies sorry that he had been asleep sorry that she had woken him she wore a cotton skirt short not much of it a white blouse brief sleeves and a textbook lay open on her lap with an italianenglish pocket dictionary strangers pausing wondering whether to go forward and blurting together what can i do please i am confused how can i help i do not understand they both laughed chimed with each other eddie deacon pushed hair off his forehead he saw that when she laughed the gold crucifix dangling from a chain bounced on her cleavage that was what he saw and she would have seen him writing the script not a badlooking guy pretty well turnedout good head of hair a decent complexion and a smile to die for and she would have heard a laugh that was infectious not forced and a voice with a tone of interest that was honest and not patronising well he was hardly going to shortchange himself whats the problem i dont understand this turn over what is turn over eddie deacon grinned is this turn over in bed or turnover in business business it is a book on auditing accounts in english and it says turn over he asked youre italian yes he said in italian turnover is fatturato you understand of course yes i do and you speak italian he shrugged a little ok ok she smiled her teeth glowed her eyes were alight she riffled again through the pages of her book her finger darted down and stabbed at a line here for balance we have soppesare in my dictionary but that is not the italian word for the commercial balance of an account what should it be to balance an account is bilanciare and a balance sheet is bilancio di esercizio does that help she touched his hand fleeting a natural spontaneous gesture of gratitude he felt the tips of her fingers on his skin he liked girls liked their touch but would have admitted if quizzed that he was currently between relationships god who needed commitments hed nearly been engaged to a localgovernment kitchenhygiene inspector two years back but his mother had become too fond of her too quickly he hadnt found a soulmate i have a very good helper eddie deacon said he should be good he was a language teacher he didnt add that if hed put his back into it he might have made interpreter level and gone to brussels or even the united nations but it would have been a hassle he taught english to overseas students his core tongues were german french and spanish but he also had useful italian she told him she was on two courses in london in the morning she studied english language and in the afternoons she did accounting and bookkeeping eddie deacon wondered why a pretty girl in a tight skirt and a tight blouse from italy bothered with any of that but didnt take it further the sun seemed in midafternoon to spear his forehead and shoulders the men and women who walked past the bench wore floppy hats or had white warpaint daubed on exposed skin while little parasols shaded tots in pushchairs there were squeals and shrieks from the lake and splashing he assumed that swimming in the serpentine was forbidden and that the gauleiter men would be there soon yelling that it was verboten he stood up its a bit warm for me i prefer to be out of the sun she said where is to be the new classroom i need all opportunities to speak english i have a teacher i do not wish to lose him it was he thought a challenge she must have realised he intended to walk away but her chin had jutted her shoulders were back and now she was almost blocking his path he reckoned that she was used to getting what she wanted he didnt push past her now for the first time since he had woken up he looked at his selfenrolled pupil she was lightly built had narrow hips a squashedin waist and a goodsized but not gross bosom her face fascinated him a fine jaw a delicate nose and a high forehead the hair pushed back but it was her eyes that caught him they had authority did not brook denial as a general rule eddie deacon did not fight authority he was one to go with the flow he didnt look at the hips waist or breasts of the girl before him but was carried deep into her eyes he asked where she was heading and she told him he told her he lived nearby a small untruth it would probably have taken him almost an hour to walk from hackney to where he lived on the west side of the balls pond road he suggested they find a pub with open doors big fans and a cool interior there he said they could have a hack at any accounting or bookkeeping language that was giving her grief her books were in a bag now and he took it slung the strap across his shoulder she hooked her hand into the crook of his arm her hips swung as she walked and she threw back her head letting her hair fall between her shoulderblades where the blouse collar had slipped by the way im eddie deacon her name was immacolata on the north side of the park they took a bus and sat on the top deck with the window open beside them so that a zephyr of cooler air reached them she leafed through the textbook found english commercial expressions and quizzed him for the exact meaning in her mother tongue they walked a bit on his territory balls pond kingsland dalston reached a pub and sat in a corner of the saloon eddie deacon sensed that she was the most special girl he had ever spent an afternoon and early evening with he was captivated couldnt think what he offered her beyond a few words in italian and explanations of a few phrases of more colloquial english but she seemed to hang on what he told her precious few stayed around to listen to him on where he lived or where the language school was his anecdotes about the daftest lithuanian students where his parents lived what excited or what bored him to death and when he made jokes she laughed it was a good rich laugh and he thought it was genuine not produced to humour him he decided in the pub that she didnt laugh often the way her life was as dusk fell they left the pub her hand again at the bend of his elbow now he called her mac had drifted into it without a prompt from her and she seemed amused by it he walked her almost home but at the end of a street off hackney road she stopped and indicated they would part here now a streetlight beamed on to her face he had been with her a few minutes short of seven hours he wouldnt have known what to do but she led she offered her right cheek and he kissed it then the left she was grinning chuckling as she kissed his lips and her smile was radiant he asked if they could meet again she told him where and when without asking if it was convenient which didnt matter to him because any time and any place were fine she turned and left him he watched her going away down a street of little terraced homes that the new rich had taken over she passed the lowslung german sports cars and the gardens filled with builders skips she was immacolata she was twentyfive two years younger than himself she was from naples and would meet him again in two days time what did he not know she had not told him her family name or given him her address and phone number she was between two lampposts and the light fell on her hair and on the white blouse she went briskly and did not look back why had she spent seven hours of her day with him laughed and joked with him listened because he was attractive and handsome because he was a success and taught in a language school because of his humour and culture eddie deacon thought the girl mac was lonely sad too he would count the hours till they met again and thought himself blessed she was round the corner gone from his view he would tick off every hour until they met again and hadnt done that for as long as he could remember eddie deacon kicked a can down the pavement then across the width of the street and was euphoric she started to run there was no pavement only a track of dried dust at the side of the road she ran past the stationary cars and vans that had blocked her brothers little fiat faced with an unmoving jam more than three hundred metres long she had had no alternative but to get out of the fiat and head on foot towards the distant gates of the towns cemetery to be late for the burial would have been intolerable to immacolata borelli she had left the car door open behind her she heard it slammed then silvios call his head protruding from the sun hatch perhaps for her to run everything about the day and the schedule had been so far a disaster the call had come to her mobile the evening before from silvio the youngest of her three brothers he had told her of a death notice in that days cronaca di napoli detailing the passing of marianna rossetti from nola the funeral to be held tomorrow at the basilica of ss apostoli followed by the burial immacolata had been in the kitchen of the hackney apartment she shared with her eldest brother vincenzo who had been shouting questions at her who was on the phone because he was paranoid about her using a mobile she had told silvio she would be on the first flight the next day she had told vincenzo that the language school had changed the time of classes and that she was required early she ran past the cigarette smoke puffed from the motionless vehicles and past the cacophony of car horns she had not been on the first flight out of heathrow it had been overbooked her wallet on the checkin counter opened to display a wad of twentypound notes had not made a seat available the second flight had seats but its takeoff time had been put back forty minutes by a leaking toilet had anyone ever heard of aircraft stacking over the golfo di napoli before landing at capodichino there was work in progress on the runway military flights from the nato detachment had priority and she had not been able to find silvio because some arrogant bastardo in uniform had not allowed him to park in front of the terminal and that was more delay normally there would have been a minder to sit in the car and tell the official to go fuck himself but this journey was not normal had been made in secrecy and was far outside the business of her family it was only twentyfive kilometres from the airport to the centre of nola but there were roadworks and the lights controlling the single lane of traffic were broken they had reached the basilica she had grabbed her handbag off the back seat snatched up the little black hat with the attached veil flung herself out of the fiat dumped the hat on her head glanced at her watch as she charged up the steps to the main doors run inside heard the crisp echo of her heels on the flagstones and allowed moments to pass before her eyesight could function in the gloom the space in front of the high altar was deserted as were the forward pews a nun had told her that the cortege of the rossetti family was now well on its way to the cemetery such a fine young woman such a tragic loss immacolata had gone back down the steps at speed had nearly tripped had accosted three people an idiot a woman who was stone deaf a young man who had ogled her and demanded directions to the cemetery she hitched her skirt hem higher it was eight months since she had arrived in london with her eldest brother they had driven all the way north to genova then taken a flight to prague driven across germany to hamburg and flown into the british capital he had used doctored papers but her passport had been in her own name in those eight months she had had no contact with her father it would have been difficult but not impossible had not spoken to her mother which could have been arranged but would have brought complications and had relied on rare brief conversations with the teenage silvio she was now familiar with life in northeast london the heat of the summer had gone two days after she had met eddie the heavens had opened and a thunderstorm of epic proportions had broken sheet and fork lightning claps that shook windows torrential rain and then cool the day she had met eddie london had been as hot as naples it was as if that storm biblical in its scale which had caught them out in the open space of clissold park had severed a link with her home city the deluge had drenched them and they had kissed then gone to his single room to take off the sodden clothes and she had lost the link to her city with the roasting heat the stench of the streets the strewn litter plastic strips and discarded paper the dumped kitchen gear and the slow rot of dog mess all were with her now as she ran on the dusty verge towards the cemetery entrance as were ever sharper her memories of the young woman she had once been proud to say to her face was her best mostvalued friend by hitching the hem of her skirt higher flashing more of her thighs at those gawping at her from the cars immacolata could lengthen her stride it shamed her that in london her best mostvalued friend had almost slipped from her mind she was within sight of the gates eight months before she had promised to stay in close touch with marianna rossetti in london she could have justified the rupturing of the thread not now silvios hesitant words resonated in her mind and his stumbled reading of the notice in the cronaca she didnt know the cause of death only that her friend had passed away in the nola hospital she assumed an accident had been responsible there was as she knew it no history of illness her heel broke she had left the london apartment early while vincenzo still slept but had taken the precaution of wearing clothes for a language class she had put her black suit stockings shoes and handbag in a zipped holdall she couldnt have guaranteed that vincenzo wouldnt appear at his bedroom door blinking and bleary to query why she was wearing funeral best to go to the school she knew about security the care that must be taken it was ingrained in her like grime embedded in the wrinkles of a labourers hands she had changed in the toilet of the delayed flight and had looked the part of a mourner when the aircraft had dropped down to the tarmac at capodichino her trainers were in the holdall which was in the boot of the fiat which was stuck in traffic more than two hundred metres behind her immacolata swore and heard laughter billow from an alfa level with her she scooped up the damaged shoe from which the broken heel hung at an angle and pushed it into her bag she hopped and limped to the gate sensing the softness of baked dust against her left foot then wincing pain which meant a glass shard or a sliver of metal at the gate three or four families were with the flower saleswoman she barged in front of them dropped a fiftyeuro note on the table took a bouquet of white roses and greenery from a bucket and kept moving if she had queued and waited for the change the flowers would have cost her twenty euros at most in naples she had learned that she had no need her fathers daughter to pay for anything she headed through the gate wiped her arm across her forehead and went in search of a burial the cemeteries immacolata borelli knew in naples were on the extreme edge of the sanita district where her father had interests and out beyond the poggioreale gaol both sprawled over many acres communities of the dead with myriad buildings for the cadavers to rot in this one seemed smaller insignificant but it served a town of only thirty thousand a statue faced her a lifesize image of a young woman of the same size and youth as her best friend with a fresh daffodil hooked in her bronze hand her name set in the stone wall beside her was angelabella and the dates showed that she had died in her nineteenth year her face showed innocence immacolata was jolted she had thought too much of the filth on the verge leading to the gates her broken shoe the size of the cemetery and not sufficiently of her friend whose death had brought her here she didnt know where to go she tried twice asking where was the burial chapel of the rossetti family a man shrugged a woman grimaced she ran up the steps of the reception noticing how acute now was the pain in her stockinged foot saw a smear of blood behind her and demanded an answer from an official who sat at a desk and sipped ranksmelling coffee he too showed no interest she told him that the burial was taking place now and his shoulders heaved as if to indicate that many funerals took place now she swore that word for excrement from the gutters of the sanita and the forcella districts the official pointed above his head to a chart that mapped the layout of the nola cemetery immacolata went past the family chapels where small candles burned and plastic flowers bloomed where photographs of old and young fought against times ravage she crossed an open space where the sun shimmered on white stone grave markers she went towards the far wall using the pathways between the stones she approached a small group their backs to her she saw two ladders above the shoulders of the mourners an elongated bundle wrapped in white sheeting was lifted and two men climbed the higher steps of the ladders and took its weight immacolata remembered the shape of marianna rossettis body where it was full and where it bulged the width of the hips on which a skirt would twist when she walked but the men on the ladders lifted her corpse as though it weighed nothing the rossetti family vault was on the fourth level the bundle went above the names and dates of the lower levels the plastic flowers commemorating strangers in life and companions in death then was level with a gaping hole it had been hard to believe when silvio had telephoned that her friend was dead harder now to believe it as her friend was lifted level with the hole then given a decisive shove towards the back of the burial place as the men came down the ladders she heard women weeping now the men went back up the ladders and grunted as they raised the holes cover slotted it into place then gave it two loud thwacks to satisfy themselves that it was securely fastened perhaps an aunt of marianna rossetti or a grandmother or an elderly friend of the family would come to the elevated grave in two years time to clean the bones of the last decayed flesh and gristle then stack them in a small space further back against the rear wall the noisy weeping was over the ladders were carried discreetly to the side and the mourners started to shuffle away they came towards immacolata she wondered whether maria rossetti would hug her kiss her cling to her she wondered also whether luigi rossetti would shake her hand composed or whether his head would sink on to her shoulder and wet it with his tears she hardly knew them had never been to their home it would have been impossible for her to reciprocate mariannas hospitality for her friend to come to the borelli clans apartment but she had assumed that a daughter would have told her mother of a friend she thought she would be thanked for the respect she had shown their daughter lopsided balanced on one shoe she waited for the little group to reach her peculiar they seemed not to have seen her maria and luigi rossetti were nearing her perhaps a few of their brothers sisters cousins with them but none in the group smiled in the wan way of the grieving she might as well not have been there they came on she did not know what to do with the flowers and they were in her hand which hung against her hip and her hat had slipped to the side as she had hurried through the cemetery the veil no longer covered her left eye she had met engineered occasions maria and luigi rossetti at the college where she and marianna had studied it would be hard for her to step aside without standing on a grave and if she wobbled as she might without a shoe she would knock over two or three vases holding artificial blooms it was not as if they hadnt seen her the parents eyes were now wide open assimilating who was astride their path immacolata knew that she was seen and recognised and the greeting came first from luigi he stopped in front of her and as she held out the flowers from which water still dripped spat on to the concrete path halfway between her feet and his own brilliantly polished toecaps he looked into her eyes unwavering and the word came silently so that his wife would not hear it cross his lips but immacolata would read it he called her a whore he did not utter the word a historian would have used when lecturing on the sex trade in pompeii or ercolano but the one that would come naturally to todays dockers in the port of naples to her best friends father she was a vulgar whore of no worth unless her legs were wide and her knickers dropped and the father was a respected teacher of mathematics to eighthyear students she gasped he stepped a halfpace to his right and made room for his wife to pass his eyes were without life as if grief had purged it not so the mothers her eyes burned with anger immacolata had a moment in which to evade the attack but her reaction was not fast enough the mother was personal assistant to the manager of a wellrespected insurance company and had a reputation for integrity dignity and probity she reached out and caught the tightdrawn lapels of immacolatas blouse ripping the buttons from their holes her other hand grabbed the pretty little lace bow between the cups of immacolatas brassiere and the fabric split immacolata fell back feeling the suns force on her bare skin before she ducked to cover herself then the mother said soft and controlled that a whore should display herself and feel no shame because she cared for nothing but money someone kicked her shin she didnt know whether it was the father or the mother she went down on her knees and saw the bouquet crumpled beneath her the stems snapped the father snarled you are a whore and you have no decency i know everything about you i know who you are what nest of snakes spawned you the poison that comes from you which took the life of our beloved child she died from leukaemia we were told at the hospital by the oncology department why how she contracted leukaemia you and your family are responsible you may be welcome beside the autostrada as you wait for your clients but you are not welcome here perhaps the only language you understand is that of the gutter so fuck off the mother said for four or five weeks she complained of tiredness we thought shed been studying too hard it was only when bruises appeared that we went with her to the doctor she seemed anaemic he examined her closely particularly her eyes they are trained to hide anxiety but he rang the hospital told them she was a priority case and sent us there immediately i rang my husband at work and called him out of his class around immacolata cold harsh faces blocked out the sun when she dropped her head she saw the mens trousers and the womens knees and if she stared at the dust there were shoes mens and womens and she feared she would be kicked again she tried to make herself smaller dragging her knees into her stomach her elbows across her chest but she couldnt shut out what she was told the father said of course we know of the triangle of death weve read about it but we dont talk about it in marigliano acerra and nola were familiar with its mortality statistics and the criminality of the camorra in our town they are paid to dispose of chemical waste and dump it in fields orchards and streams that is what the camorra those foul gangsters do for two decades starting long before we knew of it the ground and water table were contaminated with poison so that the camorra could get richer they and their families have the scruples and greed of whores you are part of a family so youre guilty too the mother said they found her platelet count was low they took a sample of bone marrow to evaluate her condition but there was no need to do any tests because that first evening her condition was obvious first she had an agonising headache until she lost consciousness we were in a ward of twenty beds most occupied and had just a curtain for privacy as we watched the team struggle to save her life we could see that they knew it was hopeless because they work in the triangle and had been in such situations many times before a neurosurgeon was called but she died in front of us they tried to resuscitate her but within forty minutes she was gone snatched from us in a public ward festooned with cables and breathing aids there was no opportunity for us to comfort her or send for the priest because that day he had gone to naples to buy shoes her death hurt too much for us to weep we were so unprepared the words rang in her head she knew now that they would not kick her again they would have seen her hands trembling as she covered her breasts and clutched the shredded blouse he said a doctor told me she could have contracted the disease as much as a decade earlier swimming in a stream playing in long grass in a field or under the trees in an orchard she said i used to take her to the fields and the stream behind our home she would swim splash play then roll in the grass to dry herself while i watched her laughed and thought of her as a gift from god she was being poisoned the father said the doctor told me that the farmland around nola and the water table are saturated with dioxins if i wanted to know more i was told i should see the carabinieri i didnt think theyd speak to me but yesterday i saw a maresciallo i teach his son he told me of the camorras criminal clans who make vast profits from dumping chemicals in this area they call them the ecomafia he said the clan leader in nola had subcontracted the transportation of waste materials from the north to the borellis from naples i believed him youve prostituted yourself for greed go the mother said theres evil in your blood but i doubt youre capable of selfdisgust or shame your presence here is an intrusion go in all of her life immacolata had never before been spoken to in such a fashion she couldnt meet their eyes but kept her head low as she bent to pick up the destroyed flowers she passed a young man with a tidy haircut and a suit but no mourners tie he wore dark glasses and she couldnt read his expression she made her way out of the cemetery she had known for a decade and a half that her father dealt in longdistance heavygoods traffic and for a decade that her brother vincenzo was involved with northern industry and she herself had arranged the hire of trucks from faraway hauliers at the gate by the statue of angelabella aged eighteen she dumped the flowers in a bin and hobbled out to look for silvio she felt numb and shivered she looked at them from the door but they seemed not to have heard her come in she had got off the bus and walked the last mile ignoring the drizzle she had had no coat and the shoes torn blouse and black suit were in the holdall with the ripped underwear she was wearing what her brother would have seen her in when she had gone out early that morning vincenzo and three friends were playing cards she watched them through a fog of cigarette smoke and waited for their reaction so that she could resurrect the lie and embellish it each held a fan of cards up to his face since she had been dropped off at capodichino to wait for the flight she had thought of the bundle lifted by the men on the ladders the accusation made against her and had seen the crowded hospital ward as a life had drained away the bundle had been so easy to lift that the wind however slight might have wafted it from the mens grip and carried it up and away into the cloudless sky vincenzo was the heir apparent to their father he was thirtyone a target for the palace of justice the detectives of the squadra mobile and the investigators of the ros the raggruppamento operativo speciale of the carabinieri he had made one mistake in the ten years he had spent shadowing his father the clan leader he had used a mobile phone and the call had been traced the apartment in the forcella district from which it had originated had been raided and scribbled pizzini had been recovered from these scraps of paper covered with microscopic handwriting vincenzos another covo had been identified and searched there a beretta p handgun had been found stowed in greaseproof paper under a bath panel it carried the dna signature of vincenzo borelli and the ballistics laboratory had reported that it had been used to fire the bullets taken from the bodies of three men he would face a gaol sentence as long as his father expected when he came eventually to trial vincenzo had disappeared from the face of the earth and so had his sister he as a fugitive she dropping from view and gaining new skills in handling money movements in the doorway she could have recited every word that had been said to her as she had lain on the ground every last word and she could remember how the aggression had cut into her wounding her never in her life had anyone spoken to her with such venom or made such an accusation while seeming not to care for the consequences of denouncing the daughter of pasquale and gabriella borelli sister of vincenzo and giovanni it should have meant a death sentence to humiliate and abuse the daughter of a clan leader was the act of a man bored with living if her father in his cell in the north or her mother who flitted between safehouses had been told what her friends parent had hissed at her that man would have been condemned if she had interrupted the card game to say where she had been and what had happened within twentyfour hours blood would have run on a pavement a body would have lain at a grotesque angle and the authority of the clan would have been preserved she had not even told silvio who had looked curiously at her torn blouse but hadnt asked her brother won the hand he always won the game was for small stakes twopound coins the heap on the table in front of vincenzo was four or five times greater than the piles in front of the other players london served two purposes for him he was out of sight of the magistrates and investigators in italy but he was also in a position to do good deals exploit opportunities and build the foundations of networks he dealt in leather jackets and shoes manufactured in the small sweatshop factories on the slopes of vesuvio then shipped out of the naples docks in secrecy after the labels of the most famed european fashionhouses had been sewn or stamped in place to felixstowe on britains east coast or to the atlantic harbours of the united states a leather coat with a designer label could be manufactured for twenty euros and sold in boston new york or chicago for three hundred many opportunities existed for vincenzo borellis advancement the downside was that a prolonged absence from the seat of power forcella and sanita in the old district of naples diminished his status and authority his parents had decreed that in london he should watch over his sister while she qualified in accountancy a clan needed trustworthy finance people he treated her as a child showing no interest as she stood in the doorway the music billowed around her the cruellest images were those of the hospital ward when silvio had driven her away from the cemetery down the via saviano they had come to the inner area of nola and had gone past two of the hospitals entrances it was dominated by a ruined castle on a hilltop it was a modern building of any hospital closer to her own area she could have said which clan had controlled the construction of it which had supplied the concrete and which had owned the politician whose name was on the contracts but this one was too far from her home she imagined the interior of the ospedale santa maria della pieta death coming fast behind a cotton screen a young womans mother screaming as her daughter slipped away the father beating clenched fists against the wall behind the bed the equipments alarm pealing because the medics couldnt save a life the mutterings of a standin priest the weeping of patients in the adjacent beds and the squeak of wheels as the body was taken away the medical staff shrugging now vincenzo looked up gave a brief smile in greeting he held up an empty beer bottle then pointed to the kitchen door immacolata dropped her holdall went to the kitchen took four peronis from the fridge opened them carried them back into the living room and found space between the empty bottles filled ashtrays and cigarette cartons to put them down she was not acknowledged she closed the door behind her in her room she lay on her bed she did not weep she stared at the ceiling the lightbulb and the cobweb draped off the shade and didnt think of the boy who had made her laugh there was music playing in the living room and traffic outside in the street voices raised in the apartment above and a baby screaming below they meant nothing to her and she shut them out but she couldnt escape from the raised bundle the spoken savagery and cruelty of death the young man found his maresciallo in a bar to the right side of the piazza in front of the towns cathedral he was from the udine region in the far northeast where there were rolling hills and valleys civilisation and cleanliness he would have hated nola his first posting after training for induction into the carabinieri had it not been for the gruff kindness of his commanding officer he still wore the suit that had been suitable for the funeral service and the burial but his dark glasses were high now on his hair he waited until he was waved to a chair then sat and handed the maresciallo the plastic folder he had prepared a waiter approached he ordered cocacola the folder with the name on it of marianna rossetti and that days date was opened his report covered five closely typed pages he knew that two days before the maresciallo had met with the girls father and was aware of the circumstances and cause of the girls death he himself had been ordered to the basilica and the cemetery to watch listen it had been explained to him that the familys emotions ran high also he knew that a researcher at the hospital had published material in the foreignlanguage edition of the lancet oncology under a title that referred to il triangolo della morte and that in the secure archive section of the barracks there was a small mountain of files dealing with the areas contamination the maresciallo had read the first two pages and he sat in silence the waiter brought his cocacola with an espresso and a large measure of stock brandy he had known the maresciallo always spent time here in the evening and that he could be certain of finding him he tried to read the other mans face but saw nothing he had hoped for praise the question was as blunt as it was unexpected have you drunk alcohol tonight and he had believed that praise was due the father and mother of the deceased had made no attempt to lower their voices so he had heard them crystal clear within minutes what they had said was written in his notebook as virtual verbatim he had the accusation the condemnation and the name an older man jaundiced and cynical from long service with the arma what the carabinieri called themselves might have hung back lounged against a distant headstone smoked a quiet cheroot and reflected on what a shit place nola was the young man had made certain he was close enough to hear every word and to see the violence shown towards the woman he accepted that he would not be praised no i havent had a drink for three he was interrupted the report was in the folder which was pushed back across the table the maresciallo had a mobile and was scrolling then making a connection the young man was shown his superiors back as a call was made he couldnt hear what was said the chair scraped as the maresciallo turned to him if you havent had a drink you can drive to naples theres a barracks at piazza dante youre expected excuse me what my report is it useful the maresciallo swirled the coffee drank it then some brandy and coughed i dont know perhaps if you want praise you should ask the officer im sending you to my old mother does jigsaw puzzles to pass her time and tells me that discovering where one piece fits will solve the rest there may be a thousand pieces on the tray in front of her but slotting one piece into its home makes the rest easy i cant say whether or not what you have told me is that one piece twentyfive years ago i was at the training college in campobasso with mario castrolami whos waiting for you at the piazza dante he will decide whether or not youve helped to solve the puzzle or made it more difficult thank you he had the folder under his arm as he walked to the door in the glass he saw the maresciallo wave to the waiter who poured another measure of stock he went out into the late evening and felt the warmth on his face he didnt know whether or not he had learned something useful that day he started his car and drove towards naples he wouldnt be there he estimated before eleven and wondered what sort of investigator was still at his desk at that time and what a physical and verbal attack on a young woman at a funeral might mean fucking brilliant he turned the third page and started on the fourth he saw from the corner of his eye the carabinieri recruit the kid just off the training course flush with pleasure not you you want a lecture ill give you one if you stand against the power of the camorra clans youll have behind you tens of thousands of uniformed men but still i think youll hesitate luigi rossetti who stands behind him only his wife but he had the courage alone to stand up against the weasel girl from a clan family all youve done is listen dont think you have the courage of the rossetti parents did the weasel swear at them when they attacked her she said nothing did she challenge them do i need to offer protection to the parents can he go back to teaching she to her work their courage was amazing but should they spend the rest of their days in hiding are they dead already what did you read on her face humiliation castrolami finished reading and shuffled the pages straightening them he chuckled but without mirth understand this weasel is the daughter of pasquale and gabriella borelli the sister of vincenzo and the recruit interrupted him which very few did it was humiliation also shes a member of the clan yes but also a friend of marianna rossetti she came to marianna rossettis funeral and brought flowers the rossetti family have no connection my maresciallo is definite on this with the camorra inside nola or beyond it this friendship crossed a divide the pencil had a blunt tip and was chewed at the other end castrolami rapped it on his desk found a small place a few centimetres square clear of papers and beat a tattoo his forehead was cut with a frown mario castrolami could accept preconceptions and believe them but when he was confronted with a superior argument he could ditch them the borelli girl had been at the funeral its rare but not unknown for a member of a clan to have a friendship with someone outside it she didnt fight back she was shamed i believe you is it useful on the desk files and folders made foothills and mountains coffee had sustained him through the evening around his desk against the walls there were filing cabinets some locked and others open showing squashedin paper there were more files at his feet and on the bookshelves that flanked the door he could have pointed to them or to the chart sellotaped to the wall on the right of the door which listed the clans and the districts they fed off with lines running between them blue to show alliances and red to show feuds or to the montage of mugshots on a board that hung to the left of the door a hundred faces men and women categorised as major organisedcrime players he could have waved his arms theatrically to demonstrate the scale of the war in which he was a footsoldier the numbers of the enemy and spoken of a campaign without end had he done so he thought he would have cheapened himself in a year or two what youve brought me may prove important or in a week i dont know the problem is that you didnt see immacolata borelli arrive and you dont know how she left where did she come from what was her destination youve given me a little which is tantalising thank you alone again he felt excited which was unusual for him after twentyfive years with the arma and seventeen in the ros but it was there unmistakable he sank down from his chair was on hands and knees and his stomach sagged as he burrowed for the file that held her photograph when he found it and extracted the photograph taken in forcella by a longlens surveillance camera he stared at it could a woman from that family show remorse and be humiliated by the death of a friend he gazed at the photograph and searched for an answer time ebbed eddie was slumped on the bed before getting back to his room he had sat for three hours in the restaurant on the left side going up of kingsland high street opposite him there had been an empty chair and a laid place that went unused the heels of his trainers left smears on the coverlet her face would have puckered a frown wrinkling her forehead if she had been there to see them she was not her picture straight ahead of him had pride of place on the wall facing the bed the landlords offering a victorian artists effort at cattle grazing beside the thames was out of sight behind the wardrobe macs picture in its place she was in the mall in front of the palace smiling her hair thrown back tshirt strained and the sun was on her it was the best photograph he had of her so hed taken the memory stick to the camera shop the punjabis ran in dalston lane where theyd blown it up to thirty inches by twenty the picture was stuck to the wall if it was taken down the paper would come with it he thought it was there in perpetuity and had come to believe that he and mac were in it for the long term the afghan place which did a wonderful lamb dish was their favourite and they could make the food last for ever as they gazed into each others eyes and held hands across the table it was as if they belonged in the place and the people who ran it from jalalabad welcomed them with an enthusiasm that lifted the soul all the time he had sat there he had waited for her to push the door wide and come in panting then hang on his neck to whisper apologies and murmur some excuse shed have kissed his lips and hed have kissed hers and he had studied the menu as a break from watching the door not that he needed to because he knew it by heart he hadnt ordered food for one hadnt even ordered a drink he hadnt believed she wouldnt come to the left of the photograph was the door to his room a flimsy dressinggown macs hanging on it she would have complained loudly in a jumble of italian and english if she had seen the smears on the coverlet because it was his and her bed when she slipped into his little home only one room only one window overlooking an overgrown back garden then another row of houses chimneys and greyness the rain had fallen more heavily as the evening had gone by and now it was spattering the window panes they had made love on that bed sometimes fast sometimes noisy sometimes slow and quiet they had first been on it after their second meeting not long then maybe twenty minutes until shed said she had to get back and had wandered over his threadbare carpet retrieving the scattered sodden clothes and had refused to let him walk her to her front door it had been the happiest two months in the life of eddie deacon he lay on his bed and hated the world hed left the restaurant after three hours because his was the only table with a spare place and two couples were waiting the owners had seemed to sympathise but had made clear that his love life was his concern and their priority was to seat one of the waiting couples he had shambled out and for a while he hadnt noticed that the rain was persistent driving the misery had eaten into him nobody who knew him who saw him with mac could believe that eddie deacon had landed a girl like her dear old eddie steady eddie one of thousands who drifted along and didnt stand out who was better than bloody ordinary but who didnt bother to be exceptional had a girl on his arm who was dramatic impressive headturning and a bloody good shag he had shuffled home and the rain had dribbled down his face and hed been within a hairs breadth of being knocked over crossing a road because hadnt seen the van coming he hadnt known such love or such unhappiness on that bed her still astride him and him still inside her his sweat running with hers her hair in his face his lips brushing the cherrystone nipples two evenings ago they had fixed the rendezvous time and place always in the two months since the parkbench meeting beside the serpentine she had been on time for their meetings there were magazines on the floor dropped haphazardly or chucked espresso and oggi fashion magazines and homerefurbishment magazines a pile of her textbooks dictionaries and notepads he liked it best when she wore the dressinggown nothing else and sat crosslegged on the bed close to him and they worked on her english he liked every damn thing about her it was the first and only time she had failed to turn up he didnt have an address for her only a sight of a street corner no mobile number it hadnt mattered before because she was always where she said she would be he thought a disaster must have struck her couldnt think of anything else it hurt eddie so much that mac wasnt there and he realised how little he knew of her how much had been kept from him questions deflected subjects changed he could have bloody well wept she was smiling at him from the photograph the dressinggown hanging loose on the hook damned if hed lose her he stood by the hut the sun teetered at the top of the treeline and was in his eyes it was hard for him to see behind the open door of the hut at his back he heard crackling radio connections he had a little spanish picked up on three visits here so if he had strained and concentrated he would have had definitive answers to the two outstanding questions how many were kicking and how many were not he stared out over the trees and thought he heard the first sounds of a hueys engine and the gentle chop of the rotors when the bird landed and they spilled out he would know for sure how many were kicking and how many were not he would know also whether the advice he had given to the captain was sound or horseshit he lit another cigarette hed worked through the best part of a carton since the team had been lifted on to the plateau and set down in the clearing close to the hut his name was called they are coming lukas two minutes and they will be down he raised a hand in acknowledgement and ash fell from his cigarette on to his boot in the middle of the plateau a soldier in combat gear took something from his webbing belt arced an arm back then tossed whatever it was when it landed bright orange smoke burst from it climbed and was shifted by the light wind masking the sun the noise of the helicopter was louder he heard behind him the exodus from the hut and the communications the captain reached him took the cigarette from between his fingers dragged hard on it twice then replaced it the captain was pablo probably a good man probably an honest one he couldnt have said how many of the others those who had gone into the jungle or manned the communications nets were good and honest too often a call was made satphone mobile or landline or a message sent and the storm squad found only a dry house which had been used to hold some wretch but from which he had been shifted out pablo had gone past him and was yelling orders soldiers came off their asses and carried folded stretchers towards the orange smoke he told himself it meant nothing it was standard operating procedure the huey came in low doing a contour run over the canopy pablo stopped turned shouted are you coming forward lukas or staying back he indicated two hands up that he was standing his ground he dropped the cigarette ground it out under his boot and lit another he was not in an army so didnt wear a uniform he had on a heavy wool blue shirt that was buttoned at the cuffs and kept him warm enough against the chill at this time of year and at this height above sea level his trousers were heavyduty corduroy duncoloured his boots were not military but of the brown leather used by hikers and hitched to one shoulder was a rucksack that held his spare socks underclothes washbag and the notepad laptop the huey made the approach usual for it to do a circle of a touchdown point give the flier a chance to check the ground but it came straight in if the bird came straight in and was dropping the last few feet over the dispersed orange smoke it didnt mean his advice had been wrong he gave the advice as best he could and sometimes the corks popped and sometimes the bottles stayed in their boxes his advice offered to the captain given what he knew given the location where the poor bastards were held and the near impossibility of maintaining secrecy had been to make the strike the huey landed heavily on the skids bounced and settled the light hit the birds camouflagepainted bodywork and he had a good view inside the door which was slid back the hatch machinegunner jumped down and went up to his thighs in the long grass which made more room for the soldiers with the stretchers to pass them inside three were handed up if at that moment it was a disappointment to him that three were needed he didnt show it his feelings of disappointment or elation his thoughts were not for sharing they wouldnt be farc guys wounded enemy on the stretchers theyd have been tipped out two of the stretchers were lifted down the orderlies holding drips high above them the bearers hurrying as best they could a doctor in a pristine uniform was between the stretchers and examining the occupants on the move the wounded would be stabilised then casevaced it was the way things were done he saw the third stretcher lifted down no drip the bodybag rolled on the canvas as it was lowered the doctor came past him they were spotted when they were almost on target but it gave away the critical last thirty seconds its what it depends on success failure i think lukas its neither i hope to save them he didnt look into the faces of the two men just glanced and saw the long wispy beards and hair the blood of bullet wounds on filthy clothing and the grimaces because they were in shock and the morphine had not yet taken effect three men now emerged from the huey and they were helped down then led away bent low from the spinning rotors they looked weak and near to collapse he did the equation intelligence had reported six hostages a french tourist who was an irresponsible idiot a canadian waterpurificationplant engineer whose light aircraft had come down three years earlier a judge who had been kidnapped eighteen months back two local politicians who had been snatched four and a half years ago and a missionary who was said to have peruvian papers one dead two wounded three unharmed was a good return two soldiers were walking wounded five bodies were dumped from the hatch theyd be farc guys a chinook was coming in now would have been called up when the contact report had come in over the communications a monster with a double rotor system and a full medical team it was a good return hed seen the missionary walking towards him and had seen him also politely shake off a hand that tried to support him it was all because of the missionary it was not for the tourist or the engineer or the judge or the localgovernment people they could have been forgotten and left to rot if it had been special forces americans on the ground the message would have been sent out in clear to the farc that the missionary tag was bogus the man passed him and there was a murmur lips barely moving which might have been two words thank you probably was he didnt acknowledge the captain pablo was not inside the loop and didnt know that the freeing of an american asset was the sole reason for this mission lukas no one else would have been permitted by the agency to give the crucial advice on the rescue of their man he had the reputation but he shunned pride there was a colonel on the chinook he slapped him on the arm and bayed good work lukas we lost a local politico but he was a left sympathiser and the frenchman weve saved the judge who has good connections with central government and gods man the canadian and a mayor from this region the injured will live fine work a hand was offered but he kept one of his in a pocket and the other cupped a cigarette end he did not do courtesies it was not that he intended rudeness more that the pleasantries seemed unimportant and he wouldnt have considered such a refusal might offend guarding the cigarette was a greater priority but later at the ramp of the chinook he permitted pablo to hug him briefly it would be an hours flight to the military base attached to bogotas civil airport he would be in time to catch the avianca night flight out of the aeropuerto internacional el dorado for the long haul over the wastes of the atlantic before the european landfall then the short commuter ride to his home the families of the survivors would be at the el dorado with jerks from the embassy flashlights government ministers and a ratpack of hacks he would be well clear of them he would sleep on the longhaul flight he always slept well coming off an assignment win lose or draw hed sleep the glasssided box of the public telephone was ahead the pavement was crowded at that time of the early evening and it slipped in and out of her view but she kept her eye on it as if it was the holy grail she had not slept the previous night and had not eaten that day she had missed an allday seminar on insolvency had walked the streets and sat in a park with downs road behind her and the open expanse in front where mothers pushed prams smoked and gossiped where kids threw off their hoods and kicked a ball and where workgangs sullen resentful and bored cleared dumped litter under supervision she had watched them all had seen the old walk arm in arm or dragged along by a dog on a tight lead and the young drift she had watched the high windows and balconies of the tower blocks on the west side of the park and seen wet washing put out on lines to dry and dry washing taken in the hours of the day had been eaten up it was about betrayal a big word as big as any she knew in its weight it had rolled in her mind tradimento it had made her in her bed unable to sleep shiver and feel dread because she knew the reward that waited for those who betrayed their own her hand was tight on her shoulderbag as she walked down the shallow slope of the street towards the telephone box it was occupied three boys in baggy trousers and oversized sweat tops were crowded inside it she wondered why they used a public phone not mobiles and whether they bought or sold she looked to see if any others were hovering to use the phone and thought not where she came from that culture and that society the word tradimento had a taste as bitter as poison betrayal was an ultimate sin was stamping on the face of christ and she had sat through today on the bench in the park she had kept her hands tight on the bags straps and had watched but not absorbed she had agonised on the implications of betrayal her first act of betrayal had been that morning when she had come out of the bathroom dressed and had crossed the living room vincenzo was lounging in a chair smoking a towel draped across his stomach as he turned the pages of a football fanzine about napoli ssc she had gone into her bedroom and come out a moment later with the bag that contained the notes she took in her classes he had asked without interest about her day she had answered a mutter that she had a seminar on insolvenza she had needed to carry the work bag if she was to support the lie that she was attending her classes she had lied to her brother and started the process of betrayal vincenzo had grinned the idea of insolvency amused him he his father and mother his brothers his sister were worth hundreds of millions of euros would never know insolvency she had sat on the bench and watched her stomach had growled and she had steeled herself was there something else she could do to reflect her feelings like what join a religious order and say prayers become involved with a charity and help the mentally handicapped alcoholics or hiv sufferers sign up for a campaigning political group and attempt to bulldoze change through a ballot box walk out lose herself try to forget what had been a part of her life as alternatives they had all during the night seemed inadequate and degrading to the memory of her best friend immacolata had found the strength to go to the telephone box when the selfdoubt was worst she would stare out over the trees and up into the clouds feel the rain on her skin and take herself back to those hours not many of them she had been able to look at her watch and think that twentyfour hours earlier she had been hurrying along the verge of via saviano or that it was the moment her heel had snapped or that she was hopping hobbling along a path between the family chapels or that she was in the centre of the cemetery at nola staring across white gravestones to a far wall where the family slots were she had recalled the hands taking the bundle and carrying it up the ladders clearest were the images of her clothing being ripped her shin kicked and the denunciation of her familys part in the death of her friend had she known of the trade in the disposal of toxic waste of course she had had she known of the profits to be made from shipping contaminated rubbish from factories in the north to dumping grounds in the fields and orchards of the south of course she had had it ever intruded into her thoughts that her family would fear responsibility for the killing of her friend never she remembered the flowers bent worthless what she remembered best gave her the strength to commit the act tradimento she stood by the telephone box she eyed the boys had she been at home on her own streets and ragazzi had used a telephone she was waiting for she would have been recognised the call terminated the booth offered and respect would have been shown to her maybe even one of the kids had she been at home would have wiped the receiver on his tshirt to leave it clean for her two of the boys stared at her challenging here on kingsland road in dalston against the border of hackney the boys with hoods on their heads nikes and new tracksuits ruled and did not expect to be stared out she thought they were shit one the biggest seemed to make a decision about her he didnt pull a weapon but ended the call and dropped the receiver letting it dangle on its cable then slouched out his shoulder brushing hers it was probably the nearest he had come to a moment of submission she heard behind her another spit at the pavingstones she lifted the receiver she knew the number anyone in her family knew the number and the occupant of the desk on which the call would ring out she had not thought of the young man perhaps he too was betrayed he was ignored didnt matter to her as she stood in the glasssided box the headlights of cars buses and vans glistened on the street the lamps above her were bright and threw an orange wash over the windows of shops banks building societies and betting shops all closed now the young man didnt matter to her and had no place in the fierce heat of the cemetery at nola she put a visa card into the slot and the display panel responded she dialled she would not have needed to know the number neither would any of her family have needed to know it knowledge of the number was power having it showed the tentacle reach of the clan the direct line would have been listed only on the most confidential sheets and would have circulated only among a chosen trusted few knowing it was a demonstration of the power of the clan to which she was integral she took a deep breath allowed it to whistle shrill from her lips the call was answered she thought she had interrupted a meeting in the office on the upper floor of the palace of justice and that a subordinate had picked it up she named the prosecutor she was told he was unavailable who wished to speak to the dottore the moment of betrayal came fast stampeded her for a moment she couldnt speak then she straightened her back and jutted her chin i think hell find time to speak with me tell him im immacolata borelli he walked into the classroom a chorus of voices in scattered accents greeted him for eddie deacon it had been a bad day and now it was evening the chance of improvement was minimal the language courses often took place after working hours and his foreign students flocked in when their daytime employment legitimate or not had finished it had been a longstanding promise made at least a month ago that he would go in the morning by train from london to chippenham his father had collected him at the station and theyd had a desultory conversation in the car about the state of the railways the weather the roads his fathers pension and just as they had exhausted all common subject matter theyd reached the family home hed had to go he couldnt have brought himself to call and tell them he had a problem and couldnt make it he would have heard undisguised disappointment in whichever of them he had spoken to and hed known that for the last two days his mum would have been planning lunch she worked frontdesk receptionist at the offices of a local building contractor and would have told everyone there that she was taking the day off because her lad was coming down from london theyd be waiting the next morning for a bulletin on how it had gone and how he was progressing and from the way she told it most would reckon he was a college lecturer and something of a highflier not a language teacher who helped a cocktail of youngsters to speak basic english and wasnt concerned with chasing prospects his father had taken early retirement on his fiftieth birthday and pottered round the house fixing things that didnt need fixing eddie deacon had damn near nothing that connected with the lives of arthur and betty his parents what he couldnt deny was the love they had for him a bit humbling actually like having a pillow shoved over his face that half suffocated him there was love and there was expectation for his future after lunch if he was lucky hed escape for an hour put on the old pair of boots that were kept on the shelf in the pristine garage and walk by the river maybe see a kingfisher in flight lean on a field gate and have a herd of heifers nuzzle his sleeve then a quick tea a pointed look at his watch and talk about the train he could catch hed been up early he had walked across from dalston into hackney and had turned up at the college where she was enrolled on the accountancybookkeeping course hed asked for her at the administration office something urgent hed said and i need to see miss immacolata borelli shes a student on the b course it really is important they knew who he was because he was there three or four evenings or lunchtimes a week to meet her whenever she finished a class and he didnt have one he was there a shrug she hadnt been in had she called in sick she had not just hadnt turned up another shrug he couldnt go soft begging and pleading and ask for a sight of her home address couldnt because it would have shown up the biggest hole in their relationship no address and no phone number then an escape route a walk in the fields where the heifers were grazing and down to the river the former soldier from a bungalow down the lane had been on the bank eddie deacon was a good listener and didnt reckon to wipe his own views over anothers and compete in conversation he didnt know the guy dean well but his mother had told him grisly stories not much older than eddie but there was a tattoo of a paratroops wings and dean had been special forces now he did contract work in iraq and was gone for four months at a time listening seemed important and he noted that by staying quiet and lending an ear the guys hands stopped shaking the fingers didnt clasp and unclasp and the voice lost its breathiness he didnt hurry him or glance at his watch and learned a bit about the airport road procedures to counter vehicle ambush and command wires things that had nothing to do with the river the flight over the water of the kingfisher twice or the patrol of a heron when it was done the guy had gripped his fist as if the listening had been important at home he apologised to his parents for having been away so long and told them where hed been and why hed stayed out hed sensed then that the world of a psychologically troubled exsoldier was a route march away from that of his mum and dad and his own hed headed for paddington and the mainline train a later service than intended not that eddie deacon knew too much about the workings of the kgb old time or the intelligence services present time but he liked to joke that his mum betty would have had an interrogators job no messing if she ever chose to turn up and offer herself it was a routine area relationships the village seemed to him a rabbits breeding warren everyone they knew had children who were shagging and producing some in marriage and others not in everyone elses house there were framed photographs of babies with redeye so was there a girlfriend had he met anyone was there anyone important in as if he had to shove his thumb in a fractured dike hed done what he could to cut off the questioning stupid but it was what he had done eddie had opened his wallet and taken out a photograph mac smiling close up he had seen his fathers jaw drop and his mother had purred in appreciation showed really what they thought of him they could hardly comprehend that the layabout the tosser their only child had a photograph of such an attractive starquality girl in his wallet to get to the river hed had to make a promise yes next time he came down he was definitely going to bring her with him guaranteed safe as a supermarket special offer hed told them a bit not much she was italian she was clever she was going to be an accountant didnt tell them hed sat in an afghan restaurant for three hours the previous evening with an empty place laughing at him across the table that shed stood him up did tell them that she was friendly warm and made him laugh didnt tell them that she had skipped classes that morning and hadnt phoned in with an explanation didnt tell them she hadnt given him her home address or a contact number didnt tell them hed never walked her home did tell them with his eyes his face and with the way he held the photo that she was totally important to him the sight of the girl mac had silenced them and hed escaped to his river walk said it out loud mac for heavens sake where the hell are you mac where have you gone what are you doing behind him in the kitchen the dishwasher would be churning arthur and betty would be muttering about a girl coming at last into their boys life all the time down by the river listening and offering a shoulder she wasnt out of his mind hed thanked his mum for lunch promised again that he would bring mac next time he came down thanked his dad for the lift to chippenham and come back to london hadnt known what to do and had gone to work she throbbed in his mind good evening everybody it came back at him surf rolling on shingle good evening mr deacon i hope everybodys had a very good day thank you mr deacon hed had a hideous day of hurt wounds and anguish no mac and didnt know where to find her he was important to her wasnt he definitely he was had to be he knew it because shed told him so had told him when they were in bed right settle down were going to continue this evening with our agatha christie story and were going to pick up on page fortynine lets get there when they were in bed naked ecstasy shared shed told him how important he was to her she wouldnt lie would she it had been enough to bring mario castrolami in his car through red stop lights then to get him as close to running along poorly lit corridors as he knew how castrolami steadied himself his hands clamped on the back of a chair the fog of smoke made his eyes water and irritated his throat four men and two women in the prosecutors office had cigarettes alive the desk and the mahogany table in the window were scattered with open files the prosecutor headed the section in the palace of justice that attempted to combat the power influence and control of the citys camorra clans with him were his deputy who had responsibility for the innercity clans of naples his carabinieri liaison officer who worked from the palace his secretary and the archivist he most trusted castrolami knew them all knew also that each man and woman in the room could be trusted implicitly the liaison officer castrolami had heard personally swept that office each morning for electronic devices and a radio played tuned to a rock programme on a commercial channel the screen on the prosecutors desk showed the softfocus closeup image of a young woman whose features he knew whose history he had studied whose importance he recognised and whom he had never met the secretary handed him coffee a thimble cup castrolami hitched off his jacket the pistol in his waist holster bouncing on his hip and loosened his tie he would have described the prosecutor as neat like a manicured garden his shirt was freshly laundered and his shave that morning had been close enough to hold the stubble at bay a man who cared for himself the deputy tall and angular was also tidy for a man now into the thirteenth hour of his day the liaison officer was not in uniform but wore a wellcut jacket of expensive scottish material the women too did not show the days pressures had probably changed in midafternoon there was no fragrance about castrolami a tiny cassette was loaded into a dictaphone and a button depressed he realised the machine had been activated late after the call had been taken him im immacolata borelli do not interrupt me dottore i am calling you from london but i wish to return to italy it is my intention to collaborate by saying that to you on the telephone i put at risk my life more important i put at risk the possibilities of a successful prosecution of my family i require immunity and an officer who is trusted by yourself should meet me in the hackney downs park in east london and i will come to a bench at nine in the morning london time and will wait for one hour he should bring with him a warrant for the arrest and extradition of my brother vincenzo castrolami is an officer of the ros whom my father respected you should send him you hold my life dottore you hold also the prospect of the conviction of my family the borelli clan good night dottore there was a click then silence he looked at the photograph on the screen castrolami saw the haughtiness that verged on arrogance that in the surveillance still she wore ordinary clothes and small ordinary trinkets no lipstick or other makeup and her hair was tousled he did not know when this photograph had been obtained whether she had been on her way to terrify a shopkeeper who was late in filling the little envelope with twenty or twentyfive per cent of his takings or to a meeting with the general manager of a cementproduction company to tell him that her price should be accepted or none of his mixer fleet would reach the road again the voice on the phone had made a play of being decisive and in control he thought immacolata borelli had failed was in bits near to physical and mental collapse what is she worth the deputy prosecutor asked castrolami assumed he knew the response he would get but needed confirmation of the obvious and gave it him his breathing had steadied and he lit his own cigarette from a heavyweight marlboro lighter an american had given him with the flame extinguished he said only a blood member of a family has a near to complete knowledge of its affairs with her help what might we achieve the prosecutor queried he thought the prosecutor the best and most dedicated under whom he had worked in naples the man possessed an encyclopedic knowledge of the citys clan structure and the principal players he imagined that the call had come during a meeting when the day was winding down and perhaps a whisky bottle had been produced and that it had exploded among them a shellburst fazing them he thought he understood we could close down the clan the whole mass of them would go into the net the liaison officer ground out his cigarette scratched the bald crown of his head murmured she telephoned from london what happened there for her to attack her family with such venom i find none of it credible castrolami told them of the young man who had come to his office late the previous evening the barbarity of a street fight in a cemetery his words painted a picture of a familys controlled grief melded with aggression and their courage he said she could have reacted in two ways she might have condemned that family to death for the insult or crumpled under a burden of selfdisgust its happened before but not often they feel overwhelming shame can you get the warrant in the time he was told that the paperwork would be ready in an hour that it had been on file then given a flight number and a departure time he preached the need for secrecy which was accepted he was told who would meet his flight in london but the individual would be outside the loop of confidences in that hour he could have gone back to his office in the barracks on the piazza dante and packed a travel bag spare shirt singlet socks and toilet bag but he did not he slumped into a chair which squealed under the impact of his hundredplus kilos he wondered how she would be and whether she would greet him as an ally or an enemy then he swept an armful of files from the table and started to gut them learning the latest intelligence sparse and hearsay on a clan now stalked by treachery and he was smiling he tried to bring life animation to the typescripts flesh and blood to the photographs he thought he walked with them pasquale borelli went to the recreation hall he was fiftyfive slight and bald with a prominent nose and a scarred head he was allowed one hour in the hall per day under the terms of the pena dura he was a strictregime prisoner under the terms of the article bis legislation had no access to a mobile telephone few and heavily supervised visits little time in the company of fellow inmates he was held in the maximumsecurity wing of the gaol at novara in the north the city was near turin and milan astride the route from genoa into switzerland it was a long way from his home in naples hundreds of kilometres and the authorities had intended that his incarceration there would sever his links with the clan he had dominated for two decades their intention was unfulfilled a prison officer carried out messages written on cigarette papers he still controlled an empire that was worth perhaps a halfbillion euros he awaited trial and the chance of him enjoying freedom again was small but he was optimistic that the evidence and testimony lodged against him could be challenged he had to believe that no further denunciations would cloud his horizon for an hour he would play pool in the hall the table of course would be occupied when the officer unlocked the last barred gate but a prisoner would immediately give up his place for pasquale borelli in his cell he had a photograph of his daughter not his wife he loved her deeply his principessa gabriella borelli was six years younger than her husband since his arrest when he had been dragged out of the underground bunker by the ros bastards she had been undisputed in her leadership of the clan they had been married for thirtytwo years since she at seventeen was little more than a child but decisions inside the core of the clan had always been taken after her advice had been heard now she was a latitanta and her continued liberty depended on her moving from safehouse to safehouse a network of covert addresses as a fugitive from justice she was unable to utilise publicly the vast wealth the family had accumulated since her husband had been taken and the flight of her eldest son she had won respect from other clan leaders it had come from her clearheaded ability to strike deals open up new markets and act with cold ruthlessness when such was required she was feared she was a small woman petite darkhaired and well kept for her fortynine years but she wasnt out to look for a new dress as she would have liked but to attend a meeting she was an anonymous figure in the narrow streets walking briskly and carrying an old shopping bag she missed having the strengths and certainties of her eldest son close to her but rarely thought of her daughter vincenzo was in his thirtysecond year the eldest and he was eating a pizza in a trattoria off hackneys mare street he always had the margherita with mozzarella tomato and basil the colours white red and green were those of his countrys flag he was with friends young men from the fringe of the clan and together they dreamed of a day when they could return to the city and eat the best pizza from the via duomo the via forcella or the via ettore bellini he would go back he would take authority from his mother he would not be able to drive a ferrari wear armani suits or have a penthouse apartment overlooking the golfo di napoli but he would have power and he would be careful not to leave a trail from himself to a killing handgun vincenzo faced four charges of murder if he was located and arrested so it was important for him to maintain his unseen existence in london but he was concerned that if he stayed away too long the fear in which he was held in forcella and the respect would diminish he barely noticed his sister accepted the need for a member of the family to have a good knowledge of financial procedures and structures but he expected her to clean the apartment they shared and to look after his laundry she wasnt important to him nobody loved giovanni he knew that he was twentythree that evening he was on a girls family bed her father and mother were in the next room and had the television on loud he fucked the girl a virgin until he had penetrated her the previous week on her parents bed because it was bigger and more comfortable than hers they would not complain and they would not attempt to throw him out of their home he was giovanni borelli the son of pasquale and gabriella borelli in the forcella district and in part of sanita his name gave him unquestioned power he would not pay the girl under him who was giving him as good a ride as he was used to neither would he pay for the meal he would have afterwards he paid for nothing the only man who had ever raised a fist to giovanni was his elder brother who had beaten him split his lip and cut his eyebrow the sister of a friend had accused giovanni of putting his hand up her skirt his father had not protected him from vincenzo neither had his mother now he grunted and cried out as the orgasm came louder than was natural for him but he knew the sound would carry into the living room and would not be drowned by the television good that they should know their daughter was a good ride he was responsible for the collection of dues in the area north of corso umberto south of the via foria and between the via duomo and the corso giuseppe garibaldi the only excitement came when a smartarse shite would plead poor business inability to pay and be beaten as his brother had beaten him he thought his sister immacolata an arrogant bitch and she had no time for him in his bedroom silvio borelli read a comic and listened to music on his ipod he was seventeen the youngest of the tribe he had been told by his grandmother never one to mince words the circumstances of his conception eighteen years ago in his mother had been sneeringly informed that his father flaunted an amante had been seen with her in an hotel on the sea front the via francesco caracciolo when pasquale borelli had next come home she had punched his head scratched his cheeks kicked him in the stomach and kneed him in the groin he had suffered a tempest of abuse he had crawled to gabriella borelli and pleaded for her forgiveness promising abjectly that such behaviour would never be repeated they had made up her on top of him calling the shots at her speed and for her gratification the result had been silvio he was a sickly child from birth and was doted on by his mother but he loved his sister he told her everything giovanni sniped that he wouldnt wipe his arse without asking immacolatas permission he lived with his grandparents above the via forcella and sensed their contempt for him because he was not blessed with the familys hardness he wanted little more from life than to speed in narrow alleyways on his scooter and to mess with old schoolmates and almost resented that his name denied him friendships he knew that some spoke of him as a cretin but a reputation for stupidity brought its rewards and the clan used him to ride round the district and drop off narcotics cash messages and firearms he was unsettled driving back from nola the previous afternoon he had been bewildered by the transformation in his sisters mood and her shoe was broken her clothing ripped and her knee scraped raw she had been near to tears and she was the best person he knew the most important in his life the parents of pasquale the grandparents of vincenzo immacolata giuseppe and silvio were carmine and anna borelli they were both eightyseven though she had been born four months after him they had founded the clan given it teeth and muscle then passed its control to their son they lived now in via forcella and as she sewed a collar back on to a shirt he snored quietly in his chair and the television screen in the prosecutors office was blank the photograph killed the files on the clan family were back in the secure area of the archive the office was darkened he had gone home as had his deputy the liaison officer and the women who ran his life they were as dedicated as he was to the extermination of the camorra culture a cars tyres had screamed as it had headed for capodichino the liaison officer drove castrolami no sirens and no blue lights but speed on the backstreets they had swept into the airport and the alfa had rocked at the sudden braking outside departures then he was out and on the forecourt he slid the pancake holster off his belt the loaded pistol in it and left them on the seat no backward glance no wave and he heard the liaison officer power away he scurried through the doors to checkin an officer of mario castrolamis seniority could have demanded and received preferential treatment at the airport a ticket already processed a boarding card presented to him a lounge to wait in until the rest of the passengers had been herded to their seats a drink a canape and an automatic upgrade but such treatment would have been noticed he went past the site of the death unmourned from heart failure of salvo lucania known to law enforcement in the states as lucky luciano he thought that the pain of the coronary was a fitting end for that man he always noted the place where that boss had collapsed he went to the communal lounge and had barely flopped into a seat before the flight was called he walked to the aircraft the last flight of the day to london gatwick in a swell of tourists voices played across his face and behind his head he spoke quite reasonable english and was able to distinguish appraisals of the ruins at pompeii and ercolano judgements on the capella sansevero compared with the pio monte della misericordia the merits of the castel dellovo and the castel nuovo he was happy to be among tourists he accepted that an army of watchers footsoldiers maintained a sophisticated web of surveillance over the city and its suburbs every district would have entrances watched by men and boys and myriad mobile phones would report which policeman moved and the direction of his journey the camera systems of the police and the carabinieri were sophisticated but could not compete with those of the clans it would be a disaster if it were known that mario castrolami had caught the last flight of the night to britain warnings would have been issued coded messages sent and it would have been known in london before the boeings undercarriage had dropped that a camorra hunter was travelling he eased into a seat the watchers were everywhere the policeman on the forecourt the porters on the concourse the checkin staff the baggagehandlers the cabin crew he put his face into the inflight magazine but tapped his jacket to reassure himself for the fourth or fifth time that the envelope with the warrant folded inside it was still there he sensed the admiration of the tourists for his city and their ignorance they knew nothing the watches were still on their wrists the wallets and purses in their coats and handbags and naples was wonderful he thought that an ignorant man or woman was blessed he could count on the fingers of his two hands all the men and women in the city whom he believed had no price sicily was bad for corruption inside the forces of law and order money changing hands in return for intelligence and warnings in calabria little was planned that did not reach the ears and eyes of the criminal tribes from his own city castrolami could not have put twenty men police palace of justice and carabinieri in a line and sworn on oath that he harboured no suspicion against them the fear of corruption and the suspicion it engendered against colleagues should be ranked as one of the greatest successes of the camorra he had not phoned his wife to tell her that he would be away had had no need to she had long ago left for milan taken the children gone back to her mother she had sworn that naples was a cloaca and that she and they would never return to that sewer there was of course another woman for mutual convenience and he hadnt phoned her either as the aircraft thrust up the runway and lifted he replayed in his mind what that voice had said i put at risk my life he would not dispute that she might the bitch have changed her mind by morning they did often enough but he could recall each word of that young officer from nola and believed she would be there he could sleep wherever he found himself so he threw back the seat ignoring the protest from behind loosened his trouser belt and saw in a dreamers kaleidoscope the features of immacolata borelli he heard himself say in a sort of wonderment i dont intend to talk you out of this but have you any idea at all of where this will lead you what is at stake not just wonderment astonishment it wasnt the face of a camorrista it was a good face with smooth skin not a cheap whores and pocked or did he delude himself they were bored but polite it was as plain as a pikestaff to eddie deacon that agatha christie needed highprofile selling in mogadishu or lagos vilnius or bratislava anywhere they came from agatha christie was not holding them but he ground a nail into his palm and kept going he was talking about the authors sentence construction all the language schools did agatha christie she was supposed to be the route towards decent spoken english maybe he wondered agatha christie was taking the blame for his own inadequacy he was droning he had as much interest in who was the murderer as they did his students wanted to be able to do the business with a gangmaster a bureaucrat at the job centre the warden of a hostel while the brightest needed to be able to communicate in a goodquality threestar hotel what they also needed and somebody was paying for was a teacher with enthusiasm who could concentrate on a text it was as though he was on autopilot he could hear his voice monotonous and flat the straw he clung to was that his mac would be back at his place she had an outer door key and a yale to his room it was only a straw a pretty thin one but it was possible that shed be there they all liked her at the house couldnt believe she was real a guy who pushed paper for h m revenue and customs another who waited at tables in a club on pall mall the one who sold train tickets for great western and the phd student from goldsmiths couldnt believe she was real because once a week she made pasta with a sauce to die for they would all have known when he and mac were on the bed in his room must have heard through those walls and down those narrow stairs enough noise then shed cook she always brought plastic bags of food and would never accept money it was the only time she splashed out and showed she was flush when they were out as they should have been in the afghan place they shared it had been laid down between them at the start he ached for her he didnt care about miss marple or poirot didnt give a damn whod done it he wouldnt wait for a bus hed run all the way back to the little house and pound up the stairs and burst through the door and hope hope she was there his straw he hadnt made the bed that morning hadnt straightened the coverlet seemed to see it still in chaos he said i apologise to you all im not myself today i hope its not the flu thank you for your attention and ill see you all next week as he gathered together his dogeared lecture notes they chimed thank you mr deacon a very good evening to you he fled hit the pavement at full stride and tears blistered his cheeks she liked salvo always used the diminutive not salvatore and never called him by his street name il pistole more than any of her own children and had since the day he had been introduced into the heart of the clan three years earlier when she reached the bar she went inside and past the counter the tables and into the inner room he was already there and immediately stood up giovanni was at the table but did not get to his feet she could accept her eldest vincenzo because he possessed the dynamism of his father and could feel affection for the youngest silvio because he was helpless devoid of authority and ambition she had never considered her daughter of equal importance to the boys she disliked giovanni for his painful and prolonged birth and for his conceit and exploitation of the family name if he had not been of her blood and had behaved with such arrogance in her presence he would now like as not be dead dead at the hand of salvo il pistole it gave gabriella borelli some slight pleasure to know that her middle son giovanni not only loathed salvo but also feared him and giovanni had cause to fear salvo when she had come into the outer area of the bar the staff would have begun to prepare coffee for her a variety that was gentler on her throat than the small bitter measures the men swore by she thought salvo was similar to a ferocious dog that ran wild and free at night inside the fence of a scrapmetal yard and showed obedience to none but his acknowledged master her husband had recruited salvo and advanced him had been that master but on his arrest the young mans loyalty had turned to her she believed his devotion to be as honest as that of any slobbering rottweiler or german shepherd at a light knock on the door salvo was up again he opened it took the cup and saucer and closed it he put the coffee in front of her indeed giovanni had cause to fear salvo the young man recruited and advanced by her husband and now only twentyfour was a killer he could kill with a pistol but if circumstances warranted he could kill more artistically he was best known for the pistol in the forcella and sanita districts the kids had photographs of the beretta p on their mobilephone screens and images of the weapons owner as the ultimate enforcer of the borelli clan salvo had accumulated enemies vendetta blood feuds were no longer practised in naples but there were enough stones in the cemeteries around that quarter of the city for many to long for the day when he was a corpse in a crimson pool or at least looking at a maximumsecurity cells bars she sipped her coffee and her thinly applied lipstick left a pale smear on the cups rim but hers was a city of betrayals gabriella borelli did not trust readily so she had brought the son she disliked to the meeting there should always be a witness she would never place her faith entirely in one man she could smell the sweat of sex on her son seeping through his shirt and off his chest he didnt even have the respect for her that would have made him shower afterwards he flaunted the smell and she wondered which teenage whore had opened her legs for him since pasquale had been flown north to novara she had not taken a man into her bed had not but wished she had when she smelt the sweat they talked she controlled a huge financial empire now it involved property in the city in other parts of italy the holiday resorts of the balearics and the canaries the south of france and on the coast east and west of spanish malaga it covered import and export of goods through the naples docks and a dozen ports near and far from italy gabriella borelli giovanni and salvatore could have talked of legal and illegal trading and mentioned millions of euros they did not they talked instead of the merits of a power supply which was better should a twostroke petrol engine be preferred to one driven by mains electricity but needing a cable plugged into a wall socket it was all a matter of the time available the location and whether the power was within easy reach they considered the problem of a cold petrol engine and how many pulls there would be on the starter cord and what if it flooded much of the borelli clans business utilised laundered cash and that could be done in the back rooms of a major bank local american german or british but other matters needed close attention in the rear room of a backstreet bar in the depths of forcella it was the place to decide between electrical power or a twostroke engine salvatore would not have been consulted on commerce or investments it was the matter of enforcement that necessitated his presence gabriella borelli liked salvo but was wary of him in the world of forcella and the clans that ran so much of the city and its population enforcement was critical respect must always be secured lack of respect must be answered to ignore disrespect showed weakness to show weakness even in a trivial matter was fatal for a clan leader a moment of perceived weakness was enough to alert circling rivals a position of power must be reinforced with decisive action that was salvatores role most often the p was used for quick clean intervention but reputation required innovation that evening the discussion was on power supplied by petrol or by electric cable the decision taken with giovanni as a witness herself sanctioning it gabriella borelli left the bar because she had chosen her way of life she never complained about it not even in her thoughts her husband would be in gaol for the rest of his life and her eldest son was a fugitive her middle son was a vain bastard and her youngest son was a useless idiot her daughter was intelligent but had neither her mothers commitment to the clan nor the determination to succeed gabriella was more than twice salvos age and he had no future beyond a quick death from a gunshot or arrest and a long sentence that was slow death on the street alone hugging shadows both hands gripping the strap of her shoulderbag she thought of the arms of the man who killed at her demand their thin hairless beauty his light narrow fingers his waist flat under the tshirt and the jeans that bulged when he stood to greet her to collect her coffee or to escort her from the bar it was unthinkable she flushed and returned to the image of her daughter a scooter swept past her its fumes flagged into her face and the picture was lost eddie had studied the victorian poets the lakes people and byron at the small unfashionable university in the thames valley if hed managed the entry to a better university or worked harder where hed ended up he would have been qualified to teach those poets as eventual head of department at a sixthform college he hadnt so he taught basic english to foreigners and his high literature was from agatha christie there was no poetry in his pain nothing noble romantic or edifying about it the pain hurt bloody bad and left an emptiness he couldnt fill the hole in his life gaped she hadnt been there he had gone through the front door brushed aside the taxman in the hallway met the man from the ticket desk halfway up the stairs and reached his own door then fumbled so badly that he couldnt insert the key he had started to kick it when the phd fellow did the honours with the lock he had snapped the light on heeled the door shut hard enough for it to slam and had seen the bed empty unmade what to do too much pain yearning for his mac not daring to believe she had just walked out on him music was playing downstairs soul stuff as if the others had caught his mood and sought to offer solace he had said it to himself so many times but he had never felt so bad before girls yes before yes village girls university girls and languageschool girls yes kissing yes groping sometimes shagging not often really caring not even with the hygiene inspector it had never really mattered whether he was hooked into a girl or not he was cold he was lonely he was so bloody unhappy hadnt eaten and hadnt slept much the night before he asked the question aloud so what to do he could see her magazines on the floor her dressinggown hanging limp from the hook on the door the scent of her was still in the room he could have leaned over buried his face in the sheets and she would have been there the sweet smell of her he did not he stared at the wall found her picture sat taller and straighter he told himself dont know what happened dont know why it happened whatever going to find out going to go to work in the morning hack the day and track it down the problem of mac in the evening promise yes bloody promise hed thought he wouldnt go downstairs and face them wrong he went down and put his head round the door of the communal living room eyes looked at him then evaded him as if he had the plague they wouldnt have known how to react to his unhappiness the tv was on bloody football yes they all loved her as if she was wendy and they were peter pans kids and she cooked wonderful pasta eddie deacon forced a smile his voice quavered but he got through it its been a grim day doublewhammy awful i dont know where she is dont know anything tomorrow ill find out right now im going out for a drink or three they all went they had their arms round his shoulders in the rain not a coat among them and headed for the talbot the public bar as if everything was all right hed know tomorrow evening if hed kept the promise hed made to himself she didnt sleep she was in her room with the light off so there wouldnt be a strip showing under the door when the gang came back and she wouldnt be called to get up and make coffee or pour beer immacolata knew most of the stories of betrayal in the folklore of her city although her mother father and brothers would not she had gone to a school that had taught her more than how to write a police statement in an interview room she had been educated she also knew what happened to the men yesterday today or tomorrow who betrayed their own she didnt know what they did to the women her mind raced flicked through a score of images and glimpsed the nightmare sight of what might happen to a woman before it was superseded she was in the crowd at the back and the polizia were unwinding the roll of crimescene tape she was on tiptoe and had just seen the blood and the white underwear the tanned thighs maybe black hair and the blanket was cast to cover her mind had gone on she told herself that only one person would have understood what she had done in the public phone box on the kingsland road that person was dead marianna rossetti would have understood but her friend was immured behind the concrete hatch with the marble facing which might now have been sealed with grouting she lay still and breathed quietly she had heard her father speak of castrolami the investigator from the raggruppamento operativo speciale and she imagined a man of dignity stature and bearing she thought of how he would welcome her show gratitude for the sacrifice she intended to make and talk to her of the nobility of what she did he seemed handsome and but she didnt sleep she was in that street again in the via foria or the via cesare rosaroli or the via carbonara and the pain bit into her toes as she struggled for greater height to see better the woman on the pavement who had been accused of betrayal and know what had been done to her always shoulders and heads impeded her view the hours went slowly they came in they drank talked played cards watched tv then vincenzo was alone she thought he paused outside her door and listened if she had moved in her bed he would have come in and talked to her maybe he had some problem with money foreignexchange regulations the opening of a new account or a transfer so she lay still after half a minute she heard him clear his throat and go to his room her mind was made up the seed sown in the cemetery at nola he had stomach cramps he walked down the long pier inside arrivals at charles de gaulle airport the pain snatched at nerves in lukass gut made his mouth twitch and brought a frown to his forehead the cramps had not been brought on by the landing of the aircraft that had brought him from madrid to paris a catastrophic bump leap and skid in a fierce crosswind that carried driving rain nor were they the product of the food served on the long atlantic crossing or the result of the confined leg room hed gone steerage because business class was fully booked he had not smoked since he had gone through the departure gate at el dorado he walked slowly and soaked up the ache in his guts within a few strides he had killed the pain the twitch and the frown nothing about him was noticeable to a stranger he would go through immigration and customs briskly he didnt need a visa for france living now on a uk passport and had only the rucksack slung loose from his shoulder he had been authorised some months back at permanentsecretary level to carry two passports in washington this had been endorsed by an undersecretary the passport with the colombian entry and exit stamps was at the bottom under his laptop the one he would show at immigration bore only east european and north african stamps nothing from the middle east or latin and central america so his movements would not go down in the computers that tracked international travellers it was important in the work he did that he left no paper trail he would take a bus into the city centre hed have a chance at a bus stop in the driving rain and wind to light a cigarette that seemed important to lukas about as important as gaining a return of three unhurt two wounded one fatality he didnt triumph nor expect herograms only a long debrief with his employer when he would sift in his mind what was relevant and what could be discarded not something to boast about playing god making decisions that might cost the lives of men and women he thought more about the cigarette he would light in the bus queue than about a return of five survivors from six it had been about the one guy the agency man but lukas declined to recognise a stark fact when the bus came he would ride into the city then get himself down into the late train on the metro and walk from the subway at solferino to his apartment if he had permitted it a limousine would have been waiting for him at the kerb outside arrivals the americans would have sent one as a mark of gratitude the company would have ordered one he had perhaps a low church love of frugality none of the good men the ones to whom lukas gave respect sought greasepaint flashbulbs and welcoming bands it was just possible that he was the most competent of the good men if he was the elite figure among them it was not because of his crusading spirit but the attention he gave to detail the depth of his experience and his rejection of conceit when he won through it was said that many who knew lukas waited to spy out his emotions and motivation and still waited no car no congratulations might have been because he knew how fine the lines were between success and failure he had one regret that evening it was a few minutes short of midnight and he was returning to paris too late to meet up with his friends by the time he had negotiated the bus ride the metro and done the walk his friends would have gone home lukas was back where he lived would be there until the next time the phone shrilled in his ear it was his life as someone had once said to him lukas you dance on other peoples misery if it wasnt such a crap world you wouldnt have work he hadnt disagreed he blinked to see better he was under a tree during the night the wind had taken off enough of the foliage for the rain to drip on to his shoulders and head he squeezed his eyes shut hoping to clear out the water and the bleariness of a bad night mario castrolami was looking for her the ministero degli interni the vast creaking bureaucracy on the viminale in rome had an officer seconded to the italian embassy he was a policeman not a member of the carabinieri so castrolami regarded him as a lesser creature good enough to meet him last night at heathrow and drive him to a holiday inn not good enough to be given advance warning on the identity of a potential collaborator with justice and the implications that might splinter from it an ros investigator from naples a frontline salient in the war against organised crime would have little trust in the combination of policeman and viminale so after his failure to sleep castrolami had left the heavy sealed envelope containing the arrestwarrant papers for vincenzo borelli at the hotels reception desk with the officers name on it laborious complicated but necessary and if the woman did the business the officer would be told to collect the envelope and act on it trust the lack of it always governed castrolamis actions he searched for her he had never seen her in the flesh but had the surveillance photograph to remember rain spattered his head and jacket he saw some old people mostly men many meandering with a toysized dog on a lead and some youngsters of both sexes who wore tracksuits and earphones and ran in a trance the most exercise castrolami took was to walk via a bar for an espresso and a pastry to the station for the funicolare and after his descent to the stazione cumana he would cross via toledo and reach the barracks at piazza dante he thought it sufficient exercise for any man in the morning but if it rained he brought his car twice while he had waited under the tree a dog had come to the trunk cocked its leg and pissed on neither occasion had the owner apologised he couldnt see her he wondered if she was standing back hesitating to show herself he moved clear of the treetrunk so that he was more visible put simply there would be only one swarthy middleaged italian waiting at two minutes past nine yes he had remembered to alter the time on his watch under a tree in diabolical weather the city authorities in naples were about to declare a drought the skies had been clear for weeks and the temperature in late september still reached the high eighties in his apartment he had a raincoat unused and forgotten behind the front door umbrellas stood in a stand also unused and forgotten maybe hed drown maybe hed catch pneumonia she appeared he could see her face she had a small umbrella up with a pretty flower pattern but held it back over her head because at that angle it shielded her better she wore a light plastic coat that came to her hips but her legs were soaked though she seemed not to notice it he knew what he would say unable to sleep in the holiday inn with the walls seeming to enclose him a sealed tomb he had passed the hours in deciding the tone he would take and the relationship he would create with her perhaps because she was here not in forcella she seemed more vulnerable than he had expected at home she would have known every trick in the game of countersurveillance had been born with the tactics in her genes anyone from the borelli clan other than the young idiot silvio knew the craft of criminality from the moment they dropped out of their mothers utero a man had said that the camorra would live until every woman in the clans was sterilised and every man castrated she did not use any countersurveillance tactic it was clear that she knew she was late for a meeting and was looking for the second party he knew too well the enormity of what she had done but castrolami reckoned she knew it better than he did should he wave or hold his ground under the tree he had thought she looked vulnerable but this was immacolata borelli daughter of pasquale and gabriella sister of vincenzo and giovanni educated and intelligent granddaughter of carmine and anna being groomed in financial management so that she could clean dirty money vulnerable not innocent she saw him she stopped she was on a path and a cyclist swerved past her then two runners divided and went either side of her the wind took the flaps of her coat and opened it as far as the lower buttons allowed castrolami noted the vivid orange blouse he thought it was her statement he smiled grimly to himself she was entitled to make a statement but this was the easy time she would know the threat to her life if she came close to him talked to him did as she was instructed but he doubted she had grasped the pressures that would now build in her mind but that wasnt his problem he came out from the shelter of the tree the rain in the wind layered on his face his collar was damp his tie bedraggled and the jackets shoulders were sodden his hair was flat and drips fell off his nose he murmured come on you little bitch come and do the business she did she had a good swing to her walk she was the daughter clear to him of the clan leader and the clan leaders wife the child of the padrino and the madrina locked eyes with him and closed on him the vulnerability was now hidden she stretched her stride he believed then that she hoped to dominate him because that was her culture she could wish it but it would not happen she stood in front of him she could have tried to use her umbrella to shield both of them but she collapsed it shook it pocketed it if he could be wet so could she she spoke coolly i am immacolata are you castrolami he reached into his pocket lifted out his wallet flipped it open and showed his identification he put it away he knew what he would say over his shoulder she saw a kid kick a football so normal she saw a man throw a stick for a yapping dog so ordinary far behind him kids were skiving from school and dropped sweet wrappers as they fooled so predictable he said you asked me to come and i came you can beckon once and ill run but it wont happen again if you flick your fingers or whistle a dog will come to you im not a dog so im here what do you want to tell me two days ago i was at the cemetery in nola for a funeral my friends funeral and she stammered uncertain he was harsh and his voice was cutting i know about nola marianna rossetti and the triangle i know what happened to you there what was said and what was done i repeat what do you wish to tell me she had thought there would be a car a big lancia or a fiat saloon and that a call on a mobile would bring it hurrying to the nearest kerb that she would be whisked inside and away to an embassy house she had expected a tone that was at least respectful if not deferential she wanted control and couldnt find it im immacolata borelli i withering i know who you are who your parents are who all of your family are i am part of the borelli clan and of course youre part of it i said in my call to the palace i wish to return to italy she blustered then return to italy does the borelli clan not have sufficient funds to permit you to purchase an airline ticket if you wish to return then do so i want protective custody she saw his eyes roll and his lips moved on those words i want protective custody but soundlessly the rain was harder now but he seemed not to notice its new intensity he stared down at her his eyes never off hers nobody had ever stared challengingly into the face of immacolata daughter of pasquale borelli then why and i require immunity from prosecution now his head shook a comedians exaggeration and she thought she heard a click of his tongue i very much doubt we would consider that i presume wed be talking through the statutes concerning money laundering extortion tax evasion maybe not acts of physical violence membership of a criminal conspiracy we do reduced sentences but not immunity in circumstances such as yours what would justify protective custody a reduced sentence what chips can you place on the table its because of what my family has done indirect responsibility for the poisoning of your friend i wish to do something in her name your friend was poisoned by the contamination of the water table with toxic waste illegally dumped so that i can look in my mind into the face of my friend and not feel total shame his expression showed no enthusiasm rather boredom that would be excellent you do something were not specific but something and you can go to a priest squat in the confessional box cant really tell you too much about all this father wouldnt be healthy for you to know but im doing something to right a wrong my family did the wrong not me personally but i want overall forgiveness and more sunlight in my life how gratifying what are you prepared to tell me i can tell you about my family her voice was little more than a whisper he lifted an eyebrow as a slow smile curved his lips i had difficulty hearing that again please i said that i can tell you about my family she had spoken boldly did i hear that correctly im not sure again she knew he was toying with her that he was the cat and she a small rat the amusement was in the mouth but not in the eyes that looked down on her she broke ill tell you about my family she shouted better again she yelled over him past him and out across the worn grass of the park at the trees the walkers and joggers the talkers and the kids who should have been at school ill denounce my family many in the park had heard her some merely turned their heads but went on their way others stopped to gawp i hear you but do i believe you he said softly you have my word he allowed the irony to run over her i have the word of the daughter of pasquale and gabriella borelli everything now he was an uncle to her as a zio would he tucked her hand into the crook of his arm and walked with her through the rain their shoes squelching on the grass and the mud you travelled to nola signorina you were late for whatever reason and did not reach the basilica in time for the funeral mass but you travelled on to the municipal cemetery there you were humiliated and subject to the emotional experience of parting from a friend you flew back to london you didnt sleep the accusations are alive in you and guilt haunts you you pick up the telephone none of this yet is difficult you make a statement to the prosecutors office that is laced with dramatic intent you put down the telephone and imagine champagne corks pulled an executive jet on standby and that you will be brought back to naples to be met on the tarmac with a red carpet the cardinal in attendance and the mayor no it hasnt happened they sent mario castrolami as you requested and the flight home will be in economy where there is little leg room the food is foul and english barbarians are talking about the culture fix theyll get in our home over seventytwo hours you will then signorina be surrounded by strangers and dont expect them to regard you as a resurrected mother teresa they will try to leech from you every scrap morsel titbit of information so that they can shut away your family for even longer the family who has trusted you with their lives and whom you will have betrayed many months after youve taken that flight back to italy youll have to appear in court at one end of the room there will be the judges in the well of the court the ranks of the lawyers and at the other end a cage behind its steel bars you will see your family will you turn to me then and say dottore i have doubts now on the course of action to which i was committed last september ive changed my mind i dont wish to go ahead with this it was a mistake i want to be reunited with my family i want the love and warmth of my gangster father my ruthless vicious mother my murderous eldest brother and my psychopathic middle brother i want to return to them will you turn your back on the court many do signorina they climb high survey the view and scramble down their nerve doesnt hold will your nerve hold she lowered her head and looked at the toecaps of her shoes she allowed him to lead her along itll hold they all say that but many fail to deliver she stopped she felt his fingers drop from her arm she faced him and tilted her head she could see the cage their faces the hatred that beamed at her and the contempt my word should be sufficient guarantee you will never be forgotten never forgiven you will never again walk the streets of your city as a free woman can you turn your back on naples it was her home those greek traders who had first anchored their boats in the shadow of the great mountain mideighth century bc had called it nea polis the new city the romans came later from the north and corrupted the name to napoli now it is a city adored and detested admired and despised it is one of unescos proudest world heritage sites and is regarded by interpol as having the greatest concentration in the world of most wanted organisedcrime players horace the roman poet coined the phrase carpe diem seize the moment and it is still the maxim of neapolitans many cultures have left their mark on naples after the collapse of romes civilisation and its hold on the city the occupying army was that of the ostrogoths then the byzantines from constantinople the normans and the spanish there were bourbon satraps and napoleonic revolutionaries admiral nelsons fleet covered the port with cannon the wehrmacht and the gestapo sought to control it after which the americans gave it military government in the last century communists democrats and fascists have attempted to bring naples to heel but failed at the university the academics seek to excuse the inner citys million people for its ungovernability they quote the actual and the potential the actual is the camorra the generic name for the criminal families that are the principal employer and major pulsebeat in naples the potential is the lowering image of the mountain vesuvio with its volcanic capability and history of destruction the criminality survived the most savage reprisals of the mussolini era and now cannot be beaten the threat of the volcano mocks any who look far to the future it may erupt at any time and warning will be minimal those same academics point proudly to the magnificent churches and palaces and strangers flock there from across the world john ruskin the english art critic and reformer came to the city in the late nineteenth century and saw the naples that has attracted the first overseas tourist industry he wrote the common english traveller if he can gather a black bunch of grapes with his own fingers and have a bottle of falernian brought him by a girl with black eyes asks no more of this world or the next and declares naples a paradise but he would not be seduced and continued naples is certainly the most disgusting place in europe combining the vice of paris with the misery of dublin and the vulgarity of new york naples is the most loathsome nest of caterpillars a hell with all the devils imbecile in it outsiders may come criticise and leave but those who are bred and live in naples are held by loyalty as if in chains to the city the gulf makes a perfect natural harbour the sea ranges from azure to aquamarine the churches are noted for their splendour and the castles that defend the shore are reassuring in their strength it has the best of everything architecture painting sculpture music food vitality and the refusal to be cowed with the biggest openair narcotics supermarket ever created the wealthiest criminal conspiracies ever known and a degree of violence that makes both the brave and the cynical cringe in the heart of the old city where the streets were laid by roman road builders then wide enough only for a handcart to pass and now for only a scooter is the district of forcella the borelli clan ruled forcella can you do that erase that place from your mind i hope whats hope useless inadequate either you can or you cant she flared i am immacolata borelli you offer me no respect castrolami shrugged as if she had scored no points he said i see so many of them this isnt sicily the vow of silence doesnt exist in forcella sanita secondigliano or scampia in the far south the gangs are linked by blood its impossible to consider that a family would turn in on itself but youre not calabrian ill get to the point signorina or sicilian the clans of naples have greed brutality and no honour do you understand we have more men and women offering to collaborate than in any other part of italy theyre practically queuing outside the palace sometimes the prosecutor has to check his diary to make sure he has a slot for a new one many are rejected because they have little to offer that we dont already know a few because we dont believe they can sustain the pressure of their treachery i offer no informer respect and im used to rejecting them dont think signorina that you have earned my admiration or have my gratitude you insult me she tried to stamp her foot and mud spattered out from under her shoe no avenue of retreat was open to her she knew it and so did he she couldnt throw a tantrum spin on her heel slip probably and walk away she had met him perhaps she had been photographed with a long lens from a car among those parked bumper to bumper around the park perhaps he had a wire strapped to his chest and a microphone in one of his jacket buttons did she believe that if she walked out on him the ros would not allow a photograph limited distribution among the journalists accredited to the palace or not make available a snatch of her voice to the rai correspondent in the city on sunday mornings priests talked often about taking personal responsibility for ones actions the need to consider consequences beforehand she couldnt meet his eyes and dropped her head it had stopped raining the wind had freshened and she shivered he said you know better than i do that the name for such a person is infame that person is not a patriot a hero or heroine disgrace walks with them and the infame who betrays his or her family is the lowest of the low you could never stand signorina on a box in the piazza del plebiscito and attempt an explanation of what you have done youll become a pariah and be forced to make a new life her lip trembled and her voice to her was hoarse i will never go back i wont if youre found again in naples what will happen to you theyll kill me what do they do signorina to an infame before he or she is killed he was relentless what do they do i dont know what they do to a woman i know what they do to a man the crowd was four deep in places where the best view was to be had the girl reporter from the crime desk barged her way through offered no apologies and kicked the ankle of an obese man who didnt shift out of her way when she was through the spectators she looked for her photographer located him and went to his side my car wouldnt start she said your cars shit and always will be my cousin deals yeah yeah what have we got relaxed the photographer smoked a small cheroot took it out of his mouth and blew smoke then used it to point at a space on the pavement between two parked vehicles a checked tablecloth that doubled as a shroud filled it the feet of the corpse its shoes and blue socks stuck out from the covering and she could see where blood had diverted round sprouting weeds to dribble into the gutter where it was dammed by a plastic bag beyond the cars half hidden a police sceneofcrime technician manoeuvred a camera fixed to a tripod other officers standing around languidly and an ambulance was parked further down the street she stretched up laying a hand on the photographers shoulder and could see better past the parked cars a woman sat on a straightbacked wooden chair no more than two metres from the body she wore a nightdress of thin cotton with a dressinggown as if shed been roused from her bed and cradled a child a boy of perhaps four as she stared blankly ahead the photographer said i done her shes the wife wrong the widow i done her when she first came bawling and screaming that was before they covered him up do we have a name the police have but they havent shared it youll get it off the street or officially at the questura that was where she worked on the ground floor of the police headquarters off via medina and down near the sea front in the cavernous mussoliniera building in the room where the crimedesk hacks fed off the information they were given she was relatively new to the city but her father had a business partner who had an uncle who had influence at the newspaper and it had always been her ambition to work as a crime reporter the link had secured her the job the normal way of things in the city the more senior staffers on the team were out of town because a supplement was being prepared on the casalesi clan operating in caserta so her phone had rung and her car hadnt started she might well take up the photographers offer to introduce her to a cousin who dealt in secondhand vehicles what they said in the newsroom about the photographer told her that a car from that source would be cheap but the chance of paperwork to accompany it was slight she had her notebook out and a ballpoint pen so what happened was he shot you sure you want to know of course have you had breakfast no because the car wouldnt start and i was late and better on an empty stomach its not pretty most of the murders she had covered since shed joined the crime desk had been pistol shots into the head of a man eating in a trattoria drinking in a bar sitting in a car playing cards with associates tell me you asked see there behind where hes lying theres a grocery the drogheria of course has steel shutters down at night the padlock was cut and the shutters lifted enough to get a man under they needed electrical power they took the cable in with them found a point and plugged it in then they went two doors down called at the place and the wife said her husband wasnt in and went back to bed they waited for him to come back from wherever jumped him and dragged him to where the shutter was up he would have seen not much light on the street but enough what they had waiting for him and hed have been shitting himself too scared to scream and theyd started the engine can you take this try me theyd plugged in a circularblade tilecutter jesus help us one of the cops told me before the big apparatchiks took over theres no pretty way to say this but they cut off his balls first then put them in his mouth forced open his teeth and shoved them in this is the twentyfirst century this is naples a cradle of civilisation you doing all right fine they put some euro notes in too then they cut his head off the blade can go right through a bathroom or kitchenfloor tile so it wouldnt have had a problem with a neck they took his head off and laid it in his crotch so it covered up where his balls had been did you say a cradle of civilisation they did all this on a pavement and theres a streetlight no more than fifty metres away people must have passed him in the night after theyd driven off they must have seen him with his head in his crotch gagging on his balls and the money and must have stepped round him kept going people live over the drogheria and alongside it but they never heard anything nothing heard and nothing seen the grocery owner came to open the shop before going to the market and found him what more do you want to know she swallowed hard if she had thrown up she would have demeaned herself and it would have gone straight round the citys newsrooms and the hacks room at the questura she swallowed gulped then she looked hard at the face of the widow and thought she saw acceptance not anger she wondered if she could write her piece on the expression of fatalism base it round the mood that seemed to grip the woman she didnt keen and the child didnt weep i want to know what hed done to be punished like this he was a carpenter why was he killed like that though the policeman who talked to me said that the borelli clan who have this territory wanted the pizzo from him so they extort cash from him a hundred euros a week the photographer lit another cheroot puffed at it shrugged he shouted his mouth off he said hed go to the palace inform the police have that from the woman maybe hed already made a statement to the prosecutor maybe hed only said he would in some districts you can do that and survive but not in forcella or sanita hed threatened it and that was enough so thats what they do to an informer yes and nobody reported any noise or the body in the street because they were frightened and because nobody values an informer he has the status of a leper the sceneofcrime technician had folded away his tripod the ambulance crew had carried the body on a stretcher to the vehicle the woman and the child were escorted by a priest to their door and the owner of the drogheria lifted his steel shutter uncoiled a hosepipe and sluiced the pavement the crowd dispersed the reporter and the photographer drove off to write copy check pictures and hear the police statement in the questura within minutes there was no trace on the pavement or in the street of where an informer had been killed he glanced at his watch she had promised detailed information on the functioning of the clan her mothers role in the running of the organisation the dealings of vincenzo and the work giovanni was put to in forcella what she had told him was merely headlines but to an investigator it was mouthwatering not that he showed enthusiasm he took no notes and didnt wear a wire he thought it important to be indifferent at this stage of his linkage with immacolata borelli in his mind were the bullet points of what he needed and two were outstanding he asked where vincenzo had been that day did she know anything about his diary where could he be found after midday she was vague it was difficult for her she said to know her brothers schedule she gave him the address of the apartment they shared his mobile number the name and location of the cafebar he most often patronised the warehouse where he stored the coats and shoes he imported and exported i emphasise and repeat signorina that intense pressure will be applied to you when your family learn what youve done in the first period before a legal process we will protect you but we cant protect all those who may be dear to you could they find hold and hurt maybe murder a lover no put a second time the question was redundant but it was his practice to examine the face rather than merely listen to words in naples theres no lover no boy no in london are you in a relationship with someone you met here an italian boy a boy from the college you attend is that important it is signorina because youll be sequestered perhaps for months in a safehouse and under protection a boyfriend wont be able to visit you you cant get on a plane and come back to london because you want him because it wont happen so there is a boy here his eyes bored into her looking for truth demanding it and he towered over her he was aware then that the first thin sunlight had broken through the cloud and played on her cheeks i have to know yes but not significant what does that mean significato is there or isnt there a boy we go to bars we go to films we go you go to bed but you say its not significant yes hes just a boy we met in a park it doesnt mean anything you wont pine for him she threw back her head and raindrops cascaded from her hair the sun catching them to make jewels ill forget him maybe i have already he looked into her eyes for evidence of a lie and couldnt find it her eyes were clear bright and unwavering mario castrolami knew little of love his wife and children were in milan lodgers at her mothers home there was little of love that he could remember it might have been his uniform that had attracted her when he was young slim and straightbacked but now he no longer wore it his shoulders were rounded his stomach pushed at his belt he was edging towards his fortyseventh birthday and he slept with a loaded handgun in the drawer of his bedside table there was a woman with whom he shared a restaurant table and the couch in her studio but only once a month never more than twice she painted aspects of the great vesuvio exhibited some and sold a few and he was fond of her but it wasnt love most of the time he forgot his wife and children and if his friend the artist moved on she too would be forgotten he did not challenge her again he believed he had found honesty in her features not that honesty would help her deceit was a survivors weapon away from her castrolami used his mobile phone a new day and eddie felt better last night was gone better and freer he had had breakfast with the others in the house toast and cereal and eddie had said his piece about losing track of mac and there had been almost a collective howl she was part of them all down the pub and the laughter back home her cooking lasagne or cannelloni or making a sauce coming out of the bathroom with maybe just a shirt on or the seethrough robe and fluttering her eyelashes at them it just wasnt possible eddie had thought that each of the others would have looked back to the last time theyd seen her mentally stripped her mood and looked for indicators that she was bugging out on him and them he had said he was going to teach and that at the end of his working day he was going to find her didnt know the number but had dropped her off that first time at the end of a street a bloody long one and hed find her if he had to bang on every door and ring every bell he taught with enthusiasm was maybe at his best he had ditched dame agatha and had gathered up an armful of weathered muchused digests of shakespeare condensed anthologies eddie himself quietly and with sincerity had read sonnet let me not to the marriage of true minds admit impediments love is not love which alters when it alteration finds or bends with the remover to remove and a lithuanian car mechanic had read aloud o no it is an everfixed mark that looks on tempests and is never shaken it is the star to every wandring barque whose worths unknown although his height be taken the classroom had rung with applause and he had blushed a nigerian who wanted to nurse but needed the language before she could enrol was next loves not times fool though rosy lips and cheeks within his bending sickles compass come a somali man who washed dishes in a hotel but wanted to be a street trader stuttered through love alters not with his brief hours and weeks but bears it out even to the edge of doom an albanian needed more english if he was to get customers for a delivery service up in stoke newington he was last to be chosen and looked about to opt out but eddie wouldnt let him so he tried if this be error and upon me proved i never writ nor no man ever loved then the class stamped and slapped their palms on the desk tops he thought a hungarian girl plump with beatle spectacles on her nose was savvy enough to take stock first and she said to the algerian next to her in halting english that the sonnet was not performed for them but for their teacher it was his love they had recited and what she had said went on down the line behind her in front of her and the room echoed with giggles they did more extracts and his medley of students gathered from across the globe played ferdinand miranda and prospero lysander and hermia juliet and her nurse lorenzo and jessica he ended with sonnet and had the hungarian girl read it shall i compare thee to a summers day thou art more lovely and more temperate he let her read alone and her delivery grew in confidence but he brought in the whole class to echo the final couplet and make a chorus so long as men can breathe or eyes can see so long lives this and this gives life to thee it had been a unique class he doubted it would be repeated he would find her his mac he had promised to eddie walked to the staff room and the coffee machine he felt that purpose had returned the bustle of the prosecutors office was stilled he was at his desk which was littered with a carpet of opened files and more lay on the wood tiles beside it the deputy prosecutor had a cigarette in his mouth the lighter lit but left to burn ten centimetres from the tip the liaison officer winced air hissing between his nearclosed teeth the personal assistant to the prosecutor bit sharply at a pencil and looked up from her screen the archivist was halfway across the office from the door to the desk and carried a load of cardboard fileholders that reached from her stomach up to her chin they were the inner cabal the call had come faint and with a poor signal from castrolami the prosecutor looked around into each face and they nodded accepted his judgement operation partenope named after the mythical daughter of a goddess who had drowned in the gulf and was regarded as a symbol of deceit treachery was launched now he spoke softly lets get to work i want on the telephone the extradition team of the metropolitan police if theyre not too arrogant to speak to me i want the operations director of the squadra mobile and the duty officer ros here for fourteen thirty hours with arrest squads on standby there must be no breach in security and no names of targets given we have a small window and must jump through it and his desk phone pealed his assistant passed him the receiver and mouthed that the caller was again castrolami the prosecutor began to scribble names and addresses the light of triumph in his eye she dictated castrolami repeated into the mobile phone what she told him all of the addresses used as safehouses by gabriella borelli the location of the rooms where giovanni borelli slept the apartment off the via forcella that was the home of carmine and anna borelli and where silvio borelli stayed the rooms off the piazza mercato a street behind the via polveriera and an alley to the north of the vicolo lepri that salvatore il pistole used she gave the last streets with dry relish and had long believed that the clans principal hitman fancied having his hands in her knickers her stomach against his and wanted to put a ring on her finger thus ensuring his advancement in the clan family would bring him that she felt no emotion as she spoke all the time she had clear images in her mind they were not the faces of those she denounced or the features of castrolami jowled and clumsily shaven with raw bloodshot eyes his sparse hair whipped up by the wind she saw the cavernous space in the basilica empty because she had been late the face of an innocent carved in stone angelabella with the single flower as she had hurried past with one foot bleeding she heard everything that had been said to her and named the streets where the safehouses were she had done it he cut the call put the phone back into his pocket he said quietly almost conversationally i hope signorina you arent fucking with me this is big we must win or be laughed at if we lose because youre fucking with me then ill put you into the sea off the rocks and hold you down she looked at him ill go the course whatever they throw at me she stood then feet a little apart shoulders back her coat was now open and had dried on her her blouse stretched across her breasts she slipped her hand into the damp crook of his arm and they walked together it was a good morning by the river the rain and cloud had cleared and lukas was hunched on the step with his friend squatting on a canvas stool philippe drew with crayons on heavy white paper pinned to a wooden board with midday coming it was close to the high seventies and in the afternoon the temperature might hit eighty but where he had taken his pitch there was shadow from the doorway down and across the street there was a foot bridge over the river marked by a largerthanlifesize statue of thomas jefferson lukas didnt know much about jeffersons life and times but it was a good place for the artist tourists from the united states came and took photographs of the statue then seemed to want to remember the place with something more authentic so they purchased his crayon drawings of the statue the bridge the river and the louvre which was on the far side of the seine usually when he was at home lukas would come to that doorway and settle beside his friend if his friend was concentrating he would sit quietly and do some thinking of his own if they talked it was about little things the price of bread the state of the football championship whether the weather was lifting or closing in he would never pry into philippes life and in return he was not asked when he came back after a week or three or a month where he had been or why there was always in late september a strong odour rising off the river because its level was low and when he looked upstream he could see the little island covered with notre dame he came to this place unwound his emotions let them slacken and was distanced from where hed been afghanistan iraq an uzbek or tajik city the jungle of the high mountains in colombia and philippe wouldnt press him why was the man his friend in one limited area there was total and compelling frankness between them philippe said his work was shit and lukas never disagreed he valued honesty men and women died when assaultsquad commanders or hostage negotiators and coordinators fought little patches of territory and declined to be truthful the work was shit but it sold and fed his friend and meant there was a place for at least another month where lukas could find company he was anonymous here which suited him he didnt carry a mobile in paris but the way he lived his life meant he was seldom far from the telephone on the small table inside the apartments front door and a light flashed if a call had come in and a message had been left he always hesitated a couple of seconds no more before he picked it up when the light flashed red theyd gone round it for a long time and had now reached consensus philippe busy on jeffersons face the second work since the discussion had begun was certain who would win the weekends football games and lukas agreed in his own trade he knew that disagreement killed three times a day lukas was out of his apartment but seldom for more than two hours it was always a stampede to catch up when the call came and the light flashed red philippe shared his flask it was good coffee as always he disliked to ask a favour to place himself in debt or obligation to any man he hadnt asked one but castrolami had endured an uncomfortable awkward day but now he had purpose they were out of the city and on to the motorway it was not yet dusk but the sun was sinking and it would be evening when they left heathrow night when they reached fiumicino the man from the embassy drove in the hours since they had left the park they had shopped underclothes for her in a chain store he had passed her euros from his wallet which she had placed in her purse then used british currency he thought her the daughter of her father because she hadnt given him change for what she had purchased he had hustled her they had been brought fifteen minutes in the car away from the park and he thought they were nearer to the heart of the city but distanced from where she lived and where her brother might be then she found a nightdress a washbag and the items to go with it for himself there was a sandwich in a cardboard and cellophane wrapping he had not discussed with her the possibility of her returning to the apartment and packing a bag it had been stated as fact that there was no question of her going near her street they had stopped outside a railway station near the shopping area and she had walked with him to a fastphoto booth and done portraits then they had killed time had mario castrolami been prepared to ask for favours a choice might have presented itself he could have used the embassy man to contact the london police and request a secure room in a police station wherever for them to wait in in naples it was common talk among the squadra mobile and the carabinieri that the british police in particular the london force were selfserving and unhelpful to the point of obstruction they lived it was said in a fantasy land of imagined and patronising superiority so he had no secure room with the london police he believed he must take precautions against a collapse of her determination a seachange in her mood he couldnt rely on her to say where they could lie up for the day there might be a back doorway on to a street through which she could slip and disappear nor was he prepared to take signorina immacolata into the embassy to wile away the hours he didnt know the personnel so he didnt trust them he had had the driver from the ambassadors staff park a block away from the embassy then had given him the photographs of her from the booth the man had been gone for half an hour then returned with the new passport it was not yet noon so they had gone to another park she had said it was hyde park the rear doors of the car had been locked and the radio turned up it was slow on the sixlane motorway castrolami couldnt have taken her out on the first available flight with seats free he wasnt prepared to move her until a signal came to him via his mobile that the extradition unit had eyeball on vincenzo borelli she had not complained had accepted what was incarceration had refused food had not asked for a lavatory had not made empty conversation it suited him that he was not required to do smalltalk and that others would begin the detailed debrief he was not much more really than the bagcarrier he neither liked nor disliked her was neither attracted to nor disgusted by her her breathing was steady giving no indication of stress but he kept an eye on the front windscreen the driver had a dayold copy of corriere della sera and had heaved the news and arts sections over his shoulder and into castrolamis lap while keeping the sport pages but castrolami hadnt looked at the paper and neither had she they had watched the movement in the park pedestrians prampushers and horseriders and hadnt talked the call had come his bladder had hurt but he had known the vigil was near to its end he didnt know how she felt now that the surveillance team had eyeball on her brother and didnt ask they were leaving behind the tower blocks of london and the sun was dipping down he had half expected her to crumple and look for comfort from him shed get fuckall if she did a bagcarrier didnt do nurse she sat bolt upright and her lip wobbled occasionally but there were no tears further out of the city the traffic speeded up the mobilephone messages had told him of the eyeball in london the readiness at the palace in naples the teams gathered in briefing rooms at the questura and at the barracks in piazza dante he had gutted her for headline information before they had gone on the shopping jaunt and that information had gone he doubted that she could now step back he had made one accommodation to his principle of refusing to ask favours at the terminal the car was met only a protocol chief but sufficient carrying the printouts of two tickets the plastic bag dangled from her fist it was the symbol he reckoned of how far she had come her possessions were in one cheap bag and they consisted of underwear washing kit and a nightdress then there was whatever she had in her handbag castrolami handed his passport and the one she would use to the protocol guy they were examined the title pages flicked and they were taken through locked doors and into hidden corridors where only permanent heathrow staff had access they emerged into a departure area were given the printouts and brought to a passport control desk one at the end which had a position closed sign but where a young woman sat she looked at the pages at the faces handed the documents back there was a screen ahead and he saw that the rome flight had been called he had been told that if the traffic was heavy on the motorway and they were late the flight would be delayed he had a hand on her arm and steered her towards the pier then hooked out his mobile dialled waited was connected he said where they were confirmed the schedule he was told the operation had been named partenope he shut the mobile and switched it off they came to the last exit off the pier he thought she had walked well not stumbling not faltering maybe she was as he had suspected a hard bitch under the veneer of sadness at the death of a friend hard and uncaring would she stay the course they all said they would but only a few did and were alive able to build a new life when the trials were over he stood aside and let his hand fall from her arm he couldnt read her couldnt pierce her thoughts she stepped from the pier inside the aircraft castrolami had had to stifle the urge to shove her the last metre but it had not been necessary he showed the boarding cards and a woman led them into business class then to the front row where no other passengers would need to pass them and look at their faces the door was closed the engines gained power she had her belt fastened arent you going to ask me how i feel whether i am strong he shook his head then turned his face away and closed his eyes as their speed on the runway gathered he put the phone down gave the order of confirmation operation partenope was named after the siren woman who seduced men having lured them on to rocks and then killed them and who had ultimately failed and had committed suicide by drowning and who lay in a paupers grave if mythology were believed among the sunk foundations of the buildings between the via solitaria and the via chiatamone operation parthenope had legs and ran the prosecutor eased his hand off the receiver and saw that his palm had left a sweat sheen on it he believed he presided over the dismantling of a clan it would be he could predict an opportunity for a minister in rome to speak of a blow of the greatest significance to the heart of the citys criminal activities if it worked well he would receive a congratulatory message from the minister he could reflect on a durable heart because many times central government had claimed such blows against it and on the columns of men and women in patrol cars and riot wagons leaving the yards behind the questura and piazza dante in london more officers and guns would be moving into position to arrest the eldest brother it was synchronised choreographed the silence fell over the room they must wait he was brought coffee he pictured now the columns of vehicles snaking across the city routes would have been worked out so that they seemed to head away from target locations then swing back giving minimal warning of their approach and only now inside the cars and wagons would the officers know who they moved against the prosecutor hated the lack of trust was shamed by it he regarded it as the single most impressive creation of the clans at about this time in the evening the curtain would have been rising for the second act of the opera a mozart for which he had begged tickets from a cousin he had cried off in midafternoon and his wife had sighed and said she would find someone else to take with her he was marginally disappointed to miss the performance opera soothed him he believed fervently that whatever hours he worked at the palace he must enjoy something of life beyond silence was good because words at a moment such as this were inadequate she was said to be strong mario castrolamis verdict and she would need to be if the arrest programme was successful a battering ram broke open the street door forcing the lock a small boy reared on extravaganzas of videoscreen warfare watched bigeyed in fascination what he played at was happening he was across the street had a vantagepoint between two parked cars and was almost hidden by a lamppost he watched the uniformed guy with the ram step aside and a charge of blackclad police plunged through the broken door the boy recognised the firearms they carried in hackney east london they were on display often enough if he had had a friend with him he would have been able to report that the men were from the specialist firearms team co that they had heckler amp koch machine pistols and glock mm handguns and one at the back had a taser immobiliser now he heard wood splintering oaths frantic shouting then quiet up on the first floor a policeman drew the curtain denying the child a clear view into the lit room he didnt have to wait long the prisoner was hustled into the doorway out on to the step then brought fast down the flight to the pavement the boy knew him all the kids of his age knew vincenzo vinny to them his sister too they ran messages for vinny the italian would take a piece of paper to the other side of hackney up to seven sisters or south to hoxton a tiny scrap of cigarette paper that was folded up smaller than the bittendown nail on the childs little finger they were paid for taking messages this boy and all the boys knew the italian as a gangster of style real life and bigger than in the games they played in the arcades and on their machines they idolised vinny but were never close to his sister she wasnt there only him there was a moment when he could see so clearly vinnys face the streetlight he was under threw enough illumination to reach across the street and the blue lamp was circling on a police car plenty of light fell on vinnys face magnificent fuckin fantastic the child thought then the police gloves black leather came down on top of vinnys head and pushed him into the car handcuffs on his wrists had seen them as vinny was brought down the steps from the broken door but not a mark on his face there were no cuts on his mouth or round his eyes and his shirt wasnt ruffled the boy understood to fight would have been pathetic scum would have fought the child reckoned he knew about gangsters and had no ambition in his life but to have the status and stature of vinny the italian if he had fought they would have belted him like they did the big black guy bouncer at the club off kingsland road it had taken eight pigs to get him down and then theyd kicked shit out of him and more he caught vinnys eye the child was nine but thought himself the friend of vinny the big man from naples that was somewhere way down south in that moment he was certain that the italian gave him the slightest nod of recognition then a policeman was in front of him telling him go and get fucking lost kiddo the car had gone down the street and the guys in black were spilling out down the steps from the main door it was a big mans cool a top mans that he didnt fight and didnt get himself thugged the child thought that naples wherever it was was a prize place if it was where vinny had come from proud not frightened ignoring all the guns round him and going at his own pace into the back of the car he wondered where the sister was and whether she would go in the cage with her brother the car had gone round the corner at the end of the street headed he thought for lower clapton road and the hackney police station the policeman was blocking his view of the front door so he got fucking lost but only to the corner there he sat on a low wall near to the kentucky fried chicken place hed wait there for the sister to come and warn her not to go in the cage a window exploded out and glass crashed down into the street which was enough to tilt eyes upwards heads were already craning at the blocks front door where carabinieri in protective gear stood guard a flashlight was aimed up three storeys and locked on to the window the man appeared and screamed the crowd knew who the carabinieri had come for in that narrow street spanning the top end of forcella and the southern extremity of the sanita labyrinth they all knew who giovanni was before the first of the attack wave had levered themselves out of the wagon and sprinted for the door on the warning of their approach the street had been blocked with boxes cartons from shops pallets from building sites rubbish and debris gas canisters were loaded in the barrels of some of the rifles confronting the crowd of local people and plastic baton round launchers were aimed at them the second wave had had to negotiate a storm of abuse and when the crowd had heard the door broken down above them the first rocks had been thrown at the men in the cordon there was a gasp he was naked his body glistened giovanni had screamed but now he swung clear of the window evaded a heavy gloved fist that attempted to grab his arm reached out and caught the downpipe from the gutter his legs hung free and the crowd saw the hair between them at the trunk a halfbrick arced up and reached the broken window the crowd heard the oath of a casualty it was encouragement the fugitive slithered up the pipe then took hold of the old ironwork guttering and the two nearest stanchions rocks and cobblestones apples potatoes melons rained against the carabinieri at the entrance and at the window where arms attempted to grab giovanni obvious hed been in the shower as he sought to lever himself on to the gentle slope of the tiles high above the streetlights the beam still held him and there were flashes from a score of mobile phones his genitalia wobbled danced girls screamed mothers giggled and old women shrieked happy obscenities it was a huge effort but he succeeded giovanni lifted a leg high and lodged his foot on the tiles then he was up and standing at shouts from below he turned and saw the blackclad carabinieri on the roof ridge then he would have known he was as trapped as if he had stayed in the shower cubicle or his bedroom he ripped out a single tile and threw it viciously twohanded at the hunters it was theatre and the crowds participation in the performance was demanded forgotten the pizzo taken from every shopkeeper every small man trying to build a business the extortion that robbed them forgotten the conceit and bullying by the son of a clan leader forgotten the weeping mothers wives sweethearts sisters of those slaughtered to create discipline giovanni borelli had milked the moment they had him his wrists were wrenched behind his back and handcuffed who ruled here one carabinieri vehicle was overturned and torched before they brought him out three volleys of the plastic baton rounds were fired and a dozen gas canisters men in full riot gear the masks distorting their faces used their clubs to batter a passageway to a vehicle with mesh over its windows by then they had found boxer shorts for giovanni borelli the scugnizzi the urchin kids of the street the watchers couriers and wallet thieves cavorted near to the burning truck giovanni was driven away more gas was fired but with him gone the anger fled show over it was said that within an hour half of the kids on the north side of forcella and the south side of sanita had transferred the image of the naked giovanni borelli to their mobiles screens and that the penis hair and testicles were in good focus he was if briefly a hero a police team from the squadra mobile knocked at the door of the old couples apartment when it was opened they stood back respectfully as if apologising and carmine borelli stepped aside and allowed them to pass him the detectives wore their own clothes roughwear garments their jeans were faded some torn and ragged at the knees their sneakers had not been cleaned and their tshirts were sweatstreaked and creased they had on also lightweight plastic tops with polizia emblazoned across the chest and holsters that pulled down their belts carmine borelli founder of the clan was treated with deference the detectives used the mat inside the door to wipe their feet before they went further inside and in the living room ducked their heads to anna borelli who sat and sewed and watched television a hundredcentimetrewide screen that dominated the small room the sound turned high she did not acknowledge them and kept her eyes on the needle he was given respect because he was of the old guard of clan leaders his fortune had been founded in the weeks after the allies had reached the city in the autumn of when a mercato nero had run free its profits from trading in every commodity that commanded a price had been huge it was long ago and actuality was blurred pimping prostitution the corruption of medication the purchase of politicians the killing of rivals the theft of funds sent by the military government for the restoration of utilities were unknown to these young detectives who saw a humble bent old man in a cardigan a faded shirt and trousers with scuffed leather sandals he was in his eightyeighth year and his marriage to anna had been celebrated and consummated sixtyeight years earlier together they had chased money and tracked power and he was asked where his youngest grandson was silvio was brought from his bedroom and was not handcuffed now his grandmother discarded her needlework rose stiffly from her chair and smoothed his hair the detectives took him down the flight of stairs from the apartment carmine and anna had lived there since their wedding day and it was furnished in the fashion of four decades past to the lobby on the ground floor the door was closed quietly by the last detective to leave there was no riot carmine borelli was as good as his word a crowd was outside now and resentful murmurs eddied the police stood nervously defensively around their vehicles and the outer door with gas loaded and baton rounds the grandfather came to the window he opened it wide pushed back the shutters and his arms were out as if he were papa the place was piazza san pietro and it was the sabbath he made a calming gesture with his gnarled hands his word in forcella carried weight and had done since american troops had released him from a cell in the poggioreale gaol after he had told the intelligence officer that he was a political prisoner a youthful but implacable enemy of mussolinis fascism he did not wish a disturbance outside his home because it might aggravate his wifes heart condition the scugnizzi were denied their hour they let the rocks drop to the cobbles and put the fire bombs petrol in cocacola bottles in shop doorways not even they feral and wild would ignore the demand of carmine borelli silvio was driven away his hair was in place and no missiles were thrown or gas fired when they had gone and the street had emptied carmine borelli leaned against the livingroom wall his jaw jutted his face was set and the blood drained from his bitten lips he knew and anna knew that they couldnt use a telephone but must wait for news how great was the attack on the clan his family she had the shop its owner and contents to herself in the salon below the piazza dei martiri gabriella borelli was queen it was in the folklore of the family that she had spent sixty thousand euros on dresses chosen purchased and carried away on the afternoon that her husband had stalked confronted and shot a man from the piazza garibaldi who had ambitions to reach into forcella also in the folklore of the family but not talked of was the stacking of the boxes containing the dresses in a lockup garage for a full halfyear before pasquale had decided it safe for her to wear such expensive clothes at a hotel south of sorrento where under false names he had taken her the obvious shops for her to visit the most exclusive in the city were down the hill from the piazza dei martiri in the via calabritto where there were the outlets for valentino prada damiani gucci and louis vuitton and shoes from alberto guardini but she preferred a smaller street behind the via calabritto she was of course one of the wealthiest women in the city and had control of sums in excess of half a billion euros price was immaterial to gabriella borelli what mattered to her more was that she could not drive a topoftherange mercedes sports to capodichino book a first class air ticket to gran canaria stay at a hotel with a hundred luxury rooms take a suite then soak up the sun during the day dance in the evening and strip for the night in a kingsize bed with pasquale or it was not possible she stood in her underwear brassiere and knickers in front of the fulllength mirror and held up to her the dresses and pirouetted letting the music a string quartet waft over her she had no stake in the shop minor or major could have bought it outright and not noticed the price the family owned hotels apartments timeshare blocks offices and many shops however it was more satisfactory to have a straightforward commercial arrangement to buy clothes even if they were seldom on her back those she didnt like too small or tight too revealing for her age she threw on the floor the owner could pick them up smooth and rehang them those she liked she laid across a chair she could have had any of the dresses she tried which were a genuine label from paris milan or london manufactured for her exact imitations in the sweatshops on the slopes of vesuvio the little factories hidden among villages on the slopes were the responsibility of her eldest son vincenzo she yearned for vincenzo more than she did for her husband suffered from her inability to talk to him to hear his certainties in fact she purchased the label not the dress it was an escape for her discarded dresses lay on the carpet but she had chosen four perhaps one more would go on the chair she was normally a middleaged woman scurrying alone on the streets or driving a small car with plates that showed it to be old there were the boxes in the lockup garage and more in a basement and she had had an airconditioning system fitted in a cellar behind the duomo where more clothes were stored unworn and in three of the safehouses she flitted between there were wardrobes filled with dresses skirts light jackets and blouses the escape was to dream and dream alone the money the clan had accumulated brought power influence control and authority but the opportunity to pamper herself was remote she smiled cheerfully and the owner clucked with enthusiasm the dress was turquoise not so close round her waist as to accentuate the first traces of flab neither a tarts dress nor a matrons it covered her knees it would have looked well on her daughter immacolata it was the first time that day she had thought of her it would have fitted immacolata but she wouldnt have chosen it there were girls at the heart of the contini clan the misso clan and the lo russo clan who would have worn that dress turned heads and stopped conversations but not her dull dreary immacolata she held the dress up to her and the owner with skill gave a small squeal and clapped her hands gabriella borelli turned the full circle then laid it on the chair with the others she didnt know when she would wear it she saw herself made up with jewellery from strong boxes in two of the safehouses or the diamonds kept for her by the few she could depend on as she walked on the young mans arm past the small orchestra the restaurant manager grovelling a greeting and was taken to the best table above her was the suite and in the suite was the kingsize bed and the young man who admired the turquoisesilk dress was a telephone rang she felt a chill and shivered she recognised that call tone it had no romance no style was not stolen from an opera aria or something popular it was piercing like a cars alarm brief then silence she turned her back on the clothes and went to the chair where her coat and bag were salvatore had that number the young man who and umberto the lawyer long used by the family it was for times of emergency a text message waited three run four run bravo five boxes twelve walk block alpha she studied the text memorised and deleted it she said to the owner that she would call for the dresses she had chosen and would then settle the account the owner was at pains to indicate that settlement was a small matter and should not concern the signora gabriella borelli left the shop the way she had come through the staff area past the toilets and the storeroom then went out into the street through a reinforced door she waited she listened she looked from a corner for a loose cordon for men who lounged and smoked or sat in parked cars the text messages she sent and received on her mobile were always coded three was giovanni four was silvio and run was arrested she was bravo and boxes were safehouses that had been hit twelve was salvatore and walk meant still at liberty while block alpha told her where he would be and at what time she was a woman in a dowdy coat because the chill came in from the sea with the evening and slipped among shadows dreams had been curtailed and an escape cut short fuck giovanni and fuck silvio if five of her safehouses had been hit searched then the security of the clan on which she prided herself was split open how was it possible almost not quite fear held her the pictures came on the screen there were digital images of vincenzo borelli in the custody suite at a london police station full face and profile they were replaced by a photograph of giovanni borelli being brought out of a door wearing only boxer shorts an officer behind him carried a bundle of clothing the youngest silvio walked meekly appearing confused between two towering men the locations followed the individuals a sequence of smasheddown doors succeeded by an interior of a living room or bedroom the deputy prosecutor unable to mask his disappointment said we have the three cubs but not the vixen we were given five safehouse addresses have hit each of them but she wasnt there possessions yes recent clothes down to dirty ones yes jewellery not put away yes she was due back at one of them i suppose we have to query the tactic of overt hits the liaison officer smarted we agreed on simultaneous strikes and and we do not have salvatore il pistole we were given five locations for the vixen and couldnt have delayed the lift the liaison officer was prepared to rebut any criticism of the operation which he had overseen the deputy prosecutor maybe from frustration or tiredness or from the simple matter of dashed expectations snarled you had a free hand they were your decisions where is she under your leadership we were the gadarene swine in a headlong dash perhaps and i say this with all charity a calmer approach and surveillance stakeouts might well we had to act in concert the prosecutor thwacked a fist on his desk if were divided we lose i believe well have the mother within hours the plane is now i estimate thirty minutes away well push the girl harder the prosecutor reckoned it was not his optimism that won a truce in the recriminations but his mention of immacolata borelli they had all been in the room when the tape was played and her tinny voice with traffic noise surging across it had told them a plain truth it is my intention to collaborate by saying that on the telephone to you i put my life at risk the voice the memory of it might have shamed the protagonists the deputy prosecutor shrugged and the liaison officer went for water they were all thinking of her the prosecutor decided and the enormity of what she had done he was offered a biscuit but waved away the plate he said i dont know how but well have the vixen two and a quarter hours of street tramping and failure fortune did not shine on eddie deacon he had started so brightly full of hope and anticipation when he had reached the street corner to which he had brought her from the pub there she had slipped her hand off his arm grinned waved and wandered down the street under the streetlamps she hadnt looked back he had stood on one corner and she had disappeared round another he had never been back always his mac had turned up on time punctual as a digital clock he knew only that she had turned off to her left he had stood there and had seen a pretty much main route with bus stops and smaller streets going off to right and left there were shops with flats above there were smart little residential roads where professionals from the city or the law courts had come with their polish builders and there were bollards at the end to stop ratrunners and twockers there were streets where there seemed to be more bell buttons on a pad by the front entrance than windows she might have gone to a highgrade road or to a couple of rooms above a launderette or a travel agent what to do he could hardly stop anyone he saw going about their business excuse me have you seen an italian girl in this streetroad we have this big thing but she never gave me an address or a phone number and she stood me up for a meal in the afghan up kingsland road do you know where i can find her he had walked had been into pakistanirun shops that sold everything and takeaways that did chicken or curries and at first he had shyly shown the photograph he kept in his wallet but for the last two hours he had just walked peering into every young womans face and found that he was doubling back on himself he went past a doorway edwardian set in london brick between a turkish bank and a charity shop both had been open when hed gone by the first time but now they were closed and showed only security lights a pair of police stood outside a regular officer and a community support girl he remembered now that the door was covered with tacked hardboard his feet hurt but not as much as his mind he kept seeing her every time a girl materialised round a corner off a bus out of a shop into the throw of a streetlight eddie deacon stared her out worst was when he had run after a girl had seen the swing of the hips the straight back the chuck of hair over a shoulder had caught her gone in front of her damn near blocking her on the pavement and shed been reaching into her handbag could have been a nail file a personal alarm or even a pepper spray when he had seen the spectacles he had apologised grovelling had just about scraped the knees of his jeans on the pavement she had walked on after one glance that measured him up as a sad thing or maybe a lowlife pervert he stopped everybody watched policemen everybody pretended policemen standing on the first step of a flight were interesting and doubly interesting when the door was opened two men came out with filled plastic bags and put them into the back of an unmarked van then went back inside so interesting and it rested his feet which hurt bad he looked down at them and noticed the glow beside his legs the kid smoked eddie deacon thought he was about ten but the face was too near the pavement for him to make out the features he sat on the kerb and his feet were in the gutter he couldnt have been seen by the police across the street the kid asked if he was looking for vinny he said he wasnt it was just good to stop walking and rest his feet was he looking for vinny the italian he heard a tremor of worship in the kids voice as if he was talking about a footballer eddie deacon took a deep breath and told the kid he was looking for a girl an italian girl then he had his wallet out and bent down with it the kid struck a match and eddie showed him the photo shes immacolata the kid said reedy then coughed and flicked away his cigarette shes vinnys sister theres filth here they took vinny and i stayed to warn her if she came so they didnt lift her they put a girls bag and clothes in the van then i heard them talking and one said to a sergeant who came in a car that her bag was for shipping home to her that was all he thanked the kid it was an afterthought but he asked him if hed still be there later something of yours in that place something important he said there might be then i have to get inside was he a friend of immacolata he was a good friend he thought so did you shag her eddie deacon looked at the kid crouched on the ground his shoulder level with eddies knees he said quietly not your business important maybe how do i get inside god youd know wouldnt you i would too he tried to sound authoritative then youd better take me a smile slashed the kids face and eddie saw it when another match was struck and cigarette lit he was told to give it a couple of hours then come back and that it would cost him he had no doubt that the kid would have the skills to break into a property that had a police guard on the front step salvatore felt her tremble he had not known gabriella borelli madrina leader of the clan show fear but she shook and couldnt stifle it he held her close to him and the warmth came off her body one arm was close round her shoulders and the other round the small of her back she was twice his age she was the most feared woman in the city he could feel the straps of her underwear and she would have felt the hardness against her belly he could have pushed aside her coat lifted her skirt pulled down the panties then flicked his own zip and hitched her up so that her arms were round his neck could have leaned her back against a wall and gone into her had he it would have been sad the stupidest action of his life against a wall of old brick put up by craftsmen centuries before to have fucked a madrina while her husband was in gaol in the north and subject to article bis would have condemned him already salvatore il pistole was a marked man and could live with it if he fucked gabriella borelli he was a dead man and walking nowhere and yet he let a hand worm round from her back along the top of the pelvis let it slide down and heard her breath quicken and yet he was not stupid he kissed her lightly on the forehead at the hairline and eased back from her he thought could not see in the darkness that she clenched her fists and maybe drove the nails into the soft palms he was glad then that he had backed off first her face would have hardened and her jaw would be out the moment body against body juices aroused heat rising would not be referred to again she would show no sign in the future of that intimacy neither would he he thought she would have been a good fuck better than the daughter salvatore knew that if ever she believed he was conceited enough to think he had any hold over her she would destroy him she touched his arm it seemed to acknowledge a moment of weakness that was now stamped on bagged disposed of she said they have searched five addresses i use who knew five of my addresses no cheek no attempt to joke i did he knew she would consider him as much of a suspect as anyone else she had the ability to detach herself analyse and act it was not necessary to bluster innocence to her who else the wall behind her was high dwarfing them and above it was the certosa di san martino of the fourteenth century and behind the monastery the fortress of santelmo whose first stones had been laid eight hundred years before that he was in the deep shadow of two of the most remarkable buildings in a city that was itself a miracle of history did not impress the clans principal killer he had one boast only he would never be taken alive coming after him were the police detectives and the ros investigators the families and associates of those he had killed on the instructions of the borelli clan and if he rose too fast that clan would destroy him he had been found and taken in hand by pasquale when he was a scugnizzo the padrino had lifted him off the street where he thieved conned and tricked for food and money no family to care for him and created a ladder of advancement for him to climb he had done streetcorner spotting who came into forcella what was their business and where they went messagerunning with tiny scraps of paper sealed in plastic and secreted in body orifices and had given out beatings when monies due were not paid when he was eighteen pasquale identifying talent where he could find it had put the p into his smooth hand had driven him to a disused quarry beyond acerra and let him fire two magazines at rusty cans a week later he had been given his first living walking breathing spitting cursing target he had money and status and wouldnt see his thirtieth birthday which he accepted he would be dead and would not have at his last breath a regret all the brothers they knew he had taken instructions from vincenzo before his flight to london but always after a moment had elapsed as if clarifying that his obedience was considered not automatic and instructions from giovanni only if they were prefaced with my mother says he was contemptuous of silvio and had never received an instruction from him it did not cross his mind that he should include the sister now gone eight months with the brothers in having knowledge of the safehouses yes and who else did carmine and anna borelli know the addresses her father and motherinlaw might have known two of the five three at maximum not all did umberto know the lawyer used by the family for more than thirty years was now elderly run to obesity and looked a fool a pompous one but his intellect was sharper than any other city lawyers he was skilled in the manipulation of court processes the transfer of monies while they were rinsed clean and the avoidance of surveillance umberto perhaps was a more significant aide to the clan than salvatore the killer she thought briefly then replied that the lawyer might have known two addresses no more did pasquale know she did not dismiss it her body seemed to stiffen tighten then a coil was loosened she relaxed she said that however desperate her husband was to regain his freedom he wouldnt dare to betray her and he would have known three addresses but not five he shrugged had no more to offer he took out a small pocket torch and flashed it three times down the lane he heard the response the gunning of a scooter engine it came forward no lights shown did she want to be taken somewhere she shook her head decisively who now to trust she walked away he thought her wealth could have provided her with a bentley a maserati or a porsche a driver in uniform and a guard to protect her the scooter came up and collected him the lights were flicked on and he saw her trudging the other way along the rough track that would bring her out on the corso vittorio emanuele he didnt know where she would head for but he reckoned it an hours fast walking to get back to forcella and sanita he sat astride the pillion slapped his man on the shoulder he called him fangio and they powered away he did not look down from the track at the beauty of the bay and the reflections on the sea from ships lamps and portholes or up at the illuminated ramparts of the castle he let his mind scratch at the problem who had betrayed the clan who had earned death not the fast death of the p but slow stretched death who the aircraft landed hit hard she reached out instinct as the wheels bounced and the aircraft seemed to fly again then the impact was repeated her hand took his the fingers did not close on hers and there was no comfort from them then she realised castrolami thought nothing of her and had no concern whether she was terrified on landing or not they taxied turned idled and then with a last lurch the aircraft braked and was still a ripple of applause shimmered behind them it had not been a smooth flight with turbulence over southern france then powerful crosswinds as they had descended on fiumicino and the landing had been rough immacolata borelli did not join in she had only once while they were in the air left her seat then she had gone to the toilets in front of business and had changed into the few new clothes she had been permitted to buy she had washed her face and hands and had looked at herself in the mirror she had tried to smile and could not she had returned to her seat castrolami had not spoken to her she thought he reckoned it enough that he had her on the plane out of british jurisdiction and on her way to italy home he hadnt asked if she was comfortable if she was hungry if she wanted a drink or a magazine he had scribbled on a pad might have been his report or his expenses and she thought his socks smelled worse in the cabin than they had in the car she heard behind her a stampede she had expected that she would have to wait castrolami squeezed his bulk past her no apology stood in the aisle and successfully blocked any passenger wanting to shortcut through business to the forward door then he flicked his fingers as if he had called a dog she didnt move heard the flick of the fingers again louder more insistent and closer to her ear sat didnt shift the hand came down the one she had clutched when the plane hit caught her coat and yanked her up her waist snagged on the belt still fastened his other hand came across her thighs almost groping her and opened the catch she thought he wouldnt have noticed where his hand had been she stood she saw that two stewardesses and a purser eyed her almost stripped her it was obvious that she was a fugitive returning no sympathy no clemency she had been offered a rug for her knees and had declined it also earphones for the stereo the trolley had come with newspapers corriere messaggero and repubblica and shed said she didnt want one a few remarks only and she wondered if they were sufficient for the cabin crew to know she was neapolitan if she was from naples and in custody she was a camorrista she understood then that few shoulders would offer her a place to weep he had reached into his pocket and produced a pair of dark glasses he handed them to her the lights were poor in the cabin and outside it was late evening she shook her head castrolami said maybe theres a photographer how do i know when i have no control over it what the securitys like im off my patch maybe this place leaks maybe your name is out you want to make it easier for them put them on and turn up your coat collar i dont want you dead signorina she put on the glasses and pulled up the collar so that it half covered her cheeks she thought was not certain because his voice was only a murmur that he added not before weve had you in court and testifying he took her arm led her out through the door and on to the pier then down a flight of side steps into the night two cars waited and men had submachine guns the rear door of the lead car was open for her fingers lay on trigger guards she was from a clan family and couldnt play at ignorance and she understood the reaction towards a traitor and knew their fate she attempted to bring to mind marianna rossettis face the last time she had seen it without the ravages of leukaemia immacolata borelli had completed the first stage of her journey home she dropped her head sank on to the back seat and the crackle of radios was around her as she was driven away music played at one cafe and the last stages of a soccer game were on a television at the other lukas was about halfway between the soccer and the music and had yesterdays herald tribune in front of him with a monthold copy of match most evenings when he was in paris he walked down the rue de bellechasse and on to the rue st dominique there he would pause outside the building with the double gate wide enough for a carriage and pair to go through and he would take a moment under the plaque to consider the life and work of j b dumas chimistesecretaire perpetuel de lacademie des sciences and note a date carved in the stone that put recognition of this man at years ago it was important for lukas to stop for those few seconds break his evening walk to the bar le bellechasse the drop cafe or the cafe des deux musees because then he placed matters in his life into a correct perspective one that he could manage to be alongside there would be no plaque erected in kabul or baghdad up in the forests of the midwest or in the triplecanopy jungle high in the cordillera central east of cali for a coordinator who made the judgement weighed lives and deaths between the arguments of the negotiators and the stormsquad commanders nobody would read a plaque naming lukas sometimes a saviour and sometimes a killer federal bureau of investigation and lately of ground force security london lukas did not rate himself important enough to warrant a plaque he thought them good people who served in the cafes and bars he patronised they were ordinary people who would not know of the situations that confronted him when he worked it was better not to bring back to paris with him in his rucksack the situations and knifeedges on which he operated if business was slack they talked to him about the concerns and excitements of ordinary people and did not push for entry into his life his unexplained absences or pry and they brought him beer and he gave them tips in midsummer and before christmas he paid always for what was brought to him unless the patron came with the drink they could all set agendas and choose the subjects had free range except one area he would steer the talk away from sons he didnt welcome chatter about the triumphs and failures of sons it was an area of pain suppressed not shared and he managed the deflection with subtle skill in the bars and cafes wiling away the evening hours he never drank so that his mind clouded the telephone in the apartment could ring at any time and activate the voicemail there was agitation at the far end of the bar his name was called by a whiteaproned waiter and he was told that the game had gone to penalty kicks and he should come for the death throes but he smiled shook his head stayed in his chair and nursed his beer tomorrow he thought he would go to the museums first the musee dorsay and then that of the legion if the telephone had not rung and no message had been left the kid hissed no lights only the torch and no torch till the curtains are done eddie deacon could honestly have said that never in his life had he done anything that warranted the intervention of the police maybe he was a bit drunk sometimes on a friday or saturday night rolling along the street and using a lamppost as a crutch but he hadnt done anything that required an officer to get stuck into him it didnt make him special just ordinary if a policemans torch had lit him now it would have been handcuffs the back of a wagon and a cell door slamming the kid had asked for fifty they had haggled he had settled for thirty eddie thought the kid might be as young as nine newspapers he glanced at in the staff room carried interminable features on the spread of hooligans on the capitals streets thirty pounds had been passed and to make it up eddie had had to empty a pocket and dig up pound and fiftypence coins it was big money to him but he didnt think it was highvalue work to the kid he rather liked him they had gone to the parallel street at the back the kid had led and eddie had followed there was a locked iron gate at the side of a fourhouse terrace and the kid had unfastened the lock as if it was easier than opening a toothpaste tube they had edged along a garden while inside a baby cried and a television played and eddie had been helped over the end wall they had dropped down into a yard filled with sodden cardboard cartons that would have come from the shop alongside the steps to the door used by immacolata and her brother next up a drainpipe using a dumped stool to get clear of the ground then a window ledge the kid used a penknife on the window while eddie tottered beside him the kid was surefooted and showed no fear the window was levered up and a small thin arm width of a broomstick came down a hand took eddies and wrenched it through the gap funny thing when the small hand took his weight eddie never doubted that he was safe what he liked about the kid was his sheer anarchy didnt do arithmetic as nine or tenyearolds should but did burglary didnt do joinedup writing and reading aloud but did housebreaking and smiled wasnt sourfaced but had an openness and a sense of untamed rebellion about him that were captivating they stood statue still in the darkened room listened and heard nothing then the window was closed and the kid said still a treble voice his friend vinny had boasted that a new alarm system had been installed had cost a grand that the system couldnt be interfered with by an intruder the kid said shrill whisper that the system was shit and hed gone into the apartment by this route disabled it and brought out a leathercovered filofax by way of proof and carried it to the trattoria where vinny ate his pizza eddie hadnt understood how the circuits could be blocked but vinny had he had given the kid fifty pounds the kid worshipped vinny only when he was talking about him did the anarchy light go out of his eyes he had looked away just once not done eyeballtoeyeball when eddie had asked what work was vinny in the kid had said business and looked away eddie remembered how he had been at that age guarded protected supervised bred on a wishlist of ambition and success and damn near frightened of his own shadow the curtain was drawn a palmsized hand torch was passed to him is it in her room the kid asked he nodded the kid took his arm and took him across what he now realised was a spare room storeroom into a central corridor and then the living area the torch beam raked it it was chaotic every drawer was out and upturned the contents on the carpet every cushion was off the chairs and dumped pictures hung at wild angles and eddie thought theyd been shifted to see if they concealed anything the magazines had been opened and dropped he asked confused why it had been done the kid told him matteroffact that there must have been a problem with the vat then he repeated that he had heard police talk of the girl immacolata who had gone back to italy her bag to follow the kitchen was more chaos plates scattered saucepans on the floor or in the sink refrigerator left open sachets of pasta sauce slit as if they might have concealed something the kid now amplified explanations and eddie made out an exaggerated wink when he was told that people in business sometimes forgot what vat they owed eddie didnt use his brain to analyse then challenge the kid seemed to glide over what was on the floor but eddie didnt he kicked a china cup and heard it disintegrate glass crunched under his feet then the small hand was tugging him and he was facing a closed door shes lovely isnt she vinnys sister leave it did you really do it with her shag her i used to watch her i was out the back and her room light would be on maybe she didnt think anyone was there i used to you know when she was taking them off i did he didnt think of the kid as a dirtyraincoat man or a voyeur they all did it at his house with a few beers taken he and his friends had lined up to see across the garden to an upstairs window he wasnt proud of himself but didnt reckon it a hanging offence eddie thought that here at least the precocious adulthood of the kid came up short wouldnt have had sex not at nine or ten he was let into the room the door had been locked and no key in it but the kid opened it with a fast movement and eddie didnt see whether he used a hairpin or a plastic card he could smell her not your concern her perfume scent and slight body odour mingled to smell her hurt him like a kick sharp on his shin the first thing that eddie deacon realised was that the room was only untidy it had not been searched the wardrobe doors were open but the dresses blouses and skirts were on the hangers and the drawers were not dragged open tipped out he hurried to the window drew the curtains and switched on the torch it was a single bed unmade the duvet pulled towards the pillow but not straightened and smoothed he let the beam sweep the room he knew what he was looking for had not promised it to himself but had hoped he was disappointed he had wanted to find a photo frame on the little pine table beside the bed on the chest or the bookcase to the left of the window with a picture of himself inside it he set to work nothing in the room shouted that immacolata borelli was the lover of eddie deacon his own room on the other side of dalston had the blowup image of her and her dressinggown which she put on when she came off the bed and went to make tea or coffee or to bring him a beer he had precious little money each week after hed paid the rent and presents for her were his definition of mild extravagance but the last thing had been a scarf silk a sale in regent street price slashed and shed said it was wonderful he found it in the top right drawer of the chest he had been three four minutes in the room when the kid came to the door he made a sucked sharp whistle as if he wanted to be gone as yet eddie had found nothing there were three more drawers in the chest on the left side he went through them faster as the kid watched nothing nothing in the pockets of clothes in the wardrobe nothing in the drawer of the bedside table the kid came further into the room snatched away the torch as if that were his right and shone the light into a wastepaper bin picked it up and tipped it out eddie saw a ripped packet for tights the wrapper from a tube of strong mints two or three squashed paper handkerchiefs a torn blouse shredded brown paper that might have been used on a small parcel and a plastic tray for sweet biscuits with italian markings the kid bent and sifted through what was on the carpet he gave a scrap to eddie about all there is eddie deacon held a piece of jagged paper the tear running through a handwritten address not the destination where the tear was to the right there were four scrawled lines on the top line was elli below it was cella under that line was at the bottom was poli he was trying to decipher it when the torch beam was cut he was led as if he were the child out of the room and the lock was refastened they went on tiptoe across the debris on the livingroom floor to a window facing out on to the street he was gestured to look down there were two police officers on the front step rubbing their hands and talking quietly he realised then the quality of the kids anarchy they went as silently as they had come down the drainpipe across the yard and over the wall through a garden and a side gate supposedly fastened then out on to a lit street all tarted up this one signs in the window proclaimed neighbourhood security cooperation and alarm boxes winked lights the kid turned to him dont give me any shit about what they call love its all because shes a great shag yes he wondered if one day the kid might learn what was shit and what was something else but was not confident of it and he thought the boy didnt want to hear about the pain of separation the hurt of his mac going out of his life about fighting heart and soul to win back the one person in his world he could not be without he had the scrap of paper in his pocket and knew where he would take it the kid at nine or ten was riddled with cynicism and love hadnt reached him why disabuse a great shag eddie deacon said they did high fives whacked their hands together and he watched the kid walk off just a kid but with a bounce and a roll in his stride there was the flash of a match and a wisp of smoke curled away from his face couldnt help himself eddie deacon called shes fantastic the light for me thank you for helping me shes more important to me than anything if the kid heard he gave no sign of it but kept going towards the corner daft to have confided that to an urchin a thief but it was heartfelt she stood by the window full length with a sliding door that led to the balcony the nightdress bought in london was shorter than she had thought thinner and hung tight on her she had no slippers sandals or flipflops so immacolata was barefoot on the marble flooring she assumed that any of the penthouse apartments in such a block in such a location would have a veneer of marble in the living room the sun was up just above the distant mountain range she didnt know rome had been there once with her mother years before to stand on an easter sunday in the piazza san pietro and see the tiny faraway figure of the holy father so she had not recognised the route taken by the two cars as they had sped towards the centre then veered away crossed the river again and climbed a hill the headlights had speared up and caught pine branches no sirens and no blue lights nothing to indicate that the passenger in the lead car was a collaboratore di justizia was protected a pentita who would give evidence against her family in return for clemency an infame who would be despised in the streets where she had been reared she came unheralded and unannounced she had been hustled out of the car and the guns were there but under draped coats she had been bundled into the lift then almost pushed the few steps from the lift door into the penthouse she had been ignored at first by castrolami who was on his mobile shed heard him swear and eyed by the two men who were to mind her cold cuts of meat a salad fruit and cheese laid out on plates were taken from the refrigerator she was told nothing shown to a bedroom with an ensuite bathroom and had heard the door locked it was done quietly and she reckoned it was not intended that she should hear it a poor nights sleep almost nightmares when she did drift off able now to comprehend what she had done at half past six according to her watch she had heard the key turn in the lock shed gone into the living room the two men were up smartly dressed shirtsleeves and ties shoulderholster harnesses across their chests with weapons in case she had forgotten overnight she was told after the hope was expressed that she had enjoyed a satisfactory rest that their names were giacomo orecchia and alessandro rossi shed nodded then gone to the window she had intended to provoke them immacolata wore only the flimsy cotton nightdress white but with flowers at the collar and stood in front of the window as the sun came up over the rooftops towers and spires she eased her feet apart let her heels be half a metre separated she could feel through the pane that the sun already had the power to warm and would have lit the outline of her body it was not normal for immacolata borelli to glory in her body to use it as a tool or as a weapon she imagined the way the light silhouetted it then she turned it would have been their skill that they moved in silence neither watched her the younger was out through the door in the kitchen area and sat at a table looking at a newspaper he was rossi the older one orecchia was in a bedroom again with the door open smoothing a duvet and straightening a coverlet it had been for nothing her gesture she had flaunted her body to tease or confuse and it hadnt been noticed from the kitchen rossi would you like coffee signorina and we have panini or bread fruit and cheese some of it or all whatever did she care hardly i dont know orecchia said do you want some coffee before you dress or while youre still almost naked she met his eyes she realised then that he had taken a gamble with her that he could ridicule her showing he recognised the game she was playing and would not tolerate it so had laughed at her she flushed and twisted away from them so that neither would see through the flimsy material the curve of her bosom the cherrystone nipples or the hair above her thighs orecchia reached behind the bedroom door and his hand appeared with a heavy towelling robe he threw it at her it landed on the marble beside her so she had to bend to lift it up with an arm across her chest as she did so she slipped into the robe belittled and angry rossi called i make good coffee signorina and i bought the bread this morning while you slept my suggestion breakfast now dress afterwards then we have visitors and work she believed they were treating her as they would a spoiled child and seemed to have set guidelines they had not leered at her or been shocked by her they had with laidback politeness almost taken her legs off at the knees she stumbled across the marble bare feet slipping losing her poise to her bedroom door she showered found a small bar of soap there and a sachet of shampoo and she had her own washbag she barely allowed the water to run hot then was out and drying herself viciously she dressed new underwear the same outer clothing she had travelled in and left her hair damp she could smell the coffee and the warmed panini beyond the window there were similar blocks to the one she was in surrounded by high steel fences with sharp spikes the walls had broken glass embedded in concrete on the brickwork she saw a maid beating a carpet on a balcony and a man who wore only shorts on another was smoking and scratching his chest a woman watered her plants with a hose she did not belong in their world perhaps she belonged to no world her nakedness had been her attempt to take control of the void into which she had thrown herself she was as much a prisoner in that apartment as she would have been in a cell in the poggioreale gaol they might have read her signorina the coffee is ready bread and fruit are on the table signorina she went into the kitchen and sat with them rossi was the heavier and she imagined he worked out in a gym his arm muscles bulged in the short sleeves of his shirt he was cleanshaven and a little gel had gone on his hair she recognised the pistol in the holster as a beretta he poured her coffee orecchia pushed the fruit bowl towards her he would have been fifteen years the elder wiry thin and his shirt seemed a size too large and fell loose from his shoulders except where the holster harness trapped the fabric his tie was the more vivid he had a worn face had been there had done whatever had seen it she gulped coffee snatched up a roll and tore it into pieces rossi said signorina we are from the servizio centrale protezione under the authority of the interior ministry you will be given later a form in triplicate that you will read and sign by agreeing to the conditions laid down by us you commit yourself to obeying instructions and following the advice we will offer you are not a free agent you have made an agreement with the state and we expect you to honour it were a specialised team trained to handle and protect collaborators were not nannies chauffeurs psychiatrists or servants and most certainly were not friends it was your decision to be where you are today you were not under duress to take this course from us you can expect dedication and professionalism orecchia said it was not thought signorina that you needed a female officer attached to you there are very few those we have are allocated to women we consider inexperienced in the role of a pentita and the pressures that will inevitably be exerted i have read the file you are from a family high in the ranks of the organisedcrime clans in naples rossi we dont think youre fragile signorina orecchia as tough as the boot on an artisans foot rossi paused eyed her without charity or respect but his tone was as correct as if it had been taught on a course nothing about you signorina is unique youre one of many we have overseen we understand the psychological stresses you will endure you will believe you can escape from us go home walk on your own streets explain and be forgiven then forgotten theyll kill you signorina youll lie in the dirt of a street among dogs mess and rubbish and youll bleed a crowd will gather to stare at you and not one person will shed a tear of sympathy and you can put the scum where they belong in maximum security and under article bis and you can be born again you will not run from us orecchia scratched a mole on his nose he wore a wedding ring narrow and she wondered if he went home often and if when he was at home he told his wife the secrets of his work he spoke quietly and she had to lean across the mess of crumbs and orange peel to hear him in a few hours signorina it will be realised that you have collaborated become an infame and they will search for you alessandro has talked about a shot in the head fired from the pillion of a scooter as you walk a street in naples or rome or milan or genoa but hes told you the minimum to me from what i know its predictable that theyd wish before killing you to hurt you but youre of the borelli clan and you know what happens when a message is to be sent in the most recent killing the funeral is today the victims testicles were cut off and placed in his mouth then his head was cut off and placed in his groin that is reality were not bulletcatchers or human shields we know our trade well do all in our power to protect you she poured more coffee for herself slurped it the doorbell rang orecchia glanced at his watch was satisfied rossi took his hand off the pistol in the holster and went to the hall but orecchia stayed in front of her blocking a view of her from the archway linking the kitchen to the hall his hand did not leave the pistol in his holster immacolata was introduced to the prosecutor she had seen him many times before on most days his picture was in cronaca or il mattino or his image was broadcast on the local rai channel and he had been in court when she had seen her father brought in chains to the cage he was slighter than she had imagined his hair was thinner and his checks had the pallor of exhaustion she thought of the magnetism in her fathers eyes the way they mesmerised and captured attention ash stained the front of the prosecutors jacket and he dumped a heavy briefcase on the kitchen table he pulled out a file with her name and photograph on it she thought of the cemetery at nola the table was cleared she was told that the woman with the prosecutor was his personal assistant a taperecorder was laid on the table and wires were connected to a small microphone she noticed now that the plates and cups had been stacked in the sink and the guns had gone the taperecorder was switched on there were the briefest preliminaries immacolata kept the cemetery in her mind the statue of angelabella the screams directed at her the anger and the pain inflicted on her she started to talk gabriella borelli needed to work there had been la piccolina a decade earlier and before the little girl as maria licciardi was known there had been rosetta cutolo known as ice eyes in the city there had been carmela marzano and pupetta maresca all had been figures of consequence on the streets of naples as was gabriella borelli she had to work if she was to cling to the most important strand in the life of a woman who craved and valued the title la madrina which was power the gaining of it far outstripped the acquisition of money power came primarily from the ability to do successful deals she could not hide in an underground den as pasquale had been able to she needed meetings and to be at them without the clay of the countryside on her shoes or the dust of cementfloored bunkers on her skirt she was in the back room of a pizzeria on the northern side of the via foria one of the busiest streets in the city for traffic and pedestrians where noise and movement were constant overpowering and engulfing she had slept fitfully at the home of the mother of a man who drove cementmixing trucks for the clan had arrived on the doorstep had been admitted in time to see the midnight news on the local rai channel had seen tape of giovanni and silvio paraded past the ranks of the paparazzi an old monochrome picture of vincenzo had heard the mayor in front of the grand building on piazza municipio speak of a great blow against the heart of the evil of the criminal culture of the city she had been brought fruit and cheese and had been offered the womans big bed had declined and slept on a settee with her handbag on the floor beside her head the small pistol in it within easy reach it was the first time she had used that address as a refuge for a single night it would not have been known as a place of importance to her as were the safehouses that had been raided she understood that she had been betrayed from inside the clan but did not yet know by whom she had been gone early in the morning as the citys life returned and had walked to the pizzeria salvatore was outside the inner door she met with albanians they talked of the movement of girls none she demanded to be more than fourteen who would be taken from moldova overland to tirana then brought to the adriatic coast to be ferried by speedboat to a fishing village north of the italian port of bari then driven to naples she was firm on the price would not haggle she demanded also that the girls be made available for medical examination to prove virginity then stared at a dull ceiling light while they bickered among themselves she presumed they would have learned that she was a police and carabinieri frontline target that her organisation was in danger of being successfully dismantled and that they might believe she was vulnerable the matter of the girls was dealt with brusquely she continued with the agenda refined heroin the poppies from afghanistan the chemical from the laboratories of turkey then shipped from the balkans and montenegro to the port of naples the price of the heroin again no debate permitted she said what she would pay monies were agreed delivery dates accepted her meeting broke she shook their hands formally to bind the agreements she went out of the pizzerias front door on to the street she did not of course carry a diary everything was in her head meeting locations and times rendezvous points market prices the next meeting in another back room in a bar on the via arenaccia was to determine the volume of hardcore stone for the foundations of a new apartment block on cristoforo colombo then the amount of concrete required for the sixstorey construction the prices for the materials and the fee for the men in the municipio who would give permission to build it was a normal routine for gabriella borelli the sun was warm on her face she felt as if a winter frost thawed by the conclusion of the meeting the albanians had shown her the necessary respect she wondered if those who had guided them to the rendezvous had shown them a halfpage of yesterdays cronaca and translated a report on the death of a man in a street the meal made of his testicles she walked briskly salvatore il pistole behind her and felt she had regained control they broke the recorder was switched off and a new tape inserted the prosecutors assistant went to the toilet she looked up into the prosecutors face and hoped for a smile and praise immacolata borelli had been prompted to talk about her brother vincenzo who was to appear before magistrates that morning and would then be transferred to a maximumsecurity facility she was confused you havent mentioned my mother that is correct the prosecutor answered gravely you took her she pressed we did not a small frown cut into his forehead because you couldnt find her she wasnt where we looked for her the prosecutors tongue licked his lower lip i told you where to go you did she was the principal target she was one target we regret she isnt yet in custody she will be very soon he smiled wanly the assistant came back to her chair and the recorder was switched on again it shouldnt concern you whether or not your mothers in custody the gesture was fast instinctive immacolata hit the table with the heel of her hand the impact bounced the taperecorder and spilled the prosecutors coffee there was a flicker of movement in a doorway off the hall as if a watcher had been alerted she said i wont talk to you until my mother has been taken i trusted in your competence you have failed do you imagine i travel lightly from naples to rome to hear the tantrum of a woman who overestimates her own importance i can cut you loose and you wont take my mother she stood and the chair fell behind her clattered she didnt look at them didnt see the slow turn of the spools in the taperecorder she went to her room and slammed the door it was her mothers face lit by camera flashes that she wanted to see her mothers face in shadow as a cell door closed on a corridors lights and her mothers face when early sunlight caught the cell windows and the bars made stripes on her skin her strongest emotion that morning was not love but hate it went so deep it covered a mothers apparent indifference to a girlchild the failure of the parent to rate the achievements of a daughter immacolata had been denied attention denied praise ignored she lay on the bed there had been hate for her mother but now there was fear at the reach of her arm is that what he said its what i was told he said salvatore was at gabriella borellis shoulder his voice had been a murmur and his lips had barely moved while he had guarded the inner door of the pizzeria the scugnizzi had brought messages to him lower in the chain than the footsoldiers were the kids who watched entrances to the quarters of the city and reported listened to conversations in bars and reported sat in the gutter opposite police stations and carabinieri barracks and reported say it to me again she spoke from the side of her mouth a whisper as the traffic roared by horns blasted men and women walked along the pavement and her words were lost to all but salvatore he was in the bar at the top end of casanova luigi pirellis bar he was in a group and the tv was on the arrests alfredos youngest heard him he said the borelli clan is history theyre finished old shit and soft they have no authority now count the days theyll be gone that man he is not to say that again she walked on salvatore dropped back he was soon fifteen or twenty paces behind her he had much to think about he was the enforcer of the clan and answered only to gabriella borelli he had taken on also responsibility for her security and the offshoots of the group three years ago before he had been arrested pasquale borelli would have had the last say on security eight months ago before his flight to london vincenzo had been given that responsibility in his fathers absence he did not know where such leakage of information had come from the faces of men bounced in his mind called forward then discarded he kept her back in his sight and the pistol the beretta p was in his belt he wore a loosefitting jacket to conceal it she was tough and her walk showed it the weakness of the last evening had been shortlived salvatore thought gabriella borelli magnificent as he tracked her watching her back he asked respectfully if lottie would join him in the staffroom alcove eddie deacon hardly knew her had offered her no friendship but now he needed her she was and the young guys who taught at the language school tittered over it shyly lesbian obvious but never confessed lottie had not outed herself she was reluctant to come with him suspicious but then he did what he reckoned was his best imitation of labrador eyes and she would have seen it mattered to him there was no snigger on his lips eddie said sorry and all that but i need help ive lost a girl its really hacked me off dont know where she is other than gone home and shes italian from naples says on google that a million people live there that the city is a hundred and twenty square kilometres i have to find her but i dont know where to start lottie looked at him in the marginal privacy of the alcove perhaps remembered slights that were not imagined remarks behind hands and little darts of cruelty what if little miss perfect doesnt want to be found at least not by you all right all right what have you got that might help eddie had the torn scrap of paper in a seethrough plastic bag as if it was priceless he seemed reluctant to give it up share it but did so you didnt answer me what if she rates you a pain and wants shot of you ill have her say it to my face eddie said he shrugged then did the smile he was famed for it implied that no woman could possibly want shot of him lottie grinned then looked at the handwriting he had gone to her because she had spent time in naples at the university and spoke the language fluently he tried to joke i really dont understand why any female of the species could want shot of me let alone rate me a pain just not on the agenda she studied the paper as if it were a crossword puzzle then gazed at him im wondering eddie if youre behaving like an adult or reverting to teenage male all acne and infatuation or is that not my business just a little old cry for help please if it wasnt for her its you id be chucking red roses at she rolled her eyes almost blushed whats her name immacolata borelli she breathed out hard right line one try borelli line two go with a number and via forcella line three will be the zip code four more preceding digits then for that part of the forcella district that runs between via del duomo and the castel capuano the last line is napoli its hardly enigma codebreaking but then youre only a man a specimen to be pitied after shed repeated it and hed written it in ballpoint on the back of his hand he surprised himself and her by taking hold of her shoulders and kissing her hard on both cheeks he was turning away as she said are you really going there too right what else eddie deacon set off down the corridor for the principals office twenty metres had become forty they were on via carbonara close to the old castle that had doubled as a courthouse he understood the route she had taken in salvatores mind many issues competed for prominence the man who had said the borelli clan was finished old shit and soft a leak in security his job as protector to gabriella borelli any could have claimed priority but he didnt make that choice then he looked at his watch saw the time recognised he was late for the rendezvous with his scooter driver fangio and smiled gabriella borelli was at the lights waiting for the pedestrian green and would cross via carbonara above the castle he smiled when he remembered fangio who had done a wall of death stunt in a circus had crashed spectacularly in front of five hundred punters or more and would not have had the money to buy a new bike he had always enjoyed the memory of fangios face when he was offered the post of scooter rider to salvatore il pistole fangio had been in poggioreale and secondigliano was no altarboy there were few salvatore trusted but fangio was one many people were waiting to cross at those lights then the traffic slowed and the charge started not for neapolitans to wait sinewy lines of pedestrians wove among the vehicles he could barely see her she had heard doors close and a minute later a car had revved outside the block then music had started in the apartment and the only voices were those of the minders she lay on the bed her head on the pillow straining to hear what was said the music was opera and distorted the voices she realised the prosecutor had gone would now be on his journey to naples there had been no soft knock on her door and no discreet voice maybe that of the woman his assistant had urged her to come out of her room to cooperate she had been abandoned she had convinced herself that walking out on them was justified by their display of incompetence they had failed to arrest her mother the doorbell rang they were at the bottom of the seniority heap he was twentyfour and she was his senior by three months they had started at the training school on the same monday morning had been posted to naples on the same monday accepted and begun duty with the squadra mobile on another very recent monday to survive they stayed close had volunteered to work together around them there were men and women who were prematurely aged jaundiced and pessimistic who preached that ambition was heresy in the team they had been up all the previous night and now headed for their homes out to the south on the sea front and sleep he had driven one of the alfas carrying a senior man to a block where on the third floor they had hoped to find la madrina she had driven a car filled with officers to another of the addresses given by an informant not identified at the briefing now she drove and stifled a yawn changed down and braked pedestrians flooded the roadway around them the photographs blown up of gabriella borelli the target were in the car he cursed both were hungry exhausted both for the operation the night before had studied the photograph long and hard the curse became a gasp he jackknifed and snatched up a picture that had been on the rubber matting smoothed it gawped he elbowed her hard in the ribcage below her right breast jarring his bone on her holster for a moment the photograph was in her face she nodded they had the certainty of youth and neither would have considered their judgement flawed their recognition wrong weapons drawn they ran from the car left the doors wide the crown of her head bobbed in front of them and the gap closed not hate but fear after the doorbell had rung immacolata heard a bucket water splashing a womans voice and laughter from the minders she thought a maid had come to clean and she was ignored she realised the weight of her fear no warning no shout to alert her that police with guns drawn were immediately behind her no opportunity to raise her hands as the pistols were aimed at the point in her back where straps and shoulder muscle met salvatore saw a small tableau in front of him that seemed mimed he was used to making calculations those that involved a reasonable chance of survival within a time frame of a second or two he could cruise on the pillion his chest and stomach against fangios back have the p in his fist inside the right pocket of his leather jacket and he would see the target darkened by his helmet visor walking sitting or eating on the pavement in a car or at a pizzeria table and he would know whether or not that was the moment to strike if he went in for the kill he would rap his left hand on fangios shoulder the scooter would swing and take him close then stop for the few moments he needed to aim and achieve a clean hit if he hit fangios shoulder twice fangio would take the scooter past the target and the hit was aborted might be an escort in place a folded windcheater on a table when the temperature was high that would conceal a firearm might be that a carabinieri or police vehicle was following or approaching he wouldnt intervene if he couldnt succeed she was pitched over the young man stood legs apart in a movie pose his weapon aimed twohanded at her the young woman had launched herself and landed on gabriella borellis back a shecat on prey had wrestled her down and with one hand had wrenched an arm of la madrina behind her back the other held a heavy pistol big in a slight fist so that the barrel pressed against the neck salvatore had the beretta half out of his waist belt and the moment was gone the man no longer covered gabriella borelli but the people men women and children who scattered away from where they had their prisoner as cars and vans veered to the side it was as if a cordon was around them an exclusion area he thought she would have said and perhaps stroked his arm as she did so that she trusted him alone because of the open area between him and them he would be seen and identified if he ran forward and would have to enter the space to be close enough to fire killing shots it could not be done he thought that she looked old with her face crushed down on the sand and shit and weeds of the little island where once there had been a traffic bollard there was dirt on her face her hair had lost its shape and there was shock in her eyes he had broken the trust had failed her she was dragged to the car her feet did not get a hold and a shoe came off but she was pulled there and the door thrown open the young man thrust her in and threw himself on top of her fumes spewed from the exhaust and the car sped off salvatore saw before he lost it a hand clamp a light on the roof and the blue flashes that spilled from it he heard the siren wail he walked away more alone than he could remember at any time since pasquale borelli had chosen him had taught him to kill and taught him well flashes in her mind of the moments of fear a girl left to mind a slowcooking meat baby lamb in the oven told when to take it out forgetting and coming back into the kitchen to see the smoke then cringing from her mothers beating a hard one her mother made fear and the hate was secondary there was no love in her life not from her family love was sealed away from her in the cemetery at nola she knew only hatred and fear more laughter came through her door but immacolata did not share it he put the phone down ended one of the calls that seemed to consist of almost endless silences the display panel told him the connection had been for four minutes and nine seconds but it had seemed to arthur deacon a fair imitation of eternity he walked slowly from the hall table towards the kitchen he couldnt go in as betty was washing the floor but he came to the doorway and coughed as if that was the best way to gain his wifes attention she squeezed out the mop quizzed him with a glance well it was edmund i know what did he want she used a mop on the kitchen floor three mornings a week then went to work at a family firm of builders and would tut if he stepped on the clean tiles and messed up he was watching her thinking how to relay what he had been told have you lost your tongue what did he want money at his age he ought to be able to listen just for once listen thank you he saw astonishment on her face his boldness almost surprised him she liked to say that her mother had told her on the eve of their wedding always remember elizabeth a husband is for life but not for lunch she was at work over lunch time and he made himself sandwiches she liked also to remind him that she was now the principal breadwinner and he was a pensioner who had taken the early bullet yes best if you simply listen edmund has resigned from his job what for he packed it in as of today hes going tomorrow or this evening if he can arrange it to naples i dont understand listen and you might after a fashion that girl he spoke of the one he promised to bring to meet us shes gone gone home no warning no explanation but gone sadly he intends to follow her what did you say i said there were other fish in the sea apparently not i said hed run the risk of hurting himself he said he was hurting enough as it was and wouldnt notice any more pain hed never said anything like that to me before bared himself in that way extraordinary i dont want to be rude betty but im wondering whether either of us would have gone chasing halfway across europe if the other had done a bunk i doubt thats unfair i said id look after his visa bills and couldnt think of anything else oh yes i wished him luck it didnt seem sensible to be parental old and cautionary thats it his wife said no i wouldnt have followed you she must be very special that girl at that time in the morning the tourists had not yet come to the museums lukas had the bars coffees and beers were for later in the day while squatting close to his friend who drew the river the louvre and notre dame was for the middle early he came with a plastic bottle of fizzy water to sit on a bench and watch the first arrivals most would not know a millet from a manet or a monet but lukas had no sense of superiority and could not have made the distinction himself he came to see people and search their faces the better to understand them the science he practised affected humble people average people ordinary people it was they who looked at the great statues the bronzes outside the former railway station that was now a museum and gazed at the massive charcoal grey bulk of the rampant elephant with flared ears and the rhinoceros that looked ready to charge both larger than life it was those people businessmen teachers backpackers engineers charity workers and those of whom it was said wrong place at the wrong time whom he worked to liberate to keep alive when the buses came he would settle back and stare into the faces but not be noticed himself and he would play mind games how would they respond hooded bound beaten videotaped with guns at their heads and knives at their throats as they parrotspoke denunciations of state policy his interpretation of how they would react in circumstances of the greatest stress would govern the guidance he gave and the decisions he took he had no favourites he was no more on the side of the pretty slim blonde girl with the denim miniskirt who came off the bus with the hamburg plates than he was on the side of the guy who walked behind her with a stick all were equal so he was not summoned to the great offices of authority in the power centres of the world he did not walk echoing corridors was not brought into carpeted offices and offered sherry or scotch because their occupants did not know his name he worked in dark corners that were except once beyond the reach of longlens cameras it was rumoured though five years later it remained unconfirmed that a photographer from a german news agency had snapped him on a street in baghdad when he was with a special forces crowd the photographer had been embedded with a marine unit or would otherwise have been hotelbound rumour ran that the sunlight had nicked the glass of the leica camera so he had seen its owner and strode up to him he had half strangled the snapper when he pulled off the strap and broke the camera open by stamping on it destroying maybe fifteen thousand dollars worth of equipment he had taken out the memory stick and had chucked it into the middle of a wide sewer then had gotten on with his work the photographer had been told by a gofer alongside lukas from the green zone that if he talked about the incident his safety could not be guaranteed it was a rumour in the work he did his anonymity was precious perhaps even more so than that of an elite bombdisposal operative if his face had been known to the enemy with his reputation he would have been a prime target and his usefulness in the field minimised and which he had not admitted to another soul he had a rooted aversion to the limelight almost shyness disguised under brusque indifference he had no medals but the people ordinary average humble coming off the bus of a hamburg tour company pretty and ugly young and old did not have medals most of those freed from the hellholes the bunkers where they squatted in excreta and urine listening for footsteps and wondering if a weapon was loaded or a knife sharpened would never know of lukass existence it was better that way no handshakes at the end if it had gone well no hugging and kissing no names and promises of cards on the anniversary the only way so his imagined friends queued in front of him to enter the museum and one of his real friends sketched in crayon by the river and several more cleaned cafe tables and swept floors and all would be wondering if he would stroll by spend some time or whether he was gone wherever and for whatever that morning he left his bench went to the kiosk and bought a pistaccio icecream it was his favourite he thought about it when he was in places that didnt do that flavour or any other some said he was a screwball and unhinged others that folk should be goddam grateful the lunatic stayed on call and was never far from his phone when he had finished the icecream and wiped his mouth he would head into the museum for the legion of honour and the impeccable garden in the central courtyard with the fine red roses it was where he went when he had tired of the mind games and it was where heroes were he did not see himself as heroic and if a medal had been offered he would have refused it many meeting him for the first time defined him as that screwball a major in the rangers had it was baqubah and theyd helicoptered in from camp liberty at the balad air base between baghdad and samarra there was a singlestorey house breeze blocks and tin roof on the extreme edge of the place near fields and the asset handled by task force said it was where the hostage was a greekborn engineer and expert in electricity supply and how many guys held him difficult to get close and the usual thing would have been to do three or four days reconnaissance learn the movements and do it from a distance lukas was at the command point four or five klicks back and was barely tolerated by the major who rated him fbi background and all as an unwelcome shoein a forward covert observer would have been on a telescope reported a jerk coming to the building cautiously and that he carried a canister of milk and a metrewide roll of clear plastic sheeting only lukas in the command centre had reacted he had demanded not asked or suggested but demanded that the storm squad assault the building immediately it had been agreed would have been lukass damn near manic certainty that had won the day an attack without sufficient preparation without a model of the interior and in the bright heat light of the middle of the day twelve minutes after lukas had made his demand the first men in the ranger platoon hit the doors front and back then the windows and chucked in stun grenades and gas canisters like it was christmas and they were giving them away they dragged out the greek and brought him back from the dead the greek said he would have been dead in five minutes was shouting it because of what the grenades had done to his hearing and choking because of the gas then the major asked the man designated a screwball how hed known the attack had to go in without the necessary preparation lukas had said because they took the plastic sheeting in would he explain lukas had said they always spread plastic sheeting out on the floor before they saw a guys head off with a serrated blade to keep the blood off it there had been a camera with a charged battery mounted on a tripod the major had been awarded another ribbon and his storm squad had commendations and none of them had ever seen lukas again maybe by now the major had made brigadier or even general and maybe the greek had a good position in power supply at the ministry in athens and lukas wandered into the courtyard of the museum for heroes it was how he liked it staying unknown but being on call gerald seymour the collaborator he had been lucky he told himself that luck had dictated that a lorry should spill its load on the m just north of harlow the northbound carriageway and that a tailback of four miles should delay a family on a budget break to rome while the rail service had sailed past unaffected eddie deacon would have slept on a bench at the airport stansted but instead found himself aboard a cheap and cheerful flight going to ciampino a rush to get himself on board a chase down corridors and piers and he had been the last on to the aircraft he was not even in a seat before the doors were closed and it was taxiing he told himself then that he was blessed he had not bought a book and they didnt do freebie newspapers with that airline the child on his left ate chocolate messily and concentrated on a gameboy and the woman on his right was rigid with nerves he reckoned he might have her hand in his lap for comfort when it came to landing eddie didnt buy anything from the trolley and sat still upright stared ahead and made no contact eye or physical with the woman or the child he thought he might just as well have pulled a pin and rolled a pineapple grenade into his parents living room his father had been monosyllabic and breathing hard but had coughed up the offer to look after his plastic bill which was decent but afterwards they would together have been in shock he had switched off his mobile before catching the train to stansted he reckoned they would have tried half a dozen times to phone him to try to dissuade him to tell him he should go to the language school and request his job back his parents and all their friends would never march out of regular paid employment without having another position to move to on the following monday morning so the concept of what he had done left him vaguely lightheaded his mind danced what was bizarre about the choreography was that he had not stopped he hadnt since he had sat alone in the afghan restaurant and waited to consider that immacolata might have decided that he was a boring nohoper a saddo and a loser and that a summer fling was over as autumn came on never thought of it he had a ba hons in modern languages only a they called it a desmond at that university in the thames valley and at the end of four years study was supposed to possess some capability at analysis he had left with a good knowledge of german fair french and some spanish with a smattering of italian which might take him over the front page of a newspaper he knew berlin having walked the pavements and worked in allnight cafes during summer vacations and could get himself around paris without glancing every five minutes at a map and he wouldnt have been lost in barcelona he didnt know rome or naples but he had once spent two days in milan having climbed on the wrong train in geneva when he should have been going to montpellier in france coming from munich it mattered not it was not in the temperament of eddie deacon to worry at a problem as if he needed to untie a tight knot in a length of string he either ran from problems or tilted at them if she had indeed walked out on him she could say so to his face clear onesyllable words not possible not his mac second point chewed on briefly in the aircraft cabin police at the flat a brother taken away the flat searched everything about her hidden from him like her address was she dodgy or bent weighed it didnt care she was his mac there was no doubt he had to go to naples he had to find her hed pull a face shed grimace and shrug a bit ask him what the hell he was doing there in a street whatever it looked like whatever via forcella looked like hed say he wanted a fresh roll for his breakfast maybe some croissants she would look surprised astonished then grin hed laugh both laughing hugging and holding tight it was what he thought nothing about a broken door police on the step a wild kid who was expert on breaking and entering maybe no more than ten years old nothing about sitting for several hours in a restaurant hurting and hurting worse in his bedroom where her dressinggown hung and her magazines lay about nothing about talking to pleading with a blowup photograph on a wall they would do it meeting again just casual as if nothing had happened and no wounds had been cut into him he never saw her solemn sullen serious because mac was always the photograph on the wall who knew what love was they didnt talk about love in the little house they shared in dalston love was not an agenda area with the guy from hm revenue and customs the club waiter the railticket seller or the perpetual student love was in movies books magazines screwing and shagging were real rare but attainable with a good alcohol flow but love was offlimits the definition of love as known to eddie deacon was an ache in his guts a yearning and the bloody awful misery of not seeing that face coming round the corner and the little wave then feeling her touch and the bloody child had put chocolate on the sleeve of his jacket and the bloody womans hand was on his knee and her fingers were tightening they were long over the alps the light was failing and the sun had dipped below the wing the child was gobbling chocolate to get the box finished and the woman was going into whiteknuckle time because the engine pitch had changed and eddie sensed that the descent had started at that time he should have been educating a roomful of immigrants all his chums from the baltics the balkans and north africa on the intricacies of murder in mesopotamia or death on the nile or murder on the orient express didnt really matter which like pressing a button on the staffroom computer keyboard he deleted them erased them it was early in the evening and a citys lights were on the aircraft yawed and the undercarriage rumbled as it was lowered of course he had come he was eddie deacon and he wanted nothing more than to see her hear her feel her and there was no logic in it and no more analysis of what he knew the wheels hit a good landing feathered and he didnt know of anything he should fear he came out of the car fast slammed the door waved off the driver for mario castrolami this was foreign territory what he had seen of collina fleming was enough to curl his lip he tasted the first trace of bile in his throat he had heard it was a hill for millionaires the big ones and the apartments were broad built their balconies had expensive plants on them and the plots were surrounded by barricades dogs barked behind electronically controlled gates and porters patrolled the front doors he thought the hill was about privilege and wealth castrolami investigator in the carabinieri ros detested privilege and lacked wealth could have done could have blocked enquiries made files disappear given advance warning by public phone with a handkerchief over the mouthpiece of a raid planned for the following dawn all of that would have filled an offshore account he lived in vomero the comfortable area of naples but on the north side of the castel santelmo and he needed to be a gymnast and to stand on tiptoe on a chair to peer through a skylight for a minuscule glimpse of the sea and the east promontory of capri he thought the hill oozed money a woman passed him as he went to the gate it was late september and castrolamis tie was loose and there was sweat in his armpits she wore a fur coat and carried a dog under one arm where castrolami lived on the wrong side of vomero there were stray cats that would have killed that toy dog and eaten it she looked up saw him dismissed him as irrelevant and went by probably thought him a plumber or an insurance salesman there was no porter on this block and he rang the bell gave his name and the gate was unlocked he carried a thin cardboard file and a small overnight bag he loathed rome and hoped the bag would be needed for a night or two no more he was admitted he asked how she was rossi the young one gestured something of amusement and something of frustration the older one was orecchia she stays in her room it was about her mother we find it often enough theres the excitement and drama the centreofstage hour then the moment of reality and the fear shes frightened of her mother you understand were not interrogators at this stage were here to protect her and maintain the security of the safehouse she wants to stay in her room hide at the back of her cave so we dont drag her out she wont eat she wont talk she wont castrolami smiled he did a grim dark smile well he went to the door it was less than twentyfour hours since he had brought immacolata borelli to this address and less than twelve since he had been told she had refused to speak to the prosecutor and only half a dozen since the file had landed on his cluttered desk they used him at the palace of justice as a bulldozer that evening he should have been with his friend who painted views of the mountain at an exhibition of modern art in a church on the riviera di chiaia and afterwards they took for granted at the palace of justice that the bulldozer did twentyfourseven he didnt knock the light was off but the blinds were not drawn and the streetlamps far below threw up enough for him to see her she lay on her back her legs together staring at the ceiling she didnt turn to face him but said quietly i dont want anything to eat or drink he put the light on hit all the switches and she jerked her head sideways he went to the table and put the file on it then he walked towards her he took her right arm at the wrist heaved her off the bed and she nearly fell he said nothing and dragged her to the table her feet slithering on the floor he kicked back a chair made room for her pressed her down on the seat he flicked open the file cover and spilled out the photographs she saw her mother immacolata held the photograph under the table light she looked at the wife of pasquale borelli the leader of the clan and controller of most business activities in forcella and sanita the woman who did deals that had relevance in the north of italy in the south of france in spain and germany who had ambitions for the opening of opportunities in great britain who aspired to be a player on the east coast of the united states and had links with organisations operating in the west of the former soviet union she looked at the photograph of her mother a little gasp her gaze slipped to castrolami if he felt sympathy for the fate of her mother he disguised it his expression was blank he showed neither clemency nor triumph she matched his mood her mother whom she had feared was on the ground on concrete built up a few centimetres from the street was helpless for a moment she wondered and then she asked is she dead he shook his head in the blackandwhite photograph enlarged to twenty centimetres by twentyfive her mother was prostrate a man was poised above her head his pistol drawn and aimed at her a woman crawled on her back and had wrenched up one arm so that the hand almost touched the neck and held a pistol against the neck so that the barrel dented it her mother wore the dead look on her face she was supine had no fight did not cringe it was as if she was comatose from shock she had fallen awkwardly under the weight of the woman then must have wriggled backwards to get further clear of the man with the aimed pistol the effect of that movement had been to ruck up her skirt it had ridden up her thighs immacolata gazed at the photograph it was the indignity her mothers thighs were white on the grey concrete but not as white as the knickers she wore immacolata had a glimpse of them frozen by the camera she thought of the respect her mother demanded from her children the clan footsoldiers and associates from businessmen to foreign gang principals she thought of when a stick had been taken to her aged twelve when she had refused to leave her bedroom to sweep the floor in the living room and hall and when her face had been slapped a stinging blow as her mother had announced to her brothers that she was to be la madrina and immacolata had not suppressed a giggle of nerves at her mothers selfelevation to such a height she thought of the verbal criticism offered in a cafe when she had failed to bring back all the protectionpayment envelopes from the via casanova it was her mother humiliated who lay prone in the road and at the periphery of the cameras view a small crowd had gathered and formed a wary halfmoon she believed from the greyness and distortion of the picture that her mothers arrest had been captured on a mobile phone she realised she had been brought this particular photograph not one of her mother being led through paparazzi and cameramen flashes and arc lights able to use the haughtiness of a pupetta maresca a rosetta cutolo or a patrizia ferriero to see her mother laid out in a posture of vulgarity did i do that immacolata asked almost in awe castrolami alone nobody achieves anything together much you were part of doing that a big enough part when your involvement is known to guarantee that the sentence of death is passed on you what do you want of me now i want you signorina excuse me to stop trying to play games with me you should now consider your situation as set in stone you see the photograph of your mother i dont think shell be pleased to know that her picture is now a source of amusement throughout naples when she knows and she soon will its inevitable that her daughter has collaborated and is in part responsible for her being photographed with bare thighs and most of her arse on display i believe shell feel resentful towards you but theres no turning back and shes behind bars in a cell shes beginning the process of rotting do you know dottore what its like to die of leukaemia no i would imagine though that its worse than being in a cell and rotting i think so i rarely offer advice signorina but now ill break a habit dont waste my time again and dont forget your friends suffering where do we start she asked pushing away the photograph we should talk again of vincenzo a corridor led from the staircase to the basement cell block and the interview rooms where prisoners met their lawyers one of the detectives who had arrested vincenzo borelli accompanied the custody officers who escorted him from the cell along the corridor even for this short walk from a departure point to a destination deep inside a protected police station and paddington green was a fortress designed to hold resourceful terror captives he was handcuffed to an officer since his arrest he had seen no lawyer no detective only the uniformed men entrusted with guarding and caring for him he knew nothing he was neapolitan a man it was right that strangers should see he cared he asked softly with concern my sister immacolata where is she is she held the detective behind him sniggered he would have thought vincenzo recognised that he dealt with crap with an italian not held friend not here and not likely to be actually friend shes shafted you shes singing like a whole damn choir sorry did i say that i dont think i did vincenzo thought it was arrogance the detective needed to appear a mastermind senior and to have detailed knowledge of an extradition case vincenzo looked blankly ahead as he was led down the corridor and mimed being simple fitting a stereotype not understanding in an interview room he met a lawyer the lawyer offered him cigarettes said he came from catania in sicily was based in the british capital and dealt exclusively with cases criminal and civil in which italian citizens needed representation he said too that he had been appointed to act on vincenzos behalf by umberto he gave the name of a street and quoted a telephone number as verification that he knew where the clans lawyer lived and the number of his personal mobile vincenzo told him to call it and deliver a message urgently the message was in english the diva performs with rare beauty and is hired for many performances he told the lawyer that the message was to be spoken once fast that was all he wished to say he wanted the man gone vincenzo in his cell believed that within half an hour the message would be on umbertos desk umberto would have recorded it for safe transcription memorised it then destroyed the tape and the typescript the door shut on him a key turned in a lock he leaned against a wall much scribbled on and graffitistrewn then beat the painted brickwork with his fist till the bruising came his own sister he left the ticket window and ran he was last on the train and he thought that too was luck eddie deacon had managed to rip open the heavy door while the uniforms shouted waved their arms and blew hard on whistles but he jumped aboard closed the door after him they did a sweet smile for the man who reached the window and glowered the train rolled out of rome he had come into the city on an airport bus and had suffered a seachange realised it now he didnt have a seat but stood and rocked with the motion of the carriage the engine gathered acceleration the seachange was in him luck was sprinting with him and he was thankful for it darkness flanked the train as it cleared the roman suburbs and then he made out the tight clusters of lights high up and imagined the track had been routed between hills and their old villages he felt exhilaration as if he challenged himself not bad was it getting himself halfway across western europe on the same day that hed jacked a job cleared a bank account he had plastic his family would guarantee and was hightailing through the hills south of the eternal city excitement adventure they wouldnt have contemplated it they being the hm revenue and customs clerk the waiter the ticket man and the student one would be dragging himself back to the house after a day of staring at a screen with a head fit to bust the next would be making polite noises to pompous farts in the club and bringing them drinks the ticket man would be on late shift and counting the minutes till he finished and the last would be buried in some damn book about manorial field divisions in the tudor period they would find his note hasty scrawled and would each feel eddie reckoned a spasm of jealousy but not half of the jealousy theyd feel when he brought her back it was excitement adventure and he felt himself lifted almost euphoric it was a brilliant line so fast so modern so smooth it was as if he had entered true civilisation didnt have a line like this or a carriage on the route to chippenham he knew of nothing now that could block him he was on a pedestal had placed himself there he would find her incredible its mac wow fancy bumping into you here just happened to be passing did you now funny old world yeah and hearing her voice the accent and the lilt and knowing she damn near laughed not at him with him like you say mac funny old world shall we go and get a beer cant think of anything better didnt know where hed find her couldnt picture it or where shed lead him to find a beer didnt care excitement was the narcotic in eddie deacon on this train on the new track it would take ninety minutes to travel from rome to naples everything went for him and luck smiled why should it not he read the note that the child had brought him he needed a magnifyingglass to decipher the tiny characters it was carmine borelli who had first taken the young lawyer umberto inside the clans affairs he had spotted the overweight and indulgent rookie with no resources of his own and no family to keep him in a fitting standard of living and had backed his intuition it had been forty years the previous june since he had made the approach and the youthful umberto had virtually kissed his hand in gratitude it astonished him that umbertos ponderous stubby fingers were capable of writing in such a delicate minuscule style he would have thought the lawyer too clumsy to fashion it the magnifyingglass made the message clear clear but almost unbelievable your daughterinlaw arrested your grandsons also arrested your granddaughter collaborates with the palace of justice and has been flown to rome he couldnt complain that four words were used when one sufficed so few words and so great this effect he was breathing hard with wheezes and bubbling gasps he understood it was a situation as critical for the clan he had founded as that which had confronted the brothers in sicily during the fascist regime and the rule of the brutal prefect of iron cesare mori when the cosa nostra had been closest to defeat and no different in naples during the time of mussolini but mussolini had fallen and the allies had landed first in sicily then on the mainland at salerno and a new era of opportunity had arrived carmine borelli had seized that opportunity had begun to form the apparatus of the clan that bore his name it had survived with respect on the streets and in the files of the palace of justice for sixtysix years he had been married to anna only two years when american troops had entered the bombed streets of naples everything he had built according to the note a street child had brought him from the lawyer was now at risk a convulsion of coughing shook his body he spat phlegm into his handkerchief and the irritation passed he sat still in his chair with the scrap of paper in his palm and the magnifying glass he did not call his wife but she had admitted the child and would have known that the muchfolded piece of paper was of importance so had allowed him to digest it first then would come to share he had known of course as she did that the boys were held not merely silvio that gabriella had been taken in the street and her photograph circulated in the days newspapers the bite of the vipera was your granddaughter collaborates if he smoked more than a full carton in a day there were pains in his chest but no worse than those now in his mind he could think of so many clans in which a member of the inner family had taken the pentito programme of the palace of justice and he had always in the fifteen years since the programme had been launched felt a sense of superiority over those who had not been able to hold the loyalty of sons and daughters nephews and nieces brothers and sisters it was his own nipote who sat now with the men who were his lifetime enemy much for him to reflect on he remembered the contempt he had larded on those clans cut deep by the testimony of their own the sneer the retort the shrug and the secret feeling that it was but for gods grace that it could have been his brother now long dead or his brothers son shot and left to bleed to death on the via carbonara or his grandson the least liked among his nipoti giovanni it was none of them immacolata was accused he let his mind rove his wife anna had brought the newborn granddaughter to the visitors hall at the poggioreale gaol in that place of dirt noise and despair where he had been held for four months before the charges of extortion were dropped the infant had slept as if unaffected by where she was had made a little island of calm in the clamour her christening had been delayed until his release he had been present in the church at the top of the street in forcella and the priest had been his friend the childs father had been one of the many latitanti in the city in flight from the prosecutor and carmine had replaced pasquale in the place of honour at immacolatas first communion and had hosted the celebration lunch the child became a teenager then a young woman and he would sit her beside him and give her the benefit of his experience and she would listen he would have said that her affection for him was great greater than she harboured for her mother and father and that her respect for him was total anna came into the room she had poor eyesight poorer than his and her chair was always by the window she reached out a hand and he passed her the scrap of paper and the magnifyingglass she glanced at the note then shook her head sharply it was for him to tell her what was written and to repeat it would be another wound cut ever deeper he used the zapper to turn on the big tv and raise its volume there had been police in the house so recently and not a chance of observing them he would say nothing of importance without turning on the television and increasing the volume she leaned close to him and he to her his lips little more than ten centimetres from her ear he could see each of the cancer marks on her skin the wrinkles at her throat and the hairs on her upper lip he told her everything and always had he said the boy came from umberto umberto writes your granddaughter collaborates with the palace of justice and has been flown to rome umberto denounces immacolata she is umberto says an infame immacolata seeks to destroy us she gave no answer carmine could see only the chill slab of his wifes face devoid of expression the child immacolata had spent as many of her waking hours in this apartment as she had in her mothers it was personal the hurt anna gave no answer he believed because she still pondered on what her response should be she would not speak unless there were words of substance to say he felt the damp on his face a tear trickled down his skin to the thin stubble on his cheek his shin was kicked a sharp blow with a heavy laceup shoe which stabbed pain into the bone he thought she might as well have condemned their granddaughter it had taken five or six seconds for him to relay the message and twentysix years of love commitment and caring were obliterated he looked into his wifes face many times in those sixtysix years of marriage she had worn an expression that frightened him and so it was he saw in that face a terrible but controlled hatred where immacolata was involved he could be soft but his wife could not they had broken castrolami came into the kitchen to make tea and left immacolata borelli to sip a glass of juice it was different he had fastened the photograph to the wall from where he had sat her at the table the microphone close to her she faced it he was to the side of her it was natural for her to look up to be certain that a point made was assimilated and then she saw her mother on the ground in humiliation the skirt pushed up white skin whiter underwear dignity and control stripped it was different because the borelli girl now talked and during the time he had been there he had used three spare tapes from the stack he had brought they had moved beyond vincenzo enough on the first two tapes to ensure an extradition case to go with the evidence already laid before the british courts on charges of murder and the third detailed the control of gabriella borelli over the clan not mere supposition supposition would have been that pasquale borelli slipped out messages from the gaol of novara through a route in the gaols catering detail was that the route whereby the husband let the wife have his advice involved the man who brought the flour yeast salt olive oil and cheap dried milk to the prison bakery and was a facilitator for the communications of two maximumsecurity sicilians supposition was that the contract for a new sewage works at a town inland from naples had corrupt political involvement detail named the men who had granted the contract in the local town hall what they had been paid for their cooperation how the payment was made and how that contract would be shared between different clans who had trucking who had labour who had cement castrolami needed to break the meeting for tea orecchia took milk from the refrigerator and poured it youre pleased with her more so than before orecchias smile was cold you were hard on her castrolami said because i feel nothing for her she is not a true pentita there is no sense of penitence the death of a friend linked to her and an attack on her at a cemetery her being too late to attend the funeral mass combine to create a sense of guilt she seeks to redress the guilt but thats not penitence revenge anger dislike for her family who may not have valued her as she thought she deserved many things but its not a roadtodamascus conversion shes not paul orecchia murmured but few of them are and no shining light only little grievances topped by the friends death no sense of outrage at the criminality of the camorra what has happened to the city naples distinguished by callousness shit thats boring excuse me have you no sense of sincerity you see her as shallow you know better than i friend what shell face when the pressure crushes her well see sincerity or not orecchia handed him the cup no saucer and a sweet biscuit me when i go home not often i stand in the shower for a full fifteen minutes and the family screams therell be no hot water for the rest of that day they say im mad that i sup with devils i say i eat with a long spoon you know whats worse the collaborators believe they do me rossi you society a great favour by coming to us i despise them castrolami smiled grimly maybe youd find spiritual fulfilment as a street sweeper thanks for the tea orecchia said im not joking i trust this one all of them as far as i can kick them they entangle people squeeze and suck the goodness from them i hear you castrolami couldnt have argued with a word hed said but he wondered how a man survived in his work if he saw only bleakness did he laugh at home did he follow a football team with the fanaticism of the mastiffs in naples did he pay tarts castrolami wondered if orecchia was ever saddened when a collaborator was cut loose from the protection programme and left to fend for himself did he ever respect them that evening he would talk to signorina immacolata about her mothers harddrugsimportation programmes and the voice droned again at him to be touched by them is to be contaminated more luck he was told that a single room was available the last and that it was the first day after the end of the highseason rate big luck double time for eddie deacon innocent and ignorant the accommodation desk at the citys railway station had found him the room a pretty girl had circled the hotel on a map and confirmed it would not be expensive he had slung the bag over his shoulder and started to walk making his way only two wrong turnings from the wide square the piazza garibaldi he had tasted the heat the noise the smells and the chaos of traffic and scooters and had known the first pangs of nerves he had stood outside the hotel door and the neon above him blinked without pattern kids stood on the streets smoked and didnt talk but eyed him more nerves they spoke some english inside and the man who gave him the key had a squint a khaki mole on his cheek and a stutter eddie spoke kindly to him he thought then that he needed a friend any bloody friend from any bloody place maybe the excitement the adventure the exhilaration like the neon blinked he went up to the room his step was heavier and the bounce had gone they were saving on power for the stairs the bulbs were lowwattage and made the shadows longer the greyness of the walls and ceiling deeper the lack of light accentuating the scratches in the paint he was no longer within the civilisation boundaries of the train carriage that had brought him south he heard a couple row in german about the cost of the meal that evening and the budget being blown another couple on the next floor up grunted squealed and worked the bedsprings and there was a tray outside the door on which was a barely nibbled pizza the sex sounded good but the pizza had dried out he had been told by the girl at the accommodation desk at napoli centrale that this pensione was the best he could afford he went on up the staircase the carpet thinner more faded and worn with each flight the key was on a chain that hooked on to a small wooden ball he slipped the little card that had come with it his name room number the hotel address into his trouser pocket opened the door and groped for the switch the room was smaller than a prison cell with a wardrobe an upright chair a table hardly deep enough for an a sheet of paper and a single bed beside the wardrobe there was a square section of transparent plastic for a shower basin and toilet only a damn small cat a kitten could have been swung in it had he expected a marriott room or one from a holiday inn maybe an intercontinental old story in this world eddie you get what you pay for eddie deacon in germany or france had never felt himself a stranger had not been the lonely foreigner he pushed open a window and the sounds of the night buffeted against him cars screaming music turned up high he knew he was in a street behind the piazza garibaldi because it showed up on the map he had been given he had asked the girl if it was near to the via forcella and she had shrugged as if to indicate that only an idiot needed that information and then she had agreed it was another visitor to naples with a rucksack on his back had elbowed eddie away from the desk he felt an increase in those nerve pangs so he slapped his face with the palm of each hand then unfolded the map he didnt feel good he didnt feel right but he didnt feel as if he was about to bloody lie down and cave he mapped out a route a man had said in public that the family was shit finished a spent power might have been right salvatore walked into the bar he wore no face mask the room was brightly lit and his face features identity were clear the clan of which he was the enforcer was worth if all property investments treasury bonds and shares in a halfdozen of the leading money markets were added up in excess of half a billion euros as an enforcer he could have been directed to a penthouse apartment on the cote dazur or a villa in a smart protected suburb of frankfurt and his target would have been a banker or investment manager who had misappropriated tens of thousands of euros or a hundred thousand or a million also his work was to maintain the respect and dignity the clan family needed he handed down the justice of the borellis to those who were high and mighty to the potential informer who refused to pay a hundred euros a week and to the braggart in the bar he looked around him he was seen noticed he didnt want anonymity if many saw and knew him the word went faster his eyes fastened on the man it had always surprised salvatore that when he confronted a victim they seldom ran or fought they were almost all helpless and trapped in terror this one was no different he would have said it that the family were shit would have repeated it would have gone home and lain beside his whorewife in their bed and the bravado would have oozed away he would have known that within hours a few days but less than a week the enforcer of the clan would come for him he had nowhere to hide a victim a man of forty would have been familiar with only the few streets that surrounded the districts of sanita and forcella and the labyrinth inside the area of two or three square kilometres he was and would have realised it a dead man walking from the time his mouth had opened and his tongue had flapped who lived out the final stages of his life in a small flat with his wife and children in a bar where others were cautious of his company who was in la cella dei condannati a morte others now backed away from him his jaw was slack the spittle was white against dark lips and sweat gleamed on his high forehead he would have felt his legs sag under the weight of his body he did not have to show the pistol the beretta at his waist salvatore flicked his fingers he gestured with his head to the door at that moment some men bankers or street scum wet their trousers in the crotch or fouled their seat some closed their eyes and began to pray some wept some pleaded some spoke of their children their wives some went as if they sleepwalked this one did salvatore also knew that the man he had called out would have friends in the bar with whom he had played in the street as a child sat in schoolrooms talked and watched football in that bar for an adult lifetime and none would help him now perhaps in a week not yet power not yet gone a photograph in a newspaper of the thighs and the covered arse of gabriella borelli more photographs of her children in custody but no certainty yet that power was in new hands none of those friends once valued would block the door defend him it was the way of naples the authority of the clans even one seriously wounded weakened ruled and none in that crowded bar would say they had seen salvatores face within two minutes the bar would have emptied well before the first sirens and lights arrived only the staff would be there all would claim to have been facing the far wall or busy at the coffee machines or in the rear store for more milk that too was the way of naples unchanged and unchanging clear of the bar he pushed the man across the broken pavement a vicious shove where a slab should have been there was a pit and the mans shoe caught in it and he fell forward he was half in the street and half in the gutter salvatore kicked him in the buttock and the man crawled limply forward he had chosen this place because he knew that no street cameras covered the stretch of road between the porta capuana and the via cesare rosaroll he had the pistol out of his belt he fired one shot and the bullet went into the back of the mans knee and there was a little limp scream of shock then another shrill from the pains spread salvatore waved up the street extraordinary true to naples palermo and reggio calabria in the toecap of italys boot traffic had disappeared from the road it had been there a constant hooting snarl but was gone the road was empty but for a white van old rusted with no registration plates it could accelerate the man would have seen it heard it but with his leg shot away at the knee he could not avoid it and squirmed on the tarmacadam he was in an oil slick now his shirt smeared and the van went over him cleared him no one saw no witnesses in the bar on the pavement or in cars on the road saw the van go over him perhaps it crushed his back or broke his neck perhaps it left him grievously injured but still living it braked it reversed it came back up the road and the rear tyres lifted as it mounted the body a second time when the body was cleared and the van stopped again there was no movement salvatore climbed into the passenger seat his driver whom he called fangio went away down the road he thought that the clan those still at liberty clung to power by the thickness of the string used to bind a birthday present an hour later a boy came to him he and fangio for speed shared the shower scrubbed and washed their clothing was bagged for disposal few knew of that address the lawyer was among the few the child brought a scrap of paper and left running more than adults salvatore il pistole whose face was on their screensavers trusted the kids he had to wipe soap from his eyes before he could read the compacted handwriting he shuddered he crumpled the paper threw it at fangios feet and saw it carried in the torrent of soapy water down the drain to shoot a man in the back of the leg meant nothing to him he was unaffected by the sight of a van speeding down a road well lit with high lamps then bouncing over a sprawled body he felt almost a tremble in his legs under the damp towel he would have said he could believe anything of naples anything he had been wrong he could not have believed if he hadnt seen it written in the spider hand of the lawyer that immacolata borelli had collaborated not the thickness of string the thickness of one strand woven to make string he didnt know then what he could do should do without the power of the clan at his back he too was dead squashed broken bloody he didnt know where he should turn he couldnt still the trembling or the image of immacolata borelli and he couldnt believe he was at the end of the street under the sign that said it was via forcella he saw nothing familiar and nothing that offered a welcome the light was poor the shadows harsh the spearing headlights of weaving scooters caught the shapes of men women kids then lost them as the riders powered away eddie deacon had told himself that it was important before he went to sleep to know where via forcella was how far away how he felt intimidated there at the head of the street and he thought it hardly wide enough for two cars to pass he realised that a group of kids watched him and he wished he hadnt brought his wallet with him he believed himself evaluated as worth a hit or not worth a hit nothing he saw reassured him he was beside a church but it was darkened and he sensed that the doors were bolted locked secure against the night and strangers he turned away it was as if he backed off the street corner seemed an interface when he retreated he was on the via duomo and the map said that the citys principal cathedral was there and the shops had lights in their windows there he felt fine down that street he had felt a cloying nervousness it would be different in the morning of course and he would be back in broad warm sunshineladen daytime he trudged back to his bed and was troubled that he had suffered what was bloody nearly a panic attack he had thought till then that luck rode with him he would be back in the morning to find her eddie was serenaded to faltering sleep by sirens so many of them and for so long and the vehicles came raucous to a street near where he was only when the sirens had died did the restlessness and tension drain away then he could think of her again as she was in the photograph on his wall fancy bumping into you here just happened to be passing because of the work he did lukas had long ago shed a body clock he could work in the night sleep in the day just as he could type on his laptop in the back of a bucking land rover or humvee in halfdarkness he typed his report on colombia what they had achieved and whom they had lost he was as happy working late into the night as in the morning was not fresher at the start of a day than at the end no drama would creep into his report no descriptive factors and no colour he would list briefly what he had known and the advice he had offered on the basis of facts available nowhere in the text would there be disguised praise for his own part or criticism of others only a professional could make sense of it only those who employed him now the chief executive officer at ground force security and the director of operations or those who had employed him in years past the federal bureau of investigation and the department of defense could have made drama from the few pages on offer the descriptions were clinical and he used the shorthand jargon of his trade men across the globe who dealt with the highrisk stakes of hostage rescue and negotiation would read the pages and know that lukas had written them and they would pray to god that the next time he was needed they found him available to travel and not marooned in some other shitheap place home for him where he typed was an apartment under the eaves on the top floor of a street off the rue de bellechasse the mother of the ceo of ground force security had lived and died there and when lukas had come on the firms books it had been offered to him the french capital suited him he had no wish to live in the uk when he was employed by a britishbased company and less to be resident in the united states after twentytwo years with the bureau the last two on secondment to the department of defense he craved to be distanced from his work and the paris apartment satisfied him little more than a shoebox it comprised a cramped living room and a kitchenette behind a chipboard partition a bedroom under a sloping ceiling but that had room for a big bed where a man with nightmares could toss in the darkness a bathroom with a power shower that could wash off iraqs sand and colombias mud and a hall with a table and the telephone it might not ring for a week or a month but a red light would flash if he had missed a call lukas did not like being far from the telephone he was finishing off the report ground force security would be heaped with praise by the agency because their man had survived and cover had been maintained goddam brilliant a motherfucker of a triumph his ceo would be told by langley his own view pretty much ok not desperate and not wonderful some whom lukas dealt with at field level regarded him as a lunatic a few told him he was a lunatic he didnt take it personally or when a spanish diplomat had tried to punch him after calling him a lunatic he had written it up in the usual laconic way afterwards negotiations with a tribal leader had been ongoing for excess of three days much reliance placed on the talks my view too much reliance asset intelligence reported the hostage held in a sixstorey block of twentyfour apartments plus basement exact location of hostage and hostagetakers in the building was not known but we had electronics in the stairwell a male not seen before at the building approached and carried a plastic bag containing one large potato i advised readying the storm squad for immediate intervention spanish diplomatic personnel in the command centre took a contrary position the electronics in the stairwell indicated the unknown male to have gone to the second floor right side of staircase i urged an instant assault no mention of the attempt to punch him the screamed accusation that he cared nothing for the life of a spanishborn expert in antiquities on attachment to the national museum no mention of a diplomat having to be restrained while frothing with rage no mention in the report of an experts experience a big potato weighing more than two kilos had been the trigger for him the diplomats believed negotiation would free their national that a premature assault endangered the captives life to be told that a man carrying a potato into the building was reason enough to abandon the talks that had been so difficult to initiate had caused an explosion of fury the assault was successful four iraqis were killed by troops from the polish special forces team and the hostage was freed he would have been dead within the hour signed f lukas nb a large potato was used as a pistols silencer in the assassination of a british national the barrel tip being indented into the potato and the killing bullet passing through its bulk a british coordinator one whom lukas admired had told him about big potatoes it didnt offend him to be accused of lunacy because he understood too well the stresses they all felt the brit had given him a cassette and lukas had gone off to watch alone the video of a killing the potato as the end of an automaticpistol barrel a makharov had dulled the noise on the soundtrack of the firing he had seen the body collapse not fall forward but go down like one of those big old cooling towers that were dynamited the coordinator tough hard had seemed badly cut by that loss they were all in the same club limited membership and all felt badly when they lost out he had failed to save the life of a european tourist who was a damn fool stupid guy to think he could walk those mountains without having looked through websites and foreign office advisories but it still hurt it just seemed cheap to lukas to show the world what hurt from his living room he often looked out into the hall but no red light winked and no bell rang gerald seymour the collaborator there were kids at the top of the street they wore a uniform of faded tshirts and tracksuit bottoms or denims and scuffed trainers had closecropped hair that made them look as though they were recovering from a louse infestation they had darting eyes that crossed over the pedestrians who came off the via duomo turned and headed on down the street when the tshirt of one was lifted in a sudden arm movement eddie deacon saw the handle of a knife and the upper part of its sheath the kids did not kick footballs behind them astride a scooter smoking was an older boy maybe fifteen or sixteen and he kept the engine idling against the wall two more boys maybe seventeen or eighteen had mobile phones clamped to their faces eddie deacon was not an idiot some said he was bone idle that he lacked drive that he was short on ambition and nobody had ever called him stupid but he had common sense nous he had realised that everyone who went down that street was visually checked over there was a rhythm to it a man or a car appeared and the kids seemed to rush in front of him maybe to slow him the scooters engine speed quickened and the mobile was spoken into once he had seen the scooter pull out and go down the street and a signal must have been sent because within seconds another scooter had taken over sentry duty he had walked past two other streets leading into the district and there had been kids a scooter and mobile phones at the top of each he could recognise it could not deny it eddie had slept poorly because of the nerves he was as intimidated by the street hesitating and hovering at its mouth as he had been in the darkness the night before he felt his intelligence dulled but it was what he had come for to go down that street and find immacolata borelli nobody had accused him of cowardice or ever mocked him for fastfix religion it might have been the nerves on the via duomo before he reached the junction with via forcella he had found himself outside the cathedral he had gone inside and lingered there he had read that the huge high interior was built four hundred years ago after earthquake devastation had brought down the thirteenthcentury building and that under the most recent foundations were a greek temple and a romanera rainwater canal hed read too of san gennaro who protected the city from disaster and whose blood kept here in a vial liquefied each first sunday in may and each september the saint had died in he did a simple sum fast years ago beheaded after torture as punishment for his beliefs and his blood was a dried cake for three hundred and sixtythree or four days of the year but went liquid on those two days if eddie deacon had told the guys in the house off the kingsland road this story and that he didnt doubt it he would have been laughed all the way to the pub to do the first round and the second flowers were being arranged near the altar and he imagined there would be a wedding later a scattering of chairs was taken by crouched figures he was happy to have been there yet he never went into the church on hoxton street or the one on the other side of dalston at middleton road being there hearing a choir of treble angel voices rehearse settled him a little so best bloody foot forward the light didnt come down the street the alleyways leading off to the sides spars off a mast were narrower and dim and above them washing hung there were shops for hardware groceries bread cheap clothing the facade rendering had peeled away and the paintwork was chipped and flaking often in the first few paces he reached back and touched his hip pocket where the slim wallet was he wore faded jeans trainers and a shortsleeved shirt he had left his passport his plastic and most of his cash in the little safe in the pensione room it seemed necessary for him under the gaze of the kids the boy astride the scooter and the older boys with the mobiles to feel for his wallet he said softly to himself for fucks sake eddie get with it where are you in western europe the cradle of civilisation why are you in western europe to find mac what are you a bloody wimp when are you going to grow up now now a woman carried two thin plastic bags that were heavy with vegetables eddie asked her in stuttered italian if she knew where immacolata borelli lived the woman looked through him as if he didnt exist and he repeated the name but she walked past him he didnt know where the street ended where the vicolo vicaria began but he did not think via forcella was long maybe two hundred yards everyone should know her a man stopped in the centre of the street a dog squatted and defecated a cat crouched at his feet and chewed gristle from a bone and a scooter swept by them the man had paused to light his pipe eddie asked if he knew please where immacolata borelli lived the man gaped at him eddie said the name again the match burned until it touched the skin of the mans fingers then the man pushed past he stepped in the dogs mess four square in it and seemed not to care the kids were behind and level with him if he faced them they met his gaze they made a cordon behind him when a car came down and it had to hoot for them to give space two men sat at a table on the street and the car slowed to get past them eddie saw they had dominoes he stood over the table waited for a play to be made expected that one would look up but neither did so he interrupted the game he asked once more did they know where in the via forcella the home of immacolata borelli was he couldnt read the faces tanned cracked as if the skin was old leather or the eyes but one spat and the brightness lay on a cobblestone beside eddies trainer and the game went on he was confused he didnt understand why she lived there it was poverty so were parts of dalston corners of hackney hoxton and haggerston but he did not see any of the pockets of wealth anything of quality the small areas that had been tarted up as there were in his corner of london he thought he sounded like his father but it had been clear enough on the scrap of paper borelli via forcella zip code napoli he stood outside a shop that sold bread rolls and cake he was taken inside as the queue moved in and the kids were left on the pavement now the scooter was with them and the engine was gunned he reached the counter he asked for the home of the borelli family said that he was looking for immacolata borelli the woman heard him eddie thought she considered what was requested of her he spoke the name again immacolata borelli the woman looked away from him and her eyes went to the next in the line her smile broad what did that customer want eddie went out of the shop bells clamoured in his mind a broken front door in a north london street and a police guard his mac never giving him an address or a phone number and she had disappeared this was her home and he was watched and no one in the street responded to his request for information the bells rang loudly what to do should he stop turn walk away and quit he didnt doubt that each person he had spoken to had known of immacolata borelli he swore stop no turn and walk away no quit he went on down the street and looked for the next man or woman to ask the kids and the scooter trailing him she talked of her mother had done since she had woken she had taken a perfunctory shower gobbled a roll gulped coffee and sat at the table drumming her fingers for the tape to be switched on an account she values is that with the dresdner bank i cant tell you the number its at fourteen karlliebknechtstrasse in leipzig its the first place cleaned money goes fixedrate deposits for six months she goes in october doesnt stay overnight since my fathers arrest she has a travel agent that routes her from reggio calabria to eastern germany on budget flights for german tourists the turnround time for the aircraft is sufficient for her meetings theres never less than eight million euros in the leipzig account and shes a generous supporter of the banks nominated charities you understand castrolami sat opposite her he was swivelled sideways and did not look at her or at the picture of gabriella borelli on the wall he didnt look at her because he was shaving had he faced her the action of the batterypowered machine would have interfered with the recording she couldnt tell with his cheeks and eyes away from her whether he was impressed by what she said or indifferent to it but he didnt prompt her perhaps immacolata thought he had turned on a tap and preferred not to interrupt the flow he shaved working the machine with three heads across his face his throat below and above his lips and she talked about the distribution of money where were the accounts placed in what banks in what cities she spoke of huge sums but he never raised his eyebrows in astonishment or disbelief the sun shone on her a maid sluiced the tiles of the kitchen floor orecchia lounged on a settee behind her and read his newspaper a socialist one that her father pasquale said was fit only for wiping a backside he never spoke or coughed or intruded in any way but his holster harness was round his shirt rossi was on the balcony and swept up dried leaves that had fallen from the plants in the ochre pots he would have been aware that he could be seen by the residents in other blocks so his holster was hitched on a chair she had fired a pistol but never at a human target had her mother perhaps but she didnt know she couldnt have said whether her mother killed by proxy vincenzo giovanni or the cold creepy one they used or had done it for herself it didnt matter after she had talked about money she would go on to killings with killings she might raise castrolamis eyebrows rossi swept diligently but sometimes she looked up and out through the opened glass doors to the terrace and she thought he watched her and each time she set her shoulders back and allowed her blouse to be stretched then he swept some more there had been no views from the apartment her brother rented in london or from the buildings they had occupied in sanita and forcella roofs water tanks satellite dishes and glimpses of the great mountain where the cap was missing here from collina fleming the view was exceptional clear skies above trees and an autostrada link below and a distant horizon of grey hazed hills on which clouds perched maybe she would live here have a maid who came in and cleaned finish accountancy courses and have diplomas set up in a small business with money provided by castrolamis people or the prosecutors people until she was able to support herself a new name and maybe meet someone have babies maybe the warmth filled the apartment but a small zephyr wind came with it immacolata had dreamed of her future and talked of her mother every april she goes to the societe generale bank on the road called la canebiere number fifteen in marseille she is driven to bari then flies to milan and connects to marseille she starts early she has lunch with her manager and is back the same evening they think shes a resident of milan that account is for more than two million euros and a plastic bucket on the balcony toppled she realised then that rossi had swept and now watered the pots he had kicked over the bucket she stopped that brought a reaction from castrolami a little hissed curse because she had been interrupted and the flow broken how am i doing you talk and we listen thats whats expected it was the place in a dream that she might live away from the dark drear streets of naples beyond the reach of sanita and forcella and the gaols at poggioreale and novara beyond the reach of the hands that would be scrabbling for her eyes please i want to go out now wariness clouded castrolamis face you know whats dictated no phone calls no meetings no contacts signorina immacolata theyll kill you i want to buy food i want to cook he sighed she thought him confused he had finished shaving now he opened the head of the machine and blew the mess out on to the floor what other banks outside italy does your mother use and well shop and ill cook yes the other banks she doesnt visit it but meets a representative in turin each january the danske bank in stockholm on norrmalmstorg in spain in madrid the family uses the banco santander for fixedterm deposits her mind had drifted it was where she could be could settle could live could make a new family his mobile rang the noise insistent clamoured in his pocket he had tried to emphasise that he shouldnt be called when he was with the pentita immacolata borelli unless to be given information of seismic importance they had gone beyond european banks were now in the cayman islands a swiss bank and had just talked through greek cyprus a larnaca branch she stopped and he switched off the tape he listened it was the message he had expected he might have been surprised had it not surfaced the previous evening a naples newspaper cronaca had telephoned the palace of justice and asked for guidance on a rumour in the forcella and sanita districts that immacolata borelli twentyfiveyearold daughter of pasquale and gabriella borelli was collaborating was the rumour confirmed or denied he was told that time had been bought that the prosecutor was unavailable in meetings and that the press office could neither confirm nor deny but only a few hours could be bought he thanked the caller and pocketed the mobile they had had the gentle hours he imagined the word racing through the district of her birth and childhood as it had with an alfieri a contini a misso and a giuliani but for it to be a girl pretty educated intelligent would captivate the city he did not hide news good or bad it should be spelled out he said its rumoured in naples that immacolata borelli is an infame word is out and on the streets they would spit at your picture if they had you in via forcella they would stamp on you until your breath had gone if you ever believed there was a time for turning back its gone now i shall ask you a very serious question what is there anything in your life that i should know about which you have not told me signorina immacolata is there anything that can be exploited a weakness no should i believe you you insult me she looked at her best when she was angry but and it troubled castrolami the sunlight was reflected on to the white marble floor and her eyes making them black pockets he liked to look deep into the eyes when he was deciding whether a suspect was truthful or lied he could not see hers he thought her strong and that she would need to be strong he said in an hour maybe we will go to the piazza where the stalls are and you can shop i think youll find that a chic corner of rome is more expensive than forcella or any part of naples and probably the produce is inferior that we give permission is a gesture of trust she didnt thank him he thought her an enigma tough and vulnerable resolute and frightened hard and pliant he didnt yet know her didnt know whether he ever would whether a gesture of trust was misplaced she had shuffled towards him salvatore watched the approach of anna borelli grandmother to the family and icon in the clan he had heard she had been the strength behind her man that the clan would not have prospered without her and that she was the worst woman in naples to make an enemy of he knew her to have been born in the year mussolini had launched from naples the march on rome that elevated him to power he knew her to have been married in when her husband had come out of hiding from military conscription and posting to montenegro he knew her to have stepped back from the running of the clan in the middle s when its strength was assured and pasquale was given authority knew that she had paramount importance in the clans territory she came close to him she was frail with bent shoulders and walked with a stick to mitigate her rheumatism she had cropped white hair but her clothes were always ebony black if she ever smiled he hadnt seen it if she ever laughed he hadnt heard her she paused outside a hardware shop and he saw her examining brooms weighing the advantages of one against another she was worth by whatever calculation millions of euros but fingered brooms to decide whether one that cost three euros was as good value as one that cost five he came close to her and the owner of the shop who had been solicitous and grovelling as if to royalty stepped back to give him room and privacy he said grandmother it is a time of maximum danger to the clan nonna the wolves circle because they believe us weak nonna without pasquale gabriella and vincenzo and with the bitch immacolata whoring with the palace we need leadership or well disintegrate everything you and carmine achieved will be lost unless you lead now your lives will have been wasted i beg you take control fight umberto can find me but in extreme emergency call this he slipped a piece of paper into her clawed hand he relied on her memory in her eightyeighth year to absorb the number he was satisfied she would have done so within an hour with total sincerity salvatore said we depend on you nonna and on carmine if were led well follow if we dont fight were dead and the whore has killed us he walked away from her at an entry fifty metres down the via forcella from the hardware shop he paused in the shadow the priest passed her the bastard priest from the church of san giorgio maggiore should have been shot and she didnt acknowledge him salvatore thought she bartered with the shop owner for a discount on the broom and for certain she would be given it there were many who would delight in dancing on his corpse and many who would queue for the privilege of dropping him he reached his man fangio put on the helmet with the smokedglass visor and was gone it was perplexing to him frustrated annoyed failing and unable to get sense from anyone eddie deacon beaded on the priest perplexingly the priest walked in the centre of the street and scooters swerved to pass him going either way and the street was lined with shoppers and gossipers old and young and no one spoke to him he was young no more than thirty with a rounded chubby face but there was no cheer in it pallor and tiredness characterised him he had come out of a courtyard through tall iron gates the school had the name annalisa durante eddie sidled towards the priest a quick sidestep like a soccer players swerve and the priest had passed eddie called after him no response but the priests step quickened he fastened on the back of the man had to he had been the length of the street and must have asked a dozen people where the borelli home was and had not received one coherent answer the kids followed him still but not with intensity he didnt think they regarded him as threatening more as a curiosity but they were behind him and hed noted that each time he asked the boy on the scooter quizzed the person hed spoken to the sun came higher he sweated strips of light and warmth knifed on to the street from the alleys more people were out if he met eyes they were averted if he smiled it was not returned he didnt know what else to do but followed the priest the spark had gone out for him as if hope was extinguished so alone the priest went up the steps of the church and into it eddie had that sense of being the stranger and unwanted in the stone slabs beside the main door at about the level of a mans head there were chip marks two scars where the stone had been gouged he followed the priest inside cool and quiet enveloped him they walked rossi led and he wore a lightweight poplin jacket so that his shoulder harness was covered she followed with castrolami alongside her orecchia behind they went down a sideroad from the block where the parked cars had been in place all summer the bonnets and windscreens coated with the fine dust that came from the north african deserts carried on the winds the hill where they had brought her was empty of residents still holidaying in the south or at the sardinian resorts that would have been why they had shipped her in here there were so few people in the apartments and on the roads the dogs had not been taken to the southern beaches but abandoned to the care of maids and porters they threw themselves at the balcony railings immacolata had forgotten almost the ferocity of the sun but there were many things to be forgotten she walked with a good step and rossi had to sense her pace and stretch his stride to keep ahead of her they went past the entrance to a tennis club and she glimpsed the pool azure blue and the loungers the borelli family had not been able in naples to belong to a club where tennis was played and there was a pool so immacolata didnt play tennis and couldnt swim different worlds and this one closed to her by the dictate of the clans security but there were clubs like this in posilippo and pozzuoli north up the coast there was a clinic and more apartments set back with different dogs and different porters then the road ducked down and ran beneath a roof of pine branches castrolami said conversationally we put you in a tower block on the north side or on the east side of rome and on every floor women are looking to see who is new its an intelligencegathering system unavoidable you know that its the same in a tower in naples we put you in a small town near firenze pisa or on the adriatic you open your mouth and they hear you naples and they hear us outsiders and they think that mafia scum is being hidden among them and there are demonstrations perhaps violence because they despise you and believe you contaminate their society its good here because were among the people who dont know the mafia but hate the vat officials and the revenue investigators and who seek to live in privacy if however they believed that a collaborating criminal had been brought here there would be outrage and the accusation that weve reduced the worth of their property we dont flaunt you and when they come back from holiday well think again look at the budget and move on there was an old bridge over the river ahead they had left the shade of the trees and gone under a sixlane road she could see over the parapet wall that the tibers level was down it looked played out not like a famous river he didnt answer her she thought they would keep her in the fine apartment while they stripped the meat of what she knew then ship her on when only the bones remained castrolami said the bridge is the ponte milvio one of the most important in the city it was built by gaius claudius nero more than two thousand years ago constantine won a great battle at the bridge in ad its been repaired many times then a new phenomenon three years ago young people in love were attracted to it put padlocks on the lamppost and threw the keys into the river so many padlocks the bigger and heavier they were the greater the love were fastened there that the lamppost collapsed for a few months there was a virtual lamppost on the web but now the mayor has put steel columns on the bridge and its possible to fix padlocks again do you find that interesting she shook her head decisively quietly his response no you wouldnt because you assured me that you do not at present have a lover you told me so we should cross the road rossi had already done so it was a fast thought only a brittle image of him in a park and in a small grubby house then laughter the smoothness of skin and she followed rossi and castrolami was holding her arm she didnt think she was a prisoner but that he guided her between cars and vans in her mind she had a list she had shopped twice every week for food to cook for vincenzo and his friends and once a fortnight she had gone to the street market to buy enough to make a meal for him and his friends it was a market far superior to those in london laid out in splendour stalls stacked high every variety and every choice but of a lower standard to that of the piazza mercato and what was had been her home she turned tapped her hip pocket to show it was empty pulled out the lining of a side pocket grimaced laughed orecchia passed her a teneuro note and castrolami was taking his time pecking in his wallet so she leaned forward and took a twenty from it rossi gave her a ten immacolata chose veal and was about to point out the size of the fillets she wanted when she felt the pressure of castrolamis fingers on her arm she indicated and he spoke she had learned she selected potatoes spinach and green beans and castrolami took the notes from her and paid she bought tomatoes and peppers button mushrooms and onions and at another stall there was cream and cheese on the way out at the far end of the covered market there were wines and spirits and castrolami bought one bottle from friuli and she queried it with a gesture then pointed to him rossi orecchia and herself one bottle he tapped his own chest and the other mens then shook his head she could drink they would not they didnt take the bags from her she carried three and castrolami two it was hotter might have reached the eighties and no breeze came off the river in london if she had shopped with him he would have carried the bags in naples a footsoldier would have carried her shopping just as he would have parked the car and waited a respectful pace behind her as she chose perhaps it was the glance she gave castrolami that prompted him he said if they carry your shopping it would impede their shooting if they had to shoot it would be in your defence a shopping bag doesnt help in aiming and firing she thought again he had insulted her she walked faster away from him and slowed only when she was a pace behind rossi the padlocks on the bridge were in her mind if shed been there with him which of them would have taken the key made the statement of love and thrown it out into the slack water castrolami was with orecchia they were fifteen paces behind the young woman and kept that distance and castrolami listened to the older man who lived and ate with the criminals who collaborated and slept near them and held a grip maybe a loose one on sanity you ask me how shell be you want to know if shell fall early or late or stay on her feet and be strong enough for the court to castrolami it was a pain to be endured some investigators and detectives were easy in the company of criminals could go to weddings and birthday parties and survive allegations of corruption not castrolami he detested being with them i was with one from your city and youll have known him he walked out of the door one morning and the next we heard he was in the secondigliano area of naples or perhaps scampia whichever he had taken a train from the north a week afterwards we heard hed arrived home and was on the street dead one bullet middle of the forehead wed been with him for four months time and resources wasted castrolami remembered him police not carabinieri had handled his defection he walked slowly felt burdened there was another we had him in genoa for a whole year with his wife his mother his aunt her mother and three children we brought him to caltanisetta to give evidence against twenty prime sicilian fuckpigs we dressed him in his good suit a clean shirt and a tie and drove him to the courthouse he smiled and said he now wished to renegotiate his terms like his evidence was a piece of goddam property more money a better allowance or no evidence we had twenty men in the cage and were waiting on his testimony we agreed the new terms won the conviction then the agreement was torn up i dont know now whether hes alive or dead castrolami knew there was a segment of opinion influential which believed too many had been allowed to become a collaboratore di giustizia that too much was given them it was an easy way to win convictions with the crimes of the camorra or the mafia there was little opportunity for gathering forensic evidence less chance of finding eye witnesses prepared to face down intimidation and go public in court the collaborator the infame was an attractive solution ive seen little of her but we were given some notes before her arrival i read of the leukaemia death her supposed friend perhaps it was merely that the guilt needed a trigger or perhaps the emotion was real now you talk to her about her mother her brothers but you havent played a big card its there castrolami faced him they were now on the rough narrow road that went up beneath the pines im not trying to teach you your job but id milk the disease to be verbally abused physically assaulted in a cemetery at a burial is no small matter use it twist it work it my advice dottore there isnt a living human being whom she loves make good with the dead they trudged on orecchia was fitter than castrolami and climbed the hill easily he could see in front the haughty swing of her hips the priest came from a side door a cleaner who polished the altar silver had said he would be there soon but it had been an hour the measure of eddies stress lethargy lost nerve was that he had been prepared to sit out the hour on a shadowed pew only moving to do something he had not attempted before he had made a donation taken a candle and lit it then sat some more when the priest came through the side door the cleaner went to him pointed to eddie and returned to his polishing the priest approached his short hair rimless glasses and creased cassock made no concession to style he sat on the bench beside eddie who introduced himself then asked for immacolata borelli oh yes the priest knew immacolata borelli his eyes flashed and his back straightened eddie warmed where would he find her home there was no immediate response he thought the priest considered eddie ignorant didnt understand why if the priest knew should he hesitate eddie innocent did not comprehend sadness fell on the face of the priest as if he had made a decision that wounded him he sighed stood up and the sadness was wiped away the face was devoid now of expression he took eddie down the aisle and eddie paused to put a fiveeuro note into the box for the repair of the church he was led out into the brightness the kids waited on the far side of the street and watched with the boy on the scooter the priest pointed far down the via forcella eddie could just make out the fruit and vegetables stall that protruded into half of the streets width beyond it was the fish stand the priest said that the door between the fruit and vegetables and the fish was the home of the grandparents of immacolata borelli for a moment his head was beside the two scars on the stone then he backed away eddie had been past those stalls twice had asked in the tabaccaio opposite and been ignored when he turned to thank the priest the church door was already closed what should he have done what should he have said to the foreign boy a fool who came to forcella and asked for the home of carmine and anna borelli what was his responsibility too tired he had deflected the problem had done as he was asked and had not accepted responsibility the foreign boy wanted to meet immacolata and he could picture her the granddaughter of carmine and anna borelli it had been her brother the middle of their three grandsons who had fired the two pistol shots at a predecessor it was too much for him to take on as personal responsibility fear stalked him fear corroded principle decency courage he had no stomach for the war on the streets he had crumpled predecessors had fought the culture of criminality in forcella and been broken or had moved away in indecent haste or were in rome under police guard he could justify to himself that he could have done nothing to divert the foreigner from visiting the grandparents of immacolata borelli and she was the only one of them with perhaps a thimbleful of charity and goodness he felt cold in the church shivered and crossed himself the allies had reached naples the fascists had fled an opportunity had arrived the troops british and american reached the city on october and within a week the fortunes of the infant borelli clan had prospered carmine out of gaol would never deny that the first moves of anna his young wife were integral to them she had opened the brothel it was the first to function within a short walk of the seafront where american officers were billeted in the sequestrated hotels she brought in women from all classes of neapolitan society they shared common features acute hunger extreme poverty the ambition only to survive it was on a small courtyard where the walls of two buildings were held up by timber supports a third side had taken a direct hit during a bombing raid it was within a stones throw of the palazzo sessa home of sir william hamilton emma and horatio nelson and the officers trooped there the women anna borelli recruited began work with the puffiness in their faces that came from nearfatal starvation but food supplies came with the patrons and silk stockings lipsticks chocolate and cigarettes they were the wives of stallholders and lawyers of labourers and advocates of streetsweepers and civil servants soon they had colour in their cheeks and they started to eat well their families too there were mornings when a queue of women dressed in their best had formed outside the heavy front door to plead for the opportunity to be fucked by gis and anna took the most attractive the most sexually experienced she did not employ uninitiated teenage girls the gis wanted women who did not waste time were easy to penetrate who knew the trade it was said among the women who came to work at noon and went home at midnight that in the first days anna borelli herself had lain under the gross belly of an american lieutenant colonel that she could make him squeal like a spiked boar and the security of the building was guaranteed the war of carmine borelli was fitful called up on his eighteenth birthday the papers instructed him on which barracks in the town he should report to and the day after he went into hiding courting anna while he was on the run and dodging raids by the fascist police coming out of hiding for the day his marriage to anna in the church of san giorgio maggiore being informed on and arrested the following evening a question never asked and therefore never answered how was anna borelli so skilled in lovemaking after one night with her nineteenyearold husband that she could so successfully entertain the american lieutenant colonel after two years in poggioreale gaol he was freed by allied forces after he had woven a tale of a young persecuted liberal democrat imprisoned for his beliefs he had found the first employees of his wife in cubicles wide enough for a bed a chair and a narrow table for a washstand and had shaken the hand of the lieutenant colonel in the hallway ignoring the mans apparent intimacy with his wife they had together not looked back within weeks she had opened two more brothels within months he had become a king in the blackmarket sale of goods brought by the americans into the naples docks and he had started his mercato nero with those stockings cans of food packs of cigarettes coffee sugar and chocolate that the first customers had given his wife by way of a gratuity first a handcart then a small closedsided van then a flatbed lorry then many lorries and always protection from the military government and the question he never asked of his wife it was in the bloodstream of both the search for power authority and wealth bred microbes in their veins which they had never lost he had walked down the street from the church past the shops that were now familiar to him past the men who sat and played cards or dominoes and past the madonna figures in niches in the stonework where candles burned and flowers drooped he had paused beside the fishsellers stand and had watched water from a fine spray fall on the swordfish he had never seen a swordfish and this one was more than five feet long its sword another four and he realised the outer door was open he could have sworn on oath that it had been closed the previous times hed gone by he had known then that the kids or the scooter rider had forewarned them he said simply i came to find immacolata the old man had americanaccented english you knew her in london you knew her well the old woman had a crows croak and spoke english do you sleep with her do you do fuckfuck with her he blushed eyes pierced him the coarseness of the question neither unnerved him nor seemed peculiar almost in this place natural they were both he estimated in their eighties he sensed that they moved with difficulty were in pain and near the door there had been a stand of walkingsticks the room he was in was furnished eddie thought expensively but with hideous taste chrome plastic fluffy pinkish the phd man in the house in dalston would have called it kitsch and his mothers lip would have curled in disdain he noticed there were no photographs not a picture of immacolata or of a man who would have been her brother or of her parents everyone his mother knew all her friends had homes littered with photographs of grandchildren shelves and surfaces groaning under them the question its vulgarity almost amused eddie but the eyes of the old woman pierced him with a brightness that suggested she harboured a degree of humour he would not have dared to lie to her yes the old woman shrugged there are many girls why come to find immacolata i think because i love her you know what i mean yes i love her she said something to the old man eddie didnt know what she reached up from her chair caught the collar of his shirt tugged his face down and spoke into his ear then moved her head to let him speak into hers but her eyes stayed on eddie the old woman asked if immacolata loved him he thought she used the word love as if it was strange to her but he reckoned that was because she was struggling with the language he wondered how she had learned english what call this peasant woman had had to speak it he repeated and amplified i hope she was in love with me at least very fond of me we were very happy together she tugged again at her husbands shirt collar her small spider fingers scratched at the material of his shirt pulled and jerked his head down she was like him in her eightyeighth year but her memory was as sharp as the day he had come back to her from the poggioreale and she had told him without a balance sheet to read from the finances of the brothel she murmured the numbers given her by salvatore he would have had to write them down her mouth to his ear her ear to his mouth as he repeated the numbers she told carmine that it was equal to a gift from the virgin and ignored his shock at what he considered inappropriate almost blasphemy that leverage against the bitch had walked through the front door presented itself giftwrapped he understood anna would go to the kitchen make coffee and take cake from the tin he carmine would go into the hallway and telephone he repeated the number again what they knew of the english language american was from the days when the troops had been in naples good days the best he a king and she a queen the fingers loosed his collar he smiled at the young man hoped it a smile of friendship and there was a girlish charm about his wifes smile which he thought as insincere and sweet as the smile she had used for her customers more than sixty years before the same smile and no truth in it she said she would make coffee and bring cake and she said that carmine would go and telephone that there was a man who knew where immacolata was and please would the young man wait a little there was an image of long ago never forgotten a shared cell in the southwest block of the poggioreale a spider huge whose territory was the angles between the brickwork the bars and the grimy glass of the window it had a web that extended nearly a metre across and half a metre high and the prisoners bet each evening in cigarettes how many new flies would be trapped in the daylight hours and eaten at night the spider was esteemed and admired its body the size of a matchbook it trapped the ignorant and the innocent she went to prepare coffee and bring cake and carmine went into the hall leaving the young man alone there was excitement on the young mans face always to fight against the testimony of an infame the bitch whore who was his granddaughter there must be leverage only that applied with extreme violence could destroy the most feared threat to the clans the informer turncoat and traitor his was the cleanest and bestpolished window of any in the long line looking out on to the central walkway on the third floor of the sail he was davide he spent many hours each week with a bucket and a rag washing his windows outside and in he used warm water and soap then a disintegrating cloth to dry them he sprayed them with polish then used a dry cloth to take off the last of the filth that had accumulated on the glass those who lived in the box apartments crumbling from neglect on either side of him regarded the occupant of with tolerance and amusement many in the sail a gigantic architectural monstrosity existed with mental aberration it was a dumping ground for the socially challenged and the medical misfits on the eastern extremity of naples the district of scampia had achieved notoriety as a supermarket of drugs a killing ground in clan warfare and as a place where the city authorities could dump the detritus of the citys population davide was among the rubbish placed there and he seemed to eke a minuscule living from delivering messages and packages for one of the comando piazza who flourished around the sail and small handyman tasks davides home was on one of the lower floors of a building that had become a cult symbol of ugliness the lower floors where no is found represent the hull and level decking of a yacht with ten storeys of floors above the deck there is a towering sailshaped construction vertical at the mast on the far end from davides location but terraced down for another ten levels it has always been known as the sail of the seventy thousand listed in the most recent census as living in scampia and its tower blocks some eleven thousand are in this architects eccentricity some call the different levels and ends of the sail by colours and others know each block there as a lotta davide was a resident of lotta h which was green and which had the franchise to market heroin already refined through his wellcleaned windows davide observed much of the trade and the sight of him in his handkerchiefsized living room the television blaring and only a side light on was familiar to the lookout the seller and the comando piazza who ran them and to the magazzinieri who held the stockpiles of the narcotic and even to the level of aquirenti who purchased in bulk and bought from the capo of the clan that had authority in the sail all from the top of the tree to the bottom knew of the demented old fool who spent hours on the windows bringing them to a brilliant shine and left his apartment not more than once a week he was almost always there and when he was not outside and windowcleaning he was hunched in a chair with the curtains open to others he was deltafoxtrot and valued too valuable to be burned by the routine of drugs trafficking salvatore came he had left the van with dark bloodstains on the tyres from where a stomach had burst when it was driven over and was at the door he was met by carmine borelli he was briefed he thought the old man panted as if some rare delight hooked him anticipation sometimes salvatore found that his own breath spurted in the moment that he lifted a pistol and aimed it he thought it would have been perhaps before he was born that the old man had last made operational decisions he was revelling in the chance to live again the talk was short as it should have been he broke away chuckled to himself the young man who had screwed immacolata in london who loved her would find that the bitchs sweat the bitchs caresses and the bitchs groans came expensive carmine borelli had said the young man screwer of immacolata was an idiot and would not make any difficulty the radio that morning had quoted an unnamed official in the palace of justice as stating no equivocation that the borelli clan was history a broken reed he saw nothing in the street that gave cause for anxiety the fishseller tomasso had had the pitch in the via forcella for twelve years his father for the twentythree before him short but broadshouldered and thick at the waist he had cropped hair controlled stubble good jeans a goodquality shirt and good shoes what he wore was good because he sold fine fish fresh from the market that morning there were however matters relevant to the state of mind tomasso enjoyed that were not generally known to those who dictated the economics of his fish stall his fathers cousin had a boat that fished from the harbour at mergellina but two years before tomasso had been told by the borelli clan that he must only buy fish landed from the boats they owned he had not complained and had acquiesced because his chance of obtaining another pitch was minimal now also he must pay to the clan a hiked pizzo for the right to put the stall in that place also now he must supply fish at cutprice to the trattoria two streets away at less than cost because the trattoria was owned by the clan the pesce spade huge with the malevolent eye frozen would have been taken by giovanni on a normal day and not paid for that had happened more often in the last months but the shitface hadnt come was in the cells at poggioreale and the cow who headed the clan was also in the cells and vincenzo who had sent the message by courier telling him where he could and could not buy they were in his opinion fucked but he knew what had been done last evening to a man who had shouted it tomasso kept quiet sold where it was possible but impotent anger burned in him where he stood close to his till and scales he was perhaps two metres from the door of the house where the old goat lived with his woman he had seen the young man go into the building had seen also that kids had come with him and a scooter boy and he had thought the young man a stranger the kids had still been in place on the far side of the road till two minutes ago everyone knew salvatore everyone who worked in the via forcella or in the sanita district knew the face of il pistole who had come and talked inside with the old goat had waved the kids away and gone he felt the tension ratchet and he was aware that the street quietly and without fuss was emptying the grocery was down the rue de bellechasse and lukas as was usual for him bought only the bread milk and eggs that he would eat in twentyfour hours nothing that would go sour or stale in the fridge if the apartment was indefinitely abandoned the red light had not been blinking when he had returned he had checked his post before he started on the cleaning as he did every day nothing that needed attention there was little enough for him to collect from the box by the main door a few utility bills offers of health insurance and holiday brochures never anything personal when he was away in a war zone or counterinsurgency theatre he always noted how men and women far from home yearned for mail from their families emails or phone calls didnt matter whether he yearned or not he wasnt getting any no envelopes came with spidery writing copperplate a big fist or one that was near indecipherable it was as if wanting or not he had no home and no folk who cared a shite so he built a wall surrounded himself and lukas cleaned he did the cleaning too about every day because he had the feeling always that he would go out through the front door lock it behind him and might survive or might not might go down in a black hawk over a shiite city in iraq and might get blown off a road by an ied outside kandahar and might fall off some dirt track in the mountains of central colombia he was like many of the gypsies who serviced the dirty little wars he didnt want to think of anyone making an entrance to collect his effects and puckering a forehead as they wondered where to start thinking that the man was an untidy jerk and had left a mess he might only have ten minutes between the telephone ringing or coming back in and having the red light alert him dragging the bag out from under the bed locking the door and starting the sprint for solferino metro he kept the place neat and just about in a state that no one could be sure that anyone had recently lived there all his washing went most days to the launderette even if it was just briefs singlet socks and a shirt when he had finished the cleaning it took all of a quarter of an hour he checked the laptop there were copies of the fulsome praise from dc that had come into ground force security and gratitude for his report the company didnt give him saccharine accolades for what he had achieved in the last trip knew that the sweet stuff was unwelcome lukas could have reeled off the story of disasters in the hostagerescue trade he didnt do celebrity and didnt want backslapping truth was the fear of failure gripped his gut more when he was in the field than the demands of success failure was a bodybag there had been enough for them never to be forgotten he wound up the cord of the vacuum cleaner that did the livingroom rugs and the bedrooms carpet ruby ridge was in lukass battle honours and nobody was keen to shout that one up to the clouds lukas if he had engaged in a discourse about his work which he never did would have said that ruby ridge up in the forests of idaho where it was wild enough for mountain lion had been the first pinpoint lesson of where a screwup had happened an innocent woman shot dead by official marksmen and a child and in return fire a us marshal killed then the circus of a fullblown fbicontrolled siege of ten days duration with a cast of maybe five hundred agents and millions paid by government in subsequent compensation lukas had not been senior had been then a marksman with the bureaus hostage rescue team and had seen a cockup played out close enough to smell the shit that emanated a good lesson for a rookie he had been far back from the front line overlooking the cabin and his remington model had never been out of its bag let alone loaded but he had seen played out before him how bad it could get he knew he walked a fine line between ruby ridge and the broken careers and the herogram stuff on his laptop he watched the telephone and thought it might be an opportunity to go visit his friend who did the artwork down by the river shit work and without talent but by a good friend the artist would never have heard of ruby ridge or seen the face of a hostage when it was frozen in death attached to or severed from the neck or incoherent and trembling in the moment after liberation lukas played the strings did god and he went round a last time with a duster when he closed the door he stood in the lobby for a moment and listened the bell did not ring he went off down the flights of stairs gerald seymour the collaborator eddie came out of the main door on the ground floor he had been told he would be met and taken to immacolata he saw a great deal in the moment he was on the outer step but he assimilated the importance of nothing the door swung shut behind him he caught a glimpse of it and the grandfathers old hand pocked with cancer scars that had heaved it too fast no chance to thank a van was parked on the street as if about to unload but nothing was taken from the tail doors and nothing was carried to them a pavement opposite had bustled and was now still the kids were not crowded in the street but further up the slope of via forcella and further down as if they formed a cordon and made a perimeter a man came forward and did not playact friendship a frown puckering his forehead a hand from the interior slid open a side door of the van the guy on the fish stall caught eddies eye the swordfish in ice beside him and held his gaze eddie had his hand in his pocket was reaching for a handkerchief must have been dust up his nose and in his throat he was about to sneeze a man closed on him came from the van and behind was a dark interior and sacking a rope trailing out of the opening the man on the fish stall held eddies eyes so much then for eddie deacon to assimilate time slowing the man coming slower people in the cafe opposite pirouetting their chairs to face away from the street but the pace of the movement slackening trying to understand the fishseller had that look unmistakable no argument with it like a warning shout but nothing passed his lips the quiet like fog settled on him but the sights were clearer he could not comprehend why the fishseller should give the warning he could only react to it the hands of the man reached towards him not open not in greeting clenched the veins stood out in his muscled arms like highways through the hairs eddie ripped his hand from his pocket and moved into that defensive stance as a boxer does trying to go forward on to the balls of his feet he had never since he was a child in a tantrum hit anyone he had never punched kicked gouged or bitten another adult he had only once intervened in a fight and played a hero and so fast his hand was only halfway up to protect his chin and throat when the fist of the man came at him he felt himself buffeted pain riddled his nostrils and there were tears in his eyes a grip tightened on his shirt and he was dragged forward he was pulled past the fishseller and saw nothing but a face without expression should he have tried to run no chance blocked by the van and the fish stall on its heavy trestle legs could see only the backs of the heads in the cafe opposite he was dragged forward and when he was close enough the mans knee exploded into eddies groin about the end of it his experience as a streetfighter real pain now he tried to double up which merely offered his jaw the chin to a shortarm hook punch he went into the side hatch of the van eddie was face down his head buried in a heap of loose sacking foulsmelling and tasting hard for him to breathe and he struggled but one fist was clamped in his hair and the other whipped his face used it as if it was a boxers training gear he stopped the struggle the door was slammed then all light went and a hood was over his head his arms were snatched down into the small of his back handcuffs snapped on he heard the tearing of heavyduty tape and his hood was lifted the tape fastened over his mouth and the van was moving the hands were at his legs and rope was wound round his ankles he heard the oath when the van must have hit a hole perhaps where a cobblestone was missing then the rope was lashed tight and tied he was helpless he wondered if he would hear sirens immediate pursuit there had been people in the cafe people further up the street and down it he imagined a phone call on a mobile alerting police to what had happened the hope died pretty bloody soon eddie realised that the van was not speeding there was no chase the driver went at the normal speed for morning traffic didnt hoot didnt weave didnt chase backdoubles and ratruns he thought the worst he was gone lost and it was hard to drag air into his lungs and could hear the breathing of the man sitting on the van floor close to him he didnt dare move because that would get him another thrashing truths came eddie deacon bloody idiot had blundered on to territory where he should not have been way back he should have walked home from the afghan place should have reached up and taken down the blowup of immacolata his mac folded it and put it deep in a drawer maybe under his socks he should not have gone with a street kid and burgled should not have jacked in work and taken a budget flight should not have walked down a street where no smile met his and no help requested was given he should not have trusted the old couple grandparents and providers of coffee cake and betrayal pretty damn obvious keep the idiot in place and send for the heavy squad what to do important not important why it had happened what to do mattered bitch and fight and get another beating go passive supine and give up the ghost lie still let the world move and try to bloody think he gave himself three alternatives he was bound at the ankles handcuffed at the wrists his mouth was gagged and a hood covered his face he had to make choices between alternatives would have to he did not know how long he was in the van lost track of time and would lose also the pain in his wrists where the cuffs bit he never heard a siren the fishseller tomasso came round his stall and bent low he believed it would be thought he retied the knot in his lace he hadnt moved from his place beside the cash box and the scales until life had returned to the via forcella chairs in the cafe had swivelled the pavement was filled and scooters swerved along the length of the street children poured out of the big gates of the school named after the girl who had been shot in crossfire annalisa durante a murder gang had come to kill the son of a more minor clan leader in the district tomasso watched the children six or seven the only evidence of innocence in the street he knew her parents who lived a dozen doors up and he knew what had been the fate of the priest then at the church on the corner with the via duomo who had denounced the clans and called for their elimination from the community he had seen the street return to normality then moved round his stall and bent to tie his shoelace he could reach also a few centimetres to the right of his shoe and slide his palm over the piece of paper that had fallen from the young mans pocket it had been at the moment that the hand came out fast in response to tomassos silent warning that the piece of paper had been dropped he slipped it into his breast pocket after glancing at it and realising what it was the priest who had stood against the clans and their culture after the killing of the teenager annalisa durante had had two shots fired at him when he paused on the steps of his church and now lived in rome he came back to naples rarely but always with an escort of police bodyguards there would be protection for a priest but not for a fishseller so he was careful in his movements he telephoned his uncle and asked him to come quickly subito immediately and mind the stall the paper in his pocket gave the name of a hotel and the room number while he waited he considered which route was quickest and hoped he might help when no other would a wretch in the gravest of danger to ring the police direct was a step too far immacolata was permitted to prepare the food she had heard the couriers motorbike outside the main gate to the block then the doorbell she had seen the plastic sack of tapes castrolami had taken across the living room into the hall and the door had been opened she had seen from the kitchens balcony the courier in black leathers load the sack into a pannier then ride off at speed spitting dust she washed vegetables scraped potatoes and brought the penne down from the upper shelf where the pasta was stored she had turned up the radio and did dance steps between the sink and the surfaces where the food was laid out for a few minutes she felt freedom perhaps for the first time orecchia and rossi had left her to herself and in those minutes she had expelled from her mind the scams deals fixes and hits of the clan and had filled the void with nothing she delighted in the emptiness of the black hole castrolami was at the door she was sluicing the spinach leaves had been measuring the penne in her mind was deciding on the mix of tomato puree and cream for the sauce she turned once saw his face must have had a smile on hers and the music from the radio lifted her her mother was gone her three brothers were gone via forcella was gone castrolami was at the door leaning on the jamb and watching her not sharing any form of pleasure he had destroyed the mood she saw no thanks no gratitude he looked at her as if she was a child wayward and not to be humoured yes we go back to work now i need only a few minutes and then im we start now castrolami said he reached across the work surface to the radio and killed the sound what is so important that it cant wait five minutes her hands were on her hips her feet apart her chin jutted she barked well what he scratched his leg then let his teeth run across his lower lip looked at the ceiling then said coldly and without apology its time to talk about leukaemia and about the death of a longstanding friend everything gone broken yes of course she threw the kitchen gloves into the bowl where they sank among the spinach leaves and the potato peel she yanked the tie loose on the apron hitched the strap over her head and let it fall to the floor she turned her back on the sink and the work surfaces and strode towards the door but he made no effort to back away almost she had believed she would be among colleagues now she realised she was alone enough he said well eat first the fishseller tomasso spoke with the day manager of the pensione giuseppe they had not met before but in the sparring for mutual contact for guarantees it was learned that a cousin of tomasso had been at middle school with giuseppes niece everyone who lived at street level in the city knew that there were times when a man took a grave risk times when he relied on trust he showed the piece of paper it was a big decision for him to say what he had seen but old enmities longfestering slights and past wrongs encouraged him the fishseller was rewarded the day manager had an address on a card filled in by a young englishman a point of contact he had done his bit played his part and was assured of virtual anonymity tomasso believed he had done right which was important to him giuseppe did not pay the pizzo the night manager did sometimes it was giovanni borelli who came for the small envelope and sometimes it was the younger son the little bastard and once it had been gabriella borelli who had been rude boorish first it had been the daughter immacolata borelli had arrived with a pocket calculator and demanded to see the books she had sat with the owner for an hour in the office at the back two men thugs had been with her and had loafed in the reception lobby they had known the night manager the day manager and the owner of a shift in authority in that district and that the borelli clan was now supreme there had been photographs in the cronaca of bodies lying in the streets the books had been shown to the daughter and the owner had not considered refusing to pay and informing the police immacolata with her calculator had decided how much should be paid each month the day manager was from genoa and worked in naples because his wife demanded to be near her widowed mother giuseppe hated the corruption of the city he found a number in england from the address given rang it and steeled himself for what he had to say there was the sound of a trapdoor slamming above him then a bolts scrape the impact pushed air across his hands but not through the hood covering his head he was on concrete now that the trapdoor was shut and the air from above was gone eddie sensed dampness around him for a while he lay still he tried to learn there were sounds at first clear and he thought feet moved immediately beside the trapdoor then heard low voices but the footfall and the words were soon muffled then gone he was uncertain as to whether he had heard an engine start the vans or a smaller noisier one like a scooters silence fell the quiet frightened him it was more intimidating he thought to have a curtain without noise draped around him than it had been at the moment of his capture violence speed pain scrambled tumbling images and thoughts the intimidation of the silence was intensified by the hood the gag the cuffs but the rope at his ankles had been untied he could after a fashion relate to his kidnap nothing like it had happened to him before obvious but it did in movies and books books didnt do the darkness and films didnt do the silence he could move on his backside could wriggle forwards backwards and sideways he started to explore the concrete floor was not wet but moist he had been dragged out of the van and had slipped his head had careered into the bottom of the side hatch and the impact had dazed him but the hold on him had not slackened he had heard a door unlocked ahead and had been propelled through it then down some steps on the steps he had stumbled again and fallen forwards unable to use his arms to protect his face the hands gripping him had let him go and eddies shoulders had taken his weight against the wall but his nose had bled he had been held upright in a room a basement or more likely a cellar and the trapdoor had been lifted and his ankles freed hands had held him under the armpits and he had felt his feet dance in a void like a hanged mans he had been lowered into the space and then as his feet had made contact with concrete he had been shoved violently sideways so that he collapsed and was prone then the trapdoor had been shut now he moved with the grace of damaged reptile across the floor to learn about his surroundings eddie had to manoeuvre himself backwards so that his fingers could touch and feel he made calculations he reckoned he was in a bunker dug into the earth below a cellar and that its dimensions were six feet by eight the sides were of breeze blocks and the mortar holding them was crudely applied in a corner there were two sacks heavyduty plastic and well filled something now was worse than the darkness and the silence he imagined the hood over his head had once been a pillowcase on a childs bed maybe since then it had been used as a rag to clean floors windows or lavatory seats the smells in it were deep in his nostrils bad enough not to be able to breathe through his mouth worse when the passage into his nose was clogged with the hoods stench eddie found he could tilt his back against a wall and wriggle his body downwards while his head and the hood had contact against the roughness of the mortar the movements eased the hem of the hood upwards he scratched his shoulders against the barbed edges of the mortar and might have drawn more blood but the hem was lifted from the nape of his neck then to the back of his skull and on to the crown it was important to him that he did this since the street and the slamming of the door behind him the eyecontact with the fishseller and the raising of his hands eddie had done nothing for himself had been like a bloody vegetable he shook his head violently rotated it waggled it the hood came off a different air and a different smell were on his face and in his nose he thought it a victory there was no light in the bunker all he could see now with the hood off was a thin outline where the trapdoor sides met the ceiling it was set in and one pinpoint where there must have been a flaw in one of the trapdoors planks he stood he couldnt straighten to his full height and reckoned the bunker was five feet high it was a victory that he had shed the hood and the guys in the house in dalston would have rated it a revenue clerk a clubland waiter a ticket seller and a workshy phd student would have seen the value of success shortlived the sense of that victory eddie wanted to pee he had crawled backwards around the bunkers walls and found the filled sacks but no bucket with his wrists held in the small of his back he couldnt drop his zip he hadnt wet his trousers since he was five on a school outing also gone with the sense of victory was the belief that the guys in dalston would have the faintest comprehension of being in darkness and feeling the urge to wet their trousers he slumped he could hear nothing no vehicles no music no voices and no sirens it was as if he had gone off the face of the earth fight be passive or think time for eddie deacon to face the alternatives and make a choice time to wonder why it had happened he sat against the sacks with only the bloody darkness and the bloody silence for company the bladder pressure grew and he knew that the fear would return it was a gesture of his newfound defiance carmine borelli left his stick propped in the corner inside the doorway he had swallowed three nurofen tablets the strong ones washing them down with cold water he knew that anna would watch him from a high window and he would be tonguewhipped if he failed between the clans that were labelled camorra there was no overall authority no consensus of leadership on the island of sicily cosa nostra groups acknowledged the disciplines imposed by a cupola a cabinet of principals there was a predictability and a certainty about the future not so in naples a clan was dead when power was lost now the borelli clan teetered on the brink of oblivion the drugs compensated for his leaving behind his stick the pain from his rheumatism was controlled in old age carmine watched much daytime television and flipped between the satellite channels so many dealt with the big animals of the african plains elephant and lion and buffalo when their teeth failed and they could no longer forage or when their muscles and strength failed or when their eyesight was gone and their keen hearing the great beasts were pushed aside by the young many afternoons he had sat in his chair and watched as an old elephant lion or buffalo was killed or pushed aside and left to starve as brutal as naples he had shaved closely and wore a suit with a laundered shirt and a tie his thick hair was slicked back with gel and anna had wiped the dust off his shoes he felt himself born again he walked down the street where a man had been taken from a bar and shot in the leg then driven over salvatore was a halfpace behind him while a dozen of the young men who wanted to be enforcers and had tried to find favour with his son pasquale and daughterinlaw gabriella fanned out around him carmine wore his suit jacket open the jacket flapping from his walk the butt of the pistol in his waistband there to be seen salvatore had a fist buried in a deep pocket that bulged and some of the young men carried wooden staves or pickaxe handles if he was not on the street and not exercising authority his clan area would be lost it would not be gone over a year or six months but in a day his right hip hurt in a throbbing ache to compensate he put more weight on his left knee and experienced stabs of pain there he kept walking his smile broad some of the older men gathered in doorways they had been on the payroll in the early days of power when the city was devastated by bombing the sewers were fractured epidemics rife and money was to be made now they called the name he had once been given then now he was il camionista the lorry driver because he had had the first fleet of trucks on the road the permit the petrol and the goods they transported from the americans he had skewered his way into so much in those incredible prosperous days he had been told and had believed it that a third of all cargo landed by the americans ended up on the stalls of the street traders in naples a good proportion of it in the via forcella food clothing oil best of all was the copper wire used for the allies telephone communications it fetched massive prices his people cut down the wire before the first connection was made he acquired good business from funerals he could arrange for a price to summon that successful cousin from rome whose intellect and wealth enhanced a sad day and therefore lifted the prestige of the bereaved family nothing had been beyond carmine borelli but it was sixtyfive years ago that he had been known as il camionista the younger men looked at him questioningly they would have thought pasquale borelli already in gaol gabriella borelli also in gaol vincenzo giovanni and silvio in gaol and the whore of a granddaughter singing to the palace of justice where was the power would the misso clan take it or the contini clan or would a new boy come out of the shadows was the old guard already dead or moving only in the last spasms at the cafe from which a customer had been taken and killed the owner brought out a small tray of bogus silver with coffee and a brandy aperitif carmine drank the coffee first then the alcohol and stifled successfully the choke that rose in his throat further down the street a haberdasher who was three days late in payment of his pizzo thrust the envelope into carmines hand murmured apologies and said he had put in extra he had been on the street for five or six minutes and little time was left had the man actually said that carmine borelli was an old drunk and useless fit only to pleasure himself in a chair had he who had heard him he had been kept for an hour to wait and sweat in a lockup behind the butchers would have squatted among the bones and offal waiting for disposal some had said they had heard him say carmine borelli was fit only to take his penis in his own hand it was enough that a rumour of what the man had said was abroad carmine borelli had not risen to the position of clan leader by clemency and charity it would be done on the street in his time leading the clan he had killed it was estimated thirtysix men with his own hand and had ordered the proxy killing of at least another sixty it was high risk it was about authority and respect it would be done on the street in public view in daylight so that none could say carmine borelli slunk in the shadows the man was brought out carmine recognised him the man knelt on the pavement two of the footsoldiers produced plastic bags for garden fertiliser and held them close to the mans head he gibbered carmine had known the mans father his uncles and his mothers family many said he was an idiot and certifiable but he shot him he had not killed for twenty years he shot him low in the forehead at a point equidistant between the eyes blood spouted but was trapped by the plastic bags had carmine wanted to run he could not have the damaged joints in his knees and hips prevented it salvatore took the pistol from him and was gone he turned his back on the man who should have been in an asylum and was crumpled on the pavement and made his way back to the via forcella he hoped he had sent a message or he too would be on the pavement he would not give up the clan would not see it cannibalised his hand shook from the impact of the pistol when it had fired he was out of the street by the time he heard the sirens they would take the corpse to the ospedale degli incurabili then to the mortuary the police and the carabinieri would come if he carmine borelli was named by a witness as the killer his authority was sand dribbling between his fingers if the investigators and detectives met the familiar wall of silence there remained a small chance he could resuscitate the clan meaningless if the whore didnt break with her interrogators he stopped at several more shops small craftsmens businesses and showed himself he thought it the best of fortune that a fool had come from england and had talked the rubbish of love for the whore by the time he reached his main door beside the fishsellers stall he would not be able to hide the limp the whore was the key the fool was critical he would go first to the home of a dear and longstanding friend and there he would strip and shower the fine suit and the shirt would be bagged and the change of clothes brought for him there by anna would be neatly laid out his friend would burn the clothes that carried the residue of the pistols firing his body would be clean of such traces and then he would go home after visiting a cafe where many would swear he had spent two hours if his authority held up as he walked carmine borelli shook his head it was so hard to believe that immacolata was the whore she wanted to dance orecchia refused and rossi declined more politely but as firmly she did not ask castrolami she had had the music up high volume castrolami had pushed his chair back from the table gone to the radio turned the volume down and talked of unwelcome complaints from the floor below they had said she cooked well that it was a fine meal and she had thought the praise insincere she did not dance in naples had not danced in london she was not trained to dance if she could dance with orecchia or rossi she thought she might dominate whichever man held her they had eaten what she had put in front of them but not had second helpings it was not disguised she believed they would have preferred to hit the freezer and do defrosts in the microwave she stood up went round the table worked her hips and let her hands drop first on orecchias shoulders then on rossis neither reacted when she was opposite castrolami he looked at her she stared at him and undid an upper button on her blouse he looked away she fell back on temper she didnt wait for them to clear the table of glasses and the cheese plate she scooped up what she could carry and made as great a noise as possible by dropping them into the bowl in the sink on top of the pans she had used for the meat and the pasta the knives forks and spoons she expected them to come running their voices were low in the dining room immacolata went back for the wine bottle and her glass then stalked again to the kitchen there was enough in the bottle to fill her glass the men had only drunk water she ran a tap noisily put the soap in everything could of course have gone in the dishwasher but then there would have been no noise no possibility of reaction she had noise not the reaction she sang made more noise immacolata washed and stacked songs from naples where else could they be from she only knew songs from that city it was her life she heard him wheeze and turned tell me how it was for her in the last twentyfour hours of her life i want to know about the last hours of marianna rossettis life he stood in the kitchen doorway he was not then proud of himself seldom if ever was it was a job he couldnt bring himself to show sympathy or humanity had he done so the emotions would have been fraudulent the course he took was necessary for the job he gave nothing of himself to immacolata borelli she reacted was a little drunk it had not been a strong wine but shed put down most of a bottle she stared hard at him and her lips moved but no words came castrolami said i want to know about the last hours of marianna rossettis life if youve forgotten what you were told i can remind you would that be a good idea should your memory have failed you i have a note of what was said to you in the cemetery in nola i ask again tell me how marianna rossetti died what the leukaemia had done to her about the contamination does your memory need prompting the reaction was not aggression but as if a deep wound had opened the rawness exposed there was he thought an inner struggle do i have to yes castrolami said he squeezed it out of her as if from a tube that needed folding over and pressurising he heard how the father had spat beside her feet how her offer of the flowers had been rejected and she was called a whore he heard how the mother of her closest friend had used her fingers to rip her blouse and underwear had kicked her and she had fallen crushing the flowers dont gild it im not interested in you how you felt what they did to you im interested signorina in the last hours of your friend he said it harshly and had no regret her last days were marked by exhaustion very tired very lethargic no energy he thought she spoke like a machine and no emotion showed then bruises appeared all over her body but she had not hit herself or been hit the bruises were there she was very pale it was high summer in nola hot sunshine and she was so white anaemic she was taken to the doctor he knew immediately as soon as he had peered behind her eyes used that little torch he made the call to the hospital you miss nothing and you spare yourself nothing continue he tested her her toughness and resolve he had to strain to hear her but he didnt lean forward he stayed propped against the door jamb the doctor thought it too urgent for marianna and her mother to wait for an ambulance her mother drove her and they called her father from work he was told of the fast collapse of the patient the pain in the skull the uncontrolled internal bleeding the neurosurgeon arriving too late the failed resuscitation how did she contract the disease that took her life that left her in her last hours without dignity and peace how being in the fields bathing in streams having gone close to where toxic waste was dumped who dumped the poison he was told that the father of marianna rossetti had said that the clan at nola had for more than twenty years paid for the toxic waste to be left in the fields the orchards and the riverbeds around the town the question i asked was who dumped the poison you have not yet answered it he was told that the transportation of the waste from the north was subcontracted to the borelli clan in naples who had an empire of lorries and trucks her father had arranged the transportation her brother and her mother had banked the money paid for it the food on your plate signorina was the blood money for the poisoning of your friend that isnt a question its a statement she nodded all the time she had spoken and he had listened she had washed plates knives forks and glasses he hadnt noticed it was as if they were tied together bound by what he said and what she said and all else was shut out the clothes on your back again she nodded then tipped out the water from the bowl but did not face him the classes where you have learned bookkeeping the basics of accountancy so that you can more successfully launder the cash from poisoning others she peeled off the rubber gloves threw them into the bowl then nodded accepted what he had said you should know signorina that the camorra has a profit of three billion euro each year from this trade that is a vast amount of food clothes and classes cancer rates are up in some categories liver colorectal leukaemia lymphoma to levels three times that of the rest of italy it is the triangle of death signorina immacolata do you accept responsibility she was staring out of the window from the little movements of her shoulders castrolami thought she might weep i do i care little for the killings in naples bad guy kills bad guy excellent fewer bad guys to pollute the streets marianna rossetti was not a bad guy i seldom do speeches signorina this one is about those already dead those already condemned and those yet to be contaminated all innocent a whole district hundreds of square kilometres is poisoned and no one knows how to clean that ground and filter that water for generations to come there will be the misery of the visit to the doctor the rush to the clinic the failure to prolong life and for your like there will be meals on the table the best clothing on your back and a fat bank account you confirm to me that you take responsibility she had lifted the glass drained it held it up so that not a drop of the wine should be left in it yes and you will see this through i will whatever correct he heard the glass fracture he realised she had crushed it in the palm of her hand she opened the rubbish bin with the footpedal let the shards fall into it and blood dripped he thought hed done well theatrical but acceptable in context castrolamis opinion it had been necessary to cut away the bullshit in her and break her having broken her he could rebuild her he thought her stronger now and focused he believed she would as she had said see it through in the face of whatever was thrown at her the policeman stood on the step and the porch light played on his shaven scalp his suit was crumpled his shirt was seconddayon and the tie was loosened he should also have smeared some polish on his shoes shouldnt have been there should have been in salisbury at county headquarters should have been changing into the best suit clean shirt best tie and better shoes should have been focusing on the seminar kicking off that evening terrorism tackling the reality of todays threat was instead at a bungalow in a village outside chippenham the rain was tipping down we have to look mr deacon at the actual world as it is not as wed like it to be do we have at the moment im just repeating what ive already told you and your wife the resources to look into this as you would like us to we do not its a matter of priorities mr deacon difficult as that may be for you to appreciate and what youve told us doesnt top the priority ladder then theres the cutbacks if we could link your sons disappearance to international terrorism its a different ball game could probably send an aircraftcarrier down there sorry not appropriate mr deacon look i understand how upset you are but see it please from our viewpoint the father said im sorry if my sons situation is inconvenient i think youre getting the hang of ours sir hes gone off your boy to try to patch up a scene with a girl who walked out on him in london you get a garbled call all the language difficulties thrown in saying your sons been kidnapped who says you cant tell us whats the source you dont know im probably keeping you the father said evenly weve called the carabinieri those people in pantomime uniforms in naples they have no report of a kidnap weve not been idle weve called the consulate there and theyve checked with the police nothing heard im being frank with you sir its about resources and priorities and also about our pretty desperate relations with italian law and order im sure youve something more important to be getting on with he saw the brief smile of relief and watched the man scuttle to his car which was parked in the lane he checked his watch it had been twentyeight minutes of passthebuck messing from behind him betty asked arthur whats eddie worth he looked out on to the lane then the darkened outline of the hedges and fields hearing the smack of the rain around him pretty much everything we have thats what eddies worth to us not the easiest boy but the only one we have a difficult enough little beggar but hes our son can be infuriating what do we do can be an utter wretch i was thinking top of my head of going down to deans hear what he has to say you should eddie met him didnt he last time he was here had a good talk a pretty sensible chap just troubled i cant think right now of anyone better or what else to do he came inside and as if it was something he should do more often and had forgotten for too long gave his wife a brush kiss on the cheek he dialled a number and spoke to dean weymouths partner at their home a quarter of a mile up the lane he wouldnt have gone near the man without first checking that it was a good time to call all the village knew dean weymouth had bad turns when he came back from the threemonth visits to iraq and his space was respected but he had always said the company he worked for was the best efficient and dedicated arthur deacon didnt know where else to go but it involved his son so he had to go somewhere each time i go back mr deacon its worse but i keep going doesnt make sense does it i go back because theres nothing else going back is my way of saying im not history not scrap not finished and chucked out im a soldier special forces that family i have no other skills im diagnosed ptsd my stress levels go up to the top of the gauge but i keep going back have to they were outside in the wilderness of the untended back garden dean weymouth was happier there than in the house im not accusing anybody certainly not you mr deacon but i hear the word is round here that im peculiar or unpredictable or difficult maybe just round the twist people dont understand traumatic stress and dont see it as a medical affliction like a wornout hip or a hernia they cross the street pretend to look anywhere else find excuses not to talk youre almost crying on the black dog days for someone to talk to but people havent the time or the inclination he wore only a tshirt on his upper body and it was shortsleeved the rain ran down the decorative lines of his tattoos and was in his cropped hair mr deacon had on an anorak and a cap dean weymouth spoke softly and without rancour in a flat almost lifeless monotone all right wrong most people havent your boy your eddie he did he made time we didnt talk stress trauma disorder he let me ramble on down by the river only last sunday about that new weed thats taking over on the banks and we saw the kingfisher fly and i told him about the fish in there and it was nothing talk would have bored a saint half to death he gave me time not many do it was precious he lit a cigarette it took three matches because of the shake in his hands he remembered his hands hadnt shaken when hed been by the river and given time the trembling was always bad when the end of a home leave was in sight im going back in a couple of weeks what spooks us most there is the thought of getting lifted being taken its like your worst nightmare but ratcheted up we do close protection usually of civilian experts we have to take them to work could be lifted in the office hoods in bogus police uniforms or blocked in on the road and not able to shoot a way out of it we know about kidnapping it scares the shit out of us if thats happened to your boy mr deacon in naples then im sincerely sorry he threw the cigarette on to the uncut grass theres a man who works for our company ive not met him hes a sort of freelancer and gets hired out to corporations and governments and to people with big bank balances i dont know if we can fix something we say out in baghdad that if ever were lifted wed pray this guy isnt on another assignment that hes sent for he has a goldplated reputation a nose for what to do and what angle to come in from but ive not met him have to see whats possible the rain was across the face of the father and dripped off the caps peak in the halflight from the kitchen window he couldnt tell whether it was only the rain on his cheeks or tears too im going to make a call for you its the best shout i can do your boy had time for me ill let you know his hand was gripped held tight as if dean weymouth was a lifeline i hear what you say dean my dad and your dad my mother and your mother just the same and worried sick as yours and mine would be to expect help from the boys in blue well thats asking too much yes ill ring are you resting up good to hear it look after yourself and well see you before you go south again he was roderick johnstone he opened a file on the screen of his computer the abbreviation of his first name and an exchange of one letter gave ruddy there was a duck with that name he was known therefore to his face and his back as duck and had been since school most casual observers of duck rated him stereotypical a mane of blond hair a publicschool education but few academic qualifications a commission via the royal military academy into a good cavalry regiment a middling career then into the outside civilian world a pinstripe suit and a mayfair office such observers would badly have misread the man he had formed a private security company had drawn around him a kernel of experienced men mostly with the hallowed special forces background had shown rare business acumen and had landed major contracts in iraq and afghanistan he did protection of property and personnel and used uk nationals from the regiment at hereford the squadron at poole and from the parachute regiment he had built a reputation for the delivery of what he promised value for cash and discretion his payroll was small but he was expensive and clients queued for his services among illustrious clients among those requiring total anonymity was the central intelligence agency and ducks email inbox was filled with sincerest thanks and deepest gratitude and top to bottom appreciation from those inside the loop here and on his payroll there was a hostage coordinator he was searching that file why did duck bother with a matter so seemingly trivial where were the rewards would he involve himself in something so lacking in fact and intelligence there was about duck a quirk of anarchy that had made him a secondrate soldier and an alphaclass business operator he liked to say that ordinary people used the same hand same paper same technique to clean their backsides as the selfappointed elite and those that his teams protected were ordinary ordinary accountants ordinary telecom engineers ordinary electricitysupply managers ordinary sewagetreatment technicians ordinary advisers on hospital management and his teams too were made up of ordinary people as dean weymouth was and had ordinary parents and ducks care for men such as dean weymouth the men on whose backs and guts the company prospered was utterly sincere he valued them listened to them and tried damned hard to stay loyal to them his own company had not thanking the good lord had an employee kidnapped hed met other ceos whose firms had he understood the awfulness of it and he had on the books a bloody good man the file told him of a link that sort of confirmed the matter something in his mans past that would open italian doors and guarantee cooperation of a sort he knew what effect a kidnapping had on a family and an employer there but for gods grace because dean weymouth had called him he was damn near obliged to get involved he lifted the telephone again and dialled the number given him by the onetime royal marine mrs deacon hello im roddy johnstone but everyone calls me duck dean weymouth has just spoken to me and explained your problem up front ground force security makes big money from governments which sort of underwrites the costs when we deal with individuals i want you to tell me what you know of your sons situation all the names and locations because i might have someone who can help you if your fears are founded time is always against us so we should push on but its your decision right mrs deacon begin at the beginning lukas ran just when the light had failed over the rooftops he had come back to his apartment and unlocked the door dark in the hallway and before he had switched on the ceiling light he had seen the flashing red bulb on the telephone he ran for the solferino metro station at the airport he would get downloads but important now was speed and getting there the bag always packed with the few things he needed was high on his shoulder pedestrians darted out of his path as if realising that when a grown man ran at that speed he wouldnt swerve to avoid collision he hurried because he didnt acknowledge complacency and knew it travelled alongside failure lukas had been at waco where the shitthe fuckthe hell is this place waco had been the chorus on the flight down from andrews they had half emptied the stores huts at the bureaus place in quantico among the forests where the hrts sat and waited for the call the beepers had gone and the hostage rescue team had scrambled and filled more than one c could carry they believed there except for the few who had been at ruby ridge that they were the invincibles and were given missions beyond the capabilities of other swat groups seven weeks at waco endless books read stuck behind a barrett calibre sniper rifle with feet per second muzzle velocity and a high hit probability at yards and watching from a distance the fuckup to end all fuckups so many children killed in the fire no medals only inquests and complacency stripped bare he went down the steps into the metro station and was still running most had quit after waco rather than face the interrogations under subpoena of the office of professional responsibility new snipers were brought into new teams he would have quit if not for the creation of a critical incident response team when the negotiators profilers and hostage rescue heroes had to gather in the same room even had to talk to each other a new world and a new style of action with a coordinator sitting at the end of a cirt table the job of the coordinator was to weigh the input of the negotiator hear the profilers analysis listen to the fears and demands of the stormers then make a decision and live with it he liked the job only decent thing that had come out of waco the fire and the deaths was the creation of the job its culture and the responsibility that went with it he forced his way on to a train as the doors closed he had had to break off he had cursed when his mobile had rung always castrolamis belief it rang at the least opportune moment she was talking well he would have kept her going all through the evening changed tapes and not let her off the hook he took a call from naples from the palace the personal assistant to the prosecutor confused a boy english aged twentyseven an adultstudent english teacher reported kidnapped believed to be taken from via forcella named as eddie deacon what has that to do with me impatience shouldered out politeness an investigator from a private commercial security firm was flying tonight to rome on behalf of the family and would wish to see at the start of the working day mario castrolami tell him and whoever volunteered me to get lost no possibility of me involving myself the parents of the boy castrolami was told had reported that their son had gone to naples to find his girlfriend i feel like my knees are weak that i could throw up because i know what youll tell me let me have it whats her name he heard it mother of jesu castrolami told the assistant where he would be in the morning at the start of the working day and rang off he murmured to himself what have i done to deserve that he went back into the living room he could mask reactions it might have been his wife who had called with news of a new dress purchased in faraway milan or the administration department at the piazza dante barracks with confirmation of his annual leave dates near to the christmas holiday he smiled thinly switched the taperecorder back on and prompted immacolata borelli on her fathers involvement with city hall she started again as if a tap had been turned on why had he not believed she would lie to him why had she lied he felt no sympathy for the boy for her and he let her talk without interruption about city hall then give the names of national politicians the location of meetings the dates in the morning he would learn and then he would confront her he took it badly that she had lied to him about a boy he was kicked in the face that was first then kicks to the chest and the small of his back eddie tried to curl himself into the foetal position for protection and succeeded well enough for more kicks to find his upper arms and wrists where the handcuffs were but not to reach the organs that would hurt more his head was lifted then punches were thrown at him he realised the crime feet had approached the trapdoor had been lifted light had cascaded into the bunker but had not reached right into the corner recess next to the filled sacks he had seen the man clearly the same face as had been on the street that of the man who had taken him the man would have realised the hood was off and that he was stared at eddie hadnt really absorbed the face on the street but now hed had a good clean sight of him it was when he was punched that he wet himself all those bloody hours of lying on his side or sitting clamping his muscles overtime and calling for willpower wasted effort when the punch went in he could hold back no longer could have cried then he felt the heat of the urine and its stream on his leg then the clamminess of his trousers it was degradation learned hard more blood in his mouth swallowing it unable to cough properly because of the sagging tape and choking he felt a new emotion eddie deacon steady eddie easygoing and friend to almost everybody little riled him and not much exhilarated him he hated he had now a true sense of loathing novel he took in all the features of the face didnt think in terms of a police station lineup or of having a crowbar in his hand but reckoned he needed to get that face into his mind acidetch it there hed coughed and taken that blood down and the heat was gone from the urine on his thighs he could have just felt miserable and sorry for himself the hood was put on he was back inside the small world hemmed in by the material and the cuffs the sodden trousers and his ankles were again roped and he was kicked some more the kick went into the stomach the force made him piss more he didnt cry out no moan no cry no scream he wondered if the memory of faces and the hope of a judicial process had kept those people alive in the camps theyd done that at school german extermination camps and in berlin hed seen the plaque that marked where the railway station was from which the jews were shipped and hed been on prinz albrechtstrasse where they had excavated the holding cells used by the gestapo he wouldnt forget that face or the voice i speak it a little english you fuck the whore immacolata you come here to find immacolata immacolata is with police immacolata is infame immacolata betrays her family if she likes again to fuck with you she will leave the police to encourage her to leave the police we send perhaps an ear orecchio perhaps a finger dito perhaps a hand mano perhaps we must send the pene and she will recognise it as from you did you not know who was immacolata who was her family did you not know what she did she will leave the police or we send the ear the finger the hand the pene then all of you but not breathing i think i speak english very good she will save you or she will kill you it is her choice not another person will save you he heard the man grunt as he levered his way up and out through the trapdoor then it was closed he heard the footsteps retreat bloody hell what to think about sort of put pissing his pants in the background he sensed all of them his ear tingled his finger scratched his palm and his penis was still wet but shrunken he hated the man he hoped the hate would give him strength lukas walked out of the terminus where the airport bus had dumped him the warm night air hit him after the cool of the vehicle and he felt then the little lift in his step the stretch of his stride and reckoned the mission launched always did feel good then afterwards was bad when he had the name and face of a target a threat level to assess then the hard times came as yet walking briskly he was not burdened by the responsibility of a human life in his hand but when he thought like that lukas either stubbed a toe on the kerb spat or kicked his ankle bone he crossed a couple of dark streets wove like a native through the traffic was in the immigrant quarter north african west african east african predictable alongside a railway hub he passed a telephone bar where calls could be made to mogadishu lagos or algiers and a cafe where guys sipped soft drinks and had at their feet the mountains of unsold handbags theyd try with again the next day a trolley bus went up the street rolled and rattled there was a narrow door into the pensione he was told by the guy behind the desk that a single room was booked for him the bill opendated and prepaid he didnt bother with the lift and climbed two flights of stairs the room was fine a television he didnt switch on a minibar he didnt open an airconditioner going like a tanks engine and the noise of the street coming through a doubleglazed window it was the way lukas liked it the sort of place where he was comfortable why was he there it confirmed he was still capable not washed up not yesterdays creature that he wouldnt hesitate to accept an invitation to travel it was why he was there and it went unshared he hooked power into his laptop wired into his mobile and information cascaded through to him he started out on the first steps of learning about edmund eddie deacon and about a girl and with each page passing on the screen so the deadweight the responsibility settled heavier nothing ever changed she looked a pretty girl and he looked an ordinary boy nothing was different from every other time but the scorpion sting was at the end last page up was the sitrep profile on immacolata borelli who she was what she did where she was a camorraclan girl a moneywasher now a traitor to her own was what the kid had gone looking to find in his career lukas thought there had been worse situations but not many he didnt know when hed next get any rest so he killed the laptop stripped and pretty soon was asleep gerald seymour the collaborator the hatred was like the wire scouring pad that his mother had by the kitchen sink and it cleaned eddies mind he needed it clean he didnt think he could lie propped up against the sacks hooded handcuffed and bound with wet trousers his guts aching with hunger his throat dry with thirst the scars on his face itching incessantly and those inside his mouth shooting pain and do nothing else hate had taken over his mind and given him clarity of thought he had ditched the disbelief he knew the reality had had it confirmed he thought he needed more than anything to regain a sense of control with nothing to see no leg movement nothing to eat no arm movement he needed a sense of some input into his destiny whatever it was he had to find control he had kicked off the process thoughts came and jumped raced flitted he must remember everything he had seen when the hood had been off the trapdoor lifted and light had flooded in the dimensions of the bunker the colour of the plastic sacks and what was printed on them face of the bastard he hated the clothes he had worn the markings on the trainers that had done the kicking the nike symbol he had all that he should keep a sense of time how he screwed his right fingers on to his left wrist and realised that his watch wasnt there had to be somewhere on the floor dislodged when he was beaten they would bring him meals meals would be a routine told himself no sentimentality and no selfpity wait heh wait wait no selfpity hed picked up a girl in a park hadnt even used a hoary old chatup line apologies and stumbles and embarrassments and then i dont understand this turn over what is turn over hed been picked up might have been a thousand different girls but hadnt had been her immacolata wouldnt tolerate selfpity wouldnt entertain it would try not to tolerate and entertain selfpity no sentimentality didnt know who he could be sentimental about not his mum and dad good enough people on railway lines of predictability not particularly loving and not particularly disapproving much like everyone elses mum and dad but worse things came into his mind and squeezed away the small matters selfpity control and sentimentality the man had spoken with a singsong reciting voice the sort of language he might have learned in a sixthyear classroom he would have had a textbook open that showed a mans body with arrows pointing to an ear a finger and a hand not to a penis she will leave the police we send perhaps an ear perhaps a finger perhaps a hand the pene then all of you but not breathing he saw a knife and his gut squirmed in fear as the shock waves surged and the pains came hard not easy fuck no to plead the need for control hardest to understand they wanted nothing of him he had no secret to hide or squeal no ideology to cling to or renounce he was not an agent in occupied europe or a heretic in tudor england he was just a piece of garbage would immacolata his mac leave the police she would be in protective custody and walk away to save him his ear finger and couldnt say he had slept with her loved her sucked her juices whispered with her laughed with her he didnt know eddie thought he heard indistinct the moan of engine noise cars lorries vans couldnt be sure might mean a new day had started if he was right noting that a new day was born was an act of control pretty bloody small pretty much all he was bloody capable of he teetered then on the edge of selfpity and righted himself another day then teetered again rocked was near to capsizing how big was eddie deacon in the emotions of immacolata borelli hard to say admit spit out that he didnt know he knew where the birthmark was deep brown at the top of her right buttock and where the minute polyp was in her left armpit but he didnt know her mind eddie had heard of prisoners in cells or in interrogation rooms who took a point on a wall or a ceiling and focused on it or found a spider crawling and tracked it but the hood didnt allow that perhaps it hurt most and made the worst fear that he didnt know how immacolata borelli would react when she held his life in the palm of her hand and weighed its value you lied to me i take much from the shit people i work with but lying disgusts me she hung her head castrolami seemed to tower over her it was a theatrical contrived attack a knock at her door a request that she come now into the living room she wasnt dressed castrolami orecchia and rossi were no coffee had been made for her no juice laid out no rolls heated but she had seen their plates on the drainingboard in the kitchen she thought they had ambushed her you lied we took you on trust we diverted resources all the time you lied she hung her head because she didnt understand she had talked of her father her mother her eldest brother she had listed the names of men who laundered and bought for the clan who handled transhipments that day she had prepared herself to talk about giovanni the brother she loathed and silvio who had depended and doted on her she couldnt think then of anything she had said that was untrue there was immacolata believed genuine anger in castrolamis accusation his jaw wobbled and little froths of spittle were at the sides of his mouth we were about to offer you the contract you would have read the document seen what we offered and what we required in return and it would have been signed by the palace and by you now we find youve lied to us i dont make deals with liars i prosecute them i send them to poggioreale but i dont sweettalk with liars she saw that he was holding a roll of papers maybe ten sheets and she noted a photograph among them for emphasis castrolami hit his palm with it rossi was at the kitchen door soberfaced and impassive orecchia was sitting in the hall and neither made eyecontact with her she was the daughter of her father she wouldnt bend the knee i dont lie castrolami took a small taperecorder from his pocket he switched it on and held it out there was the noise of the park dogs barking the kids screaming the rain on the leaves and his voice can they find hold and hurt maybe murder a lover she heard her own voice dismissive no his voice again seeking certainty in naples there is no lover no boy her own voice again giving the certainty no castrolami pressed fastforward briefly she heard castrolami first so there is a boy here i have to know her response yes but not significant again the fastforward castrolami saying you go to bed but you say its not significant yes she said crackling on the tape and distorted hes just a boy we met in a park it doesnt mean anything querying her testing her you wont pine for him heard herself snort then ill forget him maybe i have already i believe you had a passionate affair in london and that your protestation that the relationship was meaningless was a lie i dont lie what was the boys name she didnt know where he was leading her she saw the taperecorder dropped into castrolamis pocket as if its work was done she said eddie castrolami repeated the name rolled it eddie eddie and hes not significant and fucking him meant nothing so he was calling her a liar and a whore implying she slept around i liked him only liked him yes i liked him there i liked him in london i liked him is that a sin do i go to confessional and blubber it to a priest who has his hand in his crotch it was good in london this isnt london people go on holiday they fuck on holiday people go to work conferences meet others and fuck people meet in cinemas in strange towns and fuck afterwards it doesnt mean anything its what happens and she was cut short the papers were allowed to unroll the photograph taken out and passed to her she held it her eddie was leaning on a gate arms resting on the top bar there were young cattle around him nuzzling and nudging him she could almost hear his laughter she hadnt seen the photograph before she thought it would have come from an album at his parents home castrolami curled his lip if i was the boy and you were in my bed and i said i loved you and asked with a caress how you felt about me and you said i meant nothing to you id be disappointed she saw a trap a culdesac and thought she was led into it she handed back the photograph why did you show it me because you lied to me that boy is huge in your life as you are in his no the best boy you ever knew no free to sleep with him fuck him without your mother criticising who you chose not significant we shall see he dropped his voice more theatre and was casual as in conversation he smiled and held the photograph of eddie in front of her face we shall see signorina immacolata whether you lie or not he your insignificant meaningless bed partner was taken off the street in forcella yesterday why should the boy have come to naples if hes insignificant and meaningless why is he in forcella what is your response to him being taken hes not important my evidence is another lie or the truth ill stay the course a lie or the truth ill go to court whatever castrolamis big fingers made a small tear at the top of the photograph above eddies head and then with a sort of formality he handed her the photograph she knew what was expected of her she did it sharply but looked away through the window the sun clipped the roofs the water tanks and the satellite dishes and was above the mountain range she knew and had judged it that the rip would go through the middle of his face his forehead between his eyes and down the length of his nose it would split his lips his chin and his throat she did it she let the two pieces fall to the floor she said ill go to court whatever is set against me ill go in memory of marianna rossetti fuck you castrolami he kicked away the two pieces of the photograph and rossi came forward to pick them up and bin them castrolami said he had to go out she thought he despised her but he hadnt been in the cemetery at nola she went and lay on her bed heard the main door open shut and the key turn as he went into the via dei condotti lukas understood why the piazza di spagna had been chosen for the meeting he came off the main drag and walked past the fashion houses it was a good place to watch a man approach the steps and to see whether he had a tail he appreciated why they would be paranoid about security and didnt argue with it he was later than he would have wanted but duck johnstone had been on the phone for more than half an hour and had fed him morsels of intelligence that hadnt been available last night he reckoned duck must have worked through most of it it wasnt that lukas admired dogged hard work just that he couldnt abide the taking of shortcuts and easy optouts he knew more about the boy known now in the links as echo the girl was india enough about him to have rated his journey to naples as dumbpig stupid but echo would still get his best effort only effort he knew to have him on a plane and in a seat not in the hold he came to the fountain he knew that a description of his features had been sent ahead for recognition he didnt know whom he would meet or have a code to exchange the steps were a good place because he could be watched from more than four and up to seven angles there were tourists fooling in the fountain at the foot and locals were waiting to use the water spout for drinking lukas went past them and the museum that was the keatsshelley house he didnt do poetry literature or anything that was outside the confines of freeing poor bastards caught up usually in someone elses fight would have said it was full time and he started to climb the steps already the sun flared off the stonework and any shade was filled with sitting youngsters hostage rescue hostage negotiation hostage profiling and hostage coordination were big enough subject areas to swamp lukass mind he had been a sniper on the rescue team he had once fired a live round to kill he had carried the rifle and been in full kit on a live callout close to a hundred times including ruby ridge and waco but had fired only once a death shot but not a clean one the brains skull fragments and blood of the robber trying to break a siege and bug out of a bank in madison wisconsin had spattered across the face and spectacles of the cashier he was using as a shield and the mess had spoiled her dress the bureaus hrt had been called in because the target had crossed state lines hed had the crosswires on the felons head for upwards of thirty seconds and had fired a second after the guys attention had gone to his right side and the handgun had been moved out from under the womans chin it was a hell of a shot the rest of the team told him but a shame about the dress god only knew what the hairdresser would have found the next time the woman went he had moved on ditched the rifle and the big telescopic sight when the bureau launched the critical incident response group only one way an old head had told him to learn the skills of negotiation and he had to know about negotiation if he was to command those people find the construction cranes the old head had said in a corner of the quantico parkland and some good high bigspan bridges suicides went up crane ladders and out on the walkways of bridges lukas had taken two years of evenings days off and holiday time to be on standby for a call from a duty officer nobody in town county or state police was queuing to go up a crane to talk to a nutcase who wanted to jump cranes and bridges were where teeth were cut the old head had said couldnt fail with wannabe suicides and hope to make it in the bigtime of terrorist sieges the way to learn the soft gentle persuasive talk and to calm a situation was to be a hundred feet up a crane ladder with not much to see of the client but the soles of his shoes fifteen further up hed met some interesting people and heard some interesting life stories and had had to breed trust if men and women were to decide to face another day and climb down hed never liked heights but had a top job as a coordinator the negotiator rookies needed to get up high on exercises and lukas had had to take them leadership was shit it was said he heard later that some jerks climbed and threatened and only wanted the star man to come up after them hed gotten a reputation round quantico and into the suburbs of the capital the sciences of hostage rescue were squashed into lukass mind which was why he didnt know about poetry or about keats and shelley he didnt look for the guy he reached the top a big hotel faced him fellow americans were spilling out of a taxi and staff were bowing and scraping others were having cases loaded into a limousine from his crap room beside the station lukas had come to the meeting by trolley bus on the metro and on foot he didnt have to justify what some said was eccentricity and others called pathetic obstinacy a man stepped forward he would too right have watched lukas traverse the via dei condotti climb the steps and wipe away some perspiration you are lukas no warmth a question put without enthusiasm as if he was a stone in a shoe a tick sucking blood on his leg an irritation between the cheeks he didnt do pointscoring but he didnt do grovelling either yes i am here because i am instructed to be here thank you for meeting me he said quietly but briskly i am mario castrolami of the ros excuse me that is the the special duties unit i know what the ros is he didnt spell out its full italian name because that would have been to lord his knowledge and get straight up the mans nose he was an intruder castrolami was heavyset and overweight lukas read him as one of the workaholic guys who slaved through all the hours and more and who were the backbone of pretty much every lawenforcement outfit he had come across they didnt get promotion and they didnt care and they were busy had clearcut priorities and failed on smalltalk it is about eddie deacon it is and immacolata borelli lukas could have said it was about juliet and her romeo because he had seen the movie on a flight out from jfk to jakarta a long time back but neither of them wanted imbecile talk he had to lead but gently as if the wind buffeted him when he was stuck up some godawful crane and looking down wasnt an option can we go get a coffee im told theres a carabinieri barracks behind the parliament building near here i think and that a very good espresso is served in the noncoms mess i imagine mr castrolami that you feel like youve stepped in a dog mess and that im the mess but a coffee in the barracks might help to get the smell and the nuisance off your uppers i suggest though well be using up your valuable time that we say no more until weve had the coffee duck johnstone had all these things on the file could hack into them and carry lukas back six years an easy ride in the nostalgia stakes had taken him there for a reason of course lukas knew where the barracks was off which street on the far side of the via dei corso and how to get there quickest so he led it was a cheap trick but he hadnt time for subtlety they exchanged cigarettes but kept off the talking carmine borelli fired the stock of the sawnoff doublebarrelled shotgun was hard against his shoulder he squinted down the valley between the barrels and fired again the recoil twice rippled through his chest and up his neck the sensation shuddering through him was incredible and he shed years the cordite was in his nostrils extraordinary it was one thing to have used a pistol the day before and have the retort ripple up his arm but the shotgun at his shoulder was just pure pleasure one man squealed held tight to a lamppost for support then began to hobble towards the car it was down the street the doors already open its exhaust spitting fumes the other man had ducked down on his knees then twisted and tried to run but was bent double he could hear a man in the car shouting for them both to hurry carmine borelli ejected the cartridges dipped into his pocket for two more and loaded them he had three of his own footsoldiers further along the street than the car and two more behind him salvatore his visor down was astride the pillion of a scooter across the street none of the footsoldiers or salvatore were to intervene unless the life of carmine borelli was at high risk he saw why the man who tried to run was bent a hand gripped his hip and the tan trousers were bloodstained two shots at twenty metres and two hits the two men made the car and it roared away wheels shrieking as it spun right there were several hospitals nearby where the passengers could be dropped off but the incurabili on the via della sapienza was the nearest a good hospital where his pasquale had been born and where he had sent many men the street had been empty now was filled a woman stopped set down her shopping bag on the pavement crouched picked up the two ejected cases and gave them to him briefly he kissed her hand she retrieved her bags and went on a man filled the door of a bar and shouted viva il camionista and there was applause behind him carmine saw salvatore ride off down the street he knew that those who had been wounded would live now in mortal fear of salvatore coming after them the matter concerned the pizzo paid for protection by a shop on that street between the via cesare rosaroll and the via carbonara which sold wedding dresses carmine borelli understood that his granddaughter no longer spoken of without a spit on the pavement had fixed the pizzo at five hundred euros a month chicken shit to the borelli clan small change the previous evening he had learned early that morning men from the misso clan or the mazzarella clan it was unclear had told the shops owner that they would take over protection and the payment would be seven hundred and fifty euros a month if he had weakened if it was allowed to happen once if it was seen that he couldnt fight to defend what he held the borelli clan was finished dead and buried forgotten so he had taken the shotgun from the cache where it had lain hidden for more than twenty years stripped off the dampproof oiled wrapping loaded cartridges and found the old coat with the inner pocket where a shotgun could be secreted he had been on the pavement when the men had come to collect seven hundred and fifty euros or to slop petrol over the shops stock of gowns he thought he had sent a second message another shout forza il camionista he acknowledged it a slight wave the scooter came back down the street salvatore would have circled the block to see if more men waited in more cars for orders to intervene it was an old friend who had shouted and the helmet shook at this moment there was no more danger a gloved hand reached out snatched the shotgun and the scooter was gone lost in the traffic the shops owner was behind him with the padlock that fastened the steel shutters to the loop in the pavement but carmine denied him permission to close for the day demanded he stay open his sent message would be reinforced by that gesture he walked away they would now be arriving at the hospital probably the incurabili and would be hustling for the pronto soccorso entrance which was alongside general surgery where they were skilled in extracting bullets and pellets it was near to trauma necessary if the wounds were serious and the chapel was beside the mortuaria a good design layout and convenient the first professional man he had hired was from that hospital sixtysix years earlier the city starved women picked dandelions and daisies to boil as soup kids prised limpets off the seashore rocks and men hung nets to catch songbirds for plucking carmine and anna borelli made their first fortune from the brothels not all the women who went into the cubicles with american soldiers were married they had to eat so dropped knickers and opened thighs were the only currency they had but the americans had moved on carmine borelli had hired a professore from the hospital and for a fee per patient of ten thousand lire the eminent medical man restitched the virginity of the unmarried and carmine took fifteen per cent of the fee that professore had delivered pasquale safely into the world he would go first to the place where he could shower and change his clothing then take more of the pain pills because he didnt want people in forcella to see him hobble or limp clean he would go home he believed he had done well believed also that he was on a treadmill running and didnt know how long at that pace he could last once a week regular as clockwork davide locked the door of his apartment on the third floor of the sail and took a bus it carried him from the architectural disaster zone that was scampia into naples and there was a memorised sequence of meetingplaces the steep funicolare climbing from the via toledo a gentlemans hairdressing salon on the corso umberto the giardini pubblici in front of the royal palace of the bourbons the open ramparts of the castel dellovo or one of the distinguished coffee houses of the city when he was in any of those places with tapes and cassettes in the hidden pockets sewn at his trousers waist he was deltafoxtrot he sat on the bus that morning he was not reckless took no unnecessary risks in harbouring the secrecy of his double life and felt no fear in both his identities davide and deltafoxtrot he understood that the fate of an agent of the aisi if uncovered was death not negotiable if it was discovered that a man from the agenzia informazioni e sicurezza interna was living in the sail death was certain with much pain beforehand he lived with the threat he had a compartmentalized mind and could keep fear at arms length that ensured he was an agent of quality and valued by his handlers he enjoyed meeting them in the funicular carriage the barbers or in the gardens and would ask after their children and be told of their holidays makebelieve of course but it enabled him to feel he was inside a family which was important to him they had given him a number for the apocalypse call but he doubted he would ever use it he had no idea what his life might be outside the sail and without the weekly meetings nothing to report that week nothing that would interest the men and women who met him they were interested only in material of highgrade importance he had seen through his obsessionally polished windows nothing of that category neither did he believe there was anything on the tapes from the cameras in his living room or from the audio cassettes linked to the microphones buried in the outer wall the position of his apartment where a flight came up from level two and another down from level four had not been chosen randomly it was a meetingplace men stopped talked and took little notice of the cleaned windows the blaring television and the old man slumped in a chair with his back to the walkway he knew of nothing that week to intrigue his handlers she was no fool anna borelli was as adept at losing a tail as any man half a third or a quarter of her age she did backdoubles shop windows was last on to a trolley bus on the corso umberto and went into the church of san lorenzo maggiore by the main entrance and out by the narrow emergency door only when she was satisfied that she was not under surveillance or had lost it did she head for the meetingplace she carried a filled plastic shopping bag she was another elderly lady keeping death at bay for perhaps another year or only another month and she wore black from stockings to scarf she was unnoticed she rang a bell she was admitted through high gates she crossed a yard of cannibalised vehicles and a door swung open when she prodded it with her toe she was inside the building that had once been a carrepair business but was now a place where stolen mercedes bmws audis and the best models from the alfa and fiat factories were brought and dismantled the parts would be shipped into moldova or ukraine then moved further east it had been an excellent business but was now slack and the yard was deserted except for the scooter tucked against a side wall the building seemed empty but for the cigarette smoke that curled from beneath an inner door then she was met she showed salvatore what she had brought there was bread cheese two slices of cheap processed ham two apples three small bottles of water and the mornings edition of cronaca di napoli on the front page a photograph of a man sprawled dead half in a gutter outside a bar she had not read it she thought that by now her husband would be home she approved of what he planned to do and she would appreciate that when he sat in his chair with her beside him he would be clean and not smell as was usual salvatore had a camera on the table and the man who rode the scooter was stretched out on a sofa asleep with a pistol on the floor beside his head there was a corridor to the back and a storeroom off it a trapdoor was lifted and a torch shone down a stench came up through the holes opening she saw that the boy was hooded bound and that his arms were behind his back she remembered him in her living room his simplicity remembered also when immacolata her husbands angel had been in the same room had sat in the same chair drinking from the same set of cups and eating off the same set of plates she remembered the boy his almost shy smile the flush of gratitude when he was told that a man was coming to take him to immacolata she felt no sympathy the torch showed the discolouration at his groin she had not felt sympathy for the women in her brothels who had contracted syphilis from the american officers and had had to tell their husbands of the disease they carried she had not felt sympathy for those widowed when she and her husband had climbed but others had been pushed aside or for gabriella when the births of vincenzo and giovanni were complex and brutally painful or for carmine when he was taken three times to poggioreale she did not even feel sympathy for herself she watched salvatore rolled up the hood so that it cleared the mouth and nostrils but covered the eyes he pulled off the binding tape and the young man eddie cried out in pain because it had happened without warning but then so quickly his face settled anna borelli understood then salvatore unlocked the handcuffs and allowed him eddie to work his fingers over his wrists and bring back the circulation she wondered if he was edmondo or eduardo then the hands were put together in front of his waist and the handcuffs went back on anna borelli thought from his face and the little gestures that he was a fighter it didnt matter to her she passed down a bucket and the newspaper she had brought she knew a little english from the americans salvatore told the young man that he should use the bucket that he could eat that he was to put the hood back on his head each time he heard movement over the trapdoor if he didnt he would be beaten the bucket was stood in a corner salvatore had the camera the newspaper front page facing the lens was placed in the young mans hands and held up the torch was switched off anna borelli thought then that salvatore would snatch up the hood and immediately take the photograph the flash lit the bunker and the white face the scars on it and the blood smears easier to see in the flash than in the torch beam when the torch went back on the hood was in place again the newspaper was left beside the bucket the food was in the plastic bag beside the young mans knee anna borelli saw the young mans ears and fingers the stain at his crotch and felt no sympathy she accepted however that she didnt know how her granddaughter would react what her response to the pressure would be when it built salvatore climbed out the trapdoor fell back into place and the bolt was pushed home with the tab from the camera lodged in her brassiere anna borelli set off for the office of the familys lawyer castrolami watched he thought it a performance for him and no others he was sitting in the canteen area on the second floor of the barracks the coffee in front of them with a plate of sweet biscuits the swing door had been pushed open and an officer probably a maresciallo had come in looked around seen the man lukas and come to him arms opening wide hugs kisses and castrolami believed he saw tears not lukas who wept and not lukas who kissed it was about the establishment of credentials the officer had small scars on his face and walked heavily as if his left leg carried an old injury he would have been in his early forties plump and pastyfaced he clung to lukas it was explained the officer was marco he had been in the detachment of carabinieri posted to the iraqi city of nasiriyah he was asleep in quarters used by the detachment in the building that had once been the office of the local chamber of commerce a suicide attack on it had involved a tanker truck rigged with explosives seventeen carabinieri had been killed and more were injured marco suffered cut tendons in his right leg from shrapnel and his face was hit by glass shards he had gone home recovered convalesced and demanded to be returned to his unit he had come back to nasiriyah castrolami heard the story and thought it told well and quietly he waited to learn its purpose the canteen had filled the short guy at castrolamis side now extricated from the hugs and kisses seemed to castrolami to find it a necessary nuisance and was impassive i went back a dumbfuck stupid thing to do everyone told me so but i was back we had an outpost down the road and the day that those guys were supposed to get a weeks rations there was also a search mission under way just one of those days when a schedule gets fouled up and people think it doesnt matter the consequence was a reduction in the size of the escort to take the rations there were three of us italians and two trucks we got hit they put an rpg through the engine of mine and blew us off the road the driver an iraqi boy was killed the truck in front just kept going i was taken castrolami didnt hear in the packed room that a throat was cleared that a mans joints clicked as he moved his weight from one foot to the other that a nose was blown that a cup was put heavily on a saucer or that cutlery rattled lukass face gave nothing away i was taken off quickly fast immediate would have been well gone by the time a reaction force was back in there i was held fourteen days they didnt want a ransom didnt want a truckload of dollars didnt want a statement of intent to leave from our government they told me they wanted prisoner exchange people of theirs who were in abu ghraib under american jurisdiction after fourteen days they got the message no deal they were ready to do me would have been a knife job decapitation i thought theyd kill me that night those were fourteen long days a different meaning to long than ive known before like years and like hell the guys who broke in were from task force because we italians didnt have that sort of group they came out of the anaconda camp in the balad base this man mr lukas did the coordination he married what the assets brought in with prisoner interrogation and reconnaissance and did it right i owe him my life im supposed to be a rockhard bastard but the sight of this little runt and the knowledge of what he did for me his skill makes me want to fucking weep i never had a chance to thank him there we the italian contingent didnt have such a man in iraq it was my great fortune that he was in country with defense department and allocated to my situation great fortune because hes the best i saw him in the distance and then he was gone but guys told me what im saying if hes in town if some poor bastard goes through what i went through then fuck the protocol and fucking listen to him applause spattered the canteen can we get out of here lukas asked softly close to castrolami it was your call to come castrolami said someone thought it was a good idea the chief honcho in the company i work for would have pulled him up on the files maybe it wasnt and maybe it was a good idea he disengaged from the veteran and castrolami thought marco now did some soft liaison job in parliament but would never forget lukas endured one last awkward embrace then was pushing for the double doors and the coffee hadnt been drunk they went along corridors and down flights of stairs they hit the street going fast as if both men wanted to be shot of a place that was sugarsweet on sentimentality i suppose i should apologise but it was reckoned a good clean fast way of establishing credentials like fasttracking them could you do that sort of cabaret in other places other cities fraid so quite a number i do apologise a stunt and a gimmick not my way but give it me castrolami demanded lukas said i dont horn in and play rank and pedigree inside there was just about a cv and to save you time and somebody elses idea if im invited i come in if my advice is looked for i offer it there are no other strings and no other agenda i warn you we pull in different directions lukas was looking at his feet as they walked when was it ever different i make no commitment to you an outsider in your place i doubt i would the cell had no air and the heat was trapped in it if she had been charged with shoplifting bagsnatching or aggravated assault gabriella borelli would have shared a cell with five others even nine but she was special had status was awarded solitary confinement she had been escorted back to the cell and the heat had wafted at her as the door was unlocked had wrapped round her as it was closed after her the sun was climbing and played directly on the window distorted shadows were thrown over her from the light hitting the bars it had been a sour meeting with her lawyer umberto she had sensed his shock when he saw her with chains fastened to manacles at her wrists he would have heard them rattling as she was led down the corridor and into the interview room and she sensed he felt personal pain for her and also that his worst nightmare would have been to wear those chains to sleep in a cell like hers and not to walk on the tribunali or the duomo but in an exercise yard he had dabbed a handkerchief dosed with cologne at his nose they had taken the chains off her when she was ready to sit opposite him did he believe that a case conference between accused and advocate was free of electronic audio surveillance he did not did she believe that a microphone was not wired into the room its furniture its walls ceiling and electrical fittings most certainly she did not it had been a bizarre conference she flopped on to the bunk bed on a raised concrete base she kicked off the sandals which she had been issued with loosened the blouse that had been torn when theyd felled her and unzipped the skirt that had ridden up when she was on the ground but there was no relief from the heat umberto had produced a packet of cigarettes cigarette papers for rolling but no loose tobacco and two match books the cigarettes were between them and each had had a set of the matches he had divided the papers so that they had half each they had done the case conference he had asked her if she was well and she had told him she was he had written in an insect scrawl on a slip of the paper a boy the lover of immacolata came from england to find her had an address of via forcella the priest sent him to carmine and anna he had pushed the slip towards her and she had read it then crumpled it and put it into the tinfoil ashtray between them she had written was he stupid was he ignorant she had shown it to him then crushed it and dropped it with the other they lit cigarettes and allowed the lighted matches to burn the papers in the ashtray a rhythm had developed did she have complaints that he should take up with the authorities she did not he knew nothing had met immacolata in london loved her knew nothing carmine took control he sent for help what control what help more paper burned in the ashtray was the food satisfactory it was its control through leadership its to prevent secessionists and intrusion he sent for salvo to what purpose smoke rose from the paper more smoke curled up from the cigarettes was she treated with respect she was carmine thinks the boy from england can be used as leverage on immacolata salvo has taken the boy holds him in sanita bits of him will be sent to immacolata if she doesnt retract her accusations i doubt the bitch will but good to use the boy make pressure with him more important find the bitch shoot her stamp on her face in that note she had allowed emotion to escape her writing had been faster larger and the response had taken both sides of the paper he asked her what she needed she had said clothing a portable electric fan a radio and some magazines what else use the boy with a knife kill the bitch what else did she want she had not said that her love should be sent to her husband to vincenzo in london to giovanni or silvio she had not spoken of her parentsinlaw or of salvatore she had said she needed a pair of her own shoes and more toothpaste together they had checked that all of the paper slips were burned to cinders then had screwed out the cigarettes in the ash he had stood knocked on the door and the escort had come in the manacles had gone back on her wrists she had not thanked him for coming to the womens gaol at posilippo she paid him and he was rich on the familys back she sat now in the cell she would herself have slit her daughters throat she would herself have sliced off the ears fingers and nose of the english boy her daughters lover what gabriella borelli loathed most was the removal of power the loss of authority she must playact with cigarette papers across a table anger welled in her but was confined inside the walls three metres by two of the cell she could do none of it herself she was off the bed in fury gabriella borelli beat her forehead against the wall bruised and scratched herself against the graffiti she didnt care about clothes an electric fan or shoes she wanted her daughter dead the old lady had been waiting for him she was sitting in his office amid the mountains of paper and files that were umbertos trade when he came back from posilippo and he had had coffee at the cafe gambrinus where old friends the advocates of other clans had greeted him she was in front of his desk extraordinary but she didnt speak she handed him a small envelope then stood looked around as if she was searching for a dead cat carcass and was gone he tore open the envelope retrieved the cameras memory pad then called for his clerk massimo the young man was his nephew had his trust he told massimo to take money from the pettycash box and go to the camera shop on the corso vittorio emanuele a long bus ride but there was little chance of his clerk being recognised there buy a portable printer and bring it back if the clan fell umberto fell so hard for him to believe that the sweet pretty face of immacolata always his favourite might cause him to fall and fall far she had talked through the morning to the deputy prosecutor up from naples she had found with each anecdote and each item of evidence that old loyalties had frayed disintegrated a few days before she had hugged her brother silvio for driving out to capodicino collecting her ferrying her to nola and back that morning she listed all the occasions she knew and would swear to it on oath that silvio had ridden on his scooter around the city distributing handguns and ammunition she skewered him she identified the weapons caches he had visited the men from whom the weapons were collected and those to whom they were given the tape spools had turned she had seen across the table grim satisfaction on the face of the deputy prosecutor she felt no more affection for her youngest brother than she did for the others and none for her mother she didnt think of her father she kept in her mind central the image of her friend she saw as she condemned her family the features of marianna rossetti there was no other face in her mind no other friendship was significant ill go to court whatever she sensed that morning a growing relaxation in the apartment as if a barrier had been broken down she was not treated with the same suspicion near hostility when they broke the deputy prosecutor for coffee and she for juice she had stood and stretched sensing that her tshirt rode up over her navel then wandered towards rossi he was on the balcony through the open doors sitting in a rattan easy chair browsing a newspaper she could fight as she did with mario castrolami scratch she could smile too flash her eyes and be docile please yes rossi looked up at her what do you need do you run for exercise yes please may i run its claustrophobic here id like to run if its allowed but i dont have the clothes id be so grateful if i could cant see why not let me float it thank you why did she want to run not for fitness she didnt have a weight problem she was young and healthy she believed that if she could run along a pavement as other women did she would take another step towards changing her life she drank the juice orecchia brought her sat again at the table and talked about salvatore il pistole who had fancied her had wanted to sleep with her and might have wanted to marry her she stabbed him too with the stiletto pushed it deep another tape was slotted into the recorder she thought of nothing that was insignificant or meaningless there wasnt a dog in the household for arthur deacon to walk best he could do was borrow his immediate neighbours a cheerful golden retriever hed needed to get out of the house stretch his legs and have someone or something to commune with who brought no complications betty had taken the day off work and had warned them it might be the week hed felt hemmed in as he had in the last months at the waterboard office and the dog was a sort of therapy against worrying agonising about eddie they hadnt slept either of them last night could have taken the dog round the loop of byways and bridlepaths all over again but felt he should go home he had dropped the dog off at the neighbours well short of dean weymouths bungalow and tramped the last hundred yards to his house the back door of course because his dirty shoes lived in the utility room he lived a pretty boring life ordered predictable and boring so there was a place on a shelf for muddy shoes and another place on another shelf for merely dirty shoes and a cupboard spot for clean shoes it was about as boring as it could get he was about to sing out hello its me im back but didnt who else might it be the queen the pope osama bin bloody laden he said nothing but as he took off his shoes he heard his wifes voice the accent she used for work with all the vowels and consonants in place she said im grateful mr johnstone more grateful than i can say and my husband yes please do please keep in touch with us any time of day or night can i ask you one question mr johnstone only one thank you why mr johnstone are you doing this for us perhaps i do and perhaps i dont but thank you he heard the phone put down he heard her choke like a sob and couldnt remember when he had last heard or seen his betty in tears wouldnt have believed it if he hadnt heard the choke he took off his shoes put them on the correct shelf went inside and put his arm round her shoulders she was still standing by the hall table facing the silent phone she said that was mr johnstone he says his names duck but im not indulging him hes building what he calls a profile of eddie dont know that i could he says eddies been kidnapped and the likelihood is that hes in the hands of an organisedcrime group this one called the camorra is in naples the likelihood is that the girl eddie spoke of immacolata borelli is from a criminal family a very successful one god poor eddie an innocent abroad it gets blacker the girl has turned herself in as a state witness against her family eddie our eddie barged in there supremely innocent but also supremely ignorant i dont know which is worse and mr johnstone says they will try to use his captivity to persuade the girl to withdraw her evidence he wanted to know how eddie would withstand extreme pressure and stress he didnt say torture but i think thats what he meant and the information will help in building the profile i said he was just ordinary a bit lazy and a bit stubborn usually aware kind not very ambitious without malice i said that it was almost like i was doing his obituary for the western daily press i said he was a nice boy decent and steady but hadnt too much imagination his own mother selling him short she did a brief sniffle blinked and the weakness of tears was gone arthur deacon held her tight her eyes were still on the phone a mans flown to rome i wasnt told his name hes called a coordinator and he works on a freelance basis for mr johnstones company he has fbi experience and has been in iraq for the american military hes an expert on hostage rescue whether by negotiation or use of force its all because of dean dean spoke well of eddie im in areas i dont understand but i think its a sort of family dean weymouth the people who work for this company at whatever level of importance and the man whos going to naples its like a brotherhood of mutual support because of the awful places they operate in the expert hes as good at his work as anyone in the world mr johnstone says we have to be strong and pray eddie is what mr johnstone also says we must hope we must believe and we must understand the desperate nature of the situation eddies in and mr johnstone says we mustnt feel angry with him thats the natural emotion extreme anger for having caused our misery eddie may not be the brightest star but hes done nothing wrong has nothing to be ashamed of this expert the coordinator is used to going where governments get entangled in bureaucracy and pomposity and guarding territory mr johnstone says and sidestepping them all but he doesnt flannel you live nearly a lifetime then into your cosy world come people you didnt know existed im not trying to be profound but now we share space with them he says eddies position is difficult hes going to ring us twice a day and he promised that all the questions hell ask are relevant for the profile i asked him why he said that people climb mountains because theyre there cross deserts because theyre there get involved in problems because theyre there he didnt mention anything about money im frightened for eddie arthur held her couldnt do it tighter which is more important that the girl gives her evidence or our eddies life im not asking you for an answer they had walked without speaking had had a coffee and walked some more not spoken and drunk a second coffee lukas knew that the exhibition in the canteen had left a sour taste in castrolamis mouth but it was easier done that way than having to explain himself near the end of the second coffee at a bar that over looked the big square piazza venezia where the coffee cost more than a meal castrolami put his gripe mr lukas it was dishonest if you want it to be implication you win them all i win a lot not all i could have had you put on an alitalia big bird and youd be midatlantic now and i could take you to a trailer camp in arkansas or alabama and i could wheel out the family of a marine or a ranger or a military truck driver not past his nineteenth birthday who was lifted and killed because i didnt save him i could do that if it would help you you dont win them all i lose people yes i try to win i dont ask for a shoehorn im there if i can help and i try to win what keeps you in the game lukas said its what i know about all i know a hand reached out slapped lukass face quite hard but not malevolent and not playful lukas supposed he had said the right words the right thing at the right time but that too was a skill of his one day if time allowed he would work at sincerity what was real and what was not castrolami said we should go and see her then maybe you can judge better what happens to the boy he had eaten used the bucket and ditched the hood the focus in his mind was the hatred and the need for control and eddie held it with the darkness around him there was the silence selfpity which would not have been control cursed that he had stepped on to a flight when hed thought he was lucky cursed that he had made it on to a train going south cursed that he had found a priest in a great church who distracted and seeming not to care had told him where to find his macs family and cursed that he had lingered over cake while the man was sent for any cursing was selfpity he would not have turned his back on immacolata would not and could not mixed it up in his mind the face that was the source of hatred and the face of immacolata and she was laughing sharing her happiness with him he mixed the two but the hatred was of greater importance he mustnt lose control he couldnt stand in the bunker couldnt pace couldnt lose the smell of the bucket couldnt allow his head to drop gerald seymour the collaborator a new decision faced eddie a week before it would have been whether to do shakespeare or agatha christie with his class drink british bitter or czech lager eat pasta or oriental sleep the night with immacolata or send her home put the whites in the washingmachine or the woollens big decisions but all in the past how to get a pair of locked handcuffs off his wrists in near total darkness was the problem that needed a decision he doubted there would be an anaesthetic maybe at best alcohol or iodine to keep the cut clean it might be a medical student a man who cut up chicken for his familys evening meal a butcher or any bastard off the street he had been told that his ears his fingers his hand and his penis would be chips in the negotiation stakes which seemed a good enough reason to work on the locked handcuffs do nothing not a bloody option how to do it he didnt know he had searched the floor space for wire then gone over each wall hoping to find a nail hammered in he had crouched under the ceiling and smoothed the surface with his hands but there had been no nails hooks or wire they had done the holocaust at school there were pictures downloaded from the net of dayinthelife scenes at auschwitzbirkenau belsen and treblinka it had seemed a long way from a sixthform college in northwest wiltshire until an old man had been brought in on a wet tuesday afternoon in february he had been in the camps as a child and had survived and was a halfcentury later a witness he had the tattooed number to prove it and had rolled up his sleeve to show it the class had seen the photographs of the crowds shuffling in lines with suitcases and bundles holding their childrens hands towards the gas chambers the jew had talked about death its certainty a boy robinson cocky little sod had asked the jew why did they all just accept it why didnt they fight it they were dead anyway so why didnt they give it a thrash the class teacher had told robinson that the question was offensive but the jew had waved him down and said a few did a very few not enough the state of israel today still has a sense of shame at what is seen as the inability to fight the lyingdown the docility israel will defend itself now with the utmost robustness but then we had come from ghettos we were exhausted starved degraded of dignity we did not have the strength physical and mental to combat the inevitable it was a good question theyd talked about it afterwards in the canteen the school corridors and had all said robinson at the helm that they wouldnt have gone like sheep easy to say at a school in northwest wiltshire eddie deacon had not come from a walledin ghetto was tired from lack of sleep but not exhausted was hungry but not starved and his dignity was fired by hate how best to regain the freedom of his hands he told himself that they would cut off his ears fingers and penis maybe it had been his failure to react fast enough on the pavement in the moment after the fishseller had given the glance but it was all an unwalked road for him fighting was about films about stories heroes did fighting with scumbags he didnt know heroes or lowlife he had to learn how to fight first lesson shed the handcuffs eddie found one place on the flooring where the concrete had a rough edge might have been where one load had gone down as liquid against the previous load that had almost set hard the ridge was about half a centimetre high and sharp the handcuffs were not the bar variety that the police were issued with when they came into kingsland road but the old sort with a short chain linking the manacles eddie knelt he planted his elbows crouched then had the chain against the ridge made it taut and started to scratch working the chain over the ridge it hurt like fuck in his elbows but he kept on at it and when he had rubbed smooth one short section of the ridge he edged further along to a new position dust came up and was in his nostrils better to be beaten face the knife and have given it a thrash its about windows the best opportunity for escape by the potential hostage right at the start chaos confusion maximum tension for the hostagetaker you can count it on the seconds of one hand the sight of a window thats when the hostage is most likely to get clear but an attempt to escape is when the hostage is most likely to be killed its a hell of a risk and castrolami interrupted you go in there lukas saw the facade behind high heavy railings of the building the flag drifting limp and the barricades to keep the truck bombs away from the embassy walls there had been a time when he would have been welcomed open arms at any us embassy he wondered how it was for them living in a fortress bringing the baghdad green zone to the via vittorio veneto id go in there if id lost my documents assuming i was travelling on american papers get it straight i dont belong to governments they kept walking it was hot the sun high lukas thought the city not yet back from holiday and the temperature too great for the comfort of tourists he was not told why they walked in the heat or why castrolami checked his watch as if that would make the hands go faster castrolami said sorry i interrupted dont think im not interested lukas asked blunt are you fooling with me no they left the flag no wind to make it proud behind them lukas said after that first open window theres less likelihood of another we used to advise at those seminars the state put on and the private security companies host for big bucks that once taken a hostage shouldnt try to escape then along came iraq remember the brit doesnt matter how but he managed a runner barefoot and in darkness he was actually within three hundred paces of an american checkpoint when they caught him maybe he was already condemned but the escape confirmed it his throat was cut would we now advise people to hang about and see what the sun brings up were a bit humbler with advice what we do say to escape and fail is a death sentence these people here do they have qualms about killing is it a big deal for them like changing their underpants or brushing their teeth castrolami said in naples life doesnt count they would go for an espresso afterwards and talk football the dust in his eyes didnt matter because he couldnt use them what came up his nose was an irritant and several times he sneezed uncontrollably then froze to listen he heard nothing no engines no music no voices he kept on scraping the chain against the ridge of concrete he didnt wouldnt feel the chain to see whether the effort he made was winning a degree however small of success he didnt run a thumb or a finger the sensitive part against it to learn whether he had made a fraction of an indentation in the link too scared of finding there was no difference then it would be hopelessness he would slump join the line that had shuffled towards the gas chamber that hadnt needed whipping or the prod of bayonets to keep it moving how long had he been scraping an hour might take a day or three days might take a week the bucket smelled worse that was a new worry better to have the worry about the bucket than about the knife homing in on his ears or his fingers or of them pulling aside his trousers he went on scraping the chain against the concrete and the smell was lodged in his nose he worked on the chain manically a new worry what if the scraping dulled his ears what if the footsteps came to the trapdoor and he didnt bloody hear them what if they knew he was busy with escape in his mind new worries old worries hardly fucking mattered which danced in him we tend to suggest that the hostage looks hard for opportunities to escape but we cant say where they might be every case is different and castrolami grunted do you go there the union flag flew had no more life in it than the american one the british place was sixties modern with a water feature at the front there was a police jeep outside and a uniformed guy lounged with his legs draped out through the open door a submachinegun across his thighs in the square just beyond a fine statue of a bersaglieri soldier double life size stood high on a plinth lukas said today i travel on a french passport sort of a return for favours rendered i work all right with uk special forces and with spooks but the diplomats tend to see me as street dirt so id go there for a glass of water if i was thirsty i saw those troops in iraq i liked the feathers in the hat you like useless information tough shit if you dont the feathers are from the capercaillie bird and the gate behind is the porta pia through which they came to complete the unification of your godforsaken country and give the holy father the boot he was punched a hard shortarm blow with a clenched fist and lukas rode it and rated it a compliment they went through the gate he thought there were bits of ancient roman brickwork in the walls were nearly there castrolami said where i was we can lay down guidelines we know how we think guys should behave but we cannot be arrogant enough to dictate and this boy has never been to a seminar nor on a chief executives course or probably ever read a newspaper a magazine anything with hostagesurvival guidelines hell know nothing which might be a bonus or might be fatal i cant say castrolami said straight face without expression what a pity he cannot hear your encouraging words still he had the discipline still eddie worked and didnt move his thumb or forefinger over the chains link but with two hours gone he found the first evidence of progress the chain seemed to lock more easily on to the ridge then feet it would be such an opportunity in a day three days or a week if the chain was broken and his legs untied wait till the bastard came down the hole belt him on the back of the head with the sharp edge of a manacle knee him in the crotch and leave him stunned be up and out dropping the trapdoor bolting it and running running where running anywhere the scene played endlessly as if it was on a loop in his mind as he worked on the link an image of action and response that pleased him the image removed the fear gave him the sense that he was not a fatted bloody calf tethered in a shed awaiting the stungun but this was not the time the opportunity did not exist he blew hard on the floor hoped hed dispersed the dust hed created and edged himself back against a side wall he groped to find the hood arranged it on his head and let the rim cover his eyes he waited and didnt know what would happen didnt know if the footsteps heralded the knife and squeezed his thighs together so that his penis was protected pinned back his ears and clenched his fists to hide his fingers the bolt was drawn back the torchbeam flared into the bunker and caught the hood pimples of light pierced the material could he at that moment in time rip off the hood stand grab a leg or a foot drag the weight down do damage with the handcuffs on eddie hesitated could he take the decision allow the man to come down into the pit rip off the hood stand up he heard the impact of the plastic bag the light went off the trapdoor closed and the bolt was pushed through there was food in the bag more bread and cheese one apple and water in a bottle his bucket was not emptied he ate a piece of the bread and a nugget of cheese rinsed some of the dryness out of his mouth then went back to scraping the chain on the rough ridge of the concrete the heat in the bunker built on him and sweat drenched him castrolami said that the parkland was the villa borghese gardens that it dated back four hundred years that it covered eighty hectares lukas said he didnt care to know the history of the park and its significance his feet hurt from walking and his throat was parched castrolami looked at his watch might have been the tenth or twelfth time and must have reckoned then that a schedule was on course he supposed that the walk to the park was of similar importance to his own visit to the carabinieri barracks he showed no impatience lukas knew people at the bagram base outside kabul and at anaconda camp inside the balad air base who would have demanded dedicated space computers wired in maps on walls secure communications iced water iced coffee iced tea and maybe their name on a card at the front of the desk lukas could be patient because he sensed castrolami a hulk heavy and clumsy to be a man of substance a guy with whom business could be done he thought it would be rude and tactical shit to chivvy for detail he didnt require action to enhance his role he saw two boys rucksacks off their backs half stripped and washing in a pool into which water fell from three levels to him the sculpture of rampant horses that supported the fountain was art set among huge mature pines which gave wide shade the massive statue of a man in fancydress uniform sat astride a warhorse and castrolami murmured that it was king umberto i there were mock roman pillars designed as ruins and in an amphitheatre the workmen were setting up scaffolding for a concerts sound systems he saw men with dogs women with buggies and tourists who digested their lunch with a stroll not a siesta he saw everything and let his eyes follow where castrolamis gaze went he saw her had to be her there was a wide avenue lined with the high pines sparse grass in the shadows she led a young man good stride and arm movement relaxed was a metre behind her but close to her shoulder her tshirt was dampstreaked and the shorts were baggy too large lukas reckoned shed begged or borrowed them from the young man she ran well but it was harder for her than him and he thought she was not as conditioned as he was twenty metres behind them an older man rode a bicycle the awkward sort with high handlebars that were hired out in parks wherever she didnt look up to left or right he saw her face clearly full and in profile gazed at the thrust of her chin and chest he rated her as the type of girl who would collapse on her knees in serious exhaustion before she allowed the young man to go past her dust spurted from under their sneakers he sensed the privilege he was given he could make judgements from the sight of her a few seconds of watching her tough hard and committed not a quitter he said castrolami was grimfaced we would have turned her out on to the street if we had thought she was lukas shook his head why why tell me why does a decent nonentity boy get his arms and legs around that one why she is the daughter of her father all her life she has what she wants when she is finished with it no longer wants it it is discarded there is something new she wants and she takes it it is the culture of the criminal clan lukas watched her draw away from him and her escort the bicycle squealed needing oil he almost enjoyed the wiggle of her butt noted the drive in her arms and that she kept her head up and still a pity for the boy our eddie that she once wanted him lukas saw her pass the kids washing in the fountain she didnt deign to glance at them and he lost her she had made her own world and stayed inside it she didnt need panted conversation with alessandro rossi wouldnt stop slump and have giacomo orecchia give her water sweat soaked her it was a city of betrayal hers had been throughout the centuries of its history and she thought herself a mere footnote betrayal was the ultimate weapon of the clans it meant nothing went against no culture she took a text an episode of the citys history better to remember betrayal she stretched her stride and couldnt hear panting in alessandro rossi but she could in giacomo orecchia and his wheeze went with the shriller wail of his bicycle wheels she had learned the text as a child at school in the year of a day in august when naples was further forward in architectural standards sophistication and wealth than anywhere else in europe king ferrante i of aragon the ruler invited the aristocracy who he believed were plotting his overthrow to the castel nuovo on the shore to witness the marriage of his granddaughter to the heir of the coppola family they came after the marriage service they attended a banquet in the great hall near the end of the feast the kings lord chamberlain read out the names on the arrest warrants all of the nobilitys names were heard the royal guard came in and took them into custody that day they were tried and before sunset they met the kings executioner in the yard below the castles ramparts they would have betrayed the king so the king betrayed them it was a good story and one from the history of her city she ran well immacolata could not have held that pace and kept the length of her stride without the escort behind her she thought herself liberated nothing nagged in her mind london was behind her and the boy and there was a new intoxication the betrayal she didnt concern herself with eddie deacon she hadnt asked him to travel hadnt summoned him she thought her hair flew behind her and still there was the wail of the bicycle wheels and she thought that for the first time rossi struggled those betrayed were fools to have trusted those who betrayed were tacticians and without guilt she ran until they called the halt in your experience how does it play castrolami asked him they will have moved him first to a holding location then will shift him to something more permanent that completed they make the contact they have something they consider of value and wish to trade there has to be dialogue im grateful for the opportunity to see her you want to walk some more to my room to pack then to the train station they have to make the contact the prosecutor took a call he knew the lawyer well for all of the prosecutors years in the city in the offices of the castel capuana now deserted and derelict and in the new tower to which the palace of justice had moved this man had handled the legal affairs of the borelli family he had contempt for him he believed him bereft of integrity he thought him a symbol of the corruption alive in the city he had first met the lawyer when he had tried to prepare a case against carmine borelli himself a young official his target a man of substance and had failed he had met him again after the arrest of pasquale borelli had negotiated a way through the courtimposed minefields and now had that clan leader locked away in novara he would doubtless meet the lawyer frequently now with the arrest of gabriella borelli giovanni borelli and silvio borelli and after the extradition of vincenzo borelli he heard honeyed words the prosecutor was asked if he was available in his office to meet with the lawyer the following day at any time in the afternoon that was convenient he was called professore he was not a professor of any form of jurisprudence or of streetsweeping or of the cultivation of tomatoes under glass he did not address the lawyer by any title that might flatter him but he could not refuse the request he named the time and rang off he worked in a fortified enclave below his office in the basement were the courts in which his accused were judged in those courts the accused would sit on benches inside barred cages the prosecutor was prey to a personal fear that he had not shared with a living soul would those men and women in the cage contaminate him they probed all of them for weakness it might be through intimidation bribery the honeytrap and a ukrainian prostitute or a business opportunity that seemed legitimate and offered rich returns the prosecutors wife worked in a school as an administrator and was vulnerable there and his son was a teenager and could not have been protected without dislocation of his entire life he himself had only a state pension to look forward to and cash payments could be made easily into offshore accounts he was away from home often for meetings in rome at the ministry then slept in hotels and sometimes was lonely he had enough cash in hand for a relatively frugal existence his one indulgence his love of opera but taxes were high and the cost of living had soared there were many ways in which he might have been contaminated they had such wealth so many resources those who sat in the cages and he had been so far one of the few men regarded as incorruptible his fear nurtured in privacy was that he would stumble at some hurdle he went to conferences in berlin frankfurt and london in those cities of course there was criminality organised and serious in those cities also senior policemen and jurists regarded him he was aware of it with handsoff suspicion he came from that city where the clan gangs ran out of control where murder violence and extortion were embedded where integrity was long corroded he did not have the respect of outsiders for a few more years he would endure the pressure of prosecuting the clans then retirement home in a village in the northern mountains and alone the fear was always with him he made a note in his diary the lawyer to visit in person no agenda set the following day in midafternoon he believed events would play out predictably he thought a boys life was threatened and he would in the next hours prepare himself to make judgements on the value of that life he held his wrists as far apart as the pain would permit using the ridge of concrete and its serrated edge as a saws blade eddie worked on the chain now yes he was prepared to let the tip of his finger feel the scraped line on the chains link and he was prepared to believe he had made a weakness his mind roved as he scratched on the line the time he had once grabbed a man he had crossed a street to a far pavement where a man and a woman struggled and the man had hit the woman across the side of her face he had intervened had dragged the man back with some force he had been kicked and punched not with the ferocity of the beating in the bunker and had been on the pavement his eyes had misted but he had seen the man and the woman walk away without a backward glance and the woman had put her hand on the mans arm then he had dropped it across her shoulders scraping at the chain feeling a line made by the concrete switched his focus if he succeeded and parted the chain if he was free to fight if it was the guy who had taken him off the street if what damn chance did he have better than no chance big brave thought he kept on with the scraping he ate fit to bust and the gastrics put the gas in his gut twice he had noisily released it but carmine borelli had to eat a little of everything that was offered and much was pushed at him most recently he had had a piece of orange and ricotta cake sfogliata and a good slice of pizza margherita with a deep coating of mozzarella and before that more ricotta cake but the riccia version with twisted pastry and he had drunk tiny quantities of stock brandy sambuca and grappa all of which should be consumed after the evening meal but would have come from handily available bottles he must eat drink and be seen he should not have drunk on the pills without the painkillers he could not have made his long walk around the territory he had claimed so many years before for his clan the street urchins the scugnizzi followed him young men and women watched him from the pavements or from the seats of their scooters and seemed uncertain as if they did not believe that he carmine borelli could deliver opportunity money and the calm required for decent trafficking it was the old who pushed cake and pizza on him and the little glasses some he thought had known him all of those years since the power base had been formed and the men took off their caps for him and the women rose from their street chairs to touch with a degree of reverence his arm his mottled gaunt hands or to pinch a grip on his coat the old had known him since he had made forcella his own trade in the brothels had declined and the troops had moved north towards cassino heavier competition existed for the dispersal of american aid stolen and available on the street stalls and then god had smiled on him a day in march carmine looked on it as the most significant of his life vesuvio had erupted a great cloud had risen from the crater in daylight and the beginning of the molten flow was visible when night fell villages were consumed roads blocked a military airfield and its planes were enveloped in the caking heavy dust food warehouses collapsed disaster for many a triumphant moment for a few carmine borelli was il camionista he owned a small fleet of lorries the shortage of transport was desperate he was given a lucrative contract by the military government he prospered he bought more lorries and was able to profit mightily from postwar reconstruction then speedboats to pick up contraband cigarettes heavy plant for digging the foundations of industrial sites as romes government ladled money at the disaffected city but it had all begun when he had mobilised a small fleet of lorries on the morning after vesuvio had erupted it was said that only firearms and ammunition of all the items brought to naples docks by the americans were not available on the stalls of the via forcella the morning after they were unloaded the men who now pressed close to him had driven those lorries and unloaded them and the women who touched him had sold from the stalls carmine toured his streets he tried to demonstrate his authority he was not fooled this was the city of the lazzaroni the mob had taken its name from the patron saint of lepers it wanted to be satisfied the three f words farina forca e festini it was necessary to give the lazzaroni sufficient flour a scaffold to gather round and public festivals of entertainment twice in the last fortyeight hours he had given them a whiff of the scaffold and his progress up the street was similar to a celebration all threatened though by his granddaughter the mob could turn owed no loyalty if necessary he himself would kill immacolatas boy he could see craning his neck when he was at the top of via forcella near the church the summit and cone of vesuvio the mountain had made him he waved and thought himself a king how could she have betrayed him he knew it was a germ in the family in their blood she had been so pretty and he had loved her with an old mans passion now he would happily slaughter her and feel no more than if she was a sheep in the mattatoio kill her with a knife as they did the sheep in the abattoir he wove again and the old men and women applauded her clothes were in a loose heap she heard the immersion heater going as it did when someone was taking a shower there was an ensuite bathroom off immacolatas room she went into it collected her towel from the rail and wound it round herself turned her back on the tshirt shorts pants and bra the socks stained with sweat from the run maybe she was what they called her a whore the towel covered her except her shoulders and her legs below the knees she went out of her room the older one who had bicycled had his back to her but sat where he could see the front door to the apartment through the hallway and did not look up as she glided almost over the marble veneer she could hear the cascade of the water and went to that bathroom which was off the corridor past the kitchen the master bedroom was for her the secondary two bedrooms were for them orecchia had not reacted as she went behind him she headed for the water immacolata thought that rossi had toyed with her on the run in the gardens could have passed her gone ahead drawn away from her speeded up till she had sagged and had not he had kept his station behind her had finally called to suggest that enough was enough but had not succeeded in disguising his superiority his strength so fucking patronising she went through the room and saw the neat pile of clothes sweatstreaked like hers but folded and laid carefully on the floor beside the bed which was immaculately made with perfect corners the holster with the pistol was on the table she went into the bathroom this one was half the size of the ensuite attached to her bedroom she opened the door she could see his outline behind the screen did she want at that moment to be what they thought her a whore two movements but simultaneous she tugged back the plastic shower screen and loosed the knot holding up her towel he gawped at her water steaming cascaded over his forehead down his face and through the hair on his chest to the tangle of his lower stomach and she saw the size of him and the thick thighs she expected him to blush but he did not expected him to jerk up with an erection but he did not the gawp had lasted only a moment she stood naked and the towel was on her feet it was what she would have done in the terraced house in dalston but only when eddie was in the shower god not when any of the other boys was there eddie always blushed and always went his shock was brief he reached past her his right arm brushed the curve of her left breast his hand came back with a towel he put it round him and water spilled down it she didnt move make room for him he had to work his way past her and when he did his hip was against her stomach and his chest was against hers she looked into his eyes and he into hers then he was gone behind her he said quietly im sorry your shower isnt working signorina well get a plumber in to repair it she stood and regret bloomed please signorina feel free to use ours she stepped into the shower felt the heat of the water then dragged the screen across she didnt know then whether he watched her silhouette she thought she had indeed made a whore of herself he said and she could see the shadow movements as he dried matteroffact in our training for induction into the servizio centrale protezione we do roleplays to cover many situations one concerns the pentita from naples carmela palazzo known as cerasella she was barely literate pregnant at twelve and active in the spanish quarter with the family men in gaol she controlled their speedball industry drugs heroin and cocaine at a meeting inside the poggioreale prison visiting room the men blamed her for huge debts arising from her incompetent dealing in narcotics she screamed abuse and was slapped across the face in her humiliation she went to the carabinieri offered herself for collaboration she was taken to a safehouse had protection but she was beyond control our roleplays involved walking with a woman collaborator on a street of shops she puts an arm through the guards which is forbidden pretends he is her lover her husband how can she be protected if she holds his hand or links his arm she goes into stores that sell underwear she waves items of intimate clothing at the guard how do you like this my sweetheart and the guard is embarrassed she runs away she is brought back she accuses falsely a guard of raping her we did many roleplays signorina that were based on the actions of cerasella yes she helped in the destruction of the mariano clan no the protection didnt last we threw her out cut her adrift and she was regarded as a sad inadequate person fit only to sell narcotics in the roleplay were taught how to respond to erratic personality as when a collaborator behaves with the modesty of a prostitute enjoy your shower the shadow was gone water fell she scrubbed herself with soap she had heard of course of carmela cerasella palazzo had never met her or seen her from a distance she switched off the shower towelled herself she had wanted to show power over him when she came back into the living room rossi was dressed and sitting beside orecchia nothing was said which increased her humiliation she wanted arms round her to be held to be saved from the shame who could have held her she saw his face had gloried in betrayal and knew who would have held her forgiven her in the darkness eddie scratched at the chain he reckoned he had now smoothed some two feet of the rough concrete that made the ridge but had at least six more to work on new thoughts new attitudes swam in his mind he must cope with isolation and the fear it induced and he believed that sawing at the chain grinding at it obsessionally focused him away from misery which led to the next necessity must try to stay positive positive to eddie had meant advertisements to be sniggered at in which companies quoted some unheardof american electricshaver sales guru who would teach for a fat fee how to acquire confidence his mother was a positive thinker always regarded the glass as half full and ditched the empty bit and his father had chided him for not having the ambition to go to the furthest limits of ability there had been so much crap to eddie deacon not any longer and because it was a positive reaction he started to play a word game took a word stripped it jumbled it found new words he would have derided it in the staffroom and the guys in the house would have hooted at him if hed suggested it as an exercise in mental agility but he had stored it as an entertainment with mental arithmetic meaningless figures and further down the line there would be physical exercise maybe he would try squats pressups or lying on his back and lifting his legs three or four inches eddie thought that being positive was important and thought that if he ever broke the chain and freed his hands the agility physical or mental would save him had to think that once he heard a voice a whistle of some tune and footsteps but they didnt approach the trapdoor once he heard an engine faint and muffled as if a car had come close and then a radio had been switched on and off the sounds didnt make a pattern that was another thing a pattern was to be observed noted analysed clung to in case the chain broke and he worked hard and the sweat was in his eyes making them smart the bucket stank worse he thought he wanted the bucket taken and emptied more than he wanted fresh food more even than he wanted water eddie was certain of it now the link in the chain had a clear indentation not wishful thinking more than mere positive thinking there was a line in the steel of the chains link that his nail could settle in he went at the work harder and didnt care to think of the consequence if he were to break open the chain link and free his hands time drifted and he created word games arithmetic games that were more complicated taxing and the dust of the smoothed concrete was thicker in his nostrils caking the outer skin of his lips he had to do it for himself no other bastard would how will he be scared lukas said scared and alone feeling that the world already has given up on him probably in darkness probably trussed up likely to be hooded castrolami drove we have kidnapping in the south in the toecap of the boot it is an industry and when payment is slow there is the possibility of a knife taking off an ear or a finger and the item consigned to the postal services but not here i do not have the experience of it lukas thought castrolami drove well they went fast had come off the autostrada and were now on a dualcarriage way ahead there was a wide panoramic vista of lights different intensity but constant then a short curved horizon and beyond it almost total darkness but the gulf of naples was broken up by oases of lights and lukas thought one would be the island of capri but didnt know which he could keep most layers of excitement well suppressed but always a faint buzzglow grew in him when he saw the first time his place of operations might have been from the hatch window of a cessna light aircraft coming in to a jungle strip up in the mountains and far from bogota or from the porthole of a c as it corkscrewed down towards the bagram runway outside kabul or from a black hawks open hatch and over the shoulder of the machinegunner anywhere in shia or sunni iraq if he didnt have the buzzglow if hed gotten too cynical for it it would probably be past time for him to call it a day go quit it was all sort of routine and he had played this game so many times and he didnt expect to be surprised he still had and was grateful the focus they hadnt talked much on the journey lukas reckoned that castrolami was poor with chatter they had done a little castrolami had a wife and children up in milan and theyd gone there because the job was shit and they never saw him and he had a friend who painted and most times he took her out he was asleep at the table by the time the meat was served and he was fortysix and bullets had come through the post in little padded bags lukas had given some had done the fbis unit for hostage rescue had been on the sidelines at the big events ruby ridge and waco did coordination now and was a year older at fortyseven his mother had brought him up in a trailer camp and had cleaned offices to get him through college she was americanitalian and his father was pretty much a shit and long gone there was a wife martha and a boy dougie had only mentioned his sons name but lukas had said nothing else of him they all lived together now mother and wife and son in the trailer park adjacent to each other and the cutoff didnt seem to bother him they had talked a bit about things that didnt matter and didnt affect why they rode in a car down a hill and into the city of naples seemed theyd each talked enough about themselves lukas said very few hostages taken have an expectation of the risk they come to the situation with an experience bank equal to that of a newborn child we talk the language of leverage that would be an appropriate word leverage is where were at and negotiation is not an appropriate word when we have an open line of communication we talk a fair amount about negotiation but its talk i accept that talk buys time the time is used for assets of intelligence surveillance informers for just plain oldfashioned luck to chip in i dont come from a world where hostagetakers get rewarded maybe up front ive been party to them being paid for a freedom exchange but then they get hunted down shot or hanged or they disappear off the face of the earth i understand the reality in this case immacolata borelli if we paid we would destroy an antikidnap strategy applicable in domestic italy for more than thirty years i said i understood lukas murmured and if we permitted immacolata borelli to withdraw her evidence in return for the boy keeping his ears fingers eyes whatever else of his body that can be cut off the programme we have of collaborators with justice is finished the postal service would be filled with the stink of decaying flesh again i understand castrolami said close to the autostrada where we left it was the territory of the nuvoletta clan we have bypassed the zone of scampia which is the base of di lauro now we cross the suburb of the city called secondigliano and it is under the control of the licciardi clan and the contini clan as we drive towards the old city we pass the territory of mallardo misso and mazzarella they are the principal families of the camorra then there is another level lo russo sarno de luca caldarelli picirillo and the clan of borelli then another level of perhaps as many as eighty clans the first level we cannot destroy we can make arrests occasionally when we find a principal and we can disrupt but little more the second level is where we find the borelli clan with a collaborator it is possible i used it with care but possible to take the conspiracy apart to the extent that it ceases to exist the opportunity does not come every week or month it might come once in a year but i would believe that is optimistic every two years or three lukas asked she has that capability immacolata borelli we believe so we remove a clans leadership it is a ship that has no crew more important it has no rudder it sinks warfare breaks out as the void is filled but many opportunities then come our way in the scramble for the empty territory other clans ruthless in what they will do the risks they will take the numbers they will kill make mistakes mistakes are fertile ground for us she has that importance a gently posed question the tower blocks of great housing estates lights climbing into the darkened skies were gone the streets were filled now with cars and they had slowed off the route lukas could see narrow little openings noise engines horns music shouting came through the windows immacolata borelli can deliver us the clan her mother her brothers the hitman and the enforcers the buyers and the bankers it is a chance for us to win do you know what it is lukas not to win keep it for another day winning and losing lukas said some days in life it is necessary to win another day we talk about winning and we decide if we can win twice with the girl with the boy i dont bargain with you it is not for discussion we have to win with the evidence of immacolata borelli it is primary if afterwards we save the boy eddie deacon the idiot and the imbecile now forgotten then we may drink some spumante it is made at vineyards near the town of asti in the region of piedmont they use the moscato bianco grape it is very popular in italy it is drunk on a celebratory occasion i like lukas said drily i think you dont often get to taste spumante my friend it is my regret that true i drink it rarely lukas gave him the winter smile no love no life no humour the car was stopped against the kerb lukas was given directions how far he needed to walk how long it would take him and was told to watch his back and put his watch in his pocket out of sight castrolami told him he was going to his office his workplace in the barracks and would set up discreetly a crisiscontrol desk he took from his wallet a card that bore just his name on one side no logo wrote his mobile number on it and gave it to castrolami then he reached to the back seat and pulled the laptop out of his rucksack needed a contortion but he achieved it and asked that the computer be lodged at the desk overnight they shook hands perfunctorily like an afterthought he closed the door and slung the rucksack straps over his shoulders he saw the car veer away then lost it in traffic but he didnt think castrolami had swung in his seat and waved the sort of man lukas was and his judgement of castrolami did not take time out for relationships with professionals a sharp punch a quick handshake was a good par on that course he had asked to be dropped near to the piazza garibaldi had not been asked why or where he had booked a room he recalled what he had been told peeled off his watch and pocketed it the streetlights were low the headlights blinding and it seemed that around him the city was vibrant alive it flourished lukas couldnt walk along a street in baghdad or basra kabul or kandahar bogota or cali he saw backpackers in front of him guys and girls who were half his age would have come off a train and now trekked from the mainline station to whatever fleapit they could afford his clothes were of course clean laundered but not pressed and he was shaven but not closely and his short cropped hair was not brushed or combed he lit a cigarette dragged on it and tobacco smoke mingled with what he breathed out he felt good here he pondered castrolami and himself were they on opposite sides of a chequered board a girl who was needed as a state witness was one queen and a boy who had done wrong place at wrong time was the other and if the game was played to conventional rules only one could be left standing he would have to act if they were to claim a victory on maverick rules but he had been told it was not a city that threw up victories he went by the cafes the bars the little restaurants and pizza houses past the stalls where clothing was slung and past tall west africans who had laid on the paving handbags with fancy labels not good for a man in lukass trade to stand up and cheer if the hostage walked free or to crumple and sag if the hostage came out zipped into a bodybag could do his best nothing more after success came another day and after failure there was one more day to be met he thought though and this hurt that the priorities were not with the boy and it would be a difficult road to walk he saw the sign lit hardly welcoming one more backpacker in town older and more wizened but unexceptional he smiled wanly at the small group of men who stood by the step up into the pensione and worked his way past them none seemed to notice him he was greeted at the desk he thought himself a welcome diversion from the australian kids who had come into the lobby complaining that the toilet was blocked and wouldnt flush he murmured a name the one that had been used on the reservation which was on a passport he now offered canadian then asked the guy whether he was giuseppe he wasnt giuseppe was the day manager worked from seven in the morning until seven in the evening lukas lied said a friend had been here had spoken well of the pensione and of giuseppe he was given his key slowly tired he started up the stairs he did not know yet which had been the floor where eddie deacon had taken a room he was tired a little hungry and the room allocated to lukas would inevitably be shit and his situation would inevitably be about a thousand times better than eddie deacons he unlocked a door went in kicked it shut he said quietly you get my best effort kid cant say more and cant say it will be enough gerald seymour the collaborator as did his wife carmine borelli possessed the cunning of the elderly and the wiliness of a veteran he didnt understand the technicalities of the most modern surveillance systems employed in the piazza dante barracks or inside the questura but he had grasped the need for total vigilance his jacket collar was turned up a loose cotton scarf covered much of his lower face and he wore a cap with a peak to hide his nose and eyes from elevated cameras he had walked more than two kilometres done backdoubles and alleyways before he was satisfied then he had been picked up in a small repair garage in which he had a commanding financial stake an old friend had driven him the car in which he had travelled to the north of the city was not a mercedes a bmw series or an audi not a vehicle of status it was a humble massproduced fiat churned out by the turin factories anonymous he would have confessed climbing stiffly from the passenger seat and stepping into the sunshine to a flutter of apprehension it was hostile territory and he was inside it mobile phones would have logged each metre the fiat had brought him deeper into the complex of towers he saw the scooter accelerate towards him then brake and swerve he was happier to have salvatore at his back when carmine borelli had taken charge of the forcella district of the old city where the streets followed the old layout of foundations put down by roman builders the district of scampia had been scrub fields and smallholdings there was now a population of some seventy thousand it was outside the area of his experience and a new breed of clan leader was found here they did not frighten him but were a cause of anxiety he had created wealth that was exceptional by the stricken standards of the forcella people and pasquale had built on it hugely increasing it vincenzo if he was ever freed would take it further salvatore had removed the helmet and tucked it under his arm carmine borelli took a cue from the hitman and doffed his cap he unwound his cotton scarf and smoothed the collar of his jacket it was almost an act of submission it was a sign that they accepted they walked now under the protection of a more powerful mans authority the families supreme in scampia had wealth on different strata from that of the borellis they were here among the richest in the entire italian state those families also employed violence on a scale that could almost turn carmine borellis stomach they fought pursued vendettas tortured amputated burned alive he came with a request the difficulty of asking the more powerful for favours was that a high price could be exacted desperate times meant desperate measures were employed they were checked in at a pavementlevel entrance men spoke on mobile phones men searched him with aggressive disrespectful hands men took the firearm from salvatores belt men eyed them as if they were lesser creatures carmine borelli could accept the reduced status but thought it harder for salvatore to bow the knee he imagined in salvatore that pride burgeoned it had to it could not be otherwise they were led up a flight of stairs filth had accumulated in the well past scattered syringes he would not have tolerated the heroin addicts needles left as litter in forcella but the drug trade and its trafficking had come after his time of ascendancy he was brought to an ironbarred gate across the firstlevel walkway it was unlocked by more men they went through heard it clang shut then the rattle of a heavy chain carmine knew little of ironwork but would have been an imbecile not to have realised that the fire brigade would need sophisticated oxyacetylene cutting gear to get through it and it would be slow work they walked some more then went through another gate similar and climbed another staircase little in life could frighten carmine borelli but later he would admit to anna if the virgin smiled on him and he was clear of this fuckplace that he was uncertain unhappy with his experience on the lower floors of the great sail tower in scampia when they were on the third level there was another pause at another barred gate and he breathed hard sucking air into his lungs and cursed a lifetimes cigarettes his hip ached sharply it was good that salvatore disarmed was with him he thought by now they must be close more men waited here more mobiles were used and he heard little jabbers of code talk he thought the numbers were a show of strength of power he must acknowledge it what would he say how would he say it and why he would say and it had been rehearsed in his wifes presence with her making suggestions and when he had walked avoiding possible surveillance and the gaze of cameras and when he was in the car being driven north to scampia i value this meeting i appreciate that you have given me your time i am grateful for this opportunity to the point these are difficult times in forcella my son pasquale is in novara and i believe your cousin and your nephew are also in novara my eldest grandson vincenzo a fine boy is held in london and my younger grandsons giovanni and silvio are in poggioreale my beloved daughterinlaw gabriella also is arrested these are very severe times for my organisation built with my blood and sweat for half a century and more the threat to us now is from our own i could tear out my tongue for speaking her name my granddaughter my immacolata has prostituted herself and taken the money of the government she destroys all i have built we identify a weakness a boy from england followed her here is stupid is ignorant and loves her we hope the whore loves him we hold him but not where we can keep him we need a secure place i ask for a secure place a week no more under your protection i ask also for my sons most able associate salvatore to be allowed free access we will put as great a burden of pressure on my granddaughter to retract and withdraw as is possible here under your control is the most secure place in naples i would of course pay well for such a service that was what he would say there were more men on the walkway at either side and in front of a door the door was rapped opened he saw then that salvatore was blindfolded with a cloth perhaps one for drying dishes but he himself was not he prayed to the virgin that salvatore would accept the indignity not curse and rip it off he was rewarded but he saw the heave in salvatores chest the people in scampia could recruit salvatore or shoot him and leave him sprawled on a pavement he thought himself he was safe too old to be butchered too feeble too insignificant he was shown in salvatore was guided after him he was taken to the kitchen a man sat there dapper with rounded shoulders and a cigarette lit between his fingers a packet of marlboro light lay on the table he had good hair well styled and clothes that looked expensive but not luxury wear beside the cigarettes there was a pocket calculator and scrap paper with scrawled figures in columns pasquale had known this man there were no alliances in naples as there were in calabria or in palermo but there were arrangements he played his part he ducked his head showed respect he knew if the request for help cooperation was granted that a high price would be exacted there was no alternative he was fascinated by the face of the man his features a photograph of him appeared regularly in the newspapers but was more than twenty years old no more recent image existed and the newspapers said the police had never succeeded with a telephone intercept in recording his voice salvatore had made the links arranged the meeting he had done well carmine borelli was waved to a seat if his request was granted the boy would be moved to the most secure suburb of the city would be beyond reach he began i value this meeting i appreciate that he sawed at the chain it was not a dream not any longer eddie deacon could ease his thumbnail into the growing slit in the link he worked harder frantic he had his jacket off hitched on his shoulder without the sticks that were offered at the cafe castrolami would not have reached halfway up the steep path it was still early morning but already the haze was building and the dawn clarity was wiped out the city was far away and distanced further by the skim of cloud that sat over it when he stopped and turned he could make out the runway at capodicino the highrise blocks of scampia the cranes at the docks the curved line of the via francesco caracciolo the castel san elmo squat on the hill and the castel dellovo that jutted out into the sea he could not see his own district let alone his block or the block of the artist he had started this trek on the southwest side of the mountain for the view it was so many years since he had attempted anything as childishly idiotic as a climb to the crater rim of vesuvio maybe ten perhaps then it had been in february or november not in the heat of a september morning the sweat spilled off him and the dust lay on his face it was annoying to castrolami that the american well american but claiming some italian maybe some german a possibility of some british ancestry and the certainty of being a gypsy a mongrel that was a bastardo walked well and kept just behind but did not heave pant and gasp his annoyance was increased by the refusal of the bastardo to ask at any time the purpose of the journey they had left the barracks at piazza dante climbed into castrolamis car driven away from the city and parked in the yard by the station at scavi pompeii they took the bus up the hill past the old fortifications that overlooked the sea the everthinning scrub when the bus came to the park they were left with a final three hundred metres on foot to the rim it would have been good to hear what the fuck are we here for he had not thought to bring water sweat discoloured his shirt each time he stopped to calm his breathing and pretend to examine the view a steady column of tourists passed him going up and coming down he alone wore suit trousers and carried a jacket it could have been that lukas found amusement in the climb in castrolamis discomfort they hit the last metres the path of caked stampedon dust cut through a lunar landscape almost nothing grew here the stones and rocks were angular punishing a dull lifeless grey there was a first viewpoint where a fence kept the tourists a metre or more back from the rim and the cliff beyond it there were japanese in large numbers so castrolami pushed on and headed for a white metal and plastic contraption a couple of metres high and fastened with wire stays he thought it would do for his purpose he leaned on a rail lukas came alongside him gave him nothing waited and kept silence not being asked why took the gloss from castrolamis moment his calm broke almost a snarl of anger do you want to know why you are here or do you not want to know he was not certain but he thought he felt a weakness could have been mistaken didnt believe so eddie deacon worked at the link running it on the rough concrete ridge what was certain the pit where his nail went was always deeper lukas said do you want any smart shit talk from me about what volcanoes ive visited where ive picked up hunks of lava i can do that talk if its necessary i dont think it is the view is nonexistent comfort is nonexistent shade is nonexistent were the only two cretins in this place too dumb to bring water you have friend my undivided attention he saw castrolamis lips purse reckoned the anger was at the edge of control he thought the morning wasted lukas said say what you want to say there was a harshness about the craters rim and the sun came up from the stones of lava fields to reflect back into his eyes he looked down could see far into the hole and found himself straining to see better a hawk soared on the east side the drop of the cliffs from the rim to the core was uneven ragged faint curls of thin smoke or steam emerged from the rocks and dissipated lukas supposed there was some relevance to it and was patient he was rewarded castrolami said defiant i should bring here everybody who visits the city to meet me i should use it as a theatre set to explain the reality of naples anyway you are ready lukas didnt often do snide and smartass thought the rewards shortlived he would need the big sweaty armpitstinking carabinieri guy he said i am castrolami flung out a hand theatrically waved at the hole it is one thousand nine hundred and thirty years less one month since the eruption that destroyed pompeii and ercolano there was an eruption in the year three more in the eighteenth century four in the nineteenth century there have been two in the last century and look down you see nothing that is threatening it is at peace something dead that it exploded is in history not actual you cannot look down and see anything that is a maximum danger maybe it is only the newspapers that speak of the danger look at it see nothing and be blind lukas permitted himself to be led did not interrupt he assumed that castrolami had flogged his body through the ordeal of the climb for a good reason and waited for it the scientists call it in english language the plug for us it is the tappo the plug holds down the lava underneath the plug hides the reality of what is there the plug to keep the vision of harmless peace is some ten kilometres deep below the plug is the burning liquid mass the lava and you have to imagine an enormous cavern in which it boils bubbles and is unseen and that cavern may have a diameter of up to two hundred kilometres if the plug breaks the cavern is emptied and pours upwards the volcano is the city of naples at peace and tranquil with fine churches and wonderful galleries and good food and wine a triumph of sophistication and safe it is an illusion maintained by the strength of the plug out of sight and beyond your gaze there are powerful destructive forces i brought you here to explain about naples the real danger and the false calm we can go now lukas did not chide did not complain he thought actually it had been a good image and he doubted he would soon lose the sight of the scree slopes the rockfall debris the rough lava pieces and the smoke wisps that were all of the great forces at play he could see he must imagine he started out again on the path and dust slithered under his soles the tourists came by him gasping struggling and the sun was higher hotter he paused and looked down not into the pit and on to the plug but at the city he saw nothing that threatened only the mist he saw no danger in the faint hazed buildings that were toysized hard for him to understand that a poison was down there hedged in by the blue of the sea i have it thank you yes lets go he thought of the boy not good for him to feel emotional involvement about the same age as the son who lived with his mother in the trailer camp and didnt write he had heard from the london office that the boys parents spoke well of their son and with love and were on their knees with anxiety he thought his own son placed where the boy was would have lost any will to fight after about ten minutes of capture maybe less he liked the face of the boy from the picture sent to him and thought his own son nondescript perhaps ugly but lukas didnt do soapopera sentiment it wasnt about the son he wished hed had anyone lame and halt or fit and fresh would have his utmost endeavour he had killed the thought of his own detached family but not his mind image of the boy they went down together he thought eddie deacon would be existing in a living hell maybe the city itself lived under a plug but could destroy it is a good place you agree do you want me to flatter you or kick you nothing in naples is as it seems wrong lukas said the boy is kidnapped that is as it seems i enjoyed the walk and this is not about tectonic plates its about criminality dont give it excuses and ill buy you lunch he thought it would break in another hour if he could increase the pressure on the link where it ran on the concrete it seemed to bend fractionally in his hands when he had broken the link and the chains hung from the two manacles what would he do couldnt face that couldnt think about it while the chain still held christ why did nobody come why no sirens why no help why did nobody care could have screamed it didnt eddie went on sawing at the link very grave times professore grave and unhappy please distinguished avvocato explain your request for our meeting the prosecutor had not done the lawyer the favour of meeting him in his personal office had he done so he would then have had to abandon it while fumigation and scrubbing were carried out he was able to be civil to and understanding of the principal criminals he met after their arrest always found them polite and correct of good intelligence and in a few cases exceptional intellect he found some well read in modern classics and some in poetry and with a few he had discussed with passion his love of opera he was not sworn at neither did he feel his home and family were threatened the professionals the lice on the criminals backs disgusted him you understand professore that material comes unsolicited and without prior notification through the post to my office i understand material that is sent anonymously no cover note of explanation in this case a single sheet featuring a photograph and a written demand upon receiving it i immediately telephoned your office professore and you were gracious enough to permit this meeting everyone called the lawyer by his given name umberto he gloried in that familiarity even members of the judiciary were known to use it in court the prosecutor would not the professional men were the prosecutors belief essential crutches for criminality they cared for the legal matters that were the inevitable cost of a career in organised crime they opened the bank accounts and transferred the laundered monies they placed investments and advised on what stock should be bought or sold they were the politicians paid handsomely for access to contracts sometimes if he walked alone and unknown in the darkness and thought deeply the prosecutor considered that the professionals might indeed be the ones who pulled the strings and the clan leaders were mere marionettes this lawyer disgusted him but was clever many manhours had been devoted in the palace of justice to bringing him before the courts as yet they had failed what do you have for me i must say also i was this morning stopped in the street by a stranger a message was given to me i have this from a frayed and scratched briefcase a symbol of experience and also of humble poverty a transparent sheath was taken not poverty the lawyer would be worth for his work with the borelli clan many tens of millions of euros paid well because he served well the meeting was in an interview room there was a table with an ashtray and four chairs three walls were bare and one carried a framed portrait of the president of the republic it was minimalist and intended to offer no comfort the sheath was passed across the table he saw a photograph printed on the top half of the page and under it was the handwritten message if immacolata borelli does not make within one week a statement that she has left the custody of the palace and will not give testimony now or ever against persons known to her this man will be killed the prosecutor had enjoyed a varied career but remembered best the time four years he had spent in reggio calabria there had been similar photographs then staring eyes trapped in a moment of fear by the brightness of the camera flash the filth on the shirt or blouse or dress the thickening stubble on a mans face and the tangle of uncombed hair if it was a girl usually they held a newspaper usually also they seemed to demonstrate the desperation of the damned as if they didnt believe help existed or that they were anything more than supine participants in this photograph the boy had a pleasant face the man who stopped me in the street i assure you professore he is unknown to me he said that the boy taken would lose an ear after four days a finger after five his penis after six then would die if immacolata borellis statement was not passed to me i dont know why me the prosecutor remarked briskly because you represent pasquale borelli and all his tribe im just a messenger of course i would deny that my clients the family i have the privilege to represent and who are hardworking honourable people are linked to this sad difficult situation then he asked innocence creasing his face do you know who this young man is professore do you know his connection with immacolata borelli no it would be a tragic distortion of reality if the position of this young man was to weigh against the family my clients of course im only the messenger again of course you dont have the envelope in which this communication was sent to you for forensic studies i regret that it had been shredded before its contents significance was noted could you give a description of the stranger who accosted you he was behind me i never saw his face of course there were four directions in which the future career path of the prosecutor could go he might write the letter give the notice of termination go to walk in the beloved dolomites quit he might be transferred to the antiterrorism force and posted anywhere there was the chance of promotion to rome and the chair of command over the three primary prosecutors in palermo reggio calabria and naples he might just soldier on maintain his office at the palace beaver away at his work and log seventy hours a week the last option had a saving grace one day or night he would nail this shit bastard and see him dragged away in handcuffs unable to shield his face past the lines of flashbulbs and know that he was headed for the remand cells of the poggioreale gaol and a chance to share life with pimps thieves and pushers the scum of the city he never lost his temper in public he did at home he would pace his living room his child shut in a bedroom and his wife gone to the kitchen and howl at the unfairness of life he stood up the lawyer rose awkwardly from his chair the advantage of the interview room was that it did not have airconditioning and was therefore uncomfortable sweat streaked him should i be telephoned should i be accosted again is there a response i can give something that will save this unfortunate from mutilation or death no there is not the lawyer said a cut in his voice you play professore with a life do you speak as a link in a chain of negotiation and therefore as part of a criminal conspiracy or as the mere messenger he did not expect a reply the guard outside the door would escort the shit bastard from the building how hard was she the girl the prosecutor took a lift high up the tower to look for coffee who could read her and know her breakpoint he carried the sheath that protected the paper with the photograph of the staring eyes the white cheeks under the stubble colour burned from them by the flash the tousled hair and the dried blood on the skin to destroy the borelli clan would be a triumph but would carry a price it was indeed beneath the wideeyed fear a pleasant face he sawed and felt the chain link weaken he hadnt imagined it he knew it he began to think of it fighting began to stiffen with the stress of it a dream or a nightmare but kept sawing the dust was thick on his face and his eyes hurt he thought of everyone he knew and wondered if any among them would believe that eddie deacon in a hole with no water and a shit bucket could break out of handcuffs and fight his mac would she couldnt answer that the shower hadnt been mentioned or her strip in front of alessandro rossi she was subdued immacolata talked of her mother the taperecorder was controlled by rossi and orecchia prompted it was general not the detail required by castrolami the prosecutor or his deputy she scratched in her mind for memories and tried to offer up the minutiae of detail and between what she had to offer orecchia would speak or rossi as though events elsewhere had taken centre stage and the safehouse apartment on the collina fleming was no longer of pivotal importance orecchia had said the position of women in naples is unique in naples a woman can rise higher faster than in the south or in sicily it was the legislation of all the collaborators provided for all the arrests that followed that took away the glass ceiling and women flourished if theres a problem what do they do they call for the women rossi had said the women have less loyalty than the men pupetta maresca first lady of nola knows that her son is dead knows that her son is in the tower supporting a flyover bridge knows that a cocaine importer killed him and she moves in with that man and has twins with him she was a star not as clever as your mother but colder she talked of her mother with detachment as if she was speaking of a stranger she had met casually and briefly from orecchia the men in the family will usually follow the orders of their father but always the orders of their mother another from near naples anna mazza from afragola her husband is shot so she sends her thirteenyearold son to kill the assassin he fails all the men in her family are enlisted and they go to war her order the family of the killer is exterminated and another family one of anna mazzas hitmen is killed the revenge that killer is taken within a day tortured with electricity then crucified against a door because a woman wanted it from rossi we say of the women that theyre clever theyre ignorant they cant read and write theyre coarse or vulgar but theyre respected and feared all of those are true of your mother except that shes neither illiterate nor innumerate shes clever and shes feared she talked of her mother holding a meeting in the house rare and discussing a pending shipment from venezuela and seemed to acknowledge no blood ties no family the woman at the clans heart enjoys the privilege given her if she leaves it she has nothing maybe its more important to the women than it is to the men they say escape is impossible from poggioreale but patrizia ferriero succeeded in taking out her husband the scam she complained he had a severe kidney problem she was the supreme fixer she went to a hospital bought the blood of a kidney patient then arranged for it to be fed into a dialysis machine brought into poggioreale to monitor his condition she was allowed to transfer him to a hospital and he served his sentence in luxury and she bought the policemen on guard duty with cocaine then one day he rose and the police did not look and he walked out of the hospital her driver and bodyguard was a former carabiniere she was very intelligent she talked in the flat tone about the mother who had not kissed hugged or praised her we think women are more capable at criminality but less visible we believe that few women will stand against the lust an orgasmic attraction of power you owe your mother nothing an accident of birth does not have the right to demand loyalty immacolata said she would go to the kitchen and make lunch salad fruit and cheese she had not asked if she could run again in the gardens at the villa borghese through his cleaned window using the small mirror that he kept between his knee and the arm of his chair davide watched saw the movement on the walkway and the bustle and his head did not seem to waver or his eyes to move off the bigscreen television it was not usual for there to be so much movement so many men so early in the day he thought he had seen also a clan leader hustled along the walkway among guards towards the barred gate on level three but his paymasters were not concerned with the daytoday nighttonight dross life of the sail he watched everything in his memory he noted everything but he had witnessed nothing that would break his routine of meetings eddie reckoned that in five more minutes he would have broken the chains link he worked feverishly had pain in his arms and shoulders more dust on his face and in his eyes more sweat and the footsteps came with them there was music louder as if doors had been opened and not closed and the music flowed closer with the footsteps not one pair might be three they had differing rhythms and weights eddie didnt know whether to use the last moment as the footsteps came nearer to try to break the link or to leave the goddamn thing could have fought one couldnt fight three low voices were above him they would examine the handcuffs see the scratch line the sawed indentation and know what hed done wouldnt kill him no might beat him he heard the bolt pulled back had the hood on his head and peeled down the hem and the fraction of light from between the trapdoors planks was gone darkness enclosed him what was the best that could happen that the bucket was taken out what was the worst eddie shivered the sweat on him had no heat he realised it was a tremble a dog in a farmyard knows it has done wrong is called and goes forward on its belly he had seen that on the farm where the heifers were near his parents place wanted still to hate the man who had taken him off the street wanted more to hear him laugh and know he was not to be beaten the trapdoor was opened the hinges groaning the torch shone down and light seeped below the hood hands grabbed him he could smell the breath chilli maybe but onion and nicotine too he was pulled up as he was dragged out through the hatch there were hands under his arms there were no grunts no wheezes big men powerful his feet scraped the edge of the hatch and he was swung clear his hands were dragged forward and he felt the pressure as a key was inserted into the handcuffs lock they were removed he had enough freedom to run his hands over his wrists and felt the smoothness of the welt he had made as he scraped then the laughter broke round him and the chain of the handcuffs rattled as if one manacle was held and the other danced beneath it he heard then the snap as the link was prised apart the laughter was more raucous he waited for the blow he tried to duck his head and to have his hands in front of his crotch waited and his arms were pulled behind him and a plastic tie bit into the skin where it was raw he thought and was bitter they should be fucking grateful to him for giving them a fucking laugh by trying to break the fucking chain all the hours hed done sawing and scraping for nothing had given them a laugh eddie could have wept he was held he heard one go down into the pit and there was the noise of the bucket swinging whining as its handle took the weight then an oath some of his urine or faeces might have spilled out as it was hoisted he heard also the rustle of the plastic bag in which his food had been the rope at his ankles was untied he was taken forward and the trapdoor dropped behind him new fear played with him mocked him was it now they would take his penis his finger or his ear he had only her picture to cling to he had the blownup photograph on his wall the smile and was so far from it and he kicked out his foot took a good step he had verged towards selfpity forbidden had edged into the area of regret that he should never have come forbidden he tried to walk tall upright he was led out of a building and his feet crunched on broken glass a vehicle door opened and he was pitched forward he knew from the smells that it was the same van as before he didnt think now that they would bring the knife to him a rug or a blanket and maybe an old carpet were heaped on him and a boot pushed him against the bulkhead they went out of a yard on to a potholed track then a tarmacked road where was he going why was he being moved what was the immediate future it didnt fucking matter eddie lay on the floor of the van and rode with its motion he didnt know of anybody out there who cared so it didnt fucking matter he was near to weeping but held off it was massimo the lawyers nephew and clerk who met anna borelli a legitimate meeting not one that could have aroused suspicion he met the aged lady on the broken pavement among the cheap little clothing stalls on the piazza nazionale and they walked slowly together her dictating the pace towards the poggioreale gaol it was natural that anna borelli should wish to visit her two grandsons in the prison and natural that a lawyers clerk should attend with her it was an opportunity to feed the prosecutors reaction to the family the clerk didnt chivvy her to move faster he was well paid already owned a car and had bought a good apartment in the high complex of offices hotels and accommodation close to the prison and the palace of justice he had done better than any of his colleagues at the university in the faculty of law he would he realised gradually take over greater responsibility for the legal affairs of the borelli family the borelli clan he was sucked in pulled towards a vortex how to step aside difficult how to forsake the material rewards more difficult he believed with the certainty of night following day that his future would be eked out on the far side of the high wall which had watchtowers guards with guns attack dogs searchlights and cameras he thought it had been only the brilliance of his uncle umberto that had kept the old man from the cells in the blocks beyond the wall he went slowly because he hated going inside the place it had been built ninety years before massimo knew the statistics it had statutory accommodation for eleven hundred inmates and actual accommodation for two and a half thousand there was tuberculosis in the goal hepatitis and hiv a ninehundredmetre subterranean tunnel linked the cell blocks to the palace of justice it was a place of hell but it was glorified in the folklore of the city there clan leaders had enjoyed carpeted cells had had personal chefs and had drunk champagne there murders were commonplace alliances forged it was where he would go and his uncle umberto into sardinetin cells into dirt and violence if he did not break the link but he had a highperformance car and a fine apartment with a balcony view of the mountain he told anna borelli of his uncles meeting with the prosecutor she did not reply immediately but instead coughed hard and grating then spat phlegm ahead of her and let her laced shoe step in it they were near to the gate now there they would face banks of cameras and metal detectors and they would go to cubicles for body searches he was struck always by the quiet with staff some three thousand souls were inside the walls of roughcarved basalt from vesuvio but there was almost silence like many in the city massimo the clerk enjoyed the rewards of association and could not quite bring himself to break the link her voice was harsh in his ear we should have drowned the bitch at birth now we should slice up that boy use a bacon cutter on him and send her the pieces massimo knew the old woman had made coffee for the boy had brought him a slice of cake and would have smiled and simpered at him while her husband went for the man salvatore he had in truth but unspoken admired immacolata borelli she was four years older than him and had hardly seemed to notice him but he had often thought of her and his uncle would have approved she has to be broken only when he is in pieces will she break tell the fat fool that tell your uncle salvatore will understand the smells hit him he couldnt have said which was stronger the urine the sweat or the disinfectant they went through the side gate salvatore rode the pillion the problem revolved in his mind would he use a sharpened shortbladed knife a chopping knife or a knife with a line of tooth points a knife for an ear and a different one for a finger and which one for a penis it was what he thought of as he rode and his chest was tight against fangios back they wove through the traffic went fast and the pistol barrel was hard in his groin the problem and the wind on his shirt ripping at his shoulders gave him a sense of power they had gone through secondigliano were now far away from his own territory sanita and forcella they were high above the bay and crossed the ground of the licciardi and contini clans that part of secondigliano was called by everyone maybe even a postman terzo mundo if secondigliano was the third world another problem what was scampia it was the war ground he was used by pasquale or gabriella borelli to enforce authority perhaps once a month and no more than twice on these streets and in scampia there were bodies on the pavements most nights they had come off the quadrivio di secondigliano gone past the lowsecurity prison the towers were to their left and they were on via roma verso scampia he had read a week ago before the idiocy had started in il mattino that a sociologist had said if you live in scampia you have no hope of anything ever being better you cannot have optimism you have nothing and no possibility of legal work or anything that is psychologically rewarding it is a prison the boy growing up here as a teenager might as well be locked in the cells of a goal he had read that because it was on the same page as the story about himself named with a photograph he had thought it a shit article about a shit place he lived in safehouses scattered through forcella and sanita he was optimistic his picture was on the screen of kids phones and he was rewarded one day one day he would drive a ferrari on the seafront at nice and stay in a hotel where a movie star would have stayed and it would not be gabriella borelli in his bed one day he saw the sail again fangio took him towards the great weatherstained mountain of concrete he supported carmine borellis decision to bring the boy here for safekeeping but he thought the old man had given too much in return too much of a percentage of a shipment coming to the naples docks in three weeks too much of a share in a contract for the rebuilding of a sewage system on the north side of sanita he thought them peasants contadini here but he had masked his anger when the weapon was taken from him and he was blindfolded they were on the via baku salvatore did not know where baku was in what country or why a street in scampia was named after it they were waved down he said who he and fangio were where he went and by whose authority and he gave the registration of the van its maker and colour and then he was allowed to go through there had been that knot of men another at the outer end of via baku and more at the junction of the viale della resistenza otherwise near emptiness he knew that from every angle he was watched he laughed the scooter swerved fangio had twisted he laughed because he had remembered the scratched line in the manacles he laughed at the effort wasted he thought escape from here from the sail in scampia was impossible as impossible as from the maximumsecurity wing at novara or the one for sicilians at rebibia impossible he had not resolved which knife he would use which blade he was jolted the braking of the van no warning threw eddie forward and his shoulder cannoned against the bulkhead the back door was opened no ceremony a blanket was draped over him he was moved fast no voices eddie thought it had been four or five paces from the van and into a building he couldnt see but he could smell all the human smells but above all decay they had hustled him inside but it seemed they were happy to slow and go at their own pace now wherever they were he was taken up a staircase he didnt know whether it was enclosed or open but there was no wind on his hands and no suns warmth and the rest of his body was covered with the blanket he was not hit small mercy he was thankful another flight of stairs hed tried to count to count was to be positive reckoned as best he could that he was on a third floor then went along some sort of corridor it was wide because men were alongside him to his left and his right and they had his arms at the elbows not a word spoken would have said he went a clear hundred paces along the walkway heard a knock heard a door open in an instant response was jostled through the gap narrow because one man led he followed and another man had to wait to come behind now he heard a television set blaring but not near bolts were drawn back and another door opened he was pushed and pulled inside a room and knew the space was small and that there was no open window because he was hit by clammy warmth suffocating a chain was put on eddies ankle he felt its weight tight against the bone the blanket was pulled off and the plastic strip that had gouged his wrists was cut the door closed was bolted the sound of the television was gone and silence crushed him he did not start to learn his new prison its dimensions he slumped stood against a wall bent his knees and let his weight take him to his haunches then toppled over the chain tightened and he lay on his side he had not bothered to remove the hood he wondered if he was beaten lukas walked it was good for him to feel the air of the city to breathe it and learn from it it might be the last chance he had to indulge himself and he was mean with his time did not willingly waste it he soaked up what was around him he called it a tipping point and had identified it from what castrolami had told him a mobile call the italians phone clamped to his ear the frown deepening the gasps on the cigarette faster and deeper the phone shut down they had been close to the barracks at piazza dante he had been told of the meeting at which an official at the palace of justice had met the corrupt lawyer one of those who always ran with bad guys a photograph and a demand he had asked them if he could walk feel the small streets they crowded close to him hanging washing made an arch over him cooking scents fed him lukas went to a chapel paid to go past the door stood in awe and stared at sammartinos veiled christ so lifelike marble made into flesh and cloth and was in the majesty of the place for three minutes no more had learned and had pondered on the tipping point not original a lecturer at quantico had spoken of a tipping point had offered an analogy of the final gram going on to the scales and toppling the equilibrium a legal assistant drawing up the separation agreement in charlotte had talked of the tipping point as the moment when a failing relationship became irretrievable a sociologist doing demography out of the green zone in safe comfortable baghdad had done the study on sunni and shia mixed neighbourhoods but when one side began to leave shia or sunni the tipping point was reached when goddam ethnic cleansing was on its way the flight started and what had been mixed was now either shia or sunni a tipping point was reached when what had meandered took on a new momentum it had a photograph and a demand changed the game it increased the pressure on castrolami and his people to keep the girl in line and on lukas to get the boy out it increased the pressure on the girl he had seen running and on the people who held the boy heavy pressure now all different he did not have a map in his pocket he was in an old city on streets where shoes sandals and boots had strolled walked and trekked for two millennia he did not know could not have said whether he was close or far distant from where eddie deacon was held but lukas seemed to flare his nostrils he gazed at faces at windows and at shadows he was a fighter it was his preparation once a tipping point had been reached he went to work walked faster gerald seymour the collaborator three men brought food two filled the doorway and the third came in there was light behind them above their heads and shoulders and it flooded inside he was still sitting hadnt moved cramped and stiff but he pushed himself up the man who came in was the guy who had snatched him off the street the eyes were clear cold and bluegrey the fingers were long delicate almost a musicians the lips were thin without the life that blood brought perhaps cruel eddie barely looked at the face only the eyes and lips then the fingers in the fingers there was a lightweight plastic plate with slices of sausage and a portion of cheese there was a plastic water bottle on its side the plate was laid on the floor but beyond eddies reach a trainer toe edged it across the floor the movement shook it and a piece of bread fell off on to the worn grimy linoleum it could not have been washed in months maybe years there was a tackiness to it that could have come from dried urine or spilled food eddie looked into the eyes had it been an accident or done purposely nothing showed it was no matter to the guy that the bread had gone on the floor the lips didnt move and no expression crossed his face eddie took the opportunity hed heard once that it was called peripheral vision and he tried to keep his head static but to use his eyes to rake across the space about eight feet square about seven feet high a window at the top of one wall but covered with heavyduty hardboard he could see the pattern of the nails fastening it there was a metal bucket there was a ring attached to the wall to which the chain was fastened there was graffiti on the walls which had once been whitewashed but he couldnt read what had been written the door had steel sheeting on the inside all those things he absorbed and stored and his head didnt move why did he absorb store it was his refrain no selfpity but acceptance of reality no one was coming for him his life was in his own hands that sort of crap heavy heavy stuff he saw ants on the floor little beggars scurrying the piece of bread off the plate was in their line of march a voice you are ok eddie gagged why did the bastard care he didnt know how he should reply to the hesitant question in accented english well theres a fucking chain on my he was kicked the trainer swung over the plate and the toecap caught him a little above his right knee hard when the foot swung back the heel clipped the plastic plate and all the bread was on the floor with the cheese and the sausage the water bottle rolled away he wasnt kicked again but the door was shut locked and bolted then nothing he would initiate a short debate better to say in answer to the question you are ok that he was fine grateful for the kindness and room service better to say that he was not ok because he had a fucking chain on his ankle better to be passive or better to earn a kicking no decision taken no consensus of opinion better to crawl to the bastard or better to fight didnt know how could he they hadnt done survival training at the sixthform college in wiltshire or at the university at the language school there were no extracurricular classes in it the kick had hit the bone above the knee and the bruising hurt but he felt better for bawling out the bastard he wondered how far the ants had reached wondered if they had found his food on the floor he squatted down gave the chain a pull but merely jarred his wrists then reached out blind to collect the bread the sausage and the cheese he had thought when he had been able to see the food that there might have been blue mould on the bread crust better when there was no light and when he couldnt see the ant column eddie ate his food he didnt taste mould but had grit from the linoleum in his mouth and didnt know if he had swallowed a platoon of ants he ate part of the food left for him then went to work he stood up stretching leaving his weight on the manacled foot he could touch the wall where the window was set it would be his first target he tried to get his fingernails into the space between the wall at the edge of the hardboard but could not he tried until the nail of his right forefinger cracked far down the pain was sharp and he winced then sagged back maybe half a minute no more stood again stretched again and again could get no leverage on the window he realised more his head was against the hardboard his ear to it but he couldnt hear anything no music no television no kids no laughter or shouting what he did not hear told eddie that there was soundproofing beyond the hardboard which meant additional layers and he couldnt shift the first layer and he couldnt reach the door and he couldnt shift the ring that held the chain and he couldnt stop the pain in his finger from the broken nail hed once read something an academic had said on courage the important thing when youre going to do something brave is to have someone on hand to witness it and hed read something an american had said on heroes we cant all be heroes because somebody has to sit on the kerb and clap as they go by might have been both might have been one didnt know which but he laughed good to laugh bloody good not a big laugh a belly laugh a gutshaker but a pleasant enough chuckle new experiences walked with eddie deacon on his hands and knees on linoleum and in the crack where the edge met the base of the wall he searched wondering whether he was close to the ants camp from which they came out to forage on his bread cheese and sausage while he searched he didnt think of the knife which blade they would use his hands pushed and probed he didnt know what he was looking for but he searched the gameshow on television was new one of the milanbased independent channels and the girls in the show went topless it was the third week that davide had watched it he would have said if asked for a true response that he believed the girls on display were hopelessly anorexic he didnt have that level of conversation in the sail ostensibly in his chair in front of the television it appeared to any man on the walkway peering through the cleaned polished window that davide the idiot harmless gazed longingly at the slack breasts that bounced on gaunt lined ribcages but the agent had the mirror wedged between his thigh and the side of the chair he had seen much movement that day more than was usual and personalities he was an agent a watcher and had been sent on a crash course to gain the skills was knowledgeable on the workings of electricity nobody of course who lived in the great sail paid the state company for electricity nobody ever had to face final demands delivered by postal officials nobody was ever cut off for nonpayment davide as he was known was not required to run cables from the main supply into the apartments on level three but he was useful when a fusebox blew and when new plugs were needed then he was sent for that was good the poor the derelicts and the addicts did not have the electrical appliances that blew out fuses men high in the chain of command did that was good for his handlers four months before he had been to an apartment nineteen doors further along the walkway and had wired in four new power sockets had noted the carpeting and furniture the shrine to the virgin and a copy of dostoevskys the possessed in translation on a table so deltafoxtrot had identified the safehouse used by a principal clan leader on the third level of the sail he had seen the man the reader of a russian classic that day that man who the agents handlers said was among the four most influential and powerful crime players in the city had walked past the polished windows surrounded by his guards he had gone towards the apartment and an old man limping with another man had been escorted after him then the big player had come again past davides window and a hooded man had been dragged by his handlers would be interested only in information relating to that principal his handlers were not policemen they were interested only in the most senior men everything the agent saw he remembered and to back his elephantine memory there were tapes his handlers had placed him in the sail four years before he was a crusader he was there because he wished to make a difference a son buried and the heroin microbe gone in his veins to the grave a wife had walked out on him unable to weather the strain of an addict youth at the time of the death and the walkout he had worked in a bank in a resort town on the adriatic he had volunteered himself had not been accepted had come to live in a neighbouring tower on the far side of the viale della resistenza had made the second approach had been accepted given a code name and a cover history that checked had been found the apartment number once every week he took the bus into town reported and delivered tapes once also every week he went to the minimart and bought the basics of sustenance the rest of his waking hours he spent watching the walkway or sat behind a lace curtain in his bedroom observing the street below he knew every pulsebeat of the sail knew the times that the buses came from the railway station down the hill on piazza garibaldi scampia with the sail at its heart was the narcotics supermarket of italy even of europe both users and dealers took trains to come here from all over italy from frankfurt and berlin paris and marseille london birmingham manchester madrid and barcelona the regular bus service waited for them at the station and if the police stopped the buses there were taxis a watcher on a street corner a teenage youth was paid two hundred euros a day and there were twenty piazze each administered by a capopiazza they were the locations where cocaine heroin and ecstasy were sold in scampia all needed watchers and watchers were employed in three shifts an army had been recruited to watch the bus passengers coming in and those driving their own cars and to warn of the approach of the police the boy who went from the customer to the dealer could make eight thousand euros a month and eight hundred if he was extraordinarily to get a job in a factory each piazza his handlers had told davide generated an income of fifty thousand euros a week so the trade for this abandoned urban slumland brought in a guaranteed minimum of fifty million euros a year just what was sold on the streets of one suburb of the city the figure they emphasised was a minimum a young buck if ruthless if charismatic enough to find blind followers can head a clan by the age of thirty can be worth a billion euros it was a fighting ground in the late evenings when his television was turned off davide would sit in his darkened bedroom and rely on the few streetlights still working for necessary illumination to watch trading and killing linked clans clashed assassins went after a man couldnt find him took his woman tortured her for information on his whereabouts she wouldnt tell so she was trussed and put into a car which was torched in scampia a man was beheaded with a butchers axe in scampia the assassins came to take a man from his mothers home he had already fled his mother in her nightdress was shot on her step and bled to death in scampia he watched every day and every night and knew the vagaries of the pulsebeat of the sail and a short bus ride from the stop on via baku was the old city patronised by the tourists the lovers of fine arts and the gourmets who did not know about scampia his eyes flitted between the mirror against his thigh and the gameshow he knew that in the depths of this monstrous building a drama played around a hooded man dont ask me any questions if you ask it will be wasted breath yours wasted time mine all i can say what you tell me is of critical importance to the wellbeing of your friend of eddie he had marched them down to the pub roddy duck johnstone had taken a corner table then gone to the bar had been given a tray by the barmaid and had come back with two pints for each of the three lads one missing still at work and a single scotch for himself six packets of crisps and six of peanuts his question tough or weak determined or vacuous hard or soft serious or kidlike which is eddie he didnt need names hadnt a taperecorder and no need of a notepad from the club waiter who would be late at work hed like you to think hes just a lazy tosser that nothing matters to him that hes a pushover maybe he was but not any more hes changed actually hes quite tough i think hes pretty determined the phd students contribution the role he acts is that hes weak and soft just a prat really maybe he was everythings altered though hasnt it a new man our eddie quite funny to watch it hunched forward the revenue and customs clerk said he wanted to seem a kid still never going to grow up like the thing hed run a mile from fast was responsibility thats in the past gone to the recycle bin different guy and maybe carrying us with him tough probably and getting tougher determined wouldnt have jacked the job and done what he has if he wasnt hard and serious i suppose so but its like i said and us too he listened he let them tell their anecdotes put more pints in front of them and didnt speak until he felt hed drained them late duck asked what was different how had he changed what was new like a chorus spoken together it was mac she turned up that is one fantastic person immacolata was what was different she changed him maybe us immacolata was the new thing sorry and all that if we dont express it well immacolata was brilliant any guy would be crazy not to go after her are you going to tell us what this is all about whats of critical importance he bought a last round more crisps and left them he drove back to his office went inside he started to type and tried to express what three pretty inarticulate guys decent enough secondrate enough had said about their friend and about the girl and didnt know whether he did a good job or a poor one and whether he had painted a fair enough portrait of her could she go into the borghese and run rossi said she couldnt why not because castrolami has to give permission and hes in naples why was he in naples i think you know signorina try to remember please the lie you told the taperecorder had been put away of course it was foolish to imagine they would allow her to run in the darkness she worked towards the challenge could they go that evening to a restaurant orecchia said they could not why was it not possible to eat in a restaurant it requires the permission of the investigating agent castrolami or of the prosecutor both are in naples and i wont call them for this there is food in the kitchen why were they in naples orecchia did not look up from his magazine i think you know very well signorina what business they have in naples if you hadnt lied it would have been different but you did you arent going to run or to a restaurant she stood then legs a little apart pelvis forward head back chin jutted and built on the challenge am i difficult are many collaborators difficult will you write a report on me as difficult rossi said a few arent particularly helpful orecchia said some not many go on believing signorina that theyre still on the pedestal they enjoyed while their family was cosa nostra or ndrangheta or camorra some until they have disabused themselves are difficult we believe theyre frightened of the reality of their situation which they created of their own free will you can flounce pout stamp throw plates and slam doors shout or wave your boobs and fanny at alessandro but nothing will change she sucked in her breath prepared to bare her spirit i should tell you that alessandros wife is exceptionally attractive very much more attractive mentally and physically than you she spat the question whats happened to him they looked at her dumbly perhaps theyd practised their expressions of incomprehension orecchia had returned to his magazine as if he didnt understand who him was rossi had not reacted to the description of his wife orecchias tone had been harsh and unforgiving as if he had spoken to a child in a school room not that such a volley of insults had ever been directed at immacolata borelli at school her mother had brought her on the first day to the forcella infants classroom the head teacher and the year teacher had been lined up as if she was heiress to the bourbon dynasty a seat had been found for her at the front of the room and the staff had bowed and scraped because she was the daughter of the borelli clan her father had taken her on the first day to the middle school had materialised from his life as a fugitive and slipped an envelope stuffed with banknotes into the hand of the head teacher murmuring about new electronic equipment it had been pocketed with discretion her eldest brother vincenzo had escorted her to the senior school and had oozed power as he walked alongside her into the building at every level of school she had attended her marks in examinations had been exceptional her reports remarkable she was the daughter of the borelli family and no teacher would have been stupid enough to mark her down or criticise her only at the accountancy and bookkeeping college had she been treated almost as another kid and there she had met her friend marianna rossetti and orecchia and rossi spoke to her as if she was any other child one who was not given the seat of privilege at the front she repeated it more shrilly what has happened to him what has happened to eddie their eyes met unspoken acceptance that something must be said something minimal orecchia said the boy you indicated was unimportant to you yes we dont know what has happened to him rossi said signorina we are very junior links in a very long chain we would not be told the latest intelligence we dont know castrolami would tell you if he knew anything or the prosecutor we are merely functionaries they dont share that sort of information with people at our level doubt clouded her you know nothing nothing nothing of substance she went to her room didnt bang the door but closed it carefully she stood at the window and gazed out over the roofs and myriad lights stretched away from her none was in the home of a friend or lit the street of a friend or was driven on a road by a friend she had no friend in this city she stripped let her clothes fall and stared out of the window at the expanse of lights the air chilled her skin it hurt that she didnt know what had happened to him hurt that she had made a play in her mind of ignorance she knew what happened to members of the family of a collaborator to their friends and lovers ignorance was not a screen behind which she could hide she thought it was orecchias voice she could hear and imagined he had telephoned naples to tell castrolami of her hysteria but had not rated it a problem off the operations room at the piazza dante barracks there was a square annexe space four metres by three no more into it had been crowded a work surface six computer screens and keyboards the same number of chairs and scattered telephones and at the edge more chairs there was no window and cigarette smoke fogged the air he knew the names of the two men who shared the work surface with him but lukas did not make conversation had no wish to or need to neither did he think it would be welcomed one was the carabinieri units psicologia the other was the units intelligence collator he bided his time because experience had taught him that the psychologist and the collator had to be won over would not respond to being battered into submission lounging against the annexe walls there were sometimes three sometimes four of the fastreaction team lukas knew about the raggruppamento operativo speciale their kit scattered at their feet flakvests caps windcheaters boots and radios down a corridor there were more of them he was an intruder tolerated only because word would have come from rome that he had saved the life of a colleague it allowed him to be accepted but not welcomed that would come later if he could insinuate himself without breeding hostility they talked italian round him and he gave no sign of understanding a word they said he had good italian but as with other european languages he favoured often disguising the fact a concession he had been brought coffee with a ham and saladfilled roll he learned that every informant in the city used by the squadra mobile of the police and by the carabinieri s serious crime squad had been alerted to the kidnap of the english boy learned also that teams scoured cctv tapes for evidence of the abduction and the movement of a hostage learned as well that the grandparents of immacolata borelli were now under twentyfourhour surveillance as was their lawyer as were all known associates and that the watchers and tailers had been stripped from highprofile targets learned that one of the clans most effective and feared assassins the borelli familys man was loose on the streets location unknown learned that an ear a finger or a penis was expected in the post soon and lukas learned that the informants had produced nothing learned that the cctv tapes had given up nothing or the surveillance operation he would have said that the faces around him were not cut by disappointment he sensed fatalism the inevitability of failure too early in the relationship with the annexe for him to chivvy far too early to press a point did time exist for the niceties and the protocols it had to an alternative did not lukas would know when he was accepted by the psychologist and the collator the guys from the ros the storm squad when they took his cigarettes and offered him their own not yet they smoked theirs and he smoked his but the coffee and the roll were a start as a kid from the trailer park he had found virtue in waiting and patience any kid from a trailer home a father who was partbrit partpolish and gone in search of bettercarat goldpaved streets a mother who was partamerican partitalian who cleaned offices no money sloshing in pockets knew that waiting and patience paid dividends he would wait with patience until his opinion was asked and advice requested already he sensed a poor outcome was anticipated could have been worse there was an icon story about hostage negotiation had to be true too precious not to be some said the icon was a british guy having a real black day climbing a crane ladder to a jerk sitting on a spar above him squealing that he was about to go fly and that hed not be talked out of it mindmadeup crap the icon had shouted back way im feeling this morning friend way my missus is carrying on do you mind if i come up there and join you we can bloody jump fly together the story was that the brit guy meant it would have the story also was that the jerk didnt want to share and came straight down there was always somewhere that it was worse for someone it was getting late and there was room in the ashtray on the table between lukas the psychologist and the collator for maybe six more butts hed stay that long it was always about intelligence the psychologist could feed in opinions but intelligence gave facts and nothing came late that evening he walked with the prosecutor it was difficult for either man to say that he was subjected to a greater or lesser emotion or no emotion than usual when they knew a wretch was beyond reach both the prosecutor and castrolami relished the cool of the air almost a chill on the face drying the days sweat they were outside the palace and traversed the wide piazza with the towers of the financial district the holiday inn and soughtafter apartments ahead on what they earned as servants of the state castrolami and the prosecutor had no chance of purchasing or renting a place in one of those blocks neither did they need the services of the financial institutions lodged there but to their right was a church a better place lights beamed from it and castrolami could see the figures inside he thought it a rehearsal for a wedding there were bodyguards behind them the prosecutors a pair of men the church drew them as they talked the desk at piazza dante reported nothing rome reported a crisis point what to do the church was modern finished in and the concrete of its slim pyramid shape and the narrowing twin towers that supported the bell was not yet weatherstained it was named after a saint carlo borromeo died aged fortysix in milan of a fever from the plague sweeping the city he had helped the sick at great personal risk and paid for it with his life it was a dramatic building a feature of the centro direzionale and the prosecutor was a familiar figure there he led castrolami inside the bride was not beautiful and the groom was not handsome she wore a skirt about three centimetres too short and the other faded jeans they pledged their future and had good voices castrolami said i had felt her to be strong now i sense weakness the prosecutors voice was soft would have been inaudible to the couple their supporters the priest and the woman who worked the portable cd player for their music i always look for a priority her evidence statement taken with full legal cover her appearance in person in court as a witness i look for a priority then for accommodation of it there is no accommodation excuse me there cannot be we cling then to the priority the statement then the appearance there can be no manoeuvre castrolami shrugged perhaps then he thought of his own marriage his wife severefaced wrapped in sheets of white material and himself in a fulldress uniform a serious dispute within a week over the date of her mothers first overnight stay at their onebedroom apartment his motherinlaw and his wife would share the marriage bed and he would sleep in the living room on a pumpup no accommodation no compromise no manoeuvre extraordinarily he had stayed long enough with his wife to produce three children he visited each year stayed a few days drank too much then piled with relief on to the fast train from milan to the south he was his own words pathetic sad and a committed dedicated singleminded focused investigator he supposed that in an inexplicable fashion he represented the hopes of the girl with the short skirt and the boy in old jeans the priority alone is worthy of consideration she goes to court she gives evidence there is no question of stepping aside from the priority the boy came of his own free will he was not volunteered well do what we can for him he doesnt intrude on the priority even if we condemn him i want to bring her back to the city they watched the taking of the mock vows heard the moment of laughter filtering through the high building as the couple were invited to kiss and did so with rare passion castrolami told the prosecutor what he wanted why and when and it was agreed and the boy attractive intelligent interesting it doesnt matter castrolami said weve decided on the priority he is in second place the prosecutor bowed towards the altar where the couple talked small detail with the priest crossed himself then turned for the door he was reflective in the world war there were occasions when a ship was torpedoed and sunk and sailors were in the water injured and choking on oil but because the enemys submarine wasnt located ships didnt dare to stop and pick up the survivors they sailed past and through them it was a question of priorities i think they weigh heavily well do what we can castrolami said flatly priorities rule us a great truth cant be ignored good night pray for him they parted turned their backs on the church nobody could refuse her nobody could dare to leave a shuttered window a locked door and a darkened interior for her with a slow crabbed step anna borelli in her eightyeighth year came late that evening along the via duomo she had already been the length of the via carbonara up the slope on the right and down on the left and before she was finished she would have traversed the via dei tribunali the west side some boys walked with her they had been ordered to stay outside the shops and bars she visited but they were seen and they carried hand weapons axe handles a baseball bat a claw hammer and they had mobile phones linked to an outer ring of watchers it was not necessary for her to intimidate all paid the pizzo it was not inside the perimeters of reality to avoid payment she was a small crow of a woman she stepped among filth and rubbish because those streets were not on the tourist routes there was a corner a junction where carmine had shot a rival more than a halfcentury before had fired two shots and one had missed the target the rivals head there was still the mark in the stone by the bars entrance where the bullet had struck there was a bar now under the clans control in which five shots had been fired into the ceiling before carmine had been accepted as protector there was a vehiclerepair yard where a body a man killed by carmine manual strangulation had been kept for five days before it had been safe to move it to the pits of a factorys foundations into which concrete was poured she walked well and felt the control that power gave and fear people on those streets begged for her cracked smile and blessed her when she gave it she called on those shopkeepers small businesses cafes and bars and all were there though it was now late in the evening she was admitted and shown the books she discussed profit margins and heard dismal explanations of the pressures from global national and local economic recession unmoved anna borelli told them what they should in the future be paying in very few of the premises did she offer a reduction or no change in the amount paid monthly in the pizzo she raised the protection fee and in so doing she gave the impression that her daughterinlaw had allowed slackness to creep into the affairs of the clan those for whom the price was hiked did not complain bluster argue there had been a woman four years ago who owned a paint store in the san giovanni district she had refused payment and also to cash a cheque made out for a hundred thousand euros men had been imprisoned and the woman had been in the newspapers and even in time magazine there had been demonstrations in support of her but nothing had changed and people still paid as they had before the woman lived under police guard now and made no money an empty gesture anna borelli thought with some she gossiped about their children with some she talked about her husband a bladder problem and difficulty in the hips with a few she recounted the situation in the poggioreale that faced her grandsons the misunderstood persecuted giovanni the innocent gentle silvio with others she discussed the circumstances of the incarceration in the north of her only son pasquale and the brutality of the prison officers all of them she knew would have liked to talk about the infame the treachery of her granddaughter immacolata none did none dared the majority had had their pizzo fixed by immacolata and confirmed by gabriella borelli all knew the girl she was not spoken of the old woman knew that when she left each of the premises and the door was locked the shutters dropped the lights turned off it would be immacolata the whore whose name flitted on the lips and there would be sniggers the bitch was dead a grandmother had decreed it the whore the traitor the infame was condemned her secret she knew also what leverage could be exerted on the girl who was damned as a lemon was squeezed until the pips burst through the rind he searched he crawled on the floor went as far as the chain permitted him there was no concrete ridge on this floor and the chain links were double the thickness of those in the bunker that opportunity would not be repeated he started again and searched couldnt find a thick woollen red sock under the bed or the easy chair or in a corner of his room in dalston and couldnt find a shoe in his room at his parents home in wiltshire couldnt find the big brightcoloured folders with his teaching notes that hed left lying in the staff room at the college the idea of eddie deacon on his hands and knees in darkness relying on touch to a methodical careful painstaking search would have appeared ludicrous to the guys in the house or his mum and dad or to the other lecturers they would have had him down as a shambles in personal organisation untidy to a degree simply chaotic the chain rattled responding to each movement of his trailing leg he wasnt hungry or thirsty but it seemed an age since he had eaten the food brought him he had lost track of the times when it was necessary to eat and drink get up in the morning in dalston wash shave do his teeth and use the toilet then down the stairs and must have a slice of toast from old bread past its date must have with it a smear of margarine and jam must have coffee to wash it down a break for lunch at work bells ringing lecture rooms emptying and sandwiches rolls or instant soup in the staff room must have something or all known forms of life would end a microwave meal in the evening or a trip to a cheap italian a curry house or the afghan was a must do and the familiar corner seat afterwards in the pub and some pints down to his mother and fathers at a weekend and must have a piece of beef pork or a leg of lamb for lunch life couldnt go on without it eddie had no watch no sense of hours passing no knowledge of when darkness would come beyond the boardedup window no hunger and no thirst what did he look for he didnt know why did he look for something there was no acceptable alternative it wasnt acceptable to lie back and wait for them to come with the knife he did the floor and the walls smoothed them with his fingertips and used the sensitivity of his palms didnt find anything found nothing that was of use only the clank of the chain kept him company he had gone round the floor up the walls and round the blocked window but had found nothing he began again he made a change he took the image of immacolata out of his mind as if it was a transparency slide and slotted in a projector and replaced it with the image of his captor the man he hated and kept it in his mind like a new day starting was he delirious was he hallucinating was the face a fantasy it had its use it concentrated him he worked at the search and had a refrain he must save himself because no one else would the streets around the pensione were raucous crowded exploding with noise and movement lukas came through the door which swung shut behind him inside there was stillness he was handed his key by a small man dapper and neat lukas thanked him youre giuseppe i am sir youre the day manager lukas wore his best smile and its night i thought id see you in the morning better at night and my friends baby has a colic so the man shrugged lukas recognised the conspiracy he had asked on leaving that morning and handing over his key briefly but not furtively to meet the next day he hadnt expected the duty rosters to be juggled the man flashed his eyes across the darkened hall looked briefly but fast and comprehensively for an eavesdropper but the bar was empty the breakfast room deserted and in shadow i took my friends shift you are sir lukas did a droll grin i am who my passport says i am of course sir truth was end of a long day lukas could not have remembered with certainty which passport he had used when he checked in it wasnt that he was difficult secretive covert he just couldnt remember which goddam passport hed had and thought that age crept up on him stabbed him in the back it was a canadian passport sir the day manager said impassive from under the reception desk a bottle was produced with a couple of plastic beakers and measures were poured lukas saw the shake in the day managers hand he didnt offer money might but later the best intelligence in lukass experience was not bought its about the boy yes sir i would have talked to you this morning but you had breakfasts checkouts the dutch complaining about the hot water still dry i had the new zealanders who wanted a reservation in sorrento for two nights and the greek couple had fucked excuse me sir till four in the morning my friend told me and broke the bed they want a replacement not repair its about the boy i understood that sir forgive me sir the world comes across my lobby dresses in many ways and has many ages many disguises youre not a tourist you have no map and no book and do not ask directions to the palazzo reale the castel dellovo or the teatro san carlo and no businessman stays here i understand sir we have to trust each other i expected you someone i made a telephone call perhaps i regret it i realised afterwards there would be consequences someone would come it is a city where humble people myself do not seek attention i have to trust you or i walk off the beach and into the sea you have my word lukas said his right hand took the day managers his left lifted the beaker and brushed it against the others he held the hand while he sipped bad brandy he respected informants many did not the brits he knew had put up bureaucratic barricades to block entry to iraqi collaborators they were lonely and unloved by most handlers seldom thanked for the risk taken he knew it from the fbi days lukas would have thought that a few hundred euros palmed across the desk would have insulted the integrity of the day manager he did good sincerity when he guaranteed his word and meant it many he had known attached to task force out at anaconda in the balad base who did a years iraq duty had handled agents milked their udders dry then cut them adrift lukas had little sentiment but he appreciated that agents who volunteered help were vulnerable like the day manager my word is good i telephoned the family of eddie deacon thats why im here it is not yet in the newspapers his capture theyre trying to keep it suppressed cant do that for many more days i did not see him taken tell me i was brought a piece of card it is what we give to guests our address and phone and we write on it his room number it was dropped in the street and picked up and brought to you yes by a witness yes who was the witness lukas saw the squirm on the day managers features one thing to have involved himself another to involve his informant lukas understood in this culture and in this city what would be an informers reward death would come like mercy twice the day manager seemed to rehearse a statement but nothing was said then lukas could have sworn did not an australian couple young handsome bronzed and near to collapse came through the door his eye was already closing and the bruise had started to swell while below the hem of her shorts the knees were grazed he backed away heard the babble about her handbag the snatch from the motor scooter her dragged along the gutter him catching the shoulder of the snatcher who rode pillion and being lashed clear by the drivers elbow in the bag were passports plastic and some cash and christ did they think they were in bloody woolagong on the bondi christ didnt they know they were in naples italy he knew about woolagong from a special forces guy who had a girl there and theyd spent long hours waiting for the assets to turn in something of value lukas thought he had lost his man he hadnt the brandy was produced again more beakers were found the australians were given alcohol were sat down the day manager said he was going to telephone the police but as he lifted the phone he murmured into lukass ear in via forcella at the bottom is the home of carmine and anna borelli old people he came out from their home and was taken there is a stall for fish beside the outer door he is tomasso he will have returned from the market at dawn he saw it have i killed myself have i killed him i gave you my word the key please the day manager dialled then started to shout he did well he stood in the corner of the robbed couple and demanded an appointment for them the following morning lukas thought it all bullshit but the australians would have been pleased with his vigour while he shouted he handed lukas his own room key and a second he thought the greeks had had their bed repaired or a new one had been moved into their secondfloor room he went on up climbed a further flight there was police tape on the door he broke it used the key and went inside he experienced the feeling that a lawenforcement man never lost on going into private space with entire legitimacy but as a trespasser the room had been searched but he reckoned the check had been perfunctory done without interest or enthusiasm later he would sit on the bed think and contemplate he believed in the value of association with a suitcase clothes or just where there had been a presence so little of eddie deacon was there the bag clothes on the floor including the previous days socks and boxers there was a passport a wallet with a few euros lukas thought the boy had left behind as much as possible before venturing out in the wallet was the photograph the picture brought alive the girl he had seen run in the gardens more important it brought alive the boy he had been perhaps a hundred yards from her in the villa borghese gardens here he was close and could touch her could almost smell her and hear the laughter that seemed to ring from the picture infectious he saw the prettiness the vitality and the youth not matched in rome seen at a distance he knew holding the photograph under the ceiling light why eddie deacon had crossed the continent to bring back the girl in his trade he was not supposed to feel emotion and relate to victims it was thought dangerous for involvement to feature he knew about hostage rescue hostage negotiation and the coordinators job of evaluating talk against force and his whole life was the work lukas had never loved the work made do as his family could have been inside the broad family of the bureau or in the gargantuan family of the military or in the close tightknit family of ground force security love was now had been in the past absent from lukas he had admired his mother he had felt affection for his wife martha at first he had not reacted to his sons birth on a date after the divorce was finalised he looked a long time at the face of the girl then he had seen enough he left everything as he had found it except the photograph from the wallet he laid the picture with care in the breast pocket of his shirt careful neither to bend nor mark it it was the photograph that screwed lukass intention to deny any emotional involvement he looked around him for a last time switched off the light closed the door locked it then resealed the jamb with the adhesive police tape he went off down the corridor and down the stairs and the greeks were still at it he felt as if it was a weight on him the picture in his pocket saw the smile and heard the laugh good if it had been possible to make promises cant do it kid he murmured its not a business where promises are possible sorry but you have to appreciate that his own room would be so empty and without a photograph to light it gerald seymour the collaborator he didnt know how long he had slept but blessed relief it had been dreamless without nightmares he had rubbed his eyes hard stretched scratched and had started again to search he talked quietly to himself a whisper or a murmur seemed to take the guys in the dalston house as an audience whats strangest is that i cant hear anything from outside this place and i cant see anything inside it i have no light and theres no noise other than my breathing and the chain ive just slept on linoleum with no blanket under or over me where my mum lives if a dog had to sleep on linoleum without bedding then someone sure as hell would be complaining to the animalrights people the routine of the search hadnt changed from before hed slept he did sections of the floor and the walls on his hands and knees on his knees crouched and standing i dont know what im looking for but im going round again until i find it off my trolley right might be and i wont argue with you what sort of clears the mind though is the thought of that knife ears fingers and privates get me makes for good encouragement had to answer that didnt he had to face it couldnt simply squat on his backside and wait for whatever the world threw at him there was a knife on call it was laborious conscientious and repetitive but too right the thought of the knife kept boredom at bay i wouldnt have thought it possible to exist without sound or light it is i have to find something i have to believe theres something to be found it was the last sector of floor and the last area of wall and he had gone over them fingertips and palms five or six times when he had completed the sector he would start again at the beginning where the chain was fastened a success the discovery of the crevice through which the ants went back and forth before hed brushed them clear theyd countered the obstruction of his hand by crawling over it there was dust at the angle where the linoleum met the walls base sometimes he forced it away from the wall at others he didnt sometimes there was compacted dirt at the angle and he would run his fingertip into it excavate it and at others not he had lost track had been round so many times in the search of where he had prised up the flooring and where he had scraped at the mess caught in the join but this time he felt something hard and almost squealed guys its there i have it hard and sharp long and thin buried and wedged he must each time before have thought its slight shape was a flaw in the wall or a bulge in the linoleum it came away it had been deep in the dirt perhaps on the previous searches he had dislodged some of its covering or shifted it fractionally he held a nail and euphoria swept through him it was a strong nail a little bent in the middle but otherwise flawless cant see no eyes have to do it all by touch the nails about four inches long id run my fingers along that place so many times and now its there and i have it not thinking at my best sorry and all that and not being logical its the window the boarding across it which was nailed and the nail heads recessed always isnt there one nail that bends jumps back and falls and who has the patience to get down and find it its no damn use anyway because its bent but its a nail and i have it he would have found one like it in the cardboard boxes his father kept in the shed built as a leanto at the far end of the garage he had nails and screws of every size calibre length and always said they should be kept because it was a certainty of life that if you dont have them all then the one you want will be the one you dont have do any of you guys know what to do with a nail do they hand out nails in that toffs club or at revenue and customs or on a campus for phd students or in the ticket hall of a mainline station i doubt it what im thinking is that a fourinch nail even a bent one is either a multitask tool or a multitask weapon can i have your thoughts guys his mind had begun to race it could be used as a chisel turned into a bar for leverage could be a screwdriver a stabbing knife used against a soft stomach an eye a throat you disappoint me you know that are you still in bed washed and shaved yet in the bathroom queue not gone to work dont know what time it is is it a tool or a weapon youre useless sods they wouldnt have known how could they the value of a nail that was probably rusted certainly blunt and bent halfway up its length he hadnt been so clever either hed found the nail directly under the window hatch which was boarded with heavyduty plywood the nail heads that held it in place immovable were recessed down it was the obvious place to have searched and searched again it was now his most important possession eddie doubted there was anything in the dalston house belonging to any of them that competed with the importance of a single nail and nothing in his parents home prints from numbered editions widescreen tv dvd player jewellery that only came out of the wall safe for special occasions was as important as the nail theyre useless mac couldnt kick their way out of a paper bag tossers mac help me there has to be a use for it do me a favour mac and tell me what i can do with it couldnt see it could only touch it eddie started to think a dog barked at her from its high balcony a maid muffled against the morning cold shuffled past her on flipflops and went to work she would have been somali born and taught already not to stare into the faces of italians a dustcart came round a corner a porter without his tie on his collar unbuttoned stood in front of the lobby of a block and coughed on his first cigarette of the day dawn was a smear far away and grey on the mountains immacolata walked down the street past the longstay parked cars with saharan sand on their bonnets and roofs a few lights were on above her but most of the apartments were still dark it had been easier than she could have believed she hadnt showered and risked the noise of the apartments plumbing but she had washed quietly she had dressed simply trousers and tshirt a hooded sweatshirt of rossis and trainers they took turns to watch over her rossi had been in his room and she had heard his soft snore the older man was in a chair in the living room and had he been awake would have had a clear view of the main doorway in the hall but he had not half dressed orecchia had been sprawled on a settee mouth open eyes closed a mug of coffee stood beside him untouched and a cigarette had burned out in the ashtray the strapping holding the holster in place was across his open shirt and the weapon she recognised the types of pistol on offer and this was a beretta was loaded she had skirted the room slipped behind orecchia and crossed the hall she had slipped back the bolt turned a key gone out closed the door gently she had gone down the main staircase not used the lift and had seen no one half of the residents of the lower floors were still on the dreg days of their summer holiday had she met any she wouldnt have spoken wouldnt have shown them what they would have recognised as a proletariat accent from naples the hill where they had housed her was among the most select neighbourhoods in the capital and there would have been immediate protests at the thought of a collaborator harboured among them she had gone out and the chill had been on her skin she carried her handbag nothing else she went past the clinic past the tennis and swimming club where sprinklers already played on the grass past shops in the piazza where the steel shutters were down and nothing moved except one scurrying cat it was a brisk walk she wouldnt run that would draw attention to her but she needed to be clear of the covo and off the hill before the sun rose over the mountains that formed the spine of italy she stepped out and the pace she took helped to warm her she went down the hill was under the canopy of pine branches then beneath the big highway the via flaminia and walked along the river but hugged the trees and tried to stay in the shadows ahead of her was the piazzale di ponte milvio where the earlymorning buses were parked and a long taxi line where drivers waited for the days first fares she knew where she was going and why and in the square there were shops and bars it was too early for her but if she hadnt gone before dawn before rossis alarm went on his wrist before orecchia shook himself yawned and stirred she wouldnt have been able to slip away sunlight speared her caught her face and her hair fell back as she tossed her head her shoulders were squared and her chin was thrust forward she cared nothing for the chaos she would have created when the alarm sounded and orecchia woke he had gone from the pensione in the halflight the day manager behind the desk had glanced at him with bare recognition then resumed his reading of the newspaper and lukas had dropped the two keys on the counter no smalltalk and nothing serious had been said as if a conversation had not taken place the previous evening in london or in a northern german city or in that engine house of the italian economy milan people would already be on the move office workers shop managers certainly the street cleaners and rubbish collectors not in naples a few moved lost souls there was a girl ahead of him and lukas thought she wore a party frock and that the buttons were not in kilter her hair was a mess and her shoulders hunched she had that look her back did of a girl who wished shed been in her own bed half a dozen hours earlier he followed her playing his mind game making associations for her a life story as he did with the individuals randomly selected who came to the musee d orsay and paused in front of the elephant and the rhinoceros and his mind flitted the daughterinlaw of the artist who did the river in crayon the notre dame and the louvre had she had her baby the waiter in the bar on the bellechasse had the laser for his eyes gone well and monique who came once a month to clean the apartment unnecessary because of the pristine state in which he kept it and wash his clothes and iron them had her cat survived the kidney infection it was indulgent of lukas to allow himself such fancies he saw the sign high on the building at the top of the street he went briskly down the slight hill that was via forcella a church door on his right opened and he saw a young priest but their eyes did not meet the girl was no longer in front of him and the artists grandchild an operation and a cats ailment were ditched from his mind he was focused there had been kids at the top of the street and he had seen them stare at him comatose it was why he had come at that time before the streets awakening he imagined how it had been eddie deacon would have come down the street walked on the hard cobblestones but later in the morning kids would have followed him he wouldnt have known where he was going would have stood out as a stranger he saw the fish stall there was a door the paint flaking off and immediately beyond it a man was laying out plastic trays and polystyrene boxes then shovelling ice from a big rubbish bin there was a van behind him with the rear doors open lukas slowed not difficult to anticipate the sequence the ice went on to the trays and into the boxes the fish were brought from the back of the van and laid out without order and a car hooted for the van to move impatience built a brief argument followed the two drivers all predictable the van driver slammed his rear doors gave a finger to the car driver then pulled away the man on the stall began to place his fish in the correct trays and boxes lukas went forward excuse me it is important for me to meet you youre tomasso when he needed it he had good enough italian a nod of agreement a wild look past lukass shoulders suspicion and anxiety sour if i am please keep working and im examining your fish its natural the swordfish is magnificent wary of an outsider it was caught yesterday brought in today i think it is thirty kilos ill take it tomasso please listen to me i am here now ill leave with the fish i wont be back i have come to you to save a mans life he saw tomasso flinch he had nowhere to go he would have realised that setting out his catch brought from the market and preparing for a days trading was explicable and that an earlybird customer even a stranger was also explicable he couldnt run shout or protest without attracting attention ill have the swordfish but show me the mullet too you tried to help the boy tomasso you reported what youd seen youll never see me again i promise when i go your involvement ceases all i work for is the safety of the boy and his freedom tell me a low voice guttural perhaps coarsened by years of nicotine he saw carmine and anna borelli he was english an outsider i do not know why to find immacolata they call her the whore everybody in via forcella now calls her the whore before they called her signorina immacolata and she could have anything everything i do not know why he came to find her they would kill me its to save his life i too have a family tell me and im gone ill never come back the trays were filled the fish sorted the water spray turned on the scales were set up and the cash tin was opened the man tomasso looked lukas straight in the eye the price for the swordfish is a hundred and fifty euros the boy stayed upstairs in the borelli apartment with the old bitch who is anna carmine came down and sent a message and then he went back i saw him at the window several times i regret sir that i cannot do a better price for the fish it is rare the van arrived and the driver waited and salvatore came here to where you stand salvatore is called il pistole and he is the assassin of the clan borelli do you follow me i do you pay me a hundred and fifty euros for the fish and the old bitch takes fifty euros they screw me in the market and on the stall i apologise for the price i tried to warn the boy with my eyes he did not react quickly you say he came to naples to find immacolata yes he must have believed he was going to her he looked very happy perhaps that is why when i warned him with my eyes he was slow salvatore put him in the vehicle salvatore is the killer has killed more than he has years salvatore took him thank you salvatore would kill me and would kill the person at the pensione would kill anyone it cooks well the fish he looked a nice boy lukas paid him for the fish and it was wrapped in newspaper and plastic blood oozed from where it had been gutted and from the gills the tail stuck out behind lukas the sword in front of him his promise to tomasso a fishseller and frightened with reason to fear was meaningless so the guarantees had been sculpted with care those pledges of anonymity handed out with the carelessness of jelly babies and chewinggum had no value he carried the fish out of the street hoisted on his shoulder and never looked back lukas thought the day had started well rossis alarm woke him he blundered towards the bathroom showered shaved and dressed fast he came into the living room it was a few minutes past seven and the sunlight stormed through the blinds he opened them illuminating orecchia and started to whistle a tune popular in the far south then went to orecchia and slapped his face gently orecchia jerked up and groped for the holster under his arm then saw the grinning rossi rossi went to the kitchen switched on the electric kettle and took a carton of juice from the refrigerator what they had in common the two men from the servizio centrale protezione was a love of tea exported in tins from england they started each day with a mug but rossi also had juice he called from the kitchen with the mockrespect of a courtier and asked if she the important one had yet made an appearance how could orecchia have known hed been asleep he hadnt heard her or been woken by the water system it was agreed that she was not yet up rossi said as the kettle boiled shes usually washed and dressed by now perhaps because he was irritated at having been discovered asleep on his watch orecchia snapped today she isnt today she sleeps i only said it was unusual rossi went down to the groundfloor hall collected the newspaper from the front gate and came back up he heard orecchia in the bathroom poured the tea took him a mug put the rolls into the oven and switched on the television for the breakfast news more killings in iraq a bigger bomb in afghanistan instability in the currency markets defections from the ruling coalition time passed orecchia was dressed and smelled good had used the hugo boss stuff rossi made a show of recognising it and teased his colleague they had worked together many times they had been on a detail that had done a cosa nostra killer and twice had done the escort and security on an ndrangheta bagman they had been with the collaborator from the misso clan in naples and with a triad from the chinese community in genoa they knew each other were regarded by their superiors as of exceptional competence and together they had the thought rossi extraordinary for a man who had been with the guardia di finanza before transferring to the scp could call upon almost poetic imagery he thought of a wave on its way from the horizon not yet seen then closer and noticed for its ripple closer still it seemed to cry that catastrophe approached broke upon them and swallowed them they were choking he was in the spume and under the green darkness of the water orecchia too there were no sounds from behind the door no grumbles from the plumbing it was long past the time she would normally have risen the sense of disaster caught them not a word was exchanged they didnt knock they didnt pause respectfully after calling her name orecchia went in first rossi at his heels perhaps from the door the shape in the bed might have confused them but it was obvious that a pillow substituted for a body rossi heard the sharp intake of orecchias breath they were not recruits they had valued experience they did not scream curse shriek or blaspheme rossi felt a chill settle on the hackles at his neck and shivered orecchia was breathing fast gasping orecchia did the bathroom went inside as if there was no chance of finding her on the toilet they scoured the apartment each room each cupboard each wardrobe rossi knew was thankful for it that orecchia was senior and would have to make the telephone call they went down to the ground floor and checked there then to the subterranean garage which they didnt use and looked there they were supposed to have a roster whereby one slept and the other was alert but both had been asleep in older times in history to be asleep on duty was to invite a meeting with a firing squad today it would be a return to the uniform of the guardia di finanza and they would be checking vat statements in bari or brindisi maybe for orecchia it would be dismissal rossi asked are you satisfied that she is not here yes what has she taken her handbag she has some money has she taken any clothes she has hardly any to take and no case to put them in could she have gone to the piazza to buy bread or a magazine could pigs fly to the moon i think not rossi saw that orecchias mobile was in his hand he was scrolling through the directory he felt aggression towards the girl their signorina immacolata and might have exploded let the fury rip but he turned away and took the deep breaths counselled by the angermanagement people he could see the rooftops then the hills and part of the city the haze and gold light on the mountains where could she be how long had she been gone how far orecchia gave him a wintry smile and pressed the call button she sat on a bench by a bus stop a weed and litterfilled flowerbed behind her the bushes were oleander she knew them from naples their flowers were soft pink and pretty well formed as a child she had walked with her mother in the garden between the sea and the riviera di chiaia and had picked a sprig of those flowers and put it in the top buttonhole of her blouse her mother had seen it snatched it thrown it away and smacked her open hand and hard on her bare thigh above the knee she had said that the flower of the oleander was the most dangerous in the city could cause grave illness even death the sap was a compound of strychnine a poison of the same strength it had been so pretty so delicate nothing was as it seemed and she had learned the lesson the shop she wanted was across the street and she was waiting for the man to come and the shutter to be raised nothing was as it seemed and nobody except eddie deacon those days those nights and that time mario castrolami was not a man of crude temper he took the call he listened in silence he cut the call in his mentality there was a practised survival routine in the event of what many would describe as disaster he began it he lifted down his jacket from the hook shrugged into it he slipped out of the annexe and into a toilet where he dribbled out some urine then he went to the canteen bought coffee and chocolate and took them out past the desk at the front he circled the piazza as he drank the coffee and ate the chocolate the wrapper went into a bin and the plastic cup followed it after the next circuit he did the disaster routine when news came through from the palace at the centro direzionale that the judiciary had thrown out a case that might have taken three years to prepare had involved dedication and massive manhours because of a supposed technicality or because a politician had interfered in the process or a file had walked from a supposedly secure archive others went to bars and drank or dug with manic intensity into new files some went home and took their women to bed or walked by the sea and gazed at the water he plodded round the piazza with coffee and chocolate and pretended that a new day was starting when he eased into his chair judges were not known for patience when a collaborators testimony was withdrawn his friend the artist would have said if asked that he needed a holiday but she would not be asked his wife in milan would have said if asked that there was work in the private sector in that citys banking industry for a man of his experience and that he should take the plane north but she would not be asked there was of course a checklist of actions that followed the disappearance of a collaborator a watch on the railway station in rome on the principal coach station and the airports of fiumicino and ciampino and she might have been gone for two hours or four orecchia a good man had spoken woodenly on the phone and castrolami had put the question how long had she been gone had put another question how long had he slept and the final question how long between the time she was found to be missing and the time of reporting it she might have been he reflected through and out of the airport at the other end of the country holed up in rome might be dead with a bullet in her head he came back into the annexe both the men at the table the psychologist and the collator looked away and the hard men of the ros group shuffled in their seats and made room for him to get past as if a black cloud hung over them the cloud of failure he could give instructions they waited on his leadership he didnt often feel or sense the burden of aloneness but it was his shout his right to activate whatever procedures he thought appropriate there were none she was gone was clear lost castrolami let his head fall into his hands and his elbows on the table took the weight he had hoped for a small victory and had thought it within his grasp and the fate of a young man held somewhere was erased as of no importance he stared at the surface of the table there was silence around him except for the breaking open of the cellophane round a cigarette packet then the click of a lighter and he felt a rare isolated misery then heard rippling laughter first nervous and quiet then growing gaining confidence then playing on the walls and bouncing on the table driving into castrolamis ears he looked up the fish could not be fitted through the door either the tail stuck or the sword did the body with the tail would have been more than a metre long and the sword the same the beast was two metres in total and death had left it rigid it could not be bent or folded it wedged lukas held it castrolami recognised it as pesce spade and knew it as the most expensive fish on any market stall it was the size that would be bought for the celebration of an extended family no one helped lukas he didnt seem to want help he had another go but the sword caught the table and jarred it and the laughter was louder he turned round and led with the tail squeezed and heaved the flank of the beast caught in the lock of the open door and then it was through laughter chorused the success lukas dumped it on the table and the annexe was filled with its smell only castrolami did not laugh lukas said droll if theres a restaurant the guys use maybe theyd do us the favour of cooking it my news is useful i look at you friend and say to myself that yours is between disaster and catastrophe get it over with we have lost the girl he saw the grin wiped off lukass face what did she take her bag money her id she went early and what clothes he used italian now as if the pretended ignorance of the language was no longer important castrolami said he didnt know of any did she take knickers and a spare bra castrolami said he didnt know just an opinion and humbly put i know very little of women enough to fill the back of a postage stamp but i doubt they travel far without nexttotheskin necessities think about it each item youve spoken of however small itll be there usually is i make of course only a suggestion it might be worth thinking about the little things castrolami looked sharply at him wondered if he was mocked realised he wasnt he thought he saw honesty in lukass face he couldnt criticise a man who had confessed to failure with women after all he had no medals in relationships he turned behind him poked a finger at the chest of a man from the ros perhaps his favourite in the unit the guy had unevenly cut hair that fell to his shoulders and his cheeks jaw and upper lip were painted with stubble he told the man to take the fish and its spike to donato at the restaurant on the piazza gesu nuovo book a table for a dozen that evening or whenever cause for rejoicing was justified and ask for the beast to be prepared for cooking the big man heaved it off the table and carried it out but the stink stayed what was your news lukas he was told and instructed the collator on action if any he didnt rate what hed learned against the importance of the girl having gone but he took the suggestion given him and went back outside to pace think and scratch at his memory it had started as a bad day and castrolami thought it had the potential to get worse twin celebrations grew in pitch a senior police officer took a call in his car and was heard by his driver to say theyve lost her tell me again incredible if theyve lost her can they hold the mother the brothers will the case against the borelli clan collapse incredible the driver an elderly policeman with little in his life to create excitement and little to augment his status told a colleague that immacolata borelli was loose on the streets the colleague told a cousin who ran a quality furniture chain the cousin meeting a young man who sought to bring in a comprehensive contract for the refurnishing of an apartment in the bank section of the city repeated the story and the young man was massimo nephew of the flamboyant umberto word rushed along certain selected channels that immacolata borelli had fled protective custody from the lawyers office news of it was inside the gates of poggioreale within an hour and within an hour and a half it would be behind the walls of the posilippo gaol at the far end of the gulf at both prisons the footsoldiers offered congratulations which were received by gabriella borelli and by giovanni and silvio borelli within two hours the message had infiltrated the topsecurity prison on the eastern outskirts of london hmp belmarsh men and women crowded around the mother and her sons it was felt that power had been restored an old order retained davide the agent who was deltafoxtrot saw more movement on the walkway that early morning and recognised the clothing as that worn by a blindfolded man he noted the presence and his memory would be backed by the tapes he did not himself sift and evaluate what he saw it was for his handlers to make definitions of priority salvatore held the torch he alone went into the chamber two men neither known to him held back and guarded the door more were on the walkway he couldnt complain of the number of men allocated but had thought still thought the price to be exacted from carmine borelli was cruel the door was left ajar behind him he was good the boy disciplined he had the hood over his upper face and eyes and seemed grateful when told food had been brought it was fruit some cold pasta coffee in a plastic cup more cheese and water he bent and took the boys ankle in his hands the leg kicked clear but he stayed at the task and checked that the chain did not cut deep he thought it a gesture of kindness he was not familiar with compassion could not have explained why he showed it here now the boy had his head ducked down and did not respond he let his hand brush the boys arm only a slight touch and the boy shrank from him his fist clenched since he had been eleven or twelve people had recoiled from close contact with him other children women old men and men in their prime had backed away his reputation now was that of a killer no conscience no mercy no love salvatore needed that reputation to survive in naples but he did not think it important that a foreigner an outsider a stranger should have that fear of him but he would still of course cut off the boys ear finger or penis there were confusions in the mind of il pistole he did not love and did not attract it the nearest he knew of ecstasy was not in laughter with a friend or in the penetration of a girl it was when he looked deep into the eyes of a man he would kill and saw the spreading terror it was the greatest thrill in salvatores life he didnt know how he would go to his own death but swore to anybody who needed to be told that he would not be taken alive locked away and left to rot in novara ascoli or rebibbia he would not be captured arrested and if there was a hallucinating nightmare in his life it was the moment of failure capture and the parade past the camera flashes and of being merely a number on a landing of a cell block he did not hate the boy what was more difficult for salvatore he wasnt indifferent to him either confusing what is your name my name is eddie what is that eddie its not eduardo its edmondo but im called eddie thats my name the hood masked most of the face but the mouth was good hair grew clumsily around it and the skin was clear salvatore despised men who had acne and pimples the replies were hesitant softspoken he saw that the bucket had not been used and that only part of the food was eaten you have not finished the food no i brought food for you thank you but you do not eat it i apologise that i did not eat the food you very kindly brought me all right i have brought more food and more water thank you was the gratitude sincere always salvatore craved to know what people thought of his character his actions so difficult to know with certainty was he generous was he intelligent was he handsome was he the best company the best in bed the best enforcer in all naples he didnt know who could tell him he had been thanked for the food and had received an apology but he couldnt judge sincerity from a dropped hooded head he had killed men had shot or strangled them because they had not offered him respect you are from london yes what do you do in london i am a teacher a language teacher i speak english very good very good was that respect he had gone into a bar in sanita and a man had spat on the floor just in front of his feet a metre from salvatores shoes that was not respect a man who had known his face and identity had parked a saloon car on a street in the piazza mercato so that fangios scooter was blocked in then had told fangio to go fuck your mother but his eyes had been on salvatore that was not respect in london you met immacolata i did it was bad for you that you did i love immacolata so i came to find her she is dead the boy eddie cringed away from him huddled against the wall his shoulders trembled and his arms shook not yet she will be she is condemned she is living but dead better that you had not met her and loved her when when do you i understand you well tomorrow they have until tomorrow if we do not have heard by tomorrow we send our word is dono you say gift yes or do you say present you ask it is tomorrow i think my english is good eddie who are you it does not matter to you he thought the boy eddie might have cursed and tried to kick him or to plead with him some swore or screamed when he came at them with the knife or the handgun and there were others who wet themselves or soiled their trousers who knelt and clutched his legs begging for their lives and moaning their childrens names the boy had not sworn or begged and he loved immacolata borelli and she had ignored him as scum he kicked the boy did it hard in the shin saw the pain that spiralled up the leg the jerk of the hood and heard the gasp he went out shut the door and bolted it he was escorted away he felt unsettled and the confusion nagged in him he left by the same walkway and saw an old man low in a chair watching the television could see the back of the head clearly because the window was well cleaned when the pain in his leg died and aching took over eddie put the nail to work his fingertips told him that the chains links were slid into a loop at the end of an iron pin concreted into the outer wall he used the point of the nail to drive down two or three millimetres at first into the minute gap between the concrete and the pins flank he couldnt hit the nail with the bucket because the noise would have reverberated but he could use the heel of his trainer for want of a heavyduty claw hammer eddie reckoned hed done well that the day had already given him something positive he tapped with the shoe felt the nail driving down but every few millimetres he would extract it then reinsert it wiggle it and feel the gap the hole widening he thought he had in probability twelve hours before the man came with the knife time to be used he had also learned a little of the routine two men at the door only one entering the cell knew it was two because one had coughed and the other had lit a cigarette and he had been able to separate the sounds he would not go quietly denied the use of his eyes left with the power of his ears eddie reckoned the man had lost certainty reckoned also that the loss had taken him on to unfamiliar ground downside he didnt know what was beyond the inner door didnt know what weapons the two men carried didnt know whether at the key critical moment he would be able to use the nail to stab didnt know whether he was capable of it hed have to learn the answer to that it would have been so easy to roll over on his side lie limp and wallow give free rein to the selfpity and the unfairness maybe theyd use alcohol on his skin before they made the cut maybe theyd gag him or stick a wad in his mouth for him to bite on but that wasnt an option the concrete round the pin was of poor quality it cracked easily and little pieces crumbled then using the nail as a lever he could work the gap wider he thought it had been an hour but it might have been two before he could use his full strength tug on the pin and feel it rock but it wasnt yet loose would be soon carmine was under surveillance anna was not i promise you that the contract will be honoured payments will be to the accounts you have nominated nothing is different carmine with his escort he had lifelong experience in recognising when he was tracked went to a cafe in the square opposite the old entrance to the castel capuana where he had done his first sentence of penal servitude a halfcentury before he took coffee and with old friends played a game twentyones with cards and looked for the watchers he had pleasure in identifying six and two cars anna with no tail talked business for how long will i be making decisions that affect our contract as long as is necessary depend on it i have the authority to speak for my family for my daughterinlaw for my son and you have my hand anna borelli who was less than metres in height and less than fortyfive kilos in weight peered across a table at a venezuelan an ecuadorian and an irishman who together made up the cartel that would oversee the shipment from the colombian port of cartagena via west africa and transhipment at dakar into the port of naples of a tonne of cocaine and she could haggle you have my guarantee and i tell you that predictions of the collapse of my family are exaggerated lies spread by envious rivals you are wise to trust me in front of her was an old calculator she had not used for more than twenty years her first stop that morning had been at a corner shop for batteries what concerned her was the drop in the street price of cocaine and she showed keen determination not to commit herself to an excessive front price when the market rate had deteriorated through saturation a bony forefinger alternately rapped rhythms on the table and pointed at the men for emphasis when her small hand was wrapped successively in the fists of the two south americans and the irishman they would each feel the strength of her claw grip its a pleasure to do business with gentlemen she said behind her the clans treasurer beamed she was asked then natural and inevitable for news of her daughterinlaw gabriella i expect her home very soon and my grandsons we had a sweet granddaughter wonderful as a child but now suffering a mental collapse a fugitive from those who tricked and deceived her its cruel what they will do to turn the head of a naive and simple young person its a good deal please dont forget that my hand is my bond she stood tiny they towered over her she revelled in the deference offered her she would have stood in line to slit the throat of immacolata naive and simple who had been tricked and deceived and would happily have used a blunt knife she walked out of the shop the sun beat down on her and the earlymorning traffic built its fumes were in her nose horn blasts in her ears as she carried the bag they had given her she knew the stories of betrayal in her home city she had learned them at school betrayal was in the culture of naples bedded in its stonework one story she had always enjoyed was that of belisarius the sixth century after the birth of christ had been immacolatas teacher had declared a time of catastrophe the city had fallen to odoacre king of the ostrogoths roman rule had disintegrated the network of lucrative trading routes had collapsed malaria was rampant a dark age had begun it was a story that still lived with her carried forward from the classroom but in the year of our lord deliverance advanced the byzantine emperor justinian sent his finest general belisarius to win back the city he came to naples saw the height and strength of the city walls and despaired of capturing and sacking it then he found a traitor immacolata could remember the hush of the children the suckedin breath of those around her and the teacher spoke of an infame a collaborator a pentito and the traitor guided the general to a broken disused aqueduct that had carried water to the city in the great days of the empire led by the traitor the soldiers of belisarius entered the city through the forgotten tunnel moved in silence in the quiet of the night and sacked the city butchering the ostrogoths no child in immacolatas class had raised a squeal of indignation against the act of treachery it was the neapolitan way she walked towards the river around the table in the annexe there had been no criticism of castrolamis long absence from his chair reports were brought to the collator who beavered at them opened computer crossfiles pushed paper at the others the psychologist drew a word profile of salvatore enforcer to the borelli clan and painted a psychopaths portrait lukas put bricks in place built contact he murmured never allowing his voice to intrude to both men the hopes he harboured for the hostages behaviour how eddie deacon should be should be combating the sense of disbelief that this is actually happening and to me confronting fear and holding on however grimly to a sense of control he should establish a routine for himself and learn the routine of his captors regrets and sentimentality should be ruled out unacceptable talk with his guards should be kept to a minimum and attempts to ingratiate himself with them would usually be doomed they dont like a crawler or a whiner lukas had said or a guy who hit back and antagonised hes best staying quiet and should never complain he should not be uncooperative or shorttempered and should not compromise his integrity always he should be remote from the cause of the hostagetaker when a phone rang or more paper was brought lukas would back off and escape the psychologist had asked does he work towards an escape attempt should he shouldnt he the collator demanded and the men behind the storm squad murmured support for an answer an opinion lukas said eddie deacons a nice guy a secondrate guy a teacher hes in a bunker a cell probably in darkness likely hooded assuming he breaks clear of restraints chains gets through a door a trap he will have no knowledge of whats beyond again assuming he gets out of the building he doesnt know where he is on hostile ground who will help him escape is the measure of desperation at a last resort almost inevitably it will fail you paint a black picture the psychologist said his situation is black he depends on us the collator said a failed attempt arouses a reaction of extreme brutality he heard footsteps stamping along a corridor then across the operations room usually then they kill lukas saw castrolamis entry he questioned with his eyes spoke the name of the girl and the collator as if it was his personal cross to bear shook his head castrolami lifted a phone dialled lukas heard him tell a minder in rome that he had walked twentyfour times round the piazza dante and had thought then he told the minder where to find immacolata borelli bit his lip and rang off the breath sang through his teeth like dice rolled but not yet settled gerald seymour the collaborator he had crossed the space the chain dragging behind him he was against the door standing and when he pressed an ear to the crack below the upper hinge he could make out very faint voices and music he couldnt understand what was said or by whom or distinguish what music was played once the pin had come clear of the wall and the chain was free eddie had not stopped to consider step by step his actions he had gripped the nail tighter in his fist and had crawled across the space groping in the darkness until he reached the door he had moved his fingers up the smooth metal sheeting nailed to the wood then listened he would have worried if the sounds had been more distinct he didnt think he would be heard a glass is half full the nail would enable him to break out flee for freedom a glass is half empty he would fail be mutilated butchered buried in secrecy and some day some time someone would find this place and read his name he scratched with the nail tip in the blackness and trusted that he had fashioned the capital characters eddie didnt do a message or an epistle didnt do an approximation of a date didnt make a heart and arrow and gouge immacolata just did his name and thought that if some time it was read and files were turned up it might just be that the bastard who had him there would face some sort of retribution he didnt believe that to have done his name with the nail was the same as admitting defeat accepting ultimate failure he didnt know whether it could be deciphered eddie began to work on the lower hinge sank down to his knees he knew what he had to do his dad back in wiltshire had given over the inside end of the garage to shelves and boxes neat as a hardwareshop display he had about every tool a man could ever want and plenty more his mum shrugged about it and eddie had sort of sneered but his dad had the tools to get the hinge off in about two minutes flat now eddie didnt sneer he used the nail first off to try to open a fraction of a gap between the hinge and the metal sheet and didnt like to think again about a glass being half empty and didnt like to think about whether his name could be read or was just the scratching of an imbecile minutiae dominated eddie deacons existence top of the list was the depth that the nail tip could go down behind the hinge bar starting at two millimetres estimate and needing to open right out so that it could go down more than ten and likely twenty then there were the screws to be loosened and he had no screwdriver any time before he had been lucky and had caught that flight lucky again and had caught the train from rome eddie deacon would have said fuck it or no can do and walked away from the problem would have said before that eddie deacon did not take off hinges the lower one first without the necessary tools he would have said that it was impossible to dislodge two old hinges both held in with likely rusted screws without a cordless or powered drill and he had only a single nail that was slightly bent halfway up he did not acknowledge impossible through the focus came small solutions he had the pin extracted from the wall as a lightweight hammer he had a handkerchief in his pocket dirty and disgusting and could fold the corner and use it as a wad across the nail head to dull the hammer sound he had the bucket and he had the thought of the knife he could feel on his head on his hands and in his privates what the knife would cut he had no way of judging time eddie hit the nail three or four times then stopped listened let the quiet cling round him and the darkness then repeated listened again and had the nail behind the hinge bar by his estimate five millimetres double that insertion then utilise the bucket and he reckoned he made progress did well and voices louder music as if an internal door were opened he scurried hands and knees again back towards the far wall used his fingers to find the hole where the pin had been jammed it home stuffed the handkerchief back into his pocket put the nail into his right trainer against his instep he had his back against the wall had found the hood and slipped it on and his knees were drawn up his head dropped and resting on them he waited seemed a damned eternity couldnt be certain but eddie thought that men had come close to the door and had started a bloody conversation he resented that was pissed off that hed heard them had backed away from his work and now sat idle wasting time and the bolt opened which told him because now he listened hard for everything that it was lightweight and a key turned a heavy key the door was opened through the hood he realised a torch powered against his body the voice was the same as before the bastards voice you did not eat why did you not eat didnt eat because hed been too busy got that bastard i wasnt hungry if i bring you food you should eat it i wasnt hungry did you drink hed needed the water hot work dragging out a pin in the stifling space with flaked concrete making a dustcake in his throat and heavy work trying to ram a nail tip behind a hinge bar thank you yes you have used the bucket i have the minimum there is no paper and if i use the bucket and have no paper i will stink worse than i do already thank you i bring you food eddie and water and i change your bucket am i kind eddie or not kind thank you i leave food for you and water and a new bucket thank you i hope eddie that we hear something today of immacolata we give them until tomorrow for you i hope we hear today he heard the food in a bag dropped a water bottle plastic roll and the clatter of a new galvanised bucket thank you for the food and water and the bucket then wistful softer i think she is very beautiful immacolata eddie anticipated he was kicked he used his legs to protect his stomach and groin and his arms were over his hooded head not a single kick but a flurry of them eddie understood it he understood that the bastard regarded him as a rival not just as a bargaining chip but as a rival for immacolata borellis affection could have laughed while the kicks came maybe she hadnt done it with him the bastard maybe shed turned him down he heard the bucket the one hed used knocked over the kicking stopped he heard the rhythm of it door opened voices door closed faint voices door locked and door bolted silence only his groans she had been his not the bastards he saw her face then crawled awkwardly through the mess from the upturned bucket which wet his hands and knees he saw her face clearly and began again to work with the nail the river level was down the tibers flow was erratic and followed channels between sandbanks she was on the bridge she lifted the lock from the bag it had plastic wrapping round it and she used her teeth to break it open there was another couple on the bridge their arms locked and the girl was kissing the man immacolata pulled the padlock clear of the packaging and the keys fell to the paving she bent to retrieve them there was immediately below her a current moving in the water a free flow between two banks the river had been low long enough for scrub to have taken hold on the banks great dead boughs and trunks were scattered in it old trees that had been swept downstream by the early springs flood rip all she knew of the bridge was what castrolami had told her not the crap about its history but about the lamppost that had threatened to collapse and the replacement of low metal posts with a chain running between them that the city mayor had ordered to be erected the padlock she had bought was heavyduty would have been a struggle to break through even with large boltcutters it had two good keys that shone in the morning sunshine the man in the hardware shop had wanted to sell her a padlock with combination numbers she had refused and he had persisted until she had flared at him that it was not his business what sort of padlock she purchased then he had understood and the smile had crossed his face a patronising tolerance of the young and he had offered her a cheap shiny model made in china the implication was that a good padlock would be wasted when fastened to the column castrolami had said that young people in love came to the bridge with padlocks like the couple who stood along the rail from her and kissed she had told the shopkeeper she wanted the best and that she was prepared to pay thirtyfive euros for a lock with keys only when she had paid did he tell her slyly that it was possible to buy the padlocks from an albanian trader on the bridge but not of quality she could see the one the couple had together they hooked it on to the chain and she thought it would have cost ten euros at most for them it was a joke a diversion and a chance to kiss again there was a long line of padlocks on that section of chain enough to make it sag names had been written in indelible ink on some immacolata did not have a pen with indelible ink if she had she would not have used it she threw the packaging over the bridges stone rail watched it flutter down fall into the flow and float away like a boat the couple had broken in their embrace and now eyed her with hostility she gave them the look of contempt of a daughter of the borelli clan and must have intimidated them because they hurried on with their business on the bridge she might perhaps in that gesture of throwing away the plastic and cardboard have unsettled them they would have seen her face her chin and eyes and been nervous of intervening to chastise her their moment of declared love had maybe been lessened by their fear of her she watched them go south and towards the road sign for the lungotevere they didnt turn kept their backs to her and held close to each other immacolata thought that placing the padlock on the chain on the bridge was about as relevant as laying fresh bouquets beside a road where there had been a fatality in a traffic accident irrelevant but she thought it worthwhile she wondered then if he saw her pictured her she had the image of him grubby jeans socks that usually had a hole at the heel or the toe yesterdays shirt his hair unbrushed the smile and the laughter that walked with him the flatness of his stomach the delicacy of his fingers the thin thighs and she seemed inside herself to arch and press and be closer so that he went deeper she remembered eddie she knew what they would do to him she was of the borelli family and she knew how pain and fear were used as regular weapons of choice she did not have him there to kiss she kissed the padlock face it was cold remote she let her lips linger on it the chain was rusted lower than the rail and festooned with the padlocks of lovers she hesitated she heard a little squeal of mirth mocking and the albanian who sold the padlocks on the bridge was staring at her and would have been wondering why she had come alone and why she paused could she not make up her fucking mind he might have thought that the water was dull dirty and wound between the banks there was nothing attractive about the view upstream nothing of majesty she made her commitment immacolata took three steps four to the chain then looked for a section that was not already crowded and found one she didnt kneel because that would have been an act of sentimentality she crouched used a key to open the padlock then secured it to a link in the chain and snapped it shut it hung there and for a moment the sun was on it she stepped back held the keys between her fingers and remembered what castrolami had told her and what she had seen the lovers do hurriedly after they had scowled at her for letting the packaging drop they would have taken longer over it but she had destroyed their moment not important to her the sun was over the next bridge still low enough to dazzle her it was indeed her commitment there were three keys on the ring little bright trinkets of her mood not diamonds not jewels not flowers but three keys from a chinese factory she raised her arm saw his face threw them watched them fall irretrievable saw the splash and the fastforming ripples then only the swirl of the current the old mendicante was right im surprised rossi said the old beggars usually right orecchia said is she going to jump in after them i dont think so do we go for her now orecchia said as we would for a mourner beside a family grave half a minute for contemplation then we go they had been there a quarter of an hour they had been sitting on a low railing in the shade of the trees with the scent of the markets fruit stalls behind them and they had waited to see if castrolamis judgement was sure or whether it leaked they had seen her come with that haughty stride as if she was of gods chosen few on to the bridge as castrolami had said she would and each man had let out an involuntary sigh of relief would we have been fired probably returned to unit probably on a trash heap i think he told very few its contained would you do that buy a padlock waste it throw away the key i know too little about romance a faint grin broke on orecchias face come on they stood how do we treat her like an old friend how else orecchia led they skipped through the traffic crossed the far pavement and walked out on to the bridge rossi asked do we go gently or kick hell out of her orecchia answered side of his mouth i lead alessandro an uncomplicated life i have a wife who tolerates me a kid who accepts my usefulness to him as a milchcow i have a cat who ignores me but doesnt scratch i have an apartment i can afford i have a cheque in the bank on the first day of each month and an attractive pension fund i dont live with a perpetual crisis at my shoulder they do the collaborators she does i would say alessandro that betrayal brings a heavy burden it would be attractive to kick her for what she has done to us today but our anxieties are small in comparison with her agony sensitively put it does you credit rossi grinned wryly but has she capitulated is that what this crap the padlock and the key is about i think not orecchia said she looked proud the older of the two thought and seemed in no hurry to leave the bridge she would have seen them coming from the edge of her vision but made no move orecchia had seen the flash of light on the keys but not where they went into the water almost magnificent better than proud he thought as she stared up the river beside him rossi was alert on the balls of his feet ready for pursuit orecchia was beside her close but not intruding on her mood he said i think signorina that it is time for us to go back up the hill and continue with our work are you ready or would you like a few moments longer she shook her head youre ready she nodded he was at her shoulder as they came off the bridge rossi behind them they walked briskly at his pace and she matched it she told him shed paid thirtyfive euros for the padlock and seemed to expect a comment orecchia quoted a frequent remark of his child usually offered when the father attempted to limit expenditure i think in this world signorina you get what you pay for i imagine that for thirtyfive euros you have a very fine padlock he wondered if she would be weeping eyes glistening but she was not fangio drove him salvatore was pillion the clan that had offered help to carmine borelli had asked for a great deal in return narcotics an investment portfolio and salvatores services it might have been that there was a genuine requirement for a strangers face among the towers of scampia or a need to demonstrate power and humiliate the old man from forcella he had been given a photograph of a face and a map that showed a wide street and a cutthrough leading off it then a bar was marked built into the ground floor of a fifteenstorey block rare for fangio the most skilled scooter driver salvatore knew to demonstrate apprehension on the pillion knees clamped on the padding and one hand in the deep pocket of his leather jacket salvatore sensed the older mans nerves he salvatore would never grow old his friend fangio had a less fatalistic mentality and did not look to die that morning it was not their territory and others back at the sail building played with them fangio had studied the map drawn for them memorised it did not need directions from salvatore in silence of course they rode on the highperformance scooter couldnt have spoken through the visored helmets salvatore leaned with the cant of the machine as they came off the via arcangelo ghisleri and the alley was ahead they were seen watchers tracked them in unison salvatore and fangio lifted their smoked visors without showing their faces they would not have reached the far end of the narrow cutthrough little enough space but fangio had to weave between heaps of rubbish bags most broken open with refuse spilling out once he swerved hard and missed by a tails length a large scurrying grey rat they went into an enclosed piazza and the bar was under the end of the block it seemed squashed under the weight of stained concrete above and weeds sprouted outside when salvatore swung his leg off the pillion he walked on a carpet of discarded cigarette tips the doors were open they had little paint and the glass was cracked it was dark inside except for the glimmer thrown by candles on the carvedwood madonna he saw three men sitting at a flimsy table formica top on steel tube legs there were empty cups in front of them and they played cards the one who faced salvatore most directly wore a shortsleeved green shirt was bald and had a goateestyle beard it was the description he had been given at the sail he realised then the extent of the pain in his leg as he limped to the door why did his foot hurt how had he injured it a kick repeated kicks the big toe of his right foot had been the strikepoint when he had kicked the boy the boy had loved immacolata maybe immacolata had loved the boy twice he had thudded his foot against the pelvic bone which was hard reinforced immacolata had not loved salvatore had seemed not to notice him as if he was merely a paid servant of the clan so he limped into the bar and felt a fucking idiot because he couldnt walk casually as if he was in control he took the pistol from his pocket around him chairs scraped and table legs screeched as they were pushed back the television in the corner seemed louder and dinned into his ears he fired always two shots and for the head salvatore didnt know the name of the man who pitched forward whose head fell without the protection of his arms on to the table surface blood spilled the cups jumped the ashtray flew sideways and emptied and the cards scattered he didnt know the mans name or why he had been killed what hadnt he done he turned he saw fangio astride the scooter gunning the engine he had lowered his helmets visor a bottle was thrown at him sprite fanta or coke it came from behind the bar and he saw it in flight then the figure ducked he was hit full in the face and the bottle broke his helmet or his nose he couldnt see and felt the moisture a hand clawed at him another he fired once more into the ceiling he was freed couldnt run so he limped out fangio snatched at him pulled him clumsily on to the pillion and was gone and salvatore realised then that what he had not done was lower his visor as he had gone into the bar he wiped a sleeve across the bridge of his nose and there was blood on the leather they went back up the alley and now he had the visor down he had shown the world his face blood was in his nostrils already caking and when he snorted to clear it there was a spray on the visors screen fangio drove him away it was the clumsiest killing salvatore had done without finesse and the first in which he had not known a mans name or what he was accused of because he had kicked the boy because he had limped it was the worst of his killings the bucket was crucial to eddie the nail eased the hinge bar a few more millimetres from the steel surface of the door at last enough for the rim of the bucket there was insufficient leverage from the nail for the heavy effort of shifting the screws the bucket did the job the first hinge the lower one was loosened one more heave the big effort all the muscles in use and it would come apart eddie didnt finish it off he didnt know when the bastard would come back couldnt take off one hinge then start to free the other he had to do the breakout when both hinges were ready a few moments of heaving to come away when he had used the galvanisedsteel bucket which stank the noise of the screws moving the scraping against the steel and the splintering of the wood had seemed to shriek in the black space but no one had come he had heard nothing not even the faint voices and the murmur of music one last time he had the bucket rim behind the hinge bar and dragged it back the sound screaming at him the sweat ran on his shirt and his knees were still damp from crawling in the urine but he felt a glow of triumph the kicking hadnt hurt couldnt compete with the elation he was eddie deacon steady eddie many said that nothing flapped or fazed him he didnt do football and hadnt the tribal loyalties of those who howled and yelled when a goal went in or didnt a woman from algeria in a class taken by eddie deacon had gone into labour and he had cleared the room except for a woman who could help then called the ambulance and had taken his coffee in the staff room as if it wasnt a big event there had been a didnt matter what else there had been because everything in eddies old life had been to the shredder he clenched his fist didnt punch in the air but allowed it to shake as if that was good enough nobody would have recognised him now all who had been in his life would have recoiled at the sight and smell of him wouldnt have understood the ecstasy of moving a hinge bar with the rim of a galvanised bucket he started again he was up on his toes to give himself the fraction of height that helped and had the nail tip on the angle where the upper hinges bar was flush against the steel plate had the filthy handkerchief folded as a cushion on the nail head he beat down on it with the pin from the chain there was a little give and he thought the nail tip was down by a millimetre or two but it might have been wishful thinking or even bloody fantasy nothing before in his life that was measured in a couple of millimetres had been important to eddie deacon it was late morning in the annexe off the operations room the ros men were back on their chairs legs splayed out in front of them and a couple snored quietly one used a multipleblade knife to clean the dirt from beneath his fingernails and another read a magazine called fur feather and fin seeming interested in waterproof socks a fifth chewed gum and had a list in front of him of what was included in a personal survival kit available in a mailorder offer he elbowed pietro distracting him from the socks and told him that this psk had two nonlubricated condoms for watercarrying he was luigi the collator often worked alongside the ros men they seemed good at taking rest where it was offered on a hardbacked chair a floor or in a car in fact they seemed to rest more than anything else and had the weird magazines everything about the kit they wore and how to improve it but the collator knew that when the location surfaced they would be running awake and alert pietro did not speak to him neither did luigi he was not regarded as having a useful opinion on condom watercarriers or waterresistant socks it was nothing personal the psychiatrist was similarly ignored both men would have agreed that they found the personnel of the storm team extraordinary could face amazing crises could hibernate mentally in lists and could be mawkishly sentimental coldblooded or uncaring and juvenile in their humour both men had a deep sincere respect for them castrolami was not in the annexe but was on the end of a mobile signal the man lukas was with him they talked a question and an answer a pause for maybe five minutes then some more talk it took time to get round to the psychiatrists big question this american whatever he is is he good is he the best is he a man who talks well does he deliver then the collators big answer he has the pedigree of a prizewinning mastiff can he deliver tell me the circumstances some would say its an insult to our professionalism that hes here some also would say his presence was not asked for if he succeeds and delivers the english boy our reputations are denigrated the collator grinned flashed his teeth showed mischief have faith in our city naples doesnt bow the knee to foreigners the ros man interrupted their murmurs hit pietro again with his elbow and told him that this personal survival kit topoftherange in america had a brass snare wire a length of fishingline six hooks with four weights and a leader trace with an integrated swivel both men as if at a signal laughed were close to collapse and held each other they wondered whether the psk was designed for the third world of secondigliano or the via baku of scampia and whether two condoms would be enough the collator and the psychologist returned to their screens a phone rang the collator answered listened put down the receiver they have the borelli girl whats she going to do stay or quit do we have her or not castrolami was told he showed no enthusiasm no excitement do you believe her lukas hovered he didnt crowd castrolami castrolami took a big breath as if that was necessary when a decision of importance was taken and let the air whistle out again between his teeth he said bring her down to us shes not hidden now if she runs on these streets shes committing suicide that will end the shit bring her they walked things you have to understand lukas what things a square stretched out in front of them with big churches on two of the four sides on a third there was a view of the seas horizon they were near to a fountain with statues at the four corners no water flowed and the basins where the water might have been were filled with cardboard plastic and other junk the statues were of crouched lions but each had been decapitated and the centre of the square was populated with kids bikes plastic tractors and tricycles and plastic garden furniture it should be a fine place lukas thought in paris it would have been a fine place castrolami told him it was the old mercato do i get a lecture in history lukas asked quietly and the smile flickered it was the last year of the eighteenth century the english navy restored a bourbon tyrant to the throne the piazza dei mercato was the execution site it was where those who had sided erroneously with the napoleonic revolutionaries were brought for hanging many thousands died here over several months kicking the air to the drunken jeers of the lazzaroni the street thugs one hangman was a dwarf and it pleased the crowd when he climbed like a monkey on to the shoulders of the condemned putting more weight on the strangulation women were hanged here and abused it was a true terror it satisfied the mob it was their narcotic it has not died in naples on the streets they like a good killing and a display of horror nothing has changed lukas if we deny them the ears fingers or penis of the boy coming through the post or handdelivered they will be angry certainly they will not help us it is a lesson of naples i learned many years ago and learned well the mob enjoys death lukas looked around him it was a place of decay he did not like to imagine but he felt the presence of the baying drunken crowd a lynch mob and saw a gallows of rough wood and used wellstretched ropes the sun blistered his forehead and he had to squint there seemed no takers for the toys and the plastic furniture his gaze had gone beyond the church in front of him and past the broken statues he saw the mountain huge grand and hazed cloud sat on it a white cushion castrolami said in the rest of italy there is no love for this city it does not concern the citizens because they have each others love you know narcissus of course you do he could be the patron saint of naples the society is fashioned by the mountain the mountain dominates tomorrow it may blow or next week or next year the mountain creates fatalism if it blows it will be fast and there will be no escape perhaps half a million people will die most sitting in their cars and hooting in a traffic jam as the ash comes down there is resignation and acceptance of death they used to be in this square to watch the death dance at the hangings today they gather crowded close and pressing forward to see the spasms of a man bleeding on the pavement after being shot i hate this city my home and i hate its absence of morality its acceptance of corruption its compromising of honesty they are total in the city i have to tell you lukas that immacolata borelli swears she will testify she will not back down then find him find him quick before the bits are sent to you lukas said they turned their backs on the piazza and the mountain he had already bought the shirt inexpensive and manufactured in china wrapped in cellophane when he met his handler it was one of davides routines that he bought a cheap shirt when he took the bus down the hill to the old town then he had something to bring back to the sail and talk about if anyone wanted to know why he went so far that day he didnt know the name of his handler there were men and women and some he thought were senior and others little more than clerks neither did he know from what building in the city they worked he had that day requested an extraordinary meeting and broken the schedule a man in a hood handcuffed had been hustled along a walkway there was a view fleeting of the capo of the clan that had control of the sail and half of the rest of scampia who with his family was a billionaire in euros and had been a fugitive for twelve years there had now been four sightings of a man who was a stranger on that floor not seen before escorted an old man unable to disguise arthritis or rheumatism had been brought past the agents apartment window he told it all he was not expected to interpret or analyse he said that the activity was of greater intensity than he could remember and he thought the presence of the outsiders and the hooded man of sufficient interest to be reported he passed to the handler two small cassettes he was given two replacement spools he received no encouragement no praise neither was he criticised for requesting the extra rendezvous he left the handler at the table also routine he knew that when he had gone the handler would leave using his pass which showed him as disabled he took a bus to the railway station then another back up the long hill it would drop him with the rest of the flotsam and the addicts who came each day to buy in scampia near his block he had seen the shape of the hips known it was a young man but his handler had shown no humanity was unconcerned perhaps he had cared more for the cake on his plate umberto the lawyer used his open hands to demonstrate helplessness i dont seek to be an intermediary what am i to do a note is left at my office and an answer demanded i do my best and attempt to save the life of an unfortunate the prosecutor had the note in front of him they were in the same room as they had met in before and again no dignity was offered to the clans advocate he considered his answer he had learned much that morning castrolami had come to him and brought news that immacolata borelli was back with her minders that operation partenope proceeded and her support was guaranteed excellent news less excellent in fact dismal a further communication via the lumaca the lawyer he regarded as a slug crawling in slime and an ultimatum that had hardened time was running fast fine sand between fingers with castrolami there had been a short slight man who looked unfed and carried no spare weight whose clothes were clean but unironed and who had pepperspeckled hair that was cut short as if by using scissors harshly the need for brushing was removed he wore a shortsleeved checked sports shirt not the collar and tie that the prosecutor and castrolami habitually put on the man had on jeans not suit trousers trainers not polished leather shoes his accent was a little american had something of french intimations of english the language he used the expression on his face was of humility the prosecutor would likely have dismissed him as an indulgence that wasted precious time but for two factors mario castrolami had brought him and would not have done so lightly and the man had eyes that pierced in which a light burned and demanded attention he used only one name lukas the prosecutor formulating his answer recalled what he had been told by the soft voice with many accents the man lukas had said they were now in the standoff time that they needed to get to the next stage the negotiation phase and there followed only termination right now with a tenuous line of communication open they should be stalling playing the game towards deadline extension he should not be negative should not refuse but should delay while always reassuring that a solution of mutual benefit could be found and when nothing is negotiable the man lukas had said with simplicity and candour you swallow the truth and lie it stuck like a mullets bone in the prosecutors throat he had been told how he should begin the dialogue and wanted almost to throw up he smiled sickly what you must remember all the time umberto is that i want to help nothing was negotiable immacolata borelli would testify she would denounce her mother and brothers her evidence would send her blood relatives to harsh gaols for the greater part of their lives there was no slack no elasticity in the rope he now played out he had in his desk drawer a photograph of the boy a decent photograph one that had been used for a passport it was a photograph of an ordinary boy and nothing was negotiable the boys freedom could not be bought it would be duplicity that saved the boy not honesty which did not sit easily with the prosecutor he had talked of it that morning with his wife who had remarked predictably his parents how awful for them the parents of course were another burden for shouldering often when faced with the gravest problems he would talk to his wife and listen to her then decide on the course to be followed he would go to his office in the palace tower and listen to none of his closest aides his wife had said but you cannot buy dear one the life of the boy he valued what she told him and could be strengthened by her opinion what would change when he was gone retired what would be different on the streets of naples when castrolami was gone and all the men and women who worked in that trusted loop round him would anything have altered was a great victory possible before the day that he his wife and child turned their back on the place he smiled again looked across the table at the lawyer and felt the purity of hatred i need you to know umberto that i want to help resolve this matter in any way i can my help is on the table she didnt talk about her mother the taperecorder was not produced she didnt speak of vincenzo in the british prison belmarsh or of giovanni and silvio in the poggioreale gaol she made no more accusations against her father locked in a solitary cell of the maximumsecurity block in novara her plastic bag was filled she had cooked an omelette with cheese and diced ham had mixed a dressing and tossed a salad and had about emptied the refrigerator of bread and fruit she had drunk a glass of water from the tap as they had and she had cleared the table they had offered to help and been curtly refused immacolata washed up the plates and bowls and the frying pan the knives and forks they were behind her still at the table she could have asked if there was news of eddie deacon she did not they hadnt spoken of anything significant major or minor of the purchase of the padlock and it being left to rust on a chain on the ponte milvio a place of history she used scalding water and no plastic gloves the pain flushed her skin and she didnt know whether they approved of what she was doing or thought her a cold heartless treacherous bitch knives and forks clattered on to the drainingboard immacolata had not asked for information on what was being done to save eddie deacons life she knew she wouldnt be answered they would have shrugged pleaded their junior rank and she would have demeaned herself the salad bowl and the frying pan dripped on the drainingboard and she attacked the plates her problem why she washed up and would then mop the floors and wipe the surfaces chewed inside her a junction reached two turnings for choice to take one betrayed the death agonies of marianna rossetti to take the other condemned eddie deacon there was no middle road a plate broke maybe it had already been cracked or she had put it down too forcefully on the drainingboard without thinking she collected the pieces laid them out and looked to see if the damage could be repaired only for a moment she picked the pieces up marched across the floor to the bin dumped them and let the lid slam she was finishing orecchia came from the table gestured that he would help to dry up but she waved him away she wondered briefly who would be here next a pentito from the camorra from the far south or sicily she had thought once that the hill with its views its fences its guard dogs and its money could be a home she would never come back here she saw a future of cars with privacy windows false identities and apartments that displayed nothing personal no friends she supposed one day they would give her a number to ring if she had difficulties she would not after a few more days or weeks see orecchia or rossi again there would be no friends she would not love it hurt too much to think of eddie deacon she cleared the drainingboard made the correct piles on the shelves and wondered if for a department of the ministry that dealt with housing collaborators she should write a confessional note reporting the broken plate then she went to the cupboard and brought out the mop all the rooms would be cleaned orecchia and rossi would understand that she needed to purge the place of her presence she was a memory that would be erased as if she had never been there but she would have left something she bit her lower lip hard felt no pain but the warmth of blood without what she left immacolata would be a changed person she would not know how again to love the prosecutors car had brought him to the city hall he did not see the mayor or any elected politician but an official in the interior section of the citys bureaucracy we believe the successful prosecution of the entire borelli family is a matter of great importance to the administration of naples in his own world at the palace of justice the prosecutor was a king an emperor and had almost the authority of a bourbon we are concerned that the image of the city is fractured that national leaders from the north regard us as a nest of anarchy and criminality and that the city is ungovernable he was not in his own world power absolute resided in this building and when he was summoned the prosecutor came without a mark of success we face the very grave dangers of attacks on the citys budget as supplied by central government it would be reflected in police and carabinieri budgets there is the expression throwing good money after bad and it is used frequently in reference to our society we have to succeed the election also looms a small mountain of paper was on his desk with foothills of files on the carpet around it but in acknowledgement of that power he must show dutiful attention there can be no question of a bargain being done we deal dottore with justice and we are not in a souk justice comes first always the case against the borelli family will be prosecuted with full rigour the mayor or a principal in his administration wishes very soon to give a media conference at which the ironfisted determination of the city hall will be shown as resolute against organised criminality the prosecutor nodded seemed to show what was required of him respect if the young man dies and no negotiation will be deployed it is believed that such a tragedy can be turned to advantage as a clear indication of the barbarity of the clans their ruthlessness if we demand there is no weakening he was dismissed he had stood throughout and had not been given coffee what angered the prosecutor most he had been dragged across the city brought here lectured and he agreed with each sentiment voiced nothing was negotiable he left through the ornate double doors he wondered how high a level of deceit was required to save the boy and whether the man lukas who had been in his office was capable of lying to that level a priest said in brisk italian yes he came here he came to my church of san giorgio maggiore im told he waited a long time for me before he had been the length of via forcella and back and had asked where he could find immacolata borelli her last home was with her grandparents he was a stranger and no one would tell him if a stranger asks for the directions to the home of an old clan leader and his wife no one will tell him except me i told him i realise now that i should not have but i did and the boy has disappeared a way of saying he has been kidnapped and will be used to pressurise the granddaughter immacolata i know immacolata if she had stayed if she had taken a young man from her own class from another family i would have been asked to marry her in my church and i doubt i would have refused it would have been a grand wedding followed by an obscenely lavish party and horrible amounts would have been spent on the principals clothing a heap of banknotes would have been given me for the repair of the church roof and most of those notes would have tested positive for recent cocaine exposure a predecessor of mine refused and he was not supported by the hierarchy and his condemnation of the killing of a child in a gun battle was not backed for a few days after the girl died there were demonstrations of hostility towards the clan the anger was a wind that blew out very soon and the priest was isolated under threat when the tv cameras had gone and their lights he was alone he is now in rome and when he comes back to visit his mother and father he has an explosionproof car to travel in and armed bodyguards to escort him our cloth and our collar do not protect us there are bullet marks by the main door and you passed them it is not easy to stand against such a force you wish me to ask in my pulpit on sunday for information to be given to the police concerning the boy i would be wasting my breath they are the state not you dottore castrolami they have complete power complete authority even inside this house of god i feel the fear it is always with us it shames me but its there fear is in the fabric of this street this church this congregation this priest a priest stood out against the casalesi clan and was shot dead you say you have few hours left and you have no idea where the boy is held im grateful for the trust you place in me that you can give me information so sensitive and i can suggest only that you pray for good fortune and that the sun will shine on your endeavour it is naples we are all believe me friend powerless in the face of this force of evil we lack the strength to stand against it but i tell you friend if it is one or the other the force of justice exerted against the family of forcella or the boys life i choose justice i feel inadequate a failed man not only today but every day i serve here i will pray for the boy but privately the church has little use for another hero less for another martyr castrolami shook his hand then lukas they left him in the quiet cool empty cavern of his church and went back out into the sunshine lukas was not a man ever to criticise the actions the selfpreservation and the priorities of a victim skewered on dilemmas they went for coffee did he want it eddie shivered the enormity of what he had achieved struck him a hammer blow he was shivering his legs were trembling spasmodically and his hands shook he had two hinges loose he could now using the galvanised bucket for leverage and the head of the nail as a screwdriver free the hinges from the door at any moment on his decision with a fiveminute window to shift the screws he could open the door forcing the bolt from its slot and go through it he would have the nail as a weapon with the end of the chain and its pin he didnt know what was beyond the door he could get through one might find another that was locked bolted and barricaded might find that the handle turned and it opened he might confront beyond it three men with knives guns and coshes or he might find it empty or one man asleep he might be too high up to go out through a window or there might be a flat roof for him to drop down on he didnt know if he opened the door that took him beyond the chance to turn back hed be going for broke if they caught him theyd hurt him then kill him choices faced eddie deacon almost crushed him gerald seymour the collaborator it was as if eddie pressed on a coiled spring his breathing was hard uncontrolled his leg muscles had tightened and his hands were clumsy insensitive tension built in him he did it eddie had the galvanised bucket under the lower hinge bar the upper was already detached and had swung away from the steelsheeted door he let the spring go his energy danced free all of his strength now was directed on to the bucket and his fingers were gripping it he pulled tugged forced back the bucket and the two screws screeched he had been more careful had worked slower on the upper hinge and it had made less noise now the lower hinge made a catfight sound no going back a sound proverbial to wake the dead enough to wake any guy on sentry duty drowsy in a chair he did the last heave and was hurled back across the space as the hinge bar came away and one of the screws exploded into his face like gunfire the bolt fittings loosed the door sagged and fell away a strip of light came into the space eddie could see where he had been walls that were graffitimarked and his own name a scrawl across other writing the boarded window the turnedover bucket and the plastic bag in which the food had been the bottle on its side the crevice of broken concrete from which the chains pin had been dislodged and the hood he could see all of that then he scooped up the length of chain might have been five feet of it the nail in his right hand and he put his body into the gap using his hips and shoulders to force the opening wider he was snagged he struggled writhed and broke out he didnt know how much time hed used since the screech of the screws seemed an age might have been a few seconds time then was most precious to him eddie crouched he had two weapons and readied them he had the nail held like a knife for stabbing downwards and the chain with the pin on it which he could swing as a flail the room was small empty no chairs no table no cupboards or chests but there were sacks against one wall three opened and in them were stacked packages in sealed oiled paper like it was their warehouse there was wallpaper peeled and dampstained with mould by the skirting and a loud flower pattern and there was a window daylight going fast crablike eddie reached it light poured through it and stung his eyes he blinked and they watered he didnt know how long he had been in darkness or with the hood over his face he realised peering through the grime on the glass that he was high in a block he could see below an empty road then a path on which dogs fought snarling and posturing and a woman pushed a buggy beyond kids kicked a football and the shadows were small the sun high he saw also that a man urinated in the bushes his back to the block and further down the road a couple young looked behind them furtively then went into the cover he knew he could have waved at that window screamed jumped up and down and yelled some more but no one would hear see or care about him not even the bloody dogs but he pulled at the window latches they were rotten and broke and he had the window wide eddie had to close his eyes to protect them from the glare he stood vulnerable thought it pathetic rooted and blind he had to open his eyes take the pain he did he put his head out of the window he saw a cruising police car but only the tail then it was gone and a scooter coming up the street the driver and his pillion wore black helmets with darkened visors what was he looking for perhaps he hoped to find under that window a drainpipe or a balcony a hand reaching up from a window below or a builders ladder the convenience of a fireescape he craned forward lost sight of the dogs and the kids the woman with the buggy and the man who had now zipped up and was walking the scooter had gone and the road was empty again there was nothing maybe a film stuntman could have done something or a special forces soldier a guy from a comic not eddie deacon there was no hand or foot grip and the pavement was fifty sixty feet below the drop sheer he heard behind him the door open then an oath turning he faced the man young muscled not focused but confused tshirt and jeans hair slicked with gel and a chain on his neck with a crucifix hanging eddie saw every feature of him the sun spot on his temple and the mole on his chin his tshirt inside the belt on the jean waist not more than two seconds and eddie had absorbed that the man had no weapon he charged him hit him hard clenched fist holding the nail hit him in the chest where the ribcage gives way to soft stomach skin didnt know who he was why he was there eddie felt hed punctured him hadnt seen him before hit him wounded and hurt him because he was in the doorway the man grunted and doubled eddie didnt know whether it was a flesh wound or a fatal injury to an organ he pushed him aside as the man went down eddie went through the doorway he was in another room the mens hands loosened the cards fell haphazardly to the table and dropped on to the banknotes they played for chairs were pushed back and the table rocked as knees caught its underside three more men all matching the others confusion disbelief but the door out of the room was beyond them a hand clutched his shoulder from behind he was brought to the sail by fangio his nose was a dull pain that throbbed blood was in his nostrils and he had sucked some into his mouth and swallowed a little the anger burned in him salvatore had had to return to the sail to report to the clan men who had sent him out given him the photograph of an opponent to be killed and the map for the location of a killing it had been demanded that he report back in person already a witness would have called a cutout number which would have phoned into the sail he was not bringing news of a killing like when he was ten before he was full time on the streets and standing before a goddam teacher his goddam writing commented on poor needs more practice improvement required but it was a part of the price carmine borelli had paid they would know already that a bottle had hit his face and that the execution had not shown calm casual power when he lifted off his helmet the visor spattered the blood had been dammed by the padding and made a ring below his lower lip and on his cheeks he was salvatore the idol of kids who had his photograph on their mobiles he was il pistole he was the enforcer of the borelli clan he could have screwed gabriella borelli should have screwed immacolata borelli he was a man of consequence in forcella and sanita but in the sail he was a servant and had been sent with a p on an errand the blood on his face was as humiliating as if a kid he had soiled his pants he went up the stairs fast and hoped to find a washroom before he saw the principals as he took the steps two in each stride the pain caught him the car was a highperformance alfa a threelitre engine orecchia drove and the seat beside him was empty except for a machine pistol gas canisters and a protective vest she had rossi with her in the back it might have been orecchias sense of humour that he had insisted on driving and put her with rossi who had seen her naked as she had seen him they sat at the far extremities of the blackleather bench seat and there was another machine pistol between them more gas and vests she thought the car was low on its wheels and presumed it was armoured rossi now ignored her it was as if she thought her signature on the contract the agreement that she would collaborate and give evidence guaranteed they were about to pass her on and therefore had no need to humour flatter cajole or dominate her she was to them used goods their eyes did not meet their hands stayed far apart and their knees she was behind orecchia and stared out of the left side window rossis attention was locked on the right they went fast on the autostrada kept a place in the overtaking lane traffic in front veered out of their path and blue lights flashed behind the radiator grille they had been escorted out of the roman suburbs by a marked car and would be met again when they approached the southern city they were now south of frosinone north of cassino and cruised at an average of kilometres an hour orecchia had music on light opera and there was no conversation the radio filled the void she wore the best of her few clothes had done her makeup and brushed her hair before leaving she had seen residents on the balconies of the block on the hill and had walked straightbacked to the car it would have been obvious from their body language that the men with her were a protection detail she thought there would have been sneers from those balconies and it would have been obvious that she was a collaborator she had protection but not the clothing of a person of status by now she would be gossiped over like dogs with old bones they would be exchanging anecdotes of sightings of her not one she was certain of the residents on the hill would have admired what she had done they had gone out to the autostrada by the northeast route she had had only one glimpse of the river the old bridge built originally by a romanera architect and carrying now a padlock sold that morning for thirtyfive euros was far behind her immacolata borelli was going home one man had a lacerated face a ribbon of blood from the chain swung against it another had run and was gone down a corridor a door slammed after him and a bolt pushed back another was dazed from the collision of his head with eddies and doubled from the impact of eddies knee in his groin the man who had been stabbed with the nail and had grabbed eddies shoulder now moaned on the floor and held his throat there were welts on it where the chain had wrapped round it and he had almost choked with the constriction of his windpipe there were two doors closed ahead of eddie the moment would not last could not they were in shock and shock would clear eddie opened the lefthand door he saw a lavatory seat and a basin he came out twisted and dragged on the second door he was in a hall an artists conception of christ hung on the wall a candle under it not lit eddie understood that adrenalin coursed through him when it was used up he would weaken his pace would slacken while their shock and confusion ebbed there were more sacks in the hall and another door with a steelbarred gate and beyond it a steel sheet on wood but the lock on the gate was unfastened and he could wrench it back in the local paper the one that did dalston and hackney there had been a piece about crack houses that had been busted into by the police with photographs and the crack houses had had those barred gates for security heavy keys were in the door he didnt know what was beyond it he pulled it open an alarm wailed he couldnt have known the door was alarmed had seen no key pad eddie reeled out on to a walkway he could have gone right but he went left in either direction there was only a long corridor of concrete with chesthigh walls and wires running across it looped to overhead bars with washing slung on them he had to duck his head below shirts sheets and skirts cotton trousers lightweight towels and underwear he ran and heard the pursuit because of the washing his head was down and it was awkward running with the shackle on his ankle bloody excuses eddie he looked up he saw ahead of him a gate it was as if the air was vacuumed from his lungs it was like when hope died there was no way off the walkway and it was lined with doors closed blocked to him there was a staircase perhaps fifty paces ahead might have been a mile or five he slowed there was a knot of men at the head of the staircase and between them and him the gate he saw it so clearly he could see five vertical and three horizontal bars and it was topped with a loose coil of barbed wire the pandemonium behind him came nearer he had almost stopped he saw the man with caked blood on his face approach the gate and talk to the guards there and attention was distracted eddie was level with a window some on the walkway had been broken and repaired with cardboard others had old sheets or towels draped across them for privacy or were too filthy to see through he caught the eyes of an old guy slumped in a chair but who had turned twisted then was on his feet the door beside the window opened it must have been in eddies face two big words per favore he heard a key turn the door wasnt opened for him to do it eddie understood the survival instinct refuge given but for him to open the door and for him to determine whether it brought the dogs of hell into the old guys room nowhere else to go he went inside old blood on salvatores face new blood on the men confronting him he had been slowed at the gate they had been slowed by the washing slung across some items had been torn down when the cloth was across their faces women screamed and were in the walkway collecting up what had been torn down for dirtying washing footsoldiers of the clan could be abused not for murder not for selling narcotics or for intimidation but for washing that had been dragged off the pegs and would have to be washed again salvatore was allowed through the barred gate he could have been let through immediately but that was not the way power was exercised in scampia he was kept waiting on the pretence that an answer to a mobile was needed bullshit and amusing too the blood on his face he saw men coming towards him he recognised three of the four knew where they had been and what their work was incoherent ramblings greeted him then clarity salvatore screamed his man was lost where above the scream close to where he stood a television was turned up loud and blasted out of a closed window he had to scream to be heard above it knock down every fucking door find him the handler of deltafoxtrot had enjoyed his cake and coffee had put the tapes given him into his briefcase and had wandered back to the office used by the service a block in the mussolini tradition that was behind the posta e telegrafi building and backed on to the piazza carita he had wound fast through the picture images had seen a clan leader whose image was perpetually on the database he had seen a closeup of carmine borelli and his hood salvatore both thrown up by computer recognition and the three still frames that showed a hooded prisoner being frogmarched along the walkway a front frame a side frame a back frame he had typed his report he had gone down a corridor and had knocked with due respect on the door of his line manager he had been admitted he had explained what matters the agent deltafoxtrot had felt sufficiently important to warrant an extraordinary meeting he had shown the images the concerns of the agent were logged his line manager said we operate beppe in a world of priorities were not policemen not detectives of the guardia di finanze or investigators of the carabinieri we are defenders of the state in matters of national security this is mere criminality we do not for any shortterm position endanger the safety of a longterm asset if the police or other units were to act on this information it would hazard his safety our agent it should be filed thank you please excuse me i have a meeting the usual file and without specific flagging the search had started in the warren of concrete that was the sail on its third floor where the walkway had the numbers of the three hundreds odd and even doors were hammered on for entry like a pack of hunting dogs hurt and demanding blood men went about the task of tracking down a fugitive it had been the washing suspended from the wires crisscrossing above the walkway that had permitted the escaper to lose his pursuers the washing was gone now and the women had retreated it was a methodical search down two sides and every apartment was scoured all those who hunted or watched waited for the triumphant shout that would tell them of success there was no love for strangers here news travelled fast in naples and its environs it might as well have been carried on the hourly bulletins of the independent radio stations or on the rai network it burrowed through prison walls over the barbedwire defences into the great heatstifled blocks where the cells were and into the wireroofed exercise yards at posilippo north of the city gabriella borelli heard a whisper through her door that her daughter was back in the custody of the servizio centrale protezione and would testify she sat on her bunk and the sweat streamed off her she thought of the boy the one lever left and wished him dead his corpse dumped at her daughters feet she was near to tears at poggioreale south of the city giovanni borelli strutted in a yard and silvio borelli slouched around the circuit and it was murmured to them that their sister had returned to the protection of the state and had guaranteed her willingness to give evidence the older swore cursed and blasphemed his cheeks reddened and his brother heard him say the whore the fucking whore she should have her boy have him dead the younger shook his head didnt understand the scale of his sisters hatred or why it was directed against himself he would have seen the boy butchered if it would open the poggioreale gate for him umberto the lawyer heard brought to him by the grapevine his nephew massimo listened to he thought then the boy is condemned and his building had cameras aimed at it his phones were listened to if he walked to a bar for coffee and a pastry he was followed on foot and if he drove to the launderette to deliver or collect his cottons a car came after him the boy is condemned and has little time sad but inevitable little time eddie deacon had no bloodlust would have said he did not practise cruelty to the defenceless he had memories he could hear through doors walls above the volume of the television the search coming closer doors breaking shouting always closer a memory of fishing for pike in the avon as a child with other children a small roach or a juvenile perch maybe three inches long was impaled alive on treble hooks then thrown into still water in the ebb of a weir and near a reed bed and a float would bob around as the fish swam for safety from the predator it would try to reach the cover of the reeds and find shelter there from the pikes jaws and the children would yank the line and pull it away from the reeds so that it would swim where the big beast could see it always the live bait went for the most tangled reeds to hide the apartment was a trap and its teeth had closed round him a memory of the kids who lived on farms and the child eddie went to their homes at weekends and headed off with them across the fields and had set snares they were put in place on a friday afternoon inspected on saturday and sunday morning sometimes the rabbit was already dead sometimes there was just blood and fur and a fox would have taken it but occasionally the rabbit had crouched so still and seemed to know its fate and merely waited for the killing blow always with its final strength it had tried to get into what deep cover the snares restraint allowed there was a front room in which an old man sat and watched the television it was a dirty smelly hot room and the man had gone back to his chair after turning the key and hadnt looked at eddie he had watched a film technicolour cowboys it could have been robert mitchum half a century old and had not caught eddies eye what alternative a pack running behind him a closed gate in front no steps off to the sides up or down the door had been unlocked for him to open and close a front room with a window that was exceptional for its cleanliness he had gone inside a corridor ran from the living room and there was no airconditioner no electric fan and the heat caught inside was a blanket in his face there was a kitchen space off the corridor with a small cooker and a fridge both from a museum and small cupboard units it wasnt a place where a man five foot ten twelve stone six could hide no chance there was a bedroom and a double bed and under the mattress there were fixed drawers a wardrobe that looked ready to fall apart and a chest with more drawers again there was no hiding place a memory of the ferrets that most of the farmers kids had little sharpnosed sharpeyed sharptoothed killing machines nets put across the burrows the ferrets slipped in then the listening the pounding of a rabbit running and a net bulging this child had not enjoyed the spectacle but had gone so as not to lose face bloody important at nine or ten he had often thought of a rabbit going deeper and further into the far extremity of the burrow and all the time hearing the scurrying brush of the little bastards clawed pads and having nowhere further to run the bathroom was the only room remaining off the corridor the hunters were in the next apartment the walls were thin little more than partitions he thought of it as a bathroom but it had no bath there was a basin a lavatory without a seat a shower unit with a curtain drawn half across and sagging for lack of support there was a small cupboard and a window the memories were of the defenceless ones who had tried to reach thick reeds bramble cover and the last extremity of the burrow not much went through eddies mind as he looked at the window heard the banging and shouting through the wall she wasnt in his mind he didnt think of love of getting his leg over of growing old in her company and owning a bloody cottage with roses growing eddie thought of survival there was a man who had blood on his chest from a rusted nails wound and another with slash marks on his face from a chain and a third who had doubled when a knee had crunched his testicles he thought they were all coming they and plenty more and where he was would be next for the search he had the window open the breeze through it slight riffled the plastic curtains he couldnt think of anywhere else to go that offered the possibility of survival then the door down the corridor and beyond the living room was hit he saw the men in his mind pouring inside the blood on their clothing and skin eddie went out through the window he stood on the rim of the lavatory bowl and swung a leg out then the other and his weight was taken on his shin which was across the sharp metal of the window frame he looked down once was enough there was the road and long sunscorched grass there were bushes and rubbish trolleys long filled to overflowing and there was concrete what had he thought when he was looking out of the window in the holding place his cell that the drop was fifty or sixty feet seemed fucking further now a pipe jutted out of the concrete a little to his left an overflow pipe for the lavatory maybe diameter of about half an inch protruding maybe six he thought from what he heard that they were now in the bedroom or the kitchen the nail went into his pocket again eddie took a deep breath it was about survival if he was taken now he stood no chance he didnt think of her or his father and mother didnt see the childhood home or the house in dalston saw a bastard drop a pipe from which water dripped the edge of the window frame and the flutter of the curtain eddie went over and the chain cascaded down he let his chest and stomach scrape down the iron window fitting then against the old concrete of the building his feet kicked his fists clenched to give his fingers the strength needed and gripping the bottom of the window frame took his weight then a trainer found the pipe and a fraction of the weight was shed but he did not know how long the pipe would carry its share of the weight and the chain swayed beneath him he hung he played the idiot a deaf idiot well they swarmed through davides living room shrieking questions at him and he grinned but barely turned his head from the big screen in front of him where a gunfight blazed he didnt answer and left them to think he was afflicted by deafness as well as idiocy the agent was not deaf and was not an idiot his years of living the lie in the sail had required of him the acutest sense of selfpreservation it was irrelevant at that moment whether his hearing was good or impaired his sanity was on the line he could not have articulated why he had risen from his chair gone fast across the worn carpet through the polystyrene takeaway trays and unlocked his door their eyes had met he had looked back through the window had seen the face and the desperation the stains on the clothing the nail in the fist with the dark stain at the tip and the chain and he had known that a fugitive ran had seen that shirt below a hood had seen that dark shade of jeans when a prisoner was brought along the walkway he saw so much of human misery the arrogance of the clan capo s and the swagger of the footsoldiers and he performed his duty and reported to his handlers he had never before intervened not much of an intervention the unlocking of a door but a first time now he was ignored four men at least flowed through his apartment and doors banged but he did not hear the whoop there was no place of refuge if a search barely a thorough one was made but they came out of the corridor he muttered a short prayer he dedicated it to matteo the patron saint of bank workers and bookkeepers as he had been he said the prayer again silently but never allowed his eyes to leave the screen where revolver shots were exchanged in front of a timbered saloon he could not imagine where the boy had hidden they were all gone but one stood in the open door and lit a cigarette it seemed that his arms were slowly being wrenched from their sockets he didnt know for how much longer he could keep it up cramp had set into his fingers which gripped the base of the iron window frame what sustained him was the diminishing voices they had been right above him the voices and the clatter of movement had come so close within spitting range but his hands what little of them would have been visible above the window frame had been behind the flutter of the curtain it would have been just a glance a moments check and they would have seen no place where an adult could hide maybe they had then been in twenty apartments maybe they had ten more to go through maybe they had gotten careless and the voices had drifted maybe another halfminute and then god willing he would begin the attempt to regain the window the first stone missed him was well wide the second thrown harder more expertly a better missile hit the concrete level with his head around a yard from him he swung momentarily as if he had tried to swat the grit its impact spat at him on one hand then clawed the other back into position and the extra weight had shifted the overflow pipe on which there was room for one foot little voices were far below shrill he looked down had to tuck his head almost into his right armpit and his view went past flush window sills to the paving the rubbish bags the bushes and the kids fucking kids the chain swung languidly below his foot not the kids nothing halfhearted about the little bastards four of them down there the smallest had a catapult three slung stones up at him which made a random shower but the smallest kid had the range had damn near hit eddies head and had another stone loaded eddie looked back up at the window couldnt look down any more he heard their shouts voices that were choirboys and imagined they were all pointing up wrong all except the sod with the catapult he was hit in the shoulderblade imagined one man looking down from a window and seeing them pointing the next stone from the catapult hit the back of eddies leg where it was soft just above the left knee he tried to lift himself it would have taken the ultimate of his concentration real focus to find that strength channel it and get himself up high enough so that his elbows could go over the window frame a stone hit the concrete a foot from his eye and level with it he couldnt turn his head away wouldnt dare destabilise himself eddie knew his strength was going and with it the heart the drop was below him and the kids bayed and more had come and it was a chorus below his feet and the chain with the pin attached too much pain in his fingers where it all ended some godfuckforsaken awful housing estate somewhere out of naples get it over with get it done he had only to loosen his grip and it was over done the pain would be gone from his hands and he would have peace and would hit the paving a potato sack eddie felt tears welling his wrist was grasped he couldnt look up first one hand had taken his left wrist then a second he thought of the old man in the chair and sobbed in silence thanks to him he didnt doubt that the grip on his arm was strong and wouldnt fail him hed hug him kiss him his foot was off the pipe and his hands had lost their hold on the window frame he was reliant when did he know a truth came to eddie deacon when a third hand and a fourth then a fifth had a grip on him two hands on his left wrist two more on his right and a fifth had a fistful of his shirt he was lifted he saw the faces there was blood on one and blood on another mans tshirt and there was the man who had put him in the van on via forcella whose eyes seemed to dance with laughter he was pulled up lifted through the window then thrown down on to the floor the tears came as the investigator in charge of the case marco castrolami had the prime place at the end of the table it was rare for this committee to be called together but he thought it worth the effort there were few other places he could go the meeting had lasted twentyfour minutes on the wall clock behind his chair and its usefulness was exhausted around the table were the head of the carabinieri criminalintelligence section for the province of campania the officer who headed intelligencegathering for the naples police the senior intelligence coordinator of the guardia di finanza and a dapper slight man who seemed to offer no name and was set apart from the rest castrolami said i repeat for the final time that only a few hours are now available to save the life of this british boy eddie deacon i repeat that all surveillance of principals has failed to find as best i know a pattern of movements or intercepts that can locate him i hope you will all examine your memories with due diligence whatever else you have in onrunning investigations i request your help so i repeat has anyone even the smallest information on where the borelli clan is holding this boy please his eyes travelled round the table to his colleague to the police officer he had known for a dozen years of latenight drinking bitching complaining and laughing to the fiscal policeman who was new in the city they had all shaken their heads or used their hands to gesture ignorance last his glance rested on the official from the secret service who was doodling on a sheet of paper he looked up and castrolami lipread his quiet answer nothing but it was not said aloud he stood he had no more to offer they came off the autostrada through the toll booth and on to the sliproad below far to the west were the city and the sea its beauty and its magnificence in the glove box orecchia had found a lightweight raincoat flimsy but sufficient for what he needed if it hadnt been there he would have used a newspaper he covered the machine pistol with it then switched off the flashing light behind the radiator grille now rossi caught her eye accepted the contact there was a query in his expression and she nodded decisively she was prepared for the last stage of the journey into naples and memories swept her immacolata knew the features and signs of the road she knew the filling station owned by the mauriello clan and the garden centre that seemed to have hectares of rattan furniture on display and was owned by the nuvoletta clan there was the restaurant beside the dualcarriageway where her father had taken her and she had met the lo russo family she had been seventeen and had taken an instant dislike to the boy whose company she was supposed to enjoy it would have been a good alliance and her father had laughed all the way back into the city at the scale of the failure there was the truckyard where the longdistance lorries were kept maintained and repaired it was owned by the licciardi clan and the fleet could be hired by her father or her brother for the empty run north under the terms of a subcontract and the return laden with chemical waste for the moccia or the alfieri clan it was excellent commercial cooperation they came past the great angled towers of the scampia district and on through secondigliano and into the territory of the contini clan she saw cafes where men had been killed and bars where men had been killed and pavements where men had been killed and she had come home immacolata was adult she was intelligent she knew what happened in her home city and the history of its streets she knew where the envelopes of fivehundredeuro notes tight in elastic bands had been slipped into the smart expensive leather briefcases of politicians national and local she knew where civil servants who prepared recommendations on contract choice of cement manufacturers were entertained by romanian or belarussian girls she knew where the men who led the clans housed their mistresses and where there had been a concretelined hole in a yard that had been the home for eight months of a clan leaders eldest son his heir the police had needed reinforcements before they could remove the twentysixyearold and had fired gas at a screaming crowd they had lost two patrol cars torched before order was restored for long enough to make the retreat she knew where it was her city she could see the sail building and knew that her father in an earlier prison term had been in an adjacent cell and had shared exercise with the clan leaders cousin now it had drifted away from her view with the other towers and she saw the signs to capodicino airport the car went fast she saw now that orecchia spoke outside her hearing into a button microphone that hung loose from an attachment she had not noticed him put an earpiece in place they were near to the bottom of the last long hill on the via carbonara going past the high walls of the castel capuano rossi had stiffened in his seat and had undone his seatbelt as if he felt the need for greater freedom his hand was on the stock of the machine pistol and a car unmarked was in front of them with another behind it was not the direct route she sensed they were playing with her testing her or steeling her immacolata saw very clearly the lower end of the via forcella there was the bar where her grandfather went for coffee and brandy to play cards or dominoes with old friends there was the vegetable stall where her grandmother bought broccoli and spinach tomatoes and spring onions there was the narrow entrance to the shallow arcade where silvio played the machines and the hairdresser giovanni used was beyond it momentarily she had a view of the facade of the block where her grandfather and grandmother lived then the three cars in unison had swung left she could see fleetingly the shops businesses outlets from which as a teenager she had collected the pizzo and those to which older with the benefit of her newly learned bookkeeping she had gone to revalue their contributions she could recall her icecool responses when she was told that such sums were not possible they always were they crossed the big square in front of the railway station and it was from there only a few times that she had taken the train anonymous and unidentified to the town of nola to visit her friend on down a crowded logjammed street then the siren started they had gone the wrong way in the traffic chaos and the sun had been blocked by the height of the poggioreale walls where giovanni and silvio were held she saw the church modern and magnificent and the triple towers of the palace of justice they went down a subway entrance and a barrier was raised she had never been there before descending into the greyness of the tunnel under the palace she had been through the main public entrance off the pedestrian area through which the families of the accused were admitted but not this route in naples there were the castel capuano the castel nuovo the castel dellovo and the castel san elmo all great historic monuments but the palace was another castle as formidable the home of what had been for every one of her aware years the enemy the nemico one thing to meet the enemy in a park in northeast london and to travel with the enemy from london to rome then to be in a safehouse on a hill with exquisite views of the capital it was another to be taken under the protection of guns into the enemys castle she was in an underground car park dimly lit and there was the stench of petrol fumes immacolata did not look into rossis face as he stood beside the opened door of the alfa she climbed out making light of the awkwardness in slipping her legs from the low seat and stretched she followed orecchia towards a lift shaft where more men waited she was ringed with guns theatre or real and present danger the men had hard faces and she didnt think they playacted in the lift she was hemmed in and rossis machinepistol magazine dug into her arm she could not have said when on the journey she had last thought of eddie deacon she wasnt certain if shed thought of him since shed fastened the padlock and thrown the key into the river where it meandered among sandbanks salvatore came out through the door the man with the face wound now caked and dried had taken his place the door was closed a poor fit since the power drill had replaced the hinges and gouged new screw holes he went to the sink and started to wash the blood off his fists and the sweat from his body a man came up behind him the door is always locked by any person who lives on any floor of any walkway in the sail he didnt understand it was more important to him that his fists hurt and the knuckles were scraped much more important the boy had not yelled the man said every door is locked how did he get in was the door left open was there a plan i think not was the door opened for him i think it was if the boy had screamed begged it would have given salvatore more satisfaction he could hear now the thudding blows he had inflicted there would be more blood from the eyes the lips inside the mouth and the nose there would be much more when the man with the nail wound in his chest took his turn and the man who still walked badly because of the knee and the bruising what are you saying they found many new shirts in the cupboard still wrapped never worn hes davide he goes to the city each week and buys a new shirt why why does he need new shirts that he never wears hes an idiot is that the behaviour of an idiot why did he unlock the door for a fugitive no one would salvatores upper teeth closed on his lower lip and bit hard he was a stranger here isolated he had loyalties to gabriella borelli whom he had not protected to carmine and anna borelli whom he revered to himself paramount he wondered where fangio was what he was doing how he was treated down there among the shit not allowed to come up to the third level he sensed alarm two men waited each with different wounds to beat more hell out of the boy he said they should not take the boys life he dried his face he said the idiot davide could wait he went to find fangio he walked along the walkway and past the apartment and noted for the first time the cleanliness of the window and the old man watching television inside he wants to know when there was surveillance throughout the city each of the forces the carabinieri the squadra mobile and the guardia di finanza would have loved to be able to claim plaudits for recognised faces umberto carmine borelli salvatore il pistole named footsoldiers of the clan there was foot surveillance camera surveillance audio surveillance and telephone surveillance almost not quite literally the men and women of the three lawandorder agencies jostled each other when is he to kill him fangio walked in a cemetery with massimo the lawyers nephew beside him neither had any idea of the identity of the corpse in the coffin the sex or the age they took a position near the tail of the cortege as it wound towards a high wall and the line of small capelle in front of it within the last four months over a meal in the evening heat at a ristorante on the west slopes of vesuvio gabriella borelli and salvatore had chosen this as a method of avoiding watchers and cameras salvatore had activated it now a plan decided on after the whores departure to london and where for best effect is he to leave the body massimo cultivated a northeuropean pallor but he fancied his face had gone bloodless he was could not avoid the implication now at the heart of a conspiracy of murder might before have avoided that conclusion by playing at semantics no longer could deflect his own guilt they had reached the capella in which that days body would be placed by happy coincidence another funeral had ended a column of mourners men loosening their ties women dabbing their necks with cologne and using the orderofservice cards as fans came past them and headed for the gate that would lead into the sanita district they switched when where they didnt leave together fangio was far down the via foria and accelerating through slow traffic by the time massimo had telephoned anna borelli had apologised profusely for disturbing her siesta and begged permission to collect clean underwear for her grandsons and take the items with him on his visit the following day to poggioreale gaol it did not surprise him that anna the crow in her perpetual uniform of black would make such a decision when a young man would die and where his carcass would be dumped but he was hooked and could not step back he sat on great smoothed stones they were at the foundations of the narrow metalled track leading to the main entrance of the castle that jutted into the bay a wedding party hung back but the girl bride and her freshfaced new husband had come off the road and over the low wall had stepped on to the stones a photographer with them and posed close to where lukas sat he should not have been there he should have been in the annexe off the operations room if he had been there he would have been able to soak in the collators surly acceptance of his presence and the psychologists sneered hostility the ros men who would have made up any assault team that might be mounted would have sat around him yawned broken wind and belched as such men did as he had when he was a member of a hostage rescue team and if he had been there he would have been close to castrolami who seemed to him now a man of split priorities the life of the boy the testimony of the girl and the scales as castrolami demonstrated them slipped fast towards the girl as his priority he watched the bride pose in front of the towering castle walls and hold out her train so that the afternoon breeze caught it and made a sail of it he saw the adoration in the grooms face it had not happened in lukass life it was good for him to see real people and share what they offered not to be incarcerated in an annexe with a gallowshumour crowd there should of course have been intelligence coming in from the assets but the way castrolami had told it there were the usual inevitable divisions and rivalries if it was a carabinieri instigated investigation would the police crime squad or the fiscal police help small chance and there had been at their meeting the domestic security service they wouldnt no chance in the states it might have been the agency the bureau and alcohol tobacco and firearms might have been counterterrorist intelligence and the junglas colombias supposed elite the agency the bureau task force and the local warlords in iraq might have been in any goddam place where a life hung by a thread and the big boys disputed territory the wedding party lined the road to the castle entrance shouted approval and the groom had come to hold her lukas liked the image he thought that unless luck was served up in buckets he had lost the boy no assets quoted no intelligence offered just silence in closeset walls around him he could lose a hostage climb on to a flight get himself back to paris and not feel that the world had fallen in he didnt understand why this boy had gotten to him he let out a long slow sigh which was pretty damn selfindulgent nothing to do with his own boy with whom contact was severed not a piece of replacement psychology that the shrinks would have enjoyed talking up he didnt know why this boy had burrowed like a worm under his skin he had gone through the routines of hostage negotiation so many times and not felt that anything was personal maybe it was the goddam photograph hed been shown or the sight of the girl running in the park maybe their romance had fuelled that worm and little of romance had crossed his tracks perhaps he was just damn jealous he hailed a taxi and gave it piazza dante as a destination all his instincts told him that a body would soon be in a ditch or in a car or in an alley and he felt shredded of power gerald seymour the collaborator it was not mercy that stopped the beatings but their exhaustion he was a punchbag a kicked football a bleeding bruised mess eddie lay on the floor of the same space where he had removed the chains pin from the wall and the doors hinges he had no longer any sense of time or of hunger but his throat burned with thirst he thought hed swallowed some of the blood and mucus and the sweat that poured in rivers off his head he didnt know whether his ribs were broken only that the pain there came in sharp spasms if he moved an inch to right or left he thought his forearm wasnt broken but it might have been it had protected his kidneys and had probably screened his liver he was on his side his wrists were fastened together behind his back held with a plastic stay that had been pulled tight and cut into the skin but with so much pain elsewhere that was a small matter and he ignored it his ankles had new manacles he was on his side and had been since they had dumped him he had been able to lift his knees into his stomach twist his shoulder and chest towards them drop his head and shorten his neck and he had kept his eyes tight shut eddie knew he was condemned they had not hooded him it seemed unimportant to them that he saw their faces one was contorted in rage and had new scars across one cheek he had kicked and punched hard one had laughed each time he had kicked and punched and had the blood on his tshirt eddie knew a name he had heard the one whose testicles he had kneed call another salvatore again it had not seemed important to them that a name had been used within his earshot it was confirmation that he was condemned the one they called salvatore was the man who had taken him in the via forcella who had kicked him before who seemed to have a slack irresolute mouth and vacant distant eyes between the first beating and the second the one from salvatore and the one from the man with the scarred face he had almost called out to immacolata to end it for him back off quit refuse he had slid into weakness but he had ditched it in the gap between the second and third beatings he had thought of little between the third and fourth nothing coherent after the fourth now he had no thought of anything beyond survival for the next five or ten minutes he did not have a noble romantic or heroic thought all gone he existed in a vacuum no hope and no despair where no intellect was admitted he was the animal in the snare or the burrow or the treblehooked fish unable to reach the reed bed he did not consider a greater picture the rule of law over the supremacy of criminality that might govern immacolata eddie thought of nothing beyond lying still and managing the pain in his ribs and the pain in his forearm which might be broken and the pain in his lip which was bloody and swollen and the pain in his eyes where the bruising had spread his vision was through tearwet slits he didnt think of his class filling a room or the guys in the house didnt think any longer of immacolata they had nothing to do with his possible survival for the next five or ten minutes they hadnt closed the door on him he could see through the open door the shoes trainers that had kicked him and they were propped on other chairs and he could see the fists that had punched him which cradled cigarettes one was wrapped in a handkerchief and the blood showed through the inspiration of escape was behind him he could see a spider it was in the angle between the wall and the ceiling a monster of a spider with a fortress of close mesh around it and a food store it moved lethargically eddie wondered how long it took a spider to weave a web of that extent it was his first thought other than survival since the fourth beating who was the enemy of the spider who threatened it his mind turned cranked on the queries and salvatore had gone was no longer in the room with the others but the one with the shirt wound blood in the chest from the nail came to the door and stood there tobacco smoke playing across his face he was a grown man might have been thirty eddie didnt understand how a man of thirty could be as savage as a cat with a victim as helpless as a winged songbird he didnt have the clarity to think it through the man watched him was it work for a man the man was older than eddie he guarded prisoners kicked and punched them maybe he might just get to kill one eddie shivered did it fucking matter whether the man had a wife he went home to sleep beside or small children to play with at the end of a long hard day of smoking kicking and punching did he talk about kicking punching and guarding over supper with his wife and kids eddie knew nothing did the man say to his woman that it had been a good day at work to think to imagine was all the independence left to him better off without them he turned which hurt his ribs and tried to get on to his other side so that his back was to the man but the pain was too bad he managed only to flop on to his back which left him more vulnerable his privates were unprotected he rolled back he was where hed started better to have stayed put better not to think and not to imagine there had been the one chance hed given it his best shot but it hadnt succeeded and he was condemned which was what immacolata had done for him and the certainty of it gave him a sort of peace were the footsoldiers of the borelli clan inside the palace of justice immacolata had been given a soft drink iced and now was brought down a corridor guns in front of and behind her did salvatore il pistole have access here she could smell the gun oil the chilli on their breath and the scent from their armpits a door was knocked at respectfully a pause then it was opened and a smartly dressed woman who might have been as old as her mother gazed at her with the expression that was devoid of approval or criticism then stepped aside she was walked through an outer office she realised now that the guns were gone so this was the sanctum into which her fathers footsoldiers and even salvatore were thought unable to penetrate an inner door was rapped on another pause long enough to indicate that work must be completed then a call enter of course the prosecutor had not looked up his head was low over carpets of papers that were rumpled across the desk she was not asked to sit she realised then that this was deliberate a casualness meant to implant in her the certainty that she was not extraordinary there were many files on the floor and she wondered if they had been laid out to a purpose they carried the names in heavy indelible ink of lo russo contini mazzarella de lauro misso and caldarelli it might have been done to demonstrate to immacolata that she was a small fish that she swam in a big sea but she didnt know he asked a good journey signorina i sat in a car it was satisfactory im told your mind is made up i said so you will give evidence i said i would so i will i regret that your decision may cost the life of eddie deacon i regret that i will give evidence and you will not signorina be surprised if i seek to stiffen your resolve she was told where she would be taken she turned on her heel it was a grander exit than had been her entry she knew they did not trust her word salvatore stood by a broken wardrobe under its plywood sides back and doors there were dozens of cellophanewrapped shirts none of the packaging had been opened none of the shirts used the man sat in his chair the television played he seemed oblivious to the movement around him the apartment was filled with men the truth came slowly to them all to salvatore and to the men of the sail clan he was davide he was an electrician and could be relied upon to fix a broken fusebox to route power round a meter box and bypass it he would come at any time was so helpful he was a man of routine and went to the city centre down the long hill on the bus every week and would mutter to any who listened that he thought that week he needed a new shirt he was a man who polished the window behind his chair which fronted on to the walkway when he had been ordered to stand there had been a secreted mirror in his chair like a woman kept in her handbag to check her eye makeup or lipstick he was almost unique in the great block in that he had allowed a fugitive to enter his apartment either his main door had been unlocked or he had seen the fugitive and decided to aid him nothing fitted only suspicion meshed with the suspicion the adding of the parts came realisation of a truth the apartment was searched stripped bare the camera was found the cables from the camera led to the recording box the recording box and its loaded tapes were lifted from the hidden recess the wire that ran from the recording box to the audio microphone the pinhead type fitted to the outside wall was ripped clear and he stood none of the men the clan footsoldiers or salvatore seemed aware of him as he left his chair and the television he took a last glimpse at the screen it was afternoon scheduling too late for the midday film and too early for the girls to be topless they wore flimsy onepiece swimming costumes and pranced cheerfully he did not of course bolt for the front door he went down the corridor he did not know what he had achieved in his recent life could not know to what use the handlers had put the information he had supplied he understood that the men who swarmed in his apartment were almost in shock at what they had found and that time was short for him soon enough heads would clear and thoughts would focus he went down the corridor towards his bathroom duck here can you speak wait one lukas was in the corridor had passed the main desk where his id was checked had been through the metal detector and turned it raised eyebrows that he went back through the doors and on to the street then into the square he made for a central point and it didnt concern him that he had intruded into the middle of a soccer game the kids buzzed round him shoot its like youve been on the dark side of the earth nothing to report didnt report because i had nothing im not nagging i didnt report because i had nothing to report onesyllable stuff the ball came by him and he hoofed it away the kids clapped theres no intelligence there are no assets that anyone will share every agency here is fighting a breezy turf war the contact my dooropener thinks the spooks are less than frank duck how many times we heard that but its just his reading of body language i have nothing to do i cant advise on negotiation because we havent reached that status i cant suggest how a rescue might be launched because we dont have a location theres no role for a coordinator if no negotiations in place and theres nowhere for a storm team to assault sorry and all that duck thats pretty goddam obvious its frustrating you want to hear about something the voice rasped in lukass ear what is it could i try you with a snatch off the niger delta about sixty klicks into the gulf an oilflow platform yanks canadians and three brits what makes it different is that local workers were killed when the hostagetakers came on board the rig so they cant simply be paid off the temperatures hot chevron have the rig and their security people asked for you im merely passing it on you could tell them im spoken for regrets and all that any idea how much longer itll move fast too fast for you maybe he liked roddy duck johnstone trusted him and was appreciated and he thought the call didnt yet have purpose it was peculiar for the boss not to needle in on a point without preamble without crap im just throwing past you the second call on your time the german red cross have contacted us they have people in western afghanistan round herat and theyve lost a field worker well not actually lost him just dont know which warlord has him and if he goes into the hands of the aq well they asked for you like the man said to chevron lukas answered that youre spoken for that im spoken for i feel kind of obligated to stay with this let it run its course not getting soft and sentimental in your old age he heard a brief grim chuckle no one who knew him would ever accuse him in seriousness of either hope not lukas bridled and the ball was back at his feet the kids stayed off him and he did a shimmy kicked for goal wide lukas thought hostage coordination was easier than kicking footballs dont take this as impertinence but can you see yourself making a contribution of value hope to will try to a good kid i didnt do the legwork you did he said softly lukas wouldnt put down his boss no one had ever labelled him sarcastic and he thought of those he had searched out the closeup witnesses the hotel manager the fishseller a priest with a knapsack of guilt itd be nice to bring him out yes i have a desk to get back to ill tell them youve work in hand not available for the niger delta tell them youve things stacking up not available for herat damn you lukas because you never give me anything hes an ordinary kid with an ordinary background yet i think hes special its what people say and the desk calls lukas rang off he understood why the company boss the god almighty of ground force security should waffle on about a good kid and nice to bring him out in the company there were people from differing lawenforcement and military backgrounds and personal involvement was regarded as suitable for the fairies not for them but the matter in hand involved the fate of a kidnap victim not pipeline security not close protection for an ambassador not convoy escort up a road blighted with culvert bombs kidnapping was different it had a particular status with the people of this company all levels and of every other company in the same trade he understood why his boss had put saccharine on the assignment would have known there was no possibility of lukas pulling out from naples and taking a flight to lagos or heading to kabul almost the boss had pleaded with him for a best effort hed never done that before hed trawled the boys background had done the parents the guys who lived in the east london house and maybe some people the boy worked with most important the boss had been lined up by a guy onetime special forces who did close protection for the company in the dark corners where the money was earned and where the risk of getting lifted was greatest they were all in this trade bound together like blood relatives all that made sense to lukas but there was something more as if his boss had been well hooked funny thing the emotion business he could feel emotional about a complete stranger lukas didnt do emotion if he did he could be slashed minced great to feel good when the hostage walked to a helicopter or an armoured humvee a luxury of indulgence and when the hostage didnt walk but stank from the sun the flies swarmed and was carried away in a black bag emotion would wreck him he needed the protection of apparent indifference but it had gotten harder to playact he had seen bad things in his time and been party to them and a tear had not fallen from his eye might be time to quit when it did should have felt calm but didnt should have felt on top of his game the acknowledged expert in the field but didnt he went back inside walked through the operations room and took his chair in the annexe quiet and respectful he asked what was new and was told that nothing was two rats came close they didnt approach the body but blood had spurted from the mouth on impact salvatore saw the rats when he craned out of the bathroom window they had realised davide had gone through the window a full halfhour before and from three floors up each of the men who had looked at the man lying with his head at such an angle had pronounced death they had gone on with the search more had arrived there was a capodecine bustling with urgency there to see at first hand the scale of an intelligence failure in the midst of the sail a comando piazza who traded off that walkway came to check on the parameters of that failure and two magazzinieri who warehoused on the third level there was an aquirento the principal buyer for the clan all came from the walkway to try to measure the limits of a small disaster they had gone salvatore watched the rats from the window and saw them lap the blood of an old man who had played at being an idiot like cats with milk the body lay on the concrete paving with a crown of weeds for the shattered head the feet between two overflowing rubbish bins immacolata stepped out of the alfa orecchia and rossi on either side of her two more men had peeled from the police car outside the gate the front door was open and she saw more men in the hallway she wore dark glasses that covered most of her cheeks with a headscarf over her hair it was a crude disguise would have fooled few a man with no intention of backing off in the face of force the guns and the threat watered a flowerbed in the middle of his front garden she had been told she shouldnt hesitate on the pavement or the path across the street a couple watched the show little else would match the arrival of an armed convoy orecchia had taken her arm she had been to the house before but it seemed an age since she had last walked up that path and gone through the front door to be greeted with the hug and the kiss of the closest friend she had known it was because they didnt trust her that she had been brought here there had been no consultation she was a giftwrapped parcel on a conveyorbelt she had not spoken in the car but her mind had turned over the previous time she had been on that road out of naples and across the flat inland plain that stretched to nola then silvio had driven then there had not been a machine pistol on the seat gas grenades and a vest she could not have said tracing that same route how many days hours nights it had been since silvio had driven her to nola the days and nights since had concertinaed and the spread of time no longer had meaning for her she couldnt have said how long it had been since she had run from the basilica how long since she had paid fifty euros for a teneuro posy how long since the heel of her shoe had broken her clothes had been torn and she had lain on the ground assaulted and abused she didnt know she followed orecchia into the hall castrolami was there he seemed to tower in the place to minimise it on the floor near to his feet there were two neat piles of female clothing at hip height across the hallway there were three black plastic sacks filled and knotted at the neck she realised her visit had interrupted a schedule one of the two piles was of clothes for early spring late autumn and winter and she recognised the anorak marianna had worn on a january day down on the via partenope when they had walked and done the farewells the next day immacolata had gone to london the other pile was of latespring clothes which would have lasted through summer and early autumn and at the top of the heap lay the faded tshirt with the image of che that had been a favourite of marianna she had arrived which meant the disposal of her friends clothes was delayed she assumed the plastic bags would go to a rubbish tip and that the heaps had been sorted carefully and would be taken to a charity perhaps one overseen by the nuns at the basilica she could remember her friend in the yellow anorak with the black underarm panels and the north face logo and in the guerrilla tshirt castrolami said not dropping his voice seeming not to care if he was overheard at the palace the decision was taken to provide security for the family as soon as rumour would have reported your collaboration signorina it was thought that the parents of your friend were at risk when you came into our custody as leverage then the boy your onetime lover made himself available to them and the threat against the parents was briefly reduced we anticipate that the boy will be murdered you have not made a public announcement that you are withdrawing your potential testimony and the deadline expires in a few hours if we had a good line into the kidnap situation we would be able to delay and protract the process we do not we cannot rescue him because we dont know where he is held he will be murdered very soon we anticipate tomorrow unless we can stall and deceive then they the borelli family will need more leverage possibly they will come here for it the lives of these people are doubly ruined signorina they have lost their daughter poisoned by toxic greed and they should if they have any sense pack up sell their home leave their employment and move away they would then have left behind the grave of their daughter and to visit it they would require an armed escort will they run she asked for them to answer was his curt response there is a consequence for your actions you should know that if they were to stay we couldnt commit the resources for a permanent guard they would be alone the support of their neighbours would be temporary and soon they would be alone every day they must look over their shoulders and try to spot the killer stalking them quite soon at their places of work human resources will say its not personal but you bring danger to your colleagues and its with great regret that we must ask you to leave we must think of the companys welfare the schools the safety of colleagues and pupils if they stay they wont be forgotten theyre marked theyre a permanent way of hurting you its the world in which we live why do i have to see them so that you can never say you didnt know the consequences of your actions and when the boy is dead and were given the body ill drive you to the mortuary perhaps the small one at the incurables so that you can look into his face and see what theyve done to him youll never be allowed to say you didnt know she stepped out she pushed past him she knew the layout of the house and went right through a door that bypassed the kitchen entrance then out through the room where the computer was that luigi rossetti used to prepare the modules of his classes for his pupils and where marianna had done work she brought home from her college course the doors were wide open and there was a patio outside with chairs and a table and wire mesh on which a vine grew throwing shade beside that door there was a large cardboard box whose top flaps had not been folded down so she could see textbooks the same she had used and ring binders she thought they had eradicated their daughter from the home how long was it she had kept no track of time but it might have been a week they were sitting down the garden stretched away neat and small and a policeman stood at the far end with a machine pistol slung on his neck from a webbing strap she saw the hands that had snatched at her clothing the feet that had kicked her and the mouths that had torn away her dignity neither stood and neither waved her to a chair nothing immacolata thought is forgiven mariannas father luigi said we didnt want you to come but they insisted there is no welcome mariannas mother maria said there is a boy nineteen admitted this week to the ospedale he has followed marianna to the santa maria della pieta he may now be in the same bed but certainly in the same ward and he has the same symptoms i dont know the family but luigi taught him for a year its said hell die the day after tomorrow luigi said we havent visited the family we didnt want to intrude on the crisis afflicting them maria said there were others before marianna there will be others after the boy will you go she blurted go where a frown knitted the fathers forehead will you leave and take marianna with us break her peace or leave her behind can you imagine us doing either the mothers shaking head expressed her incredulity i wondered if we shall stay if they kill us well join her were not frightened of them theres nothing else they can take from us they said in chorus you know what im doing we were told the father said we respect it but we do not forgive and we do not forget the mother said also we were told of a boy who loves you and that theyll kill him but you wont weaken it is what we were told ill testify against my family she had said it ill testify against my family and at that moment the scales tipped and she had made her commitment they turned away from her it was as if she was of no further use to them she was ignored vulnerable did castrolami rescue her he did not she fidgeted and shuffled her feet she wondered if one day she would be somewhere in england in the countryside green near cows and she would be with the father and the mother of eddie deacon explaining to them what choices had been made and the consequences she spun on her heel she faced castrolami who lounged at the door immacolata said lets get the fuck out of here a smile widened at his mouth his arms unfolded and he took her elbow at that moment she believed she had his respect she walked past the box of books the files and past the bags that would go to a tip and past the two heaps of mariannas clothing orecchia came out of the kitchen rossi following him and they readied their weapons they went out into the sunlight and the brightness dazzled her they headed back towards the dualcarriageway and naples driving past fields that had been harvested and groves of apple trees and crossed a stream that was almost dry she didnt know where the poisons had been dumped or where marianna rossetti had played or whether that was the stream she had paddled or swum in the car was silent nothing more to be said she had made her pledge and could not turn back if she wanted ever again to walk with a pinch of pride she had killed the boy might herself have held a knife or a pistol she broke the quiet am i a circus freak she wasnt answered do i have the right to know where i am to be exhibited next no reply it couldnt be challenged a lawyers clerk had the right to escort the motherinlaw of an accused woman not yet convicted and entitled to legal presumption of innocence to see the daughterinlaw and take her toiletries clothing and fruit massimo escorted anna borelli drove his car and listened too much time is lost and no message is sent he wished he hadnt heard it should be done in the morning his own grandmother had a baggy stomach wide hips an excessive bosom a twinkling eye and a smiling mouth she teased him about the marriage invitation that hadnt been sent to her the lack of babies to drool over this woman the hag was sheer contrast not a gram of spare flesh no fullness in her chest a dulled deathlight in her eyes and thin lips she seemed to find no pleasure in her world his own grandmother on his mothers side living in comfort in merghellina north along the coast and only a few kilometres from the citys centre couldnt have spoken those whipped words or done in the night then dumped in the morning he crossed the piazza sannazzaro then cut down to the via francesco caracciolo soon they would be close to his grandmothers apartment at this time of the day she would be watering the plants on her balcony or maybe she would have started to mix a pesto for massimos uncle a bachelor of fiftythree who hadnt yet left home his grandmothers life was ordered and regulated his other uncle umberto the lawyer was on his fathers side and his character was harsher and colder umberto would have been at ease with this woman a strega in his car and would have listened unfazed as she discussed without passion the killing of a young man i have thought of where the cadaver should be left his own grandmother was nervous of small spiders and wouldnt even swat a fly on a windowpane massimo wondered as he drove near to his grandmothers now how many men and women had lost their lives on the witchs sayso he could imagine those fingers with the wrinkled skin and the pared nails wrapped tight round a mans throat he swerved and nearly hit a taxi the cadaver should be where the impact is greatest they were past merghellina and the marina where the launches rolled on the gentle waves in the shelter of the breakwater at one more set of trafficlights they were beyond the franchise area of the piccirillo clan and were entering the territory of the troncone and grasso families that information might have been given on an advertising hoarding or a frontier control point a man who answered to the piccirillo would not cross that street beyond the trafficlights and go north to trade narcotics or to extract protection dues neither would a man employed by the troncone or the grasso come south very ordered he would be at the gaol in ten minutes she said the cadaver should be left at the main door to the palace of justice but not before nine in the morning he didnt ask how a vehicle would bring a dead body across a wide piazza that was a pedestrianonly zone how could it be tipped on to the patterned paving under the sign that read palazzo di giustizia and the flag when there was always a carabinieri vehicle parked there with two armed men inside it from the protection unit how he did not ask i have spoken to carmine i told him what i thought and then i told him what he thought it was the same he thought incredibly that a suspicion of a smile hovered briefly at her lips you massimo will take my instructions to salvo there is no time for a rendezvous you take them to him kill him early in the morning and leave his body for when they arrive at work his hand shook the direction of his car wobbled he would not have dared to contradict anna borelli they drove in silence the last kilometres to the parking area outside the walls fences and watchtowers of the womens gaol where the daughterinlaw was held what did guys do they had last visits sent messages and wrote final letters eddie would have no visit did not expect an opportunity to send a message and could hardly write a last bloody letter with his hands trussed behind his back what else did guys do they put their affairs in order problem was that eddie had no affairs worthy of the name none that were tidy or chaotic he had no money beyond a current account and a post office savings book that had somehow been forgotten while he was at college or it would have been stripped bare he had other things to exercise him than worrying about whether he had paid his tax and whether the last pension contribution had gone out of his account and that he hadnt made a will was that actually what guys did he thought that his fathers and mothers affairs would be in order last letters sealed with a secondclass stamp on them legal things up to date all relevant tax settled it was because eddie had become after a fashion comfortable and because his body hurt less that his mind had allowed that door to open he was better off when the pain was rich and thinking didnt intrude next thing would be going through that door how would they do it had to squirm had a flash in his mind of the hood going over his head but seeing a pistol before his eyes were covered or a knife or being taken to a high floor and feeling the air on his skin and knowing he was beside an open window quite deliberately eddie turned on to his right side so that his weight crushed his ribs the pain might have made him squeal but he welcomed it which seemed to slam that door when how would they do it was gone he rolled back the exertion sent the pain into his head and feet legs and arms chest and stomach but the mind was cleared more philosophical quite a jab on the nose actually a reality check eddie deacons life didnt count when it was set against a principle pretty bloody heavy stuff he chewed on it who had made the decision who had sat on the judgement bench had they applied logic and intellect to the process or tossed a bloody coin if it was logic and intellect would they go to a chapel lower themselves on to a hassock and say a smug little prayer if a coin had been tossed would they have headed off to the pub and sunk a few raising a glass to him sorry and all that eddie nothing personal would have been nice if it was all faceless people big policemen in fancy uniforms with medal ribbons in bright lines politicians waiting for the limousine to pull up escorts to open the door and judges in robes easier for eddie if it was men who did not have faces it was her it was his mac who had said that the principle won out his immacolata he was curled on his side the pressure off his ribcage and the pain had subsided it might have been from what eddie remembered three weeks after he had met her maybe four and they had been in the pub with the boys from the house hed only been on the second pint and his glass wasnt even half empty but she had pushed the table reached out her hand and taken his then yanked him up and led him out they had gone back to the house and she had set the pace going ever quicker had run the length of the street to the steps and the front door it had not been a slow seduction undressing but a stripoff and she had beaten him to it naked when he still had his socks on they had made love fast then again slower and hadnt stopped when the boys had come back from the pub they had done it again when the house was quiet and the boys late film was finished hed probably only ever said it to her once whispered it in her ear with wonderment i love you immacolata and will love you till she hadnt let him finish he thought remembering the declaration that it had been after the first time and before the second the third time bloody near knackered she had brought him on hard and deep and he had damn near broken the bed he had meant it every word every syllable will love you till she hadnt let him say how long he would love her and her mouth had closed over his and her tongue had stilled his and her body had brought warm sweat to his and he had squirmed under her i love you immacolata he had said it she had not there was a cough at the door salvatore was there his immacolata only once had they shared a sour exchange hed drunk too much she was sober hed wanted horseplay shed wanted to read a textbook hed had a normal undemanding day tomorrow shed had an exam salvatore leaned on the door jamb and watched him was huge above him his immacolata he had told her boisterous to lighten up she had told him he was wasting his talent could do more and go further that he could make a difference and he had flounced out gone for a leak and it had never been mentioned again and there had been no suggestion as to how he could make a difference salvatore studied him as if he was an enigma mindful that he was open to another kicking eddie glimpsed the face looming over him and thought it vulnerable bloody bizarre returned to the core theme the principle had won breasted the tape for immacolatas prize he had not won bloody hadnt principle coming before his survival didnt make him angry it stifled his feelings salvatore had a cigarette in his mouth smoke came up from it and went towards the web where the big spider was abruptly he moved a hand eddie trussed unable to shift didnt feel threatened which went into his pocket and took out a pack of marlboro lights he pulled out a cigarette and bent to slip the filter into eddies mouth where the lips felt triplesize swollen and lit it he didnt say anything and eddie didnt thank him three times the ash broke off and scattered on eddies chest then salvatore retrieved the stub and trod it out under his trainer he didnt leave but stayed in the doorway and stared down he did not know if it had been for immacolata a big or small decision to go with the principle rather than his life he didnt think hed ever get to know there was a sliver of window that eddie could see past salvatores shoulder and he realised that the day had died and the light had failed that dusk closed on the buildings he didnt know if he would see the dawn because he was second to the principle a body lay on the paving at the base of the giant block that was the sail where in excess of ten thousand souls lived and it was unreported many who lived in the disparate towers of scampia with a population of seventy thousand souls walked close to it as the shadows lengthened but were careful not to see it the rats had drained the pool of blood later with darkness they might start on the cheeks or the throat few of the residents of the third level of the sail knew of the first movements along the walkway it was a precaution heavy sacks filled with packages sealed in oiled waterresistant paper were carried away and an additional precaution the locks on the barred gates were checked and heavier chains used to fasten them merely as a precaution the clan capo who controlled that sector moved out slipped away went unnoticed massimo had waited more than fifteen minutes at the chaotic road junction at piazza nicola amore one of the pods for tunnelling the new metro system when he was flashed by a scooter he was given a helmet awkwardly he climbed astride the pillion and had barely achieved a grip on the mans heavy leather coat when it surged away massimo knew the statutes of the law he could have quoted the article that listed accessory to murder the scooter wove though rushhour traffic he didnt know whether he could control the feeling of acute sickness or whether he would fill the interior of the helmet with vomit castrolami came into the annexe lukas raised his head queried with his eyes castrolami said shes strong shes fine i have other surprises for her but shes good what do we have here the collator used his hands for the gesture the psychologist murmured niente di nuovo and shrugged seeming to squirm a little at nothing new and the ros men kept their heads down as if they declined to be part of the failure lukas said to himself to castrolami to anyone with nothing better to do than strain and listen to the gentle lilt of his voice the soft accent when he spoke in italian its what we do isnt it we sit around and we wait we live off sandwiches and fries and highdosage coffee and we tell ourselves that the break will come dont know from where and dont know how but we have to believe it will smoke too much eat too much drink too much caffeine but be ready to go because were not the people out with the kids at a parents staff meeting and were not at the goddam cinema and were not doing a fishing weekend upcountry so we wait and we believe itll come and if we get the break and if we get up front and we have audio contacts maybe even an eyeball contact it may get played out for a week or be settled in a halfminute a few words that foul up or do the business we hit the break running and we cant say were tired or that were coming off shift or that were going into a meal stoppage and because of all that were the privileged few whats best my small insignificant opinion is that were not in armies and we dont have a big picture to fulfil or generals breathing on our shoulders were anonymous and unsung and we dont get to stand in a line for a regulation quota of medals we live in the dirt we operate in dark corners were accountable only to success or failure we smell and dont get back home or to a hotel room for changes of underwear and socks but theres no place id rather be and there are no people here that i wouldnt want to be with i hope we get the boy back that about wraps up the bullshit stakes apologies and all that one of the ros guys muttered bravo and repeated himself another slapped the stock of a weapon he was cleaning lukas had not in his adult and working life made a remotely similar declaration it was as if the boy the victim had released something trapped deep in his soul reached where no others had someone else folded his magazine tight and hit bravos head with it in simulated applause and he recognised that a sense of growing apprehension new and unlearned had driven him to make the speech and there was a short rippled clap from the collator and the psychologist apprehension he cut it before it blazed he doused it castrolami dry asked you do that talk most days every morning in front of the shaving mirror the quip bogus was ignored are you quitting win or lose doubt ive anything else to do suppose not why did you say that stuff seemed a good idea lukas grinned you wait for the break whats the puzzle you dont know where its coming from but the chance is that it comes gerald seymour the collaborator he was asked by a voice now detached the face in shadow did he want food it hurt eddie to speak it meant he had to suck air into his lungs which expanded his ribcage and the bones that might be cracked his throat was dry his lips grotesquely misshapen his voice was a croak i dont thank you no there was no reaction no indication of softening and a degree of kindness or offence that the offer was refused eddie couldnt read the face high above him he was unable to judge whether the chance of food meant that his hope of survival was greater or less did they bloody bond was it a last meal being ordered he couldnt control the rambling of his thoughts which bounced pinballs in a machine home immacolata work the guys in the house her again pains in his chest and head curry in the afghan the knife or the pistol immacolata some of the thoughts jumbled and without process were comforting others wounded he didnt understand why the man salvatore stood over him watched him should he have accepted the food did refusing it diminish his lifespan by a day an hour five minutes or did it make no difference he had said he didnt want food because he wasnt hungry seemed a good enough reason to turn it down his throat itched seemed rubbed raw eddie wheezed please id like water you would like water please yes please did it play well if he grovelled should he not stand upright for himself eddie didnt know whether he should be cowed or whether he should goddam show some fight there was no one to tell him he thought he needed to earn respect and wouldnt if he bowed scraped slithered i want some water you want water bring me water would he be kicked was there any more shit left in him to be kicked out he saw the shadow turn and it was gone from the doorway the darkness was falling a light came on down a corridor and he heard running water well eddie had a target a new aim might not live might not hang on and cling to the pulsebeat but he was looking to achieve respect what a man wanted the tap was turned off a light was switched off the feet came back down the corridor and across the room then the shadow shape filled the doorway eddie looked up at the shadow thank you he coughed for bringing me water thank you the shadow moved a bucket swung the water came in a wall slapped hard into eddies face and drenched him it was in his eyes his ears up his nostrils and down his throat his lips smarted and he feel sharp stubs of pain from the grazes on his face the water puddled on the floor round him he expected then to be kicked and tried to curl himself up so that the soft parts of his body were better protected but no kick came he thought he would hear the maniacal laughter of a man demented there was none more movement in the doorway eddie dared to look the man salvatore bent his knees slid his back down the door jamb then pushed his legs out his trainers buffeted eddies knees but it wasnt a kicking salvatore sat with him a second cigarette was offered held up in front of his eyes and eddie nodded it was put between his lips there was a brief flash from the lighter and eddie sucked he could hear distant occasional traffic and a cacophony of barking dogs the smoke climbed his thoughts were sharp now as if theyd been tempered on stone and the moments when he had bounced them juggled them were gone he had learned a truth a man had total physical control over him could snuff out his life as easily as he would let go of the little lever that kept the cigarette lighter alive yet the man was vulnerable eddie reckoned that the water thrown over him and the cigarette between his swelled lips were signs of earned respect if you want to talk eddie said ill listen there was only silence and he could hear the rhythm of salvatores breathing and eddie heard also the dogs bark again raucous as if a pack hunted they had frightened away the rats which scurried to holes the dogs circled the body the rats and dogs fed well round the rubbish bins at the base of the sail the rats had made a meal of the blood and the dogs soon would use the body as a toy a mastiffcross was the pack leader had that dog been a pedigree a pure neapolitan mastiff the symbol of the most fanatical tifosi following the citys serie a football team in the glory days when diego maradona had lit it it would have been pampered not running free among the rubbish bags of napless most deprived rione it would not have gone close to the corpse sniffed it then worried at its clothing and taken a leg in its jaws this animal though born to a mongrel bitch retained many of the mastiff characteristics it weighed in excess of seventy kilos and lifted the man with ease the beasts in its pack attempted to join in tugging at the other leg the arms the head and strips of clothing the struggle for possession moved away from the refuse bins and the body was carried through scrub towards the viale della resistenza the dogs howling barking whining yapping and dragging what their teeth held the mastiffcross couldnt lose his pack the game progressed it didnt wish to chew the mans flesh but it was sport to have smaller dogs compete for possession bones were broken joints dislocated but the sinew gristle and muscle held the body together they were in the middle of the road the big dog still had the leg and ten others had a grip on the arms and the clothing the body seemed suspended a metre or so from the tarmacadam they tugged growled snarled and a cruising police patrol car swerved to a halt the observer said i cant fucking believe what im seeing the driver said if you want to throw up do it out of the car they watched for a full minute the noise grew as the mastiffcross was unable to assert its authority over the pack and the game was played out noisily traffic was backing up behind the police vehicle the ambulance called on their radio would be there within minutes not that a paramedic was going to be of any help to the poor bastard being pulled apart backup was coming too the observer said the big one thats a mastiff on the leg it was used as a fighting hound in roman times against lions its a guard dog now possessive obstinate its fucking big what are you telling me are you going to put the man and the dog in the ambulance or are you planning to tell the dog to let go of the man shoot it shoot a mastiff thats like shooting maradona himself shoot it with a handgun shoot the fucking thing the observer used his beretta r to fire four mm rounds into the dogs head before its grip on the bodys left leg loosened the others had slunk away an ambulance came and the body was removed from the pillion seat over the shoulder massimo watched the ambulance pull away and the headlights caught an animals carcass spread out on the road beyond it in deeper shadows a group of dogs had gathered and massimo could have sworn they were whining the road was still blocked the scooter jolted as it mounted the kerbstones and ploughed through the oleander that grew wild there then again when it came down on to the road at the far side of the dogs body the township of scampia had been built immediately after the earthquake of november that had killed more than people injured some ten thousand and destroyed the homes of three hundred thousand money wasnt a consideration the finest architects available were employed on creating a heaven for the dispossessed scampia rose from wasteground massimo had been born the year that the first blocks were laid he had been twelve before he was driven past the great complex and shown the ludicrous size of the sail he had been back twice since then once with a school party on a field trip to examine modern demography once because a pretty shop girl lived there his last journey to the jungle of concrete and heroin had been seven years ago he was and couldnt have hidden it terrified to be on the viale della resistenza the scooter braked the engine was cut shadows moved he thought himself encircled and the streetlights close to him were dark he presumed they had been broken so that trading was easier a finger jabbed at his chest then his helmet he lifted it off and it was taken from him the finger pointed and he made out an ebony black opening in a grey wall he was told how many floors up he was going and given the number that he should use the name of salvatore to get through the inner gates the beat of massimo working for his uncle was between umbertos office and the palace of justice and there were excursions to visit clients in the gaols of poggioreale and posilippo twice there had been visits to the head of the borelli clan which had taken him and umberto to novara they had stayed two nights in a decent pensione he had not till that day had to make the big decisions in life to go right or go left destra o sinistra he had been able to hide behind the enablement of justice every man and womans right to professional representation now facing the black pit of the opening he was at the roads fork it was of course about fear what was he afraid of going into the crowded stinking hell that was the poggioreale gaol who was he afraid of the old woman dressed only in black with the wizened face and throat the bony hands the suns cancer scars on the skin what was he most frightened of her he couldnt quantify it it existed the glance and brilliance of the eyes denying age the withering contempt in her voice the touch of her fingers and their rap upon his skin when she gestured he wouldnt have told another human being about it not umberto or his grandmother the fear lived he could remember each word she had said at what time it should be done and how the body should be disposed of during every trial when a member of the borelli clan was before a court massimo walked from his apartment across the pedestrian piazza with a capuccino in his hand and a sweet pastry a sfogliatella and he would cross the patterned paving where the witch had said the body should be left he carried the sentence of death that would put the body there and guilt made him shiver he headed for the darkness he left behind the scooter and its rider a man loomed out and blocked his path massimo stammered the name he wore his suit every day that he went to work he wore a suit sometimes silk sometimes cotton sometimes mohair and a shirt with a tie and good laceup shoes he didnt think he possessed any clothing that would have made him feel unnoticed here he was let through and a mobile call was made he thought he stepped on a syringe and held a handkerchief over his face against the smell but he had more fear of her and went on up the steps and remembered word perfect the message she had given its a very grave situation dottore any situation involving criminality and a threat to an innocents life is grave umberto the lawyer pursed his lips seemed to feel genuine pain again these wretches are using me as a conduit i follow the paths of the law and do my best to save a life i seek no personal advantage im above suspicion with no guilt in this matter dottore the wretches who are using me predict that the english boy will be killed tomorrow is immacolata borellis testimony so important the prosecutor didnt answer an answer was not yet required he revolved a pencil in his hand and waited for the speech to continue a sip of water was taken the pause was allowed to continue for a beat or two as the messenger i want only to help is the testimony of the borelli girl so valuable i hear many things in confidence as a legal practitioner im told shes disturbed has psychological difficulties she has an incomprehensible hostility towards her mother and siblings i see an unreliable witness a troubled woman with a misplaced sense of grievance against her relatives i also see an innocent in desperate circumstances whose life may have only hours to run if dottore you could see a way to issuing some public statement to the media stating without equivocation that immacolata borelli will not give evidence against her family and that those members of the family recently arrested are to be released without charge i believe i can save this young mans life as a messenger you understand the prosecutor had taken no notes he was aware of course of the need to prevaricate delay and not to deny but the lawyer would be as well versed as he was in the tactics of obfuscation and diversion he thought a dance was played out elaborate and choreographed but a doomed dance for all that his thoughts drifted he remembered the dance his wife had seen the dying swan set to a cello solo by camille saintsaens inspired by the poem of that name by the english milord tennyson and designed first for anna pavlova to perform a century before it was a good image the dying swan dottore we are professional opponents but we are also defenders of justice you as much as i must have serious misgivings about the process of collaboration too often the evidence is unreliable and selfserving immacolata borelli no doubt believes she can escape scrutiny of her own actions by concocting lies about her family perhaps also greed drives her the more lurid her accusations the greater the rewards that the state will drop into her bag collaboration makes for bad law i have one thing further to say dottore and it involves the image of the city we love and cherish if gabriella borelli and her sons do not go to court it will not be noticed beyond the circulation area of mattino and cronaca if the english boy dies reports of his death will go round the world and our city will be denounced as a dangerous hellhole is there something dottore that i can take back to those who use me as a conduit of information the prosecutor laid his pencil neatly beside the blank sheet of paper his hands went across his mouth as if for prayer he reflected had his career not taken a path towards making judgements on which freedoms depended what might he have done with his life he could have gone for wellpaid management of the electricitysupply company safe and honourable employers he could have practised corporate law in milan or venice civilised places he could have forsworn responsibility and owned with his wife a hotel in the mountains he could have been valueless he thought he had respect for himself and prized that achievement to him it was of paramount importance he said quietly and with equally false sincerity we are all grateful my friend for the efforts youre making on behalf of the innocent i want you to know that i shall reflect on the substantive points youve laid before me and i hope youll have an opportunity to urge those in contact with you to avoid precipitate action i do not rule out an accommodation its difficult but not impossible i appreciate what youre doing if necessary ill go to rome next week to raise questions of priority with the minister thank you my friend when the bastard had been shown out and escorted from the building the prosecutor stayed by his phone dusk turned to evening and it didnt ring salvatore stood over the boy there was no light and he could see only the outline of the body but he could hear the breathing and smell the boy he broke the silence that had been long lonely there were other men outside the main door on the walkway but none inside those who had been hurt and who had taken revenge were gone he needed to talk what do they call you at your home in your family how do they call you salvatore didnt know anything about the season of spring had not noticed its start six months ago or the blooming of small flowers without a sense of romance or fantasy he would not have seen that question what do they call you how do they call you as a mood change as if he had come from the darkness of winter why should he wish to know such a thing about a boy he was shortly to slaughter in forcella he wouldnt have asked or in sanita he wouldnt have asked if fangio had been with him or if he had come from gabriella borelli and flowers played no part in the life of salvatore il pistole and he had never in his life picked or bought any to give to a girl if he had given a bouquet to gabriella borelli she would have laughed in his face and maybe slapped it he didnt know whether his own parents were still alive or had been buried and had needed flowers maybe there would be flowers at his own funeral because he would not be taken alive to rot in a cell and maybe kids would throw flowers at the hearse as it passed he didnt see that asking such questions weakened his resolve to kill and if he had been told he would not have believed it they call me eddie just that its what they call me eddie where is the home of eddie many thousands of people lived inside the sail and many tens of thousands in the other towers around it but quiet had fallen which heightened his isolation the need to talk was an itch that had to be scratched in the country what is in the country fields green fields villages built of stone with churches and a river through the fields and cows we do not have fields green because it is too warm and everything is built in concrete and we do not have cows but we have buffalo and we have to kill many why are the buffalo killed they have poison he heard surprise a smear of confusion from the shape on the floor how do they have poison it happens there is poison ridiculous where is the poison why are the buffalo killed the buffalo make the milk for the mozzarella cheese and they have poison so the cheese cannot be eaten and they are killed enough where is the poison from too many questions why is there poison for the buffalo to eat you ask too much it is enough he kicked out he caught the boy on the hip and the jolt went up through salvatores ankle and his knee and right to the joint in his pelvis the boy did not shout or whimper but seemed to wriggle further from him salvatore thought he had shown weakness by kicking eddie but he was angry he had wanted to talk he had asked in innocence where the boy came from and had said in innocence without thought that buffalo were killed because the cheese made from their milk was poisoned and he had been questioned salvatore il pistole was not questioned by any man he could not have said they are poisoned because we the clans have killed the ground with toxic material from which great disposal profits are made and the ground is poisoned for generations to come and the poison is now in the blood of the buffalo and the milk for the mozzarella is contaminated we spread the poison so that we could make money he could not say it instead he kicked again he heard the quiet and felt the aloneness it is a good place the village eddie the handler beppe was told by his line manager to bring to his office the recent package from the agent deltafoxtrot he retrieved it from his safe and carried it along the high echoing corridors of the building knocked and was admitted the line manager said whether he was taken to the window and thrown out therefore murdered whether he was in flight and crawled out in an escape attempt and fell whether he has determined to take his own life to avoid capture and the rigour of interrogation i dont know whatever hes in the mortuary of the hospital in secondigliano and in due course well find some women to claim him and show suitable grief this evening we have no more use for him we dont admit to ownership or knowledge of him because we dont need to safeguard that intelligence source his past film can be sent to the relevant officials there is a carabinieri officer marco castrolami at piazza dante he should be given the films and told that the camera was sourced at apartment on the third level of the sail he should be assured that this material reached us only this evening and has been transferred to him directly without delay we will answer no other questions about the film beppe the death of an agent whether by murder accident or suicide is sad it leaves emptiness and creates humility tomorrow is another day take it thank you he put it into his leather bag hitched it on his shoulder and went off down the wide high corridor symbol of an age of power he didnt know that a life depended on the package in the bag that swung against his hip the priest had told her she was sitting in the seat eddie deacon had taken when he had come to the church of san giorgio maggiore she didnt know the priest well had seldom confessed to him before she had gone to london she had known better the one who had fled under armed guard to rome who had despised her and her family two of castrolamis men were on the door one inside and one out and another was at the side entrance to the sacristy two women were at the altar arranging the flowers and they would have seen her come in but hadnt acknowledged her their backs to her know nothing see nothing hear nothing immacolata thought castrolami three rows behind her was playing with her the priest said if youve come to me for the churchs praise of what youre doing youll leave with empty pockets i the church have little interest in your conversion to legality society in this city embraces criminality which feeds half of our population provides work and opportunity is enjoyed i hazard the opinion that the majority of neapolitans take pleasure and pride from the reputation of their home as the centre of the western worlds most successful criminal conspiracy the reason for your conversion after so many years of benefiting from illegality is not important to me you denounce your family you seek to imprison your mother and brothers to earn their enmity for the rest of the days you will all breathe gods air and reconciliation will be denied you even on a deathbed your family is destroyed but that doesnt mean forcella is freed from its criminal burden outsiders will use these streets as a battleground while they fight for supremacy over insiders who believe they are the natural successors to your family equilibrium is broken and i will be called upon for many funerals it will be a time of great danger for the old and young who live here your actions will create no respite and you will have on your shoulders until the day god calls you the weight of responsibility for the life of the boy who came with his love to find you all you will have as solace is a principle those are the complications you face the potholes in the road you have taken but i admire your determination to walk along it the example you set cannot be countered by sneers or contempt and cannot be ignored immacolata may god go with you they prayed together hunched down for a bare halfminute then she stood up straightened her skirt tugged down her blouse and pushed her hair back from her forehead she did not look again into the priests face and did not shake his hand facing the altar she crossed herself then turned at the door castrolami asked do you want to do it no answer but a firm nod her hair bouncing on her neck he said i cant predict the reaction she gave him a cold smile showing him her authority he wondered then at that moment and as the evening settled on the via forcella how eddie deacon had thought of love when he had stood with her right well get this fucking circus on the road if i grab you dont fight me if i run run with me they came down the steps of the church past the twin chips where the bullets had nicked the stone pillars they turned to their right two of the men those from the front entrance walked ahead of her each with his right hand hidden under his jacket the one who had watched the sacristy door was behind she didnt know whether he would have his pistol exposed or secreted castrolami was half a pace behind her at her right shoulder immacolata allowed her bag to swing with the rhythm of her hips it was as she remembered it nothing had changed she saw the barbers shop the hardware shop and the shop where cheese and fresh milk were sold she knew what pizzo each paid because she had determined the amount she saw the shop where the wedding gowns were sold and the suits for grooms and principal guests then the bakery no one inside shopkeepers and customers caught her eye and no one called to her abuse support or a greeting a scooter came towards her bouncing on the basalt blocks the riders visor was up and she recognised a young man who had been at school with her whose father had been killed by hers it swerved past her men played a last card game in the light thrown from a bars window but did not look up it would have been easier if insults had been shouted eggs or tomatoes thrown it would have been a triumph if there had been a shout of support what she was doing was not acknowledged she did not exist as a living human she passed many she had known since childhood none cheered and none spat at her she assumed that the mobile phones were in contact and a network of messages rippled the length of the street and off into the side alleys that a footsoldier had been called out a handgun sent for lifted from a cache unwrapped and stripped of its protective cover a magazine hurriedly loaded she saw a man hosing down the cobbles where his stall had stood and through the open door of a van boxes of unsold fish lay among melting ice she had often bought octopus mullet and bass from him but he didnt see her she saw lights at the front windows of her grandparents home she assumed by now they knew of her walk down via forcella but they didnt show themselves on the balcony the cars waited walking briskly not running as if afraid but not dawdling with a fools conceit they had covered some hundred and fifty metres in two minutes castrolami pushed her without dignity through a back door and had barely slammed it before the vehicle had pulled away it wove down the street headlights flashing to clear a way and skirted the square in front of the castel capuano then went fast on to the via carbonara in three minutes there might have been a gun and a marksman in five there would have been she thought she had sent a message of her resolve and that she had killed eddie deacon the boy wouldnt speak and had been kicked again so salvatore did i am from the city from the old city i do not know about fields or a village or where there is a river that is not a sewer ditch i do not know about cows and i have never been into the country and towards the mountains where they keep buffalo i do not know it here i am here because it was decided to bring you to this place i hate it my home is the old city it is where people follow me many people follow me and give me respect i lived on the street eddie i worked the street the via duomo and the via carbonara it was best on the via duomo because tourists came to the cathedral and fewer were on the via carbonara because the castel capuana does not have many tourists i start at nine years i finish the school at nine years i am a spotter at nine years i spot for tourists who have a bag loosely held or a nikon camera that is on a shoulder strap or a rolex watch at nine years old i am not strong enough to get a watch or a bag or a camera but i am the best at spotting at ten years old i am the leader boys with more years do what i say i am commander and i sell on what we take from the tourists at eleven years old i am taken by pasquale borelli the father of immacolata he chose me he could have had a thousand kids our word is scugnizzi but he chose me i owe everything to him i can read and i can write and that is because of pasquale borelli i am not a kid from the gutter and that is because of pasquale borelli i am a person of standing in forcella and in sanita and that is because of pasquale borelli i think that after his eldest son who is vincenzo i am the most important i have more respect from him than giovanni and silvio i am the favourite of gabriella borelli and she is among the most admired women in the clans in the city everybody has respect for me if i had wanted to i could have been married with immacolata you understand that both pasquale and gabriella borelli have sufficient respect for me to give to me immacolata if i had wished it did i want her i think she is not good in bed and i think she has poor skin on her face i did not want her i am trusted by them and i am trusted by carmine and anna borelli the old people they do nothing if they have not talked first with me do you know that the kids in forcella have my picture on the screen of their mobile phones i am a person of importance all the police hunt me and all the carabinieri special teams and the prosecutor i am in naples in the list of the ten most wanted i have that status and that respect i have a place in the ten with a russo and a licciardi and a contini there are many days when i am in the newspaper in the newspaper is my photograph the journalists write about me i read everything that is written about me in the newspaper they call me il pistole in the newspaper many times i have been on the front page of cronaca and of mattino and they talk about me on the news from rai i am a celebrity in this city i am more famous than a film star or a singer or a footballer they say i am the assassino you understand that who has no fear and who does not give mercy we say senza misericordia i have killed more than forty men i do not know exactly how many men because it is not important to me i am the killer the expert at killing and i do not have hesitation in killing when i have the instruction i will kill you eddie it is not personal it is not because you sleep with immacolata borelli who has fat ankles and bad skin i will kill you when it is ordered by the clan i will not kill you because i hate you but because it is ordered i will not hurt you i am not your enemy but if i was ordered to kill you and did not i would lose respect i must have respect he heard the voices at the door then heard it opened salvatore turned away from the figure bound on the floor lying in the darkness it had been a nightmare massimo thought himself in the corridors of hell with no end to their length they were a labyrinth it had taken him an hour might have been more to travel the extent of a walkway set between reinforced doors barred windows dulllit corners refuse heaps washing that was draped and still stank across his route he did not think the nightmare complete or half consumed he had climbed the staircase and at the top had been searched fingers had prised into every pocket then he had been stripped almost bare and those fingers had gone inside the orifices of his body then he had been allowed to dress and had had to scrabble in the near darkness at his feet to collect what had been taken from his pockets examined and dropped he had gone through the first barred gate there had been three more searches as if no message had been passed ahead on the mobile phones three more times he had been questioned then stripsearched then the fingers had been in his mouth and in the anal passage and lights had been shone into his ears and up his nose and the sac under his penis had been lifted there had been more delays at more barred gates he thought contempt was shown him he was left with little that preserved dignity each time he was allowed to progress he had taken time over dressing knotting his tie and shoe laces he feared for his life he saw the silhouette of salvatores head he had seen the man several times before always a halfstride behind gabriella borelli massimo had thought the man who hovered at gabriella borellis shoulder to be a psychopath probably medically certifiable he thought his own feet in the expensive handmade shoes of soft leather were on a treadmill that the motor went ever faster and struggled to keep up the momentum if he did not he would fall and he didnt know how to jump clear of the treadmill he saw the body on the ground strained his eyes and detected cuts on the face what did they say salvatore murmured the voice of a dreamer a sleepwalker he remembered the equation of fear the cells of poggioreale or the anger and retribution of the old witch massimo did not lie did not dare to he stuttered through the message he had been given by anna borelli now in her eightyeighth year and realised that what he had said was understood by salvatore and by the figure bound on the floor near his feet salvatore nodded as if the matter did not concern him but the figure twitched and he heard the intake of breath massimo thought himself damned he said where the body should be dumped damned he had a law degree he owned an apartment in the most select district of the city he drove a highperformance car and already could count his assets in hundreds of thousands of euros yet he was reduced to ferrying instructions was the boy sent from a reception desk at the excelsior hotel on the via partenope damned for ever he ran he wasnt stopped he ran as fast as he could and the barred gates seemed to open ahead of him he was not searched questioned delayed or hindered by men with mobile telephones he careered down the staircase syringes and glass shards crunching under his shoes and broke out into the night the scooter took him only to the edge of scampia he was dropped where the via baku made a junction with the via roma verso scampia he was left at a bus stop the evening air played on his face and he waited for a bus alone and believed he had killed a man they clustered round the screen those who worked the annexe had prime positions but others from the operations room peered over shoulders for a glimpse of what the video showed he had thought it a tipping point when a contact had been made but had been wrong this was the collator gave the commentary lukas hunched beside him that is the great nose to everyone except him and his face thats him we have one photograph of him in ten years and that was with dark glasses its excellent he has that territory of the sail he has been a fugitive for more years than the photograph has existed incredible the image on the screen was monochrome and the walkway poorly lit the figure of the man identified as il grosso naso came from under hanging washing slung across the walkway and was clear for a matter of seconds in profile then was gone under more draped sheets typical of those bastards the spies they wont share they have a camera on him another visitor far from his home ground it is il camionista the old man of forcella and his rheumatism is bad again so the grosso naso and the camionista do business carmine borelli is off territory he will be nervous he will not be there with a position of strength and he will have come to ask a great favour for which he will pay lukas reckoned that in other company the old man would have used a stick but not there a stick was weakness and frailty a younger man walked two three paces behind him but he was led a cloth tight round his upper face blindfolding him no trust theyre strangers in the sail i cannot see all his face but i know from the walk from the mouth from the shoulders and the hips that carmine is escorted by his sons killer it is the hitman it is il pistole salvatore there is a file fat on him when he goes to prison if he is not shot dead by us by another clan he is locked up for the rest of his life he is to be condanna allergastolo he will never again feel grass under his feet hear birds sing or swim in the sea they were all here but the spies wouldnt tell us until their man was dead and we couldnt blunder into their precious world the file the fat one says there are many murders proven to salvatore usually with the beretta p usually with a man on a scooter to take him to the target and away and there are many more homicides with him as first suspect he has no parents no family no woman he has only the pistol and his dependence on the family of borelli he would want to be killed and that is the only reason not to kill him lukas craned forward far beyond that point the tipping done he understood that he saw an opponent he did not use verbally or in his mind a word such as enemy in his world emotion and rancour were put aside he saw an opponent brought under the draped washing shuffling past the lens then taken under more washing they went on through the films and did fast view for the departure of big nose the lorry driver and the pistol the collator muttered more names but without enthusiasm as if they had no part to play many images went at jerky oldmovie speed across the screen cigarettes were lit more coffee was downed their attention again was jolted and silence fell lukas could smell the sweat of many bodies and his own of socks and underclothing not changed and his own men came down the walkway and gestured dismissively women went indoors abruptly and kids fled it was as if a route was cleared of obstruction and witnesses lukas saw salvatore again and the boy he was within touching distance lukas could have reached out and let his finger brush the screen the boy went slowly as if exhausted and hurt his feet did not have good traction on the walkway and he was mostly dragged his shoulders were down lukas knew him because he had spoken with the man at the hotel and with the man who sold fish the fish yes the fish presented to the annexe at piazza dante the swordfish was in a freezer tray in the kitchen area of a local restaurant it would be thawed and cooked if there was a successful outcome and would go on a rubbish heap if there was not fuck the fish he had spoken to both men and knew what clothes the boy had worn when he left the pensione in the morning and when he had met the eye of the fishseller lukas had demanded of them what shirt trousers and trainers the boy had worn he saw them in the blackandwhite image on the screen and the hood lukas had only once been hooded in his time as an instructor at quantico after hed come off the hostage rescue team and before hed got himself lodged with the new critical incident response group he had been one of the fbi instructors doing closequarters battle training in simulating the storming of a building they had needed a tame prisoner and it hadnt seemed fair to allocate a rookie he had done it he could remember still the smell and taste of the sacking his panic at his inability to breathe deeply and the fear of what would happen next he had had on ear protectors when the storm came blank rounds and thunderflash grenades he had been hustled out the hood had been lifted off and no one seemed to have much time for him interest was in the bad guys who were wasted and the good guys who were heroes i assume thats eddie deacon lukas made his first contribution it is he has been beaten he has if he still lives he is on the third level of the sail building in scampia it is not my expertise but i would suggest there is no more difficult place inside the state from which to extract a prisoner lukas said i dont intrude gentlemen i dont push or impose my opinions im here to give help if im asked for it castrolami said they would go in five minutes not a suggestion but a demand lukas knew them now by their familiar titles the bustle broke around him he had little to take nothing of consequence other than his laptop some that he knew of made occasional trips into baghdad or bogota for the fbi dod or a contractor and travelled with their bespoke flak vest blood and sterile dressings lukas had never bothered neither did he have manuals to refer to because everything he needed and half a ton more was in his head but he regretted that he had no fresh socks or underwear in the rucksack they had discarded their given names were identified by those their colleagues used for them the tractor the engineer and the bomber were loading big kitbags there was no more talk of military survival kit waterresistant socks small strengthened hacksaw blades and fishing hooks lukas had learned how they would operate at the first wave of an ros assault the ingegnere would take off a door or blow out a window for entry the bombardiere would put in a handful of xm stun grenades the flash and bang gear the flash was up to seven million candela and the bang decibels the trattore would lead the storm guys inside lukas had seen it done in practice and for real sometimes the practice was fouled up but the actual thing went a treat at others the practice was perfect and the actual a disaster what the tractor the engineer and the bomber did was a definition of the old inexact science but so was lukass work lukas hung back in the annexe he heard castrolami talking in the operations room the small team which would fit into one large minibus would travel to scampia ahead of a larger squad only when the initial group was in place would the numbers for securing a perimeter be deployed lukas understood it was about security about maintaining secrecy he thought it a harsh world in which police officers and paramilitary men couldnt be trusted might have a place on a gang leaders payroll a last brief act was played out in the annexe the psychologist announced defiantly that he could monitor observe contribute from the operations room the collator gave as his opinion that he was better employed close to his big computer and his archive lukas felt that the reputation of the sail lay on them he was not invited neither was it suggested that he should find a quiet corner and get involved in basketweaving he wasnt accused of imposing himself lukas was on board he thought and it suited him well that he was barely noticed as they hiked out of the annexe and skirted the side wall of the operations room the far side from the banks of screens and the illuminated map castrolami was given a brief bearhug by a superior while others slapped the arms and shoulders of the ros guys in encouragement lukas was offered no warmth no good will and flitted out apprehension burgeoned he had seen the face in monochrome of his opponent had been there so often looking into a face and wondering which welltrodden path to take to consign the face to the rubbish heap had been there so often was concerned again that the magic moment was dulled god let it not be said that almost he was bored with all the faces there was a driver and the drivers escort big men armed with filled holsters and belts that sagged with kit there was a communications kid looked no more than nineteen who carried a steel box and lukas saw that it was chained by the handle to his wrist there were six ros and castrolami a pecking order existed as they loaded into the minibus the driver and his escort were together the communications kid and castrolami were side by side the link and the decisiontaker there were the men who would make an entry if it came down to the desperate uncertainty of a storm and there was lukas who was without status and quantifiable expertise and had been there so many times before they left piazza dante lukas sat across the aisle from castrolami and the communications kid a map of the sail was spread out across the investigators knees and he used a pencil torch lukas gained an impression of the enormity complexity and threat posed by the building he did not wish to talk he turned away from the map and stared out of the window at the passing streets it was he reflected a city with some of the finest architecturally designed churches in christendom which contained some of the greatest works of art sculpture and painting ever created there was the beauty of the bay behind them and the crude majesty of the mountain sophistication intellect culture and glory encircled the minibus all he had seen of them was the view over the rim of the crater when he had received the warning of hidden and violent danger there were no such contrasts in baghdad or in the mountains and jungles of colombia or on the great plains of afghanistan the cafes seemed full and the bars and outside two restaurants he saw people standing on the pavement in what apologised for a queue waiting to be given a table it was so goddam normal castrolami pushed the map of the sail towards the communications kid left him to fold it he asked lukas when we get there what do you want to be as close as possible what do you do first i try to make some calm lukas said its not always easy but its a good place to start castrolami looked into lukass face and a slow smile spread do you have that buzz in you the adrenalin pump is it going riding towards the location not knowing what youll find and lukas shrugged then said droll worst you can find is a dry house a dry house is where they were its the one theyve quit sheets and blankets a hellhole for a cell food and mountains of cigarette butts but gone thats a dry house i dont often get sex dont often fire a handgun and im a smalltown boy from a trailer park with a mongrels pedigree so i guess riding towards the location is sort of ecstasy orgasm and cartridge discharge yes the pumps going a bit do we have a good environment or a bad one he looked out of the window again the road was clogged with traffic and a horn blasting wouldnt have helped or a siren or the lights the driver wove looked for weaknesses in the jam and the ros guys didnt talk but worked on their kit lukas said if it isnt a dry house and if the boys still alive the locations about as shit as it gets but then none of them comes easy a big deal you have the girl nailed down none of them comes easy gerald seymour the collaborator when there wasnt much worth saying lukas usually stayed silent castrolami seemed tight knotted and would have had cause they had left the city and climbed on to the plateau area inland to the east and the dense housing was behind them the ground opened scrub rubbish abandoned construction more scrub more rubbish more halffinished projects and more scattered lighting the traffic blockages of the old city were back down the hill lukas saw the towers he was near to making progress calls on his mobile but not yet he was not one of those who went off radar and only called in when he had success or failure to report but he wouldnt call unless he had hard information at ground force security they paid his wage and put a roof over his head if he didnt have them he might just have to ship out and go back to charlotte a trailer park a wife who might tolerate him if he was around to do handyman jobs and a son who would ignore him hed eat doughnuts and fries drink grape juice maybe hike some carolina trails and worry about a bureau pension that had been cut short in contributions and would keep him light on cigarettes he wouldnt walk away willingly from his employer and he would call when he had information the towers speared up and alongside them there were big shoeboxes laid on their sides way back when he was young in the bureau and there was a shortage of personalprotection guys for an overseas detail he had taken a short straw and had gone in the directors entourage to a terrorism conference in west berlin there had been a chance of a day across the other side theyd been bussed through the wall and he had seen the forests of towers on the outskirts of the eastern sector lukas could live in an attic apartment under the eaves off the rue de bellechasse in the heart of a great old city or he could live in a cabin up high in a treeline like the guy at ruby ridge had he couldnt have lived in a tower block in east berlin or one out on the darkened flatlands east of naples castrolami had hold of his sleeve and tugged at it then pointed at the map the pencil torch caught the outline of the big block and castrolami pointed out through the window it was massive it was indeed a sail the towers now seemed dwarfed by it the lights from windows etched in its shape there seemed to lukas to be a hull to the building then what was almost forward decking and then twin sail shapes rose climbed high they were close now what castrolami had not asked him could he maintain the same hunger for his work as in the past when his reputation was made did he have the same fascination for the techniques that would undo his opponent inside the minibus there was the murmur of the comms kids voice as he spoke into a button microphone his metallined case was open and dials were lit twice a separate microphone was passed to castrolami and enveloped in his ham fist as he spoke there was the scrape of weapons being armed he thought the tractor was the leader the bomber was the joker and that the worlds roof would have to collapse before the engineer contributed a contested entry was a disaster lukas knew it they would all know it he thought the place would be from castrolamis plan like a gopher warren of tunnels and entries exits climbs and descents like the ground squirrels used the navigation was done by the drivers escort who would lean back and whisper into castrolamis ear he had said himself that he needed to be as close as was possible to the hostage and the hostagetaker and he didnt think it needed saying again he had seen a sign crazily askew for the via baku he wondered what the connection might be between an asshole corner of southern italy and the capital city of azerbaijan but doubted it mattered another sign told him they were on the viale della resistenza the torch flashed on the map and the pudgy finger pointed to the location they were slowing lukas felt the tightness in his gut always there when the action came near castrolami said quiet but breathy it is unlikely we will be met with armed resistance but it is possible if we are stay close to my back you do not show anyone your voice your accent damn yankee we may be confronted with passive opposition crowds abuse heckling manhandling stay close to me hold on to me i expect barricades steel gates blocks to slow us the ingegnere will deal with them and for hostile people we have the bombardiere we attempt speed but we do not know what we find and we do not have the luxury of time for reconnaissance what do you wish to say im here i can give advice if its wanted i dont impose castrolami punched his arm a good hard jab made it hurt and it seemed to lukas a gesture of affection might have been respect there was no call for respect the minibus came to a stop they had rocked on to a pavement and the weight had broken a slab the roll had barely stopped when the trattore had slid back the side door and was out there was a stampede lukas had never jumped with a parachute he had been on an aircraft from which men had jumped at night over a targeted farm where a contract worker was reported to be held what had lasted with him was the sight of the dispatcher by the open hatch as he booted the guys out and into the void the drivers escort had that job half of the ros guys then castrolami and the comms kid the rest of the ros guys and lukas the escorts fist caught him as if he was the runt of the damn litter threw him forward and he cannoned first into a big backpack then the one with the boltcutters damn near speared him with a handle he steadied himself against castrolamis backside and most of the wind was squeezed out of him he gasped he was in his fortyeighth year did that matter maybe not the statistic but he didnt run on pavements or do gym sessions and guys with a childhood heritage of trailer parks didnt play tennis hed never had the time or inclination to learn golf and mountain hiking was more a dream than real he felt old he sucked in air felt old feeble but there was no young bastard pressing up against him why could ground force security rent out the services of lukas a hack who had seen better days because negotiators and coordinators were happy to work a stateside beat or to be in london or berlin but declined postings to mosul jalalabad or medellin any goddam place where there were shit flies and a building like the sail and a wretch who was looking at a knife or a pistol they were running except the driver and his escort who were left behind lukas didnt play at heroes was separated from castrolamis back by a cigarettepaper thickness he saw past the big shoulders the shadows in a dark doorway lukas thought then there was brief negotiation a few seconds two or three exchanges and the shadows were done and the way ahead was clear there were pounding feet and he imagined the heavy boots encasing waterresistant socks and more boots behind him which was as welcome a sound as any the tractor had a flashlight in one hand turned it on in the other he held a handgun he wore a vest and had a machine pistol slung on a strap looped at his neck his chin jutted no debate negotiation or discussion the tractor led them through as if he was crossing a waterfilled ditch or rode a sand berm and men made way for them lukas was given no explanation but he factored that their entry on to a staircase was not impeded that was a little victory minimal but a victory of sorts the smell of the place hit him the flashlight used intermittently guided him up he would do the best he could had no more to offer it was as if a signal had been given from the base of the stairwell and sent on up to the floors above the flashlight caught men and women children with them they were dressed the smaller children in night clothes and carried cases and bundles one child had a puppy clasped to his chest and others had prime toys he sensed the mood of evacuation as if a deck was cleared there was no eyecontact between those on the stairs coming down stumbling under their loads and those going up bowed under the weight of the kit two groups not acknowledging each other lukas thought he did dirty work it was work that decent people should not be asked to perform he went up the stairs and castrolamis shoulders bounced in front of him eddie wondered where the noise had gone salvatore talked they pay me well because i am the best i am expert and i am valuable i have accounts in banks in switzerland and in liechtenstein i do not know where that is there is another account in andorra i have never been there i am twentyfour years old and i have much money and many accounts he should have heard noise the keenest sounds he had heard had been when he was brought up the staircase hooded and when he was taken down a long corridor and voices had been muffled behind doors and windows with televisions and music men had shouted women had laughed kids had squealed and dogs had barked yapped he had heard less when he had run and realised that the corridor was a walkway an aisle between boxed apartments there was a knife on the table near the door close to salvatores hip and he had a pistol in his hands i can buy what i want i can go to any shop in naples and i can buy anything i want jewels for a girl i can buy them i want a suit i want shoes i want a car i have the money in banks they pay me because of my worth they want me the borelli family they can have me but they must pay i think i have a million euros in accounts and perhaps it is more one day i will go to the coast not italy one day i will go to france they have told me the family has of cannes and nice and i will go there i think i will have many girlfriends when i go to france because i will have money and i can buy anything he could not recall so clearly the sounds of the walkway when he had fled along it before he saw under the washing the barred gate closed eddie then had been on his toes and running at speed despite the stiffness in his legs knees and hips from being tied down and the burden of the chain and ankle shackle he had heard sounds then shouts of pursuit the gasp of his breath doors slamming in his face a kids obscenity as he charged past a window and there had been the loudness of the television in the room where he had taken refuge now he could hear nothing it was as though quiet carpeted the air round him salvatores shoes slithered on the flooring and his voice droned in the accented english as he played with the pistol and aimed it at points on the wall eddie thought there was in the eyes something demonic or manic or lunatic something that was plain bloody mad he realised it he was the only audience the man had maybe had ever had i will go to france to the mediterranean and i will buy an apartment a penthouse with cash and i will go to a showroom and buy a car and again i will use cash in the morning i go to the bank and i sit down and i authorise transfers from liechtenstein and andorra and other places and then they go to get my money from their store in the basement and we fill a suitcase with my money and then i go to the realestate office and to the showroom i will find new friends and new girls maybe this is in one year or three years and maybe it is tomorrow after i have i will go to france i speak good english the best yes i will speak good french i have many enemies here but they will never find me when i have gone to cannes or nice there i will be unknown and i will have much very much money i have the money because of what i do well i kill well the shadow spun on its heels and the feet came close to eddies face and the shadow crouched a little of the light from a window thrown up by a streetlamp orange caught the pistols barrel and rested on it it was three or four inches less than six from eddies forehead he stared at it and kept the focus of his eyes on the needle sight at the end of the barrel and could see the finger just on the bar protecting the trigger and the finger slipped from the bar to the trigger stick he wondered then if his bladder would burst whether the urine would squirt into his trousers fill the groin make it steam hot the finger moved from the trigger he did not know if the safety catch had been on or off what had he thought of had had a modicum of seconds to reflect had not thought of his parents or his house friends or anything noble had not thought of immacolata had worried that he would mess his trousers had hated the bastard and anger caught in him i think when i have gone to france that many in naples will remember my name the kids will women will they will remember that i was a big man in forcella and in sanita and here in scampia and that i had respect no one in naples i promise it you would ever dare not to give me respect i will be written of for many years in the cronaca and in the mattino and i will let them know that i live go to germany and send a postcard go to slovakia and send another the police do not have the brains that i have and they will not find me i will be written of in the papers and they will put my photograph there because i have importance and i have respect i will never be taken do you understand me i will not be taken alive eddie was still lying on his side he had lost sensation in his hands from the tightness of the plastic at his wrists and he thought the welts at his ankles were raw and his vision was through the slits of his swollen eyes and his lips were broken and the bruises throbbed and he hated and felt the growing anger the man salvatore circled him held the pistol in two hands and aimed it down but the shadows of the fists were too dark for eddie to know if the finger was on the bar or on the trigger and the man laughed cackled eddie thought salvatore didnt hear the silence around them himself he didnt know why the quiet had come the first gate on the walkway of the third level was chained and padlocked washing had not been taken off the wires some of it still sodden and some of it nearly dry the wet sheets towels and shirts clung to their faces as they went forward it was as if the evacuation was complete nobody came and nobody moved no men from a clan no families quitting all gone faded into the evening and most of the lights with them the clothes and bedding hung out to dry threw long shadows no radio had been left on and no television they were wary of the silence and the tractor went on the balls of his feet lukas saw looking past castrolami a cola can lying abandoned on the walkway a few yards short of the steelbarred gate that had chains and a heavyduty padlock securing it the cola can was in the centre of the walkway he was in baghdad there was a street emptied silent where kids didnt play men didnt stand on steps to smoke and talk there was a street with a sprite can tossed on to the path and the patrol would use that path there was a private first class of an airborne outfit and he was point on the patrol and the sprite can was in front of him and he was near to it there was a first sergeant leading the patrol walking with lukas doing acclimatisation and the mans yell had damn near shredded the clothes and the vest off lukass back and had stopped the private first class dead in his tracks it had been explained an empty street no people no traffic was the telltale sign of an ambush a trashed can was on a path and grunts always did it always kicked a can that was in front of them a can could hold a quarterkilo of plastic explosive and a detonator operating off a tilt switch could fire it when it was kicked and it could take a leg off the point man and the balls off the one following him and maybe some eyes lukas burst forward he shoved castrolami aside he sprinted as near as he could he went past the engineer and the bomber he caught the tractors arm he held it stopped him he panted couldnt find a voice to speak he pointed to the can they went on and lukas again had taken his place behind castrolami and each of them stepped with care round the can until the last ros guy squatted down then went on to his knees and shone a torch into it lukas had turned and could see him under a kids towel then the guy stood up and kicked the can to hell it rattled away the warning he had given his caution for a can was not ridiculed he had respect the engineer took big boltcutters from his bag opened the blades and put the loop of the padlock between them flexed and used his strength and the padlock broke apart the gate was pushed open by the tractor beyond it the washing hung thicker and made a fog it could not be seen through lukas knelt he could see under the washing and the walkway stretched to a darkened infinity and had no horizon nothing nobody moved they used the long tunnel from the palace of justice to bring immacolata to the poggioreale gaol she could have gone by car and entered through the back gates but when offered the choice she took the walking option and did it briskly with a good stride rossi and orecchia at either side of her the deputy prosecutor was in front the carabinieri liaison officer behind the air around her was close dank from the dribble of a water leak and was ill lit prisoners were brought by small bus from the court to the gaol and the fumes hung trapped immacolata did not show relief when they reached the steps when a door was unlocked by a guard when fresh air wafted over her she was told by the deputy prosecutor how long she had she shrugged and answered that she did not need that much time the gaol was not yet shut down for the night and the clamour inside it filled her ears she had no doubts she was led to an interview room at the door she was told her brothers had not been informed that they were to meet her the door opened they had their backs to it there were four officers in the room and cigarette smoke rose towards a single barred light she saw that giovanni lounged had tipped back his chair and silvio was hunched forward his head resting on his joined hands they were manacled she was led round the table and recognition broke shock from giovanni confusion from silvio she smoothed her skirt and sat down two of the officers flanked the table and two were immediately behind her brothers immacolata said im here to tell you in person because im not frightened of you that i intend to continue collaborating with the state and to give evidence in any criminal trial that follows the information i provide i will not be deterred and big hands rested on giovannis shoulders he spat bitch youre the walking dead and the boy you fucked will be sliced i wont be deterred and my decision is irrevocable ill be a witness in court whatever is done to those who have been close to me silvio did not have to be held and his shoulders shook he blurted i loved you you were my sister i did whatever you asked me i never told our mother i drove you to nola why have you done this to me please why to break the power of our family ill put that power under the heel of my shoe and grind it to dust whatever happens my mind will not be changed she stood she was the queen of the moment and the audience was completed silvio sad inadequate a worshipper wept into his hands she started to move round the table and giovanni lunged the hands held together by manacles were in her face the fingers outstretched and the nails exposed as a cats claws would have been one nail caught the tip of her nose and as the blood welled he was thrust back into his chair he spat but it fell short of her then a hand was in his hair and locked his head still silvio sobbed i thought you loved me i thought you were my friend giovanni snarled theyll slice him slowly theyll send you his dick keep looking over your shoulder and know that youll be found she left her escorts would have hustled her out but she went at her own pace she heard outside the room as inside giovanni fought an unequal battle and silvio howled orecchia ask rossi what did caesar say and heard rossis answer at the rubicon river as he prepared to ford it and march south he said iacta alea est the die is cast she cant turn now she understands the consequences she understands and has cut herself free of them orecchia said god be gracious and protect us from principles she didnt turn her head and tell him shed heard what hed said and didnt think of eddie deacon but of nola and a cemetery they went past the agents door easy to recognise there was a light on inside and the room seen through the broken door and the clean window was wrecked it had been searched systematically and then lukas thought trashed in vengeance he knew now what had happened to the agent about the fall and the dog that had been shot lukas was big on agents assets and he recognised their value more than most in any city he worked or any strip of jungle or up any goddam mountain he would ask about intelligence assets and probe for what they were able to bring to the table it was not for him an outsider to criticise the unwillingness of an agency to share well not out loud and not for quoting he could have said that the agent might be alive might enjoy a glass of a local wine in a safehouse if his material had been shared and hed been lifted out he could have surmised that many agents had been lost euphemism for slaughtered because theyd been kept in place beyond the sale date the agent had cheated those who had come to his apartment had plunged from a window and so denied them the chance of the beating the kicking the burning with cigarettes maybe the use of electrodes and waterboarding for cheating them they had wrecked the place lukas could see also the cables that hung from the ceiling and dropped down from the cavities in the plaster where they had been hidden the hole through the wall and the place where an attachment for the hook that held a washing line in place had masked the exterior lens he couldnt have sworn to it but he thought that castrolamis arms moved saw the jerk of the elbows and reckoned the investigator had crossed himself if the boy survived if lukass best effort was sufficient if an apartment further up the walkway was not dry then that life would be owed to the asset who had died sobering yes they went on quiet fast and wary but not stampeding each took fistfuls of the washing and dragged it down thought little of dumping it in the dirt at the side of the walkway sometimes it was womens underclothes they snatched but there was no laughter they hustled forward momentum with them lukas thought he liked serious men that they were good to be with when advancing towards what his jargon called the termination phase then not even outsize knickers or a frilly imitation lace brassiere made for humour the second gate was locked with a large lock box welded to it more delay lukas thought the gates barricaded against them were the sign that they were tolerated for an evening here on this level alone the limit of that cursory negotiation at the bottom of the stairs but they had no automatic right to access again lukas did not have to be told boltcutters could do chains and a padlock but not entry through a locked gate he wondered what they would use the engineer had turned crouched and unhitched the straps of his bag eyes must have met the engineer told him that it would be t an abbreviation for an impossibletopronounce formula name that ended in trinitramine a compound of nitric acid and hexamine with a blast velocity of metres per second and lukas had not heard him speak before he had known enough technical screwballs in his time and doubted they were different people from those who stood on platforms and noted train numbers or had binoculars to see the registration on aircraft fuselages coming in to land and taking off the engineer worked fast and his description of the power he was manufacturing fell on lukass deaf ears it would be a crucial moment along the empty corridor was an apartment wet or dry if it was wet the hostage target was there and a psychopath a lunatic had to be talked out of killing him what counted was to get close by covert approach there was nothing secret about a blast of ttype plastic explosive horrible stuff colourless and in the engineers hands about half an ounce less than a golfball then a stick detonator the wiring the waving of them back taking shelter in doorways the playing out of a cable and the clips going on to a box and if the apartment was wet they did not know which was its door we go through we look and we find i speak i ask for the boy and i ask for surrender maybe the boy gets killed maybe im shot at then its your chance you want it different the way it is thatll be fine by me lukas took the chance offered him and hit castrolamis arm not as hard as he had been hit but with what force he could manage they waited for the engineer to count them down eddie boiled you know each time i do a hit it is the next morning in the newspapers and i buy them they write so much about me they make up much i had thought of calling some of the reporters to meet me and tell them that they must be exact and tell truths they should treat me with greater respect i read all the newspapers the morning after and they carry the conferences of the police and they talk about me i think they do not make much money the reporters they would be as easy to buy as police are i earn in one week what a policeman makes in one year they have nothing i have money in the bank the anger burned those who knew him would not have recognised eddies voice and the crack of contempt in it maybe you dont what do you say what maybe you dont have money in the bank i do i know it gabbled but irritated eddie said maybe theyve taken it all fleeced you what is fleeced what you do fleece is steal they open the accounts for you the lawyer did for gabriella before her it was for pasquale borelli the lawyer did what they instructed theyd have fleeced you did you ever see the statements they cannot send them i was told the statements it is a million euros near if there was ever money there which is doubtful now itll be gone i have their word their word like your word a word is a guarantee in fucking naples i bet you what do you bet i bet you that your accounts if they ever existed are empty i reckon you were easy to trick to deceive i reckon youre just some animal they employ then put back in a cage theres no money i bet it he was hit across the face salvatore had crouched low over him and used the barrel of the pistol as a whip the blow made more blood opened the wounds that had almost sealed and scraped away more skin it hurt bad he thought he wanted the fucking show on the fucking road wanted it over he was finished with lying trussed cut and bruised in pain his ribs throbbing and helpless like a goddam chicken going to slaughter no sirens no goddam help what made it easier like a mouthful of codeine paracetamol or ibuprofen even like bloody aspirin was that in his anger he had challenged the bastard on his money had hit the open wound had put salt on it wanted it over and the triumph preserved the victory was proven by the wild slashing strike on his face fuck you eddie said in his face he had pushed himself up ignoring the pain he sat upright he looked into the wide eyes could see them in the slack light there was silence and he didnt know why wanted it done he heard the scrape as a lever on the pistol was moved thought it the safety heard the weapon cocked metal scratching on metal could almost smile saw the barrel wobble as if the bastard couldnt hold the aim steady needed it finished heard the explosion maybe the front door of the apartment on to the walkway had not been locked because it opened and light flooded in a window flew into the outer room eddie smelled smoke the door swung hard slowed and flapped then was still but open he was pulled up because his ankles were fastened he couldnt move he was dragged to the door propelled into the walkway and could feel the pistols barrel a pencils width against the back of his neck where the hair reached to eddie was a shield he saw them and fifty paces up the walkway wreathed in smoke the frame of the barred gate which had been open when he had run now it was half through a window doors near to it hung askew unhinged windows were out and washing was stripped or shredded the men were through the gap all huge three leading black suits black masks black weapons he was wrenched round he looked momentarily up the walkway in the other direction and a gate there was fastened shut the men had stopped weapons were up aimed eddie felt salvatores breath on his neck beside where the pistol barrel dug they had come and about fucking time and all anger gone a blast in his ear deafening too fast for him to react blink a puff of concrete dust came off a wall near the gate high and the men scattered one on his stomach one in a rightside doorway and one in a left with a rubbish bin for further cover more men were behind them eddie saw one large wore a suit incredible yes a goddam suit and there was a small guy beside him who looked old out of place and crouched and eddie was dragged back inside they had come what had changed it was that eddie wanted to live because they had come almost overwhelmed him the sight of the men in their black kit the guns and masks the quiet around them and the emptiness and a man in a suit and a man with short peppercoloured hair and a lightweight windcheater more behind them eddie trembled then his ankles were kicked hard and his feet went out from under him he was felled collapsed and couldnt break the impact he wriggled towards the far wall he cursed himself for having provoked the bastard to anger didnt think it smart hadnt known they were coming he wondered who they were what sort of men had come who had sent them what they knew of him the silence hung heavy the quiet settled he wanted to live wanted nothing more the door to the walkway slammed shut there was scraping as the table was dragged across the floor then wedged into the outer doorway chairs used as props to hold it it was the older man he could picture best i have had a short eyeball on the target hostage echo delta delta india echo he is held in an apartment of the sail building third level scampia a naples suburb initial indication is one hostagetaker armed unlikely to be a covert exit point nothing by way of escape is negotiable target seemed from brief sighting at approx forty paces to be bound had facial marks of abuse but did not appear to have lifethreatening injuries taker my opinion is unstable and unpredictable time to go to work out he closed the call a waiter came to the table with the wine list and roddy johnstone waved for it to be given to his guest you all right duck you look a bit pale got a ghost showing up the guest asked he shook his head it was a decent restaurant close to his office and it was usual for him to bring prospective clients here and convenient halfway on foot between grosvenor square and berkeley square for most he asked his guest who would be talking detail in a contract for the security of an oildrilling programme in georgias taribani field zone fourteen in block twelve which could be worth fifteen million american dollars over ten years to select a wine and choose from the menu for both of them he apologised for having been distracted by the call he went outside he stood on the pavement and the doorman lit a cigarette for him he had seen lukass name come up on his mobile had allowed him to talk had not interrupted had allowed him to ring off had not spoken a word thoughts clouded his mind he saw lukas saw a waste mass of concrete floors and walls saw men with armed aimed weapons saw a young man who had gone off to get his girl back had walked as an innocent into a snakes nest had been beaten and had had a gun barrel against his head and he saw an idiot who would have pledged because they all did that he would not be captured alive and again he saw his man lukas he flicked the cigarette towards a drain cover and watched it gutter not something he would have wished to do but not something to be avoided he dialled he did it because a kidnapping was involved and a boy had been brought into the extended family of ducks world he would have cheapened himself had he not made the call then there he had no shame in admitting to himself that he cared he heard a call ring out and heard it answered he said mrs deacon mrs betty deacon yes its roddy johnstone from ground force i wont beat around this is a holding call the position is that ive just received confirmation of what we call an eyeball it means that my man has seen your son seen him physically at a distance of about forty paces hes in reasonable physical condition mrs deacon were a long way from the end of this road eddies held by an armed man in a housing complex the authorities are there and my colleague is with them hes very good at what he does mrs deacon as soon as i have further news ill give it you i shall hope for the best and i shall hope for it very soon but were in uncertain times goodnight mrs deacon and my regards to your husband he saw them too winced and wished hed lit a second cigarette he went back into the restaurant everything all right his guest asked he smiled probably perhaps about as all right as it can be now what have you ordered for us immacolata had been given pizza in the prosecutors office she was not privy to events he had been called out by his assistant three times left his inner office gone into the outer took the phone and kept his voice at a pitch subdued enough for her not to hear what he said she sensed that finality approached and that she was not invited to share it each time when he came back he had a deepercut frown on his forehead and then as if he remembered its presence would force a smile and attempt to wipe anxiety she ate the pizza and drank aerated water she thought in truth they didnt believe in her resolve she cleared her plate and emptied the bottle immacolata said and did her sweet warm smile you need not be concerned for me my mind is made up and its not for changing he looked at her quizzically as if he didnt yet understand her i work in this room signorina for six days out of seven every week for a minimum of ten hours every day i strive after successes but they are rare and elusive to arrest a de lauro or a lo russo or a licciardi or a contini classes as success maybe once a year we take one because of you the evidence you bring i have been able to close down an entire family not an individual but a whole clan does that then defeat the criminal conspiracy no but it halts the advance in my terms to halt an advance to stop a flow of vesuvios lava is a success such are the crumbs off the table from which i survive if you capitulate signorina success is snatched away and the advance irresistible continues i wont capitulate you will not say now at this moment that the life of the boy matters more no say it to me again please no his life doesnt matter more thank you she stood up and let the pizza fragments fall from her lap on to his carpet and desk she brushed the lap of her skirt then took a little handkerchief from her bag and wiped the ring on the desk that the bottle had left she touched her hair she faced him im ready for my next test yes its a matter of giving proof wheres eddie in scampia in the sail at the mercy of your fathers killer salvatore controls him will you save him well try to could i save him of course and the price would be my evidence he shrugged he didnt have to give her his answer she walked towards the door it was as if she was an actor on a stage caught in a pool of light and she knew the lines would not be spoken again the questions and doubts would not be reiterated she would not be thanked she did not expect gratitude and she thought humanity what had been a variety of love had been squeezed out of her existed only in a padlock abandoned on a bridge she said i am ready to go to posilippo now to give you proof and serve you the crumbs success can we move i hope your best is good enough for eddies life its only advice not control yes of course lukas answered i give advice and you obvious are free to take or ignore it its the way friend it always is he saw a wry smile spread on castrolamis face almost lukas grinned as dry as the skin of a tomato left out in the midday sun what they sold in a supermarket and castrolami asked what would be the first item of advice lukas squinted looked up the length of the walkway two ros guys including the one they called franco the sniper the franco tiratore had gone up to the fourth level had tracked along it then come down and were now hunkered in front of the far barred gate on the third level the washing in front of him had not been torn away and it was only as he lay on his stomach that he could see the doorways and windows the one door and the one window he thought the section of walkway was now evacuated if it wasnt if some had been determined to stay behind they must take their chance there should not be the distraction of bawled commands or requests on a bullhorn for people to get clear always difficult to make the last few shift they had a sick relative who was bedridden a dog and four cats a stick insect and a snake a programme was coming on the television that they never missed they feared theyd be looted once theyd gone what now to advise he lit a cigarette the tractor had just started one and the engineer had just stubbed one out from what he had seen and heard in the hours in the annexe off the operations room at piazza dante he knew a little of the men around him they talked girlfriends and sex wives and arguments kids and schools mothers and food and the psychologist made mobile calls to his partner maria spanish and was concerned about the progress of her phd thesis while the collator was bothered that his son was on leftside defence in the cafe soccer team for the undernines and should have been on the right castrolami had made one terse call not more than ten seconds duration to a woman hoping her work had gone well and stating that he would not be eating with her that evening lukass only communication had been with roddy duck johnstone and had been short brief factual and without emotion he had no one else to call he never called his mother amy and never called his father because he didnt know his name never called his onetime wife martha who knew him only because a lawyer in charlotte out of a smart office block on the city centres west trade street sent her a small donation on the first friday of each month a couple of hundred dollars that had once been to look after the kid and had never been cancelled she didnt acknowledge it never called his boy dougie who did real estate out of premises on north tryon street there was no one he knew other than duck and that was professional who would give a damn whether he called or not not even the artist on the riverbank or the man who had the grocery off the rue de bellechasse or the woman who sold him icecreams outside the museum or the waiters in the cafes would care greatly if he returned to their territory or not he wasnt maudlin it was the way he wanted his life to be he didnt have ties that tugged at him he was only bonded so he was told to his work he lay on his stomach with his upper body jutting out of the recess of a doorway he could see the distant shapes of the sniper and his partner the door they focused on and the window and he could see half of castrolamis shoulder lying in the filth of the walkway would screw castrolamis suit what advice was on offer the walkway was secured at both ends so no advice was needed on sanitising the perimeters of a designated siege area nothing was negotiable on free passage out for a hostagetaker and his victim the renunciation of evidence would not happen an exchange witness statements ditched in return for a life given was not an option clemency for a killer unlikely leniency improbable right now i dont have advice to give lukas said i can tell you what i want and what i dont want tell me i want to stabilise the atmosphere cut the tension get it stable make it so tedious that everyone wants to go to sleep like its taking the drama out of the show the hostagetaker what i have on him hes young and hes used to immediate acceptance of what he says and hell reckon himself saying it vulgar the dogs bollocks he sees himself right now as a central figure in a big theatre we have to get him down to the ground and calm him bleed the adrenalin out of him then keep him cool thats the stabilisation hell threaten to kill because he has no other currency to chuck at us cool and calm is what we aim for the priority for the boy is to have him walk out in one piece agreed we do an assault by your people and were on uncertain ground may win may lose an assault is lastchance stuff the hostagetaker wheres your priority for him taken alive most of them ones fitting his profile want what we call policeassisted suicide its easy and quick and they have a delusion about a legend being born alive and hes just another number in another cell block rotting and forgotten alive then is my aim point do you do timetables try not to i dont have for ever lukas understood a deal already in place part of a walkway cleared a clan leader ordering his people to stand aside on this limited patch of territory and an understanding that the lawandorder guys do their work hurry look for nothing else do not disrupt get lost a deal that called for a long spoon supper taken with devils not a nice deal one that stuck in a gullet a deal that was understandable itll be over by dawn lukas said he had the feeling he was regarded as an oracle had done little to diminish it and that he knew solutions to whatever problem areas were thrown up but hostage negotiation hostage rescue and hostage coordination were not exact sciences some people lived their lives on certainties down to a level of decisiontaking on whether to replace with a bayonet or screwfastening bulb he knew of no two cases where hostages had been taken that exactly mirrored each other but there were basic patterns enough for him to make up expertise on the hoof what castrolami had not asked him did he have the same excitement as years back did he find the processes repetitive and was the light in his eye dulled i have that feeling and the shout came down the walkway hacked into the night air itll be finished by dawn what did he shout lukas strained to hear the voice better and castrolami had a hand cupping his ear he heard the obscenity the feet came back across the floor and eddie was heaved upright he stood tottered was supported the man was at his back and wriggled in his hips and pelvis but stayed close to him eddie felt the belt looped round his own waist then buckled across his stomach they were a single item siamese one hand was round eddies chest above the belt and the other held the pistol against his neck his feet from behind kicked he could manage a hop and went forward more hops and the space between the inner and outer door was crossed halting in english at his ear they do not answer me they see you they will answer me what to say nothing eddie bit his lower lip it was broken where his teeth closed on it and swollen to double size and the pain brief was pure his ankles were trussed his wrists too and he could only move at a snails pace he was driven forward and god he wanted to live he prayed silently but the bitten lip moved and they would not shoot he could feel the body of salvatore close against him and they were indivisible the door was pulled open eddie blinked there were gaps between the sheets towels shirts underwear and dishcloths none of them stood eddie did eddie was exposed he looked left saw the barrels of rifles and felt that each aimed at the centre of his chest above the belt below the arm and zeroed eddie reckoned on the place where his heart beat bloody pounded he didnt know if he could hold his bladder his body was twisted a quarterturn and he looked to the right and up the other section of the walkway light reflected back from the telescopic sight mounted above the barrel and another blacksuited figure was prone beside the marksman and had binoculars the binoculars aim and the sights and the barrels were not on eddies chest but his head he could feel the pressure of the second head salvatores against the back of his scalp and the forehead moved made little motions bucking his own forward and back eddie read it a rifles bullet would enter and exit would not hit one of them but both and the movements of salvatores head dictated that the snipers aim fluctuated between their two skulls from the other direction up the walkway the rifle bullets would go through one chest one ribcage one set of lungs or one heart then into the other prayed again dont let the bastards shoot realised it the bastards were the marksmen a fucking jumble in his mind and the marksmen were the risk to his life not the man hugging him close and holding the pistol to his neck the voice boomed in his ear had stayed with english and eddie didnt know why i walk out i walk past you i walk from the sail when i walk i have the guarantee that the whore immacolata borelli the voltagabbana the turncoat retracts evidence you have a halfhour look for the time on your arm half an hour in half an hour no promise of retracting evidence he is dead believe me dead you have a halfhour you decide eddie shivered the cold was on his skin but the warmth of the night made him sweat it was a new cold and it came from fear the rifles he saw never wavered in their aim and were on his head and his chest and he was perhaps forty paces from them and they would have a killing range of a quarter of a mile he sucked in great gasps of air would have collapsed if the arm and the belt had not held him a man among them pushed himself up he had been flat on his stomach went to his knees then used his hands for leverage it was the man who was slight and inconsequential who wore a creased dusty shirt and crumpled trousers and who was unshaven and had the short peppercoloured hair his face was weathered and worn and had the texture of hardship he stood at his full height then arched his spine as if to get stiffness from it salvatore breathed hard on eddies neck beside the pistol barrel the marksmen had not shifted nor a bigbodied man who wore a suit and held a pistol loosely uselessly in his hand eddie watched the man who stood saw him cup his hands across his mouth as if that was the way to be heard do they believe me a shrill whisper in eddies ear then the firearms blast near his ear and the hair above it was scorched the stink of firing on his skin concrete dust came down and settled on his face eddie blinked squeezed his eyes shut opened them again and the rifles were still aimed at his head and chest i think now they believe me the man had paused as if at an interruption now he stood his ground and called to them my name is lukas im a friend of eddies parents not a policeman id like to help he twisted a little lowered his head and murmured to castrolami below him this is advice if you ever incline to hostagetaking and a jerk says id like to help my advice is to shoot him and fast lukas had that mischief in his face but then his head rose and it was gone he was sober sombre im here to see if i can help he shouted throwing his voice down the walkway the mischief was off his face but it stayed inside him first time the mischief had taken root since he had been at the forward airstrip in the mountains beyond bogota and the captain pablo had asked for advice and it had been suggested that the assault team go in there was not much else in lukass life that pumped excitement the tip of a directional microphone lay in front of his trainers and by his ankle the comms kid took off his headphones and gave them to castrolami he yelled again would be good if i could help to sort this out and thats what i want to do if youll allow me because he now stood square in the centre of the walkway he could see far down it there had been an accident in the hanging of the washing so there was an avenue of vision for him he had manoeuvred himself into a position where he had a good eyeball on the boy and on the hood who held him my name im saying it again is lukas what im looking to avoid is anyone getting hurt and any way i can ill try to help prevent that what lukas saw every few seconds the hoods head moved and took the boys with it and he rated it as a hell of a hard call for franco the sniper to have a zero on the small piece of skull that was visible as a target and the bodies were locked together like they were in standup sex out in the yard at a kids party he didnt rate the chances of the sniper getting a clean shot and the pistol was against the back of the boys head and lukas could see in the available light that the finger was inside the loop and against the trigger bar most likely a shot to the head a killing shot would induce a muscle spasm through the body most certainly a chest shot whether fatal and into an organ or a wounding shot would set off a decisive twitch through tissue and ligament and it would go to that finger a spasm a twitch would be sufficient to depress the trigger bar wasted exercise they had taught the siegebusters at the quantico training unit to do a double tap in the head close range pistol if possible two shots to the brain might suppress a spasm i told you what i want i want it now you have twentyfive minutes you use time the voice came back reedy lukas thought the hood was exhausted god alone knew how long it had been since hed slept in a bed maybe not for two nights or three exhausted and hungry wouldnt have eaten proper cooked food exhaustion and hunger to lukas balanced out the hood would be irrational and unpredictable he would make mistakes and be subject bigtime to judgement errors they were the equations lukas worked on were what he knew castrolami below him beside him murmured we have a feed through the psychologist hears this he says that salvatore would dream of a legend was never taken killed with honour will already know that nothing can be negotiated and that he is boxed salvatore knows it he is a killer he expects to kill more important than anything to salvatore is the belief that woven into the legend will be respect the psychologist says lukas said i have his drift thank him what do you do what i try to do is get up close talk a bit get the pistol off the boys neck take it from there do you want to indulge the hood give him policeassisted suicide his legend or do you want to fuck him charge him convict him hear the key turn and lose it smell the decay as he rots and the years go by that is a better message than giving him respect harder to achieve but a goal just watch me just be ready as they say on a wing and a prayer he moved forward but slowly like he was the tide coming in short crabbed steps and he was gone from castrolami and the comms kid and was in a few steps separated from the tractor the engineer and the bomber lukas could see the boys face part of it there was bruising in rings multicoloured round the eyes the cheeks were scarred the lips grotesque and there were blood smears from a wound on the forehead and from the nose and more blood was caked where it had dribbled from the mouth the boy wouldnt be standing if he hadnt been held by the belt and the arm there had been just blind fear on the face when he had first seen it but there had been a change subtle like hope was born there were many burdens on lukass back and shoulders the one he liked least was that he gave little packages of fragile hope to hostages when he approached them he saw the increasing agitation on the hoods face and went slower he did short steps that were barely the length of his shoe if the motherfucker moved the pistol from the boys neck if the motherfucker moved his own head clear of the boys then he made an opportunity for franco the sniper to shoot with the beretta m rifle lukas reckoned through a x mm zeiss scope that the sniper would have a good view wounds and warts of the two faces it would be castrolamis call before the sniper fired and that was not the goal set he did not of course but he would have liked to offer more of his advice to castrolami would have stopped and turned and the advice would have been if a little guy who says hes just there to help ever starts walking towards you and youre a hostagetaker and has a decent honest smile on his face and looks concerned for you just shoot him dont hesitate shoot he must have reached close to halfway from the start point to where the boy and the hood were would have been about twenty paces from them lukas felt the crisis moment was on him the scream stop the pistol did not move off the neck and the heads did not separate a second scream stop do not come close at twenty paces lukas could be almost conversational you dont want me nearer im not coming nearer like i said im just here to help lets make a start im lukas and im not a policeman im a friend of eddies mother and father i want to help them and help eddie and i want to help you i want this to end with everybody winning its where im headed everybody wins you dont want me closer i dont come closer youre called salvatore yes good name the saviour il salvatore its a great name to have right im going to start doing some helping salvatore what do you need do you need some food we can get pizza up here you need water we can do water thats still or with gas cigarettes tell me the brand and i can get it the pistol hadnt shifted and the heads hadnt separated it was early lukas had time i will help you and you can trust me there were some of them dumb and stupid exhausted and hungry who believed they could indeed trust the little guy who came close and offered help food and drink and cigarettes and they either stared up at a cell window or were dead buried tell me what you want and ill get it for you he realised now many things clarity swamped the mind of salvatore the walkway was sealed at either end the apartments fronting on to it were either evacuated or locked and barred he had no freedom of movement was as a rat in a corner with teeth without anywhere to run he wondered at what stage fangio had slipped away on his scooter no mention made of immacolata and whether she would retract evidence no appeal grovel or beg for the life safety of the boy he was close against if he killed the boy eddie who had slept with immacolata and was her lover then he himself was dead maybe half a second after he had pulled the trigger he was dead was it his destiny did he crave death didnt know had no one to tell him didnt have pasquale borelli who had taught him to read write shoot and kill didnt have gabriella borelli to tell him whether he wanted to die be shot down and didnt walk behind her and follow the sway of her hips had no one was alone he had seen so many they didnt lurch back when shot as the movies showed it they fell they were like the cattle in the abattoir that the clan owned they subsided and they twitched chickens did they flapped mens muscles moved while the blood flowed the fingers fidgeted tried to catch dirt or the concrete on a pavement the vinyl tiles on a bar floor he had seen it death was frozen on a face that last expression laughing never happy never supreme never etched on to a dead face was at the last fear did he want it he saw a television cameraman who filmed and smoked then heaved the camera off his shoulder dragged a last time on the cigarette and threw down the filter it would be on the walkway near his head he saw two reporters and heard their laughter as if they were the latterday crowd in the piazza mercato when the aristocrats were hanged and maybe the laughter was about the filth of his clothes and the smell of his body and he saw children who stared blankfaced at the blood he didnt know how long his photo would stay on the screens of the kids mobiles one step more and i blow his head away salvatore yelled didnt have to not to be heard twenty metres away if he did if he squeezed the trigger he was dead a halfsecond later knew that realised it the voice was so calm because im here to help i need to know the type of pizza we can order and if the water should be still or with gas and the brand of cigarettes look were not in a hurry you think about it give me an answer when youre ready whats on offer is food something to drink and cigarettes take your time salvatore we have all the time you need and the face was so reasonable and it smiled at him he had no one to ask to tell him whether he wanted to eat and drink and smoke to die or to live and the hands of his watch moved couldnt be stopped three raids supported by arrest warrants in the via forcella a goodsized crowd watched as carmine and anna borelli were led out through the main door of the block escorted past the stall empty where the fishseller traded they didnt look fearsome anna borelli carried her teeth had not inserted them in her mouth and wore a pink night wrap over a white gown and had on fluffy pink slippers carmine borelli looked confused and his hair was wild he clutched his stick and wore striped pyjamas a police officer followed them with two overflowing bags of day clothes they had not been given time to dress because the police had feared a riot when they were taken away but it didnt happen no riot neither were they handcuffed two insults both hard to stomach to prompt no reaction in naples was to be dead irrelevant in an alleyway off the via tribunali the section running to the west of the via duomo the lawyer was arrested he fared worse than the old clan leader and the old brothel keeper he was handcuffed and the photographers of cronaca and mattino were there to poke lenses in his face he was ashen he wore the previous days socks shirt and underwear and had to hold up his trousers because he had dressed at such speed that he had forgotten his belt the crowd jeered because it was a sport to see a big man taken down he was headed now for the foul faecessmelling cells reserved at poggioreale for prisoners arriving late at night it was the ultimate insult to him that he was not ferried to the questura or to piazza dante but to a common cell near to the palace of justice behind the holiday inn that rose in the business zone of the city there was an apartment block that was a target only for the most successful to aspire to it was had been the home of massimo the lawyers clerk and nephew on a table in the kitchen area there was a fulsome letter of apology to his family of explanation to the prosecutor of pleading to his god he apologised for the disgrace bred from greed he explained the link between the kidnap of the english boy the borelli veterans and the hitman il pistole he pleaded that he should not be eternally damned for carrying a sentence of death one of the police officers who found him suspended from a skylight in a smaller bedroom by a sheet had had experience of hangings he said that the signs on the neck showed that the young man having kicked away the chair and choking had tried to save himself and failed weals at the neck showed the efforts he had made following his change of heart the net closed around a clan stifled its breath strangled it her mother spat at her gabriella borelli had been given an officers coat to drape over her shoulders but with or without it she gave no sign of cold no response from immacolata they had thought at the palace that she would lecture her mother in her conversion from the clans culture she did not she said nothing the tactic employing silence had been determined in the car that had brought her round the bay along the coast road and through the gaols gates the spit was on immacolatas cheek and her chin and she did not wipe it there was a table between them two women guards were behind her mother but immacolata sensed they would intervene only if there was a physical attack she thought them in awe of her mother rossi and orecchia were behind her her mother before spitting had used different avenues to demonstrate her disgust contempt for and loathing of her daughter the shame to the family of a collaborator the betrayal of her relatives the treachery of siding with the prosecutor against her own she had not flinched she had stared back at her mother had ridden the punches as a boxer did she had been taunted where would she live who would befriend her could she live a lie for the rest of her life did she understand what it would be to cringe each time on a darkened street if she heard a footstep behind her did she know how much bounty money her mother and father in joint enterprise had placed on her life did she understand that she would never be forgiven there was the spit then her mothers final throw you sleep with a boy you curl your legs round him you take him into you you fuck him and you kill him i never betrayed your father you took the boy into your bed and he means nothing to you you kill him it is not salvatore who kills him its you i love your father and i love vincenzo giovanni and silvio and they love me you cannot love the boy comes searches for you will give his life for you you cannot love because youre cold youre not a daughter you have the cold of a whore you dont know what love is what loyalty is the boy did youre cold not of naples you kill the boy its as if you fire the shot or hold the knife do you imagine that one of our family if there was love would turn away and condemn to death perhaps you fucked him like a whore does were cold you will never love youre not capable youre not your fathers daughter not my daughter youre not your brothers sister all of our family have warmth can love not you the proof of it you killed the boy her mother swung round did not spit again and strode to the door as if she was a monarch the two women officers scurried to get to it first and to open it for her they stood aside so that she could pass through immacolata heard more keys jangle in harmony more doors opened and closed in slammed timpani the distant trill of her mothers laughter as if she deigned to share a joke with her escort then the voices the footsteps the music of keys and the percussion of doors faded were gone her chin trembled they had set immacolata hurdles to leap she understood that she had cleared them all except this one here she had stumbled she looked at her watch had no reason to but did and saw that the minute hand showed five to the hour the watch was in a gold setting but discreet it had been her fathers present to her on her twentyfirst birthday one of many presents and had become part of her she had worn that watch in the telephone kiosk on an east london street when she had made the international call and in an east london park when she had met the enemy of her family and on a flight to rome and in a car that had carried her south and home it was five minutes to an hour and the time had no significance to her the watch was part of an old life she took it off opened her fingers let it fall to the concrete floor of the room that had been made available to them in the late hours while a prison slept she had been wounded and knew it deliberately immacolata put her heel on the watch face and killed it at five minutes to an hour rossi pulled a handkerchief from his jacket pocket unfolded it and without fanfare wiped the spittle off her face orecchia took her arm she left the watch behind her for a cleaner to find or a trustee prisoner as she had left behind a padlock on a bridge do we have long she asked not long orecchia answered she said where now she wanted to be taken rossi shrugged orecchia said it would be done she thought they humoured her because of what her mother had said she didnt know the importance of a watch stopped at five minutes to an hour he did not want food he did not want water he did not want cigarettes it was five times now that he had been asked if he wanted to eat drink smoke he yelled it back at the small man who sat crosslegged on the walkway nobody listened to him why did nobody listen in forcella in sanita men listened when he spoke he didnt have to raise his voice he could whisper and men would crane forward to hear what he said and others would hush those at the back if he was angry men were fearful if he made a joke men laughed i dont want anything its just that its a long time since you ate or drank salvatore myself i could do with a cigarette and anything except that you look at the time look the man had a gentle voice use my name he said its lukas what i always say is that a guys name is the most important thing he owns im lukas youre salvatore hes eddie i dont want to be hustled by time look at your watch all right easy all right can i say something salvatore the gun can the gun be moved from where it is eddies head youre tired course you are can you just shift the gun a little they frighten me guns do look at your watch see the time how about you move the gun and i look at my watch is that reasonable youre tired that situation your hand might slip maybe you have a hair trigger we dont want an accident look at the time he couldnt now see his own watch hadnt seen it since the man had come forward and offered food then sat and salvatore hadnt dared to move not a centimetre and the guns aim was on him the way his arm was across the boys chest and his own head was half buried in the hair at the back of the boys skull didnt allow him to see the face of his watch but now he heard the chime distant a churchs clock a churchs bell could have been the church of the resurrection he had passed on fangios pillion midnights strike if a player of importance a figure who was respected let a given deadline drift allowed an ultimatum to slip then face authority was lost could never be regained that is fair exchange salvatore you move your pistol shift it a little and ill check my watch listen friend all im here to do is to help he screamed he heard his own voice detached from it as if it was another who howled in the night a cats cry where is she where is her statement where is the retraction answer me the gentle voice was so reasonable and there was a shrug helpless from the small shoulders and the hands gestured it way above my level that sort of decision salvatore nobody tells me anything the jerks who make that sort of decision theyd have gone home long ago people like us are left out of bed no food and no water and no goddam cigarettes and therell be no decision from them till the morning comes better salvatore for you for me and for eddie that we sort this out ourselves and i can go home and eddie can and you can go get some sleep it was like honey the voice sweet and cloying and satisfying and he knew the deadline of an ultimatum had gone and could not be clawed back if he killed the boy then he himself was dead and he could see the light reflected from the scopes lens he couldnt clear it from his mind did he want to die he cocked the pistol scraped metal on metal and the sound echoed along the concrete of the walkway and filtered through the washing lines and the hammer was back he had no hatred of the boy he had no love for gabriella borelli or loyalty to pasquale borelli who had created him he loved the respect that was shown him a slow gathering smile came to his face but his stomach growled and his throat was dry and he craved to smoke and his finger tightened on the trigger stick squeezed on it the watch face was in front of his mouth and it looked as though lukas examined the time it showed and had difficulty in that light he murmured lips barely moving dont shoot dont respond you were asking me the time salvatore about five minutes past the shot was fired lukas saw the flash and the recoil of the weapon and saw the boy flinch cringe sag but he was held up by the arm and the belt there was no blood he knew that if a second shot was fired it would be a killing shot what a fucking way to live what a fuckawful job to have he had stood once in a corner of the board room of ground force security had been a day back from baghdad and had come out with a freed hostage and duck had led the directors in celebration drinks lukas wouldnt have been there had there not been delays at heathrow from the baggage handlers he had been sober and his employers had not one had quoted declaimed it a shakespeare speech their king harry on the eve of the battle and gentlemen in england now abed shall think themselves accursed they were not here not if the here was a mudwall village beyond the conurbation of baaquba likewise not if the here was a stinking foul dirtladen walkway on the third level of the sail bullshit and any rightminded person valuing sanity should have been now abed but it was what lukas did and was all he knew he had slipped out of that boardroom and doubted that any of them had noticed that he the cause of their celebration had quit on them he had the watch again in front of his face next time will be for real im not usually this much of a gloryhunter but i fancy its time to go and do some walking there was no answer in his earpiece he didnt expect it it was the side show it was the b flick the main event was miss immacolata and her denunciation and the boy was rated as secondary he could do what he damn well pleased he called forward i think i have that message salvatore you should trust me i am here to help and best for all of us if i am to help is that you give me trust watch me lukas stood he had seen so many men women and children with a knife close to their throats or wired explosives round their bodies or a pistol against the soft skin at the back of an ear he had seen mute terror on the faces of the old and the young and sometimes he had been far back from them linked only by a closedcircuit camera or binocular vision and a few times he had been close and they had seen him and the burden was goddam near intolerable then because of the dependence on him focused from their eyes as if he was a final chance maybe most of those people intelligent or stupid experienced in the world or innocents had been sideshow material or bflick fodder there were some hed lost and theyd had a halfminute of fame posthumous there were some hed helped to save and they might just have secured a full fifteen minutes in the limelight only an idiot without a life without an idea of a proper job without a bed would have been there midnight gone and the next bullet drawing blood and feeling the night cold in his knees what castrolami had not asked would he ever all these years in forget the basics that underpinned success lose the mischief and excitement and ever just get so simple goddam bored been there and seen it questions not asked were those not needing answers he flexed so damn tired not a long time left for the resolving of it folk in charlotte went up into the hills and hiked trails at weekends on public holidays and for their summer vacations they took cabins and the last morning there was a cutoff when the cabin had to be vacated and them gone forgotten no sign of them left behind lukas thought that by five before the dawn they would be off the third level out of the sail and driving away down the road from scampia he appreciated the agreement made through third parties between castrolami and the local bigshot player by first light the ros team would be gone and the dealers would be back and salvatore was either in handcuffs or dead and eddie deacon was either in a bodybag or walking free it wasnt a big window of time but more than sufficient for lukas to climb through what bothered him this time he cared about the target which was shit didnt do concern and emotion except saw the face and the fear saw the hair and the pistol barrel saw the eyes and the bruises and the lips and the swelling and the cheeks and the cuts he said it again pleasant like he talked to a friend a trusting one just watch me salvatore watch me very carefully he bent and pulled loose the knots on his laces then kicked off his trainers and used his toe to shift them to the side then he ducked down again and pulled off the socks he couldnt remember how long hed worn them and smelled them he dropped them on to the trainers and stood in his bare feet just as i say salvatore keep watching me he did it as a palming motion slipped his hand past his ear and extracted the gear moulded and fleshcoloured he hadnt expected castrolami in his ear or wanted it and he admired the investigator for not burdening him with queries hesitancies the palm went into the pocket of the lightweight windcheater then lukas shed the coat and tossed it on to the pile he had never done a strip before but the tiredness ate him and he sought to push the matter on force it his shirt went next unbuttoned taken off discarded watch me salvatore watch me all the time and have trust in me im here to help eddie and to help you he did everything slowly nothing suddenly his hands went to his belt and unfastened the buckle he was not selfconscious never had been almost because of the way his mind worked he shared the agony of selfdoubt inflicted on the hitman in seminar talk it was policeassisted suicide but in any canteen in paris berlin new york or london it was suicidebycop it was the easy way lifted the decisiontaking out of the equation had somebody else do the dirty stuff didnt have to climb on to a parapet on a widespan bridge or go up a crane ladder and feel the wind swaying it as he went higher and didnt have to sweat on whether there were enough pills in the bottle and hed come to alive and vegetablebrained and easier than turning the firearm on himself feeling the ugliness of the barrel in the mouth and the foresight in the roof above the tonsils all about selfdoubt and all about the selfishness of a bastard who thought of himself only most certainly did not think of the poor guy police marksman who blew him away then went on to trauma counselling it was a fucking awful place to be and a fucking awful job and lukas had always said he would fight bareknuckled any man who tried to take it off him he did the zip on his trousers let them fall and kicked them off used a bare toe to move them aside and shove them with the heap just keep watching me salvatore and know that you can trust me its all going to be fine you and me were going to sort everything he took off his undershirt not a fine sight he thought damn near twenty years before the medic from the bureaus recruitment programme had taken a sight of that chest the concave bit between the bones the spindly arms sprouting and failed him he was told afterwards when all the rest had gone well that he presented next to naked a poor example of young manhood and it hadnt improved in two decades he chucked aside the undershirt might have killed then for a cigarette and might have killed as well for a shower long and hot and soap not right for him to shiver and he didnt they watched him as they were supposed to didnt think that seeing him would give too much comfort to the boy didnt think looking at him from twenty paces would summon up too much suspicion and anxiety in salvatore their eyes the two sets were never off him he heard alongside him a door open he said in his mind bawled it fuck me do i need that do i hell he turned his head not full on and used the periphery of his vision an old woman stood in a doorway and she had a goddam cat in her arms she looked hard at lukas and shoved the cat down it yowled and she kicked it hard with a gnarled foot that was half in and half out of a slipper and the cat flew behind him the door slammed and a bolt was drawn silence he thought the old woman had either refused to move or had been too deaf to know of the evacuation the cat wanted to pee or crap and had roused her end of story i was near god believe me to a damn coronary dont do it to me again please he had his arm up scratched above his ear and could say to his watch face i dont aim to make it easy for the shite we want him rotting he wore navy boxer shorts they had seen better days and the colour had faded from rich to dull and the elastic in the waist had lost the snap and the shorts hung slack on his belly the pistol barrel had not moved was in the boys hair i cant abide shouting salvatore so im coming a bit nearer theres sensitive things to talk about and i dont want the world knowing what our business is there were good goose pimples on lukass skin mustnt shiver mustnt show fear all bluff he took the first step forward all a bluff and an opaque mist chucked over the reality if the mist was blown away the bluff called he was dead and the boy was dead and salvatore had achieved his buspass ride to the angels the smile was good it was a rare talent lukass smile never looked as if it was pasted on his face and it was calm quiet and as sincere as it came he was on the fourth and fifth steps stretching them im not a danger to you salvatore im a friend and ive come to offer help trust me he didnt know how much of what he said was understood and was unable to gauge the italians comprehension of his message lukas thought his bearing more important than anything his nakedness and his lack of physique proved he threatened nothing nobody he heard behind him a soft but strangled howl and wondered if the bloody cat was nuzzling its damn face against a rifle barrel and if the animal had been hit with the heel of a hand had done ten paces then twelve the eyes of salvatore seemed wider the lower lip jabbered and the jaw wobbled he had no voice lukas thought he tried to speak and couldnt a hell of a way to spend a night good damn thing he looked down because there was syringe glass on the walkway concrete and shit from a dog not the cats a hell of a place to be he kept the smile in place an instructor for the training of the critical incident response people had said it was the best smile hed come across and asked why it couldnt be carried from the roleplay scenarios into the canteen when they ate together it was an act had no truth fifteen paces taken then sixteen always smile the boy gazed at him like he was a messiah you have my word salvatore and my word is my bond that you can trust me and that way nobodys hurt and we get to go home and you get a proper bed and some sleep and a meal what im working at salvatore is that every one of us is a winner you know about winning you win because youre smart salvatore i can see that youre a big man and smart a winner he could see more of the boys face than the hoods shouldnt have allowed a personal feeling to intrude in the work had done and lukas saw that as a failure a small one but failures totted too many small ones and there was weight enough for catastrophe catastrophe was the pistol being fired blood spurting bone splintering the boy had a good face assault teams negotiators and coordinators all wanted to believe that the target for rescue was worth saving was of goldplated value found half the time after a rescue that they were creeps useless some too fucking arrogant to offer gratitude not that lukas wanted thanks wanted a job done well had counted them had done twentyone steps was level with the doorway it was a good face and a terrorised face i appreciate you letting me up close salvatore an idiot wouldnt have but youre a smart guy can i call you friend id like to he wasnt certain lukas stood in the centre of the walkway the boy and salvatore wrapped together like one were in the doorway the pistol had not moved from the back of the boys head and he saw that it remained cocked the finger inside the guard resting on the trigger bar i want to talk with you hear you and that way i can best be your friend and i can help you he was not yet certain that the hood would not shoot inexact sciences whether when why a gunman would pull the damn trigger one of many sciences for which there could not be textbooks only a bedrock of experience was getting into the mind of a holedup gunman and anticipating whether he wanted to be in a warm cleanedout cell or hankered after a oneway ride to valhalla lukas didnt know he did a little roll of his eyebrows to salvatore i doubt he means anything to you that eddie anything at all doesnt mean anything to me not smart like you friend not a winner means a great deal to his parents pretty ordinary people and thats why i said id try to help theyre not winners either not like you are he put his hands on his hips as if he was standing in a bar talking with a man he knew and respected and sent a message big and clear and spoke a confidence he thats eddie doesnt know that the bitch the woman he came to find wasnt prepared to lift a finger for him im not supposed to tell you this she couldnt care less for him could have sent signals could have opened up channels shes not changing her mind you could have sent bits of him back to her or all of him dumped on her doorstep and she wouldnt have changed only word for her bitch but he thats eddie has only found that out these last three days whatever hurting him salvatore wont change her wont alter a hard bitch its just what im thinking they were in the doorway from where he stood he couldnt have touched the boy would have had to take a couple of steps to be close enough then could have tousled the boys hair pinched his cheek or slapped his upper arm for encouragement but he hadnt yet convinced himself that the hood wouldnt shoot it all happened in these situations so damn fast was so damn unpredictable he thought that at least five rifles were aimed at the little part of salvatores body protruding from the doorways recess not enough to give the marksmen an aim and have them shoot and the pistol remained at the boys neck it would be one word or a short sentence one movement or gesture that could change it and the pistol might be moved and might be fired lukas didnt know he stood near naked and cold fighting the urge to shiver and couldnt know whether what he said or did would win or lose it the lips moved he strained to hear they will never take me they all say that friend he murmured in his mind and kept the smile and i dont know whether i believe you have to find out dont i the smile clung to his face they will never take me as a prisoner his voice seemed to growl from deep in his throat the breath hissed on the back of eddies neck he didnt know whether the smile six or seven feet from him was real or manufactured not me not a prisoner one step i shoot eddie felt himself a spectator the mans arm was tight round him and the mans fingers were hard in a fold of his tshirt and the mans bones were against his buttocks the chest against his back the head against his own a spectator a voyeur a watcher he could not relate to the incoherent babble of the man and the breath on his neck and the wet spit coming with it i kill him one step closer dead him almost eddie thought the man cried tears and edged to hysteria and he was a spectator also when he gazed into the calm face of lukas he could see each hair on his head and face the stubble growth what was in his ears and nostrils the curled hair on his chest and at the base of his stomach visible because the boxers drooped i shoot him do you not believe me you will the skin was broken by the force used to press the pistol barrel against his neck and eddie could feel the wet there lukas had not moved had not gone back or forward and his hands were still on his hips they were not flexed and there seemed no strategy of deceit about the posture lukas was eddie believed in control you believe me when i shoot him not one step he felt comfort given him the man lukas oozed competence and experience he didnt have to speak he had the calm of a parent while a toddler rages knows the child will quieten hed had an old teacher at school sixthform english forty years in the job and a new headmaster half his age had trashed the veterans ideas experience often clouds judgement best without it the pupils had thought it bullshit eddie valued experience valued it big when it was in a smile from a man who masked any trace of fear a weedy little beggar no strength to him no muscle spindly legs arms almost emaciated and that burn mark on his lower lip that came from smoking cigarettes to the filter seemed to offer no threat i tell you you believe me i will shoot what i believe friend i want to call you that ok i believe friend that youre a big man a smart man too big and too smart for an accident i think friend youre hurting eddie with the barrel can we do something about that not hurt him thats good the barrel was less pressured on his neck eddie knew it no longer gouged it had an indent but less force was used thats good friend and its generous i appreciate that we have to figure a way out of this i shoot i have no fear you have no fear of course you dont fear is for little guys him eddie hes fit to shit his pants but hes not a big guy you come no closer im not moving maybe there was cramp in salvatores hand maybe it was ironic bloody generosity but the pistol had moved again imperceptibly but a further lessening of the pressure eddie didnt move was one of those guys with painted faces and robes who struck statue poses at tourist sites he realised that lukas too had moved edged closer eddie knew it because he could match the windowsill across the walkway with the corner of lukass right elbow and there was less of the sill to see and a big paint flake was obscured by the arm eddie knew standing and held upright with the pistol in his skin and the tiny sounds inside his ear from the firings where all the paint scrapes and flakes were on the window opposite it could have been a full pace closer could have put him damn near anyway with a lunge in touching distance eddie reckoned lukas knew what he was doing and the comfort in him grew you dont move i dont move what i care friend is how we come out of this before theres an accident they dont take me not a surrender no not paraded like some damn chimpanzee in a zoo cage absolutely not you call me scimpanze do you a scimpanze chimpanzee cannot shoot i can i am not taken how about friend you try to shoot try not eddie not worth the cost of a bullet you try to shoot me you jam and what is jam it is block malfunction does not fire but you tried a smart guy you know about weapons there could be dirt in the ammunition dirt in the pistol with a buildup of cordite in the barrel dirt in the magazine mechanism it can be the extractor bar breaking the automatic blowback can fail for many reasons it can block and jam the word gets passed i will not be taken yes yes eddie thought then that he heard the first wisp of impatience like it had been a good game and an interesting experience and it had run its course and the first twist of boredom was there and a little of the confidence slipped in him what is important is your prestige and dignity friend you tried you did not surrender you were good to your word it was just that the damn machine the pistol the kit failed you that message gets put around nobody can say that salvatore big man and smart man bottled out not him it was the pistol that failed theres another thing eddie could watch the eyes of lukas every feature of his body was unremarkable stunted without authority except his eyes there was less of the window to see and the gap between lukas and the two of them shortened and it would only have been a short lunge for the touch the eyes were extraordinary they were locked on the man who pressed his body against eddie they had the quality to hold and mesmerise eddie did not think that he himself held interest to lukas only salvatore the friend he didnt know how it would end but knew it would be very soon a minute or two minutes his comfort bled because he thought he recognised impatience the other thing you get a good lawyer youre intelligent and you have the resources and you get a top man to front up for you you pull a prosecution case to pieces not difficult because theyre always second rate maybe you walk at the trial maybe you go free on appeal it doesnt last locked up show me salvatore that youre a big guy and a smart guy and i already know youre a generous guy do what we all have some food we all get some sleep theres no accident what do you say friend lukas had moved again could have touched two bright flashes on the dirt and the concrete which caught in eddies glance two discharged cartridge cases two shots fired and two cartridge cases thrown out no fucking jam playacted or otherwise the comfort had gone and he felt the stress build again and his body was rigid you did not listen course i did friend i listened well heard all you said just giving you the good back way out and you did not listen the pistol was off eddies neck gone from his skin it was out in front of eddies face and the arm was loosed that had been across his chest two hands on the pistol grip eddie understood should have taken longer maybe too tired maybe too hungry maybe just bored pigsick with a thug with a gun maybe done it all before and so many times saw the shock spread on lukass face like disbelief eddie heard god did i do this did i and then the pistol blast and the cordite dust flashed in his face and the bright brass of the cartridge was ejected fell bounced and rolled blood came back at him a fine spray and there was more behind he saw the slight ugly knees bend then falter then collapse and saw the shock on the face preserved like the scale of a mistake and its consequences were the last thought that he did a sort of hop eddie had no legs free to kick backwards as he jumped up held by the belt he hacked his heels behind him and felt them hit and hurt and he could punch with his hands all done in one crazy uncontrolled moment his clenched fists hit the belly the pistol arced fell and clattered they went down he was underneath salvatore and his head was held gripped and his face was beaten into the concrete and they came his eyes were closed shut tight couldnt absorb more nightmare engulfed him he was crushed weight on him squeezed out the breath from his lungs his head was in blood he couldnt move see or breathe there were voices muffled and indistinct and he didnt understand what was yelled he felt himself sinking then falling then lost and the abyss closed over him and the weight was lifted eddie dared to open his eyes he was ignored he lay in a smeared strip of blood that now sank into the porous dirt of the concrete two figures huge in vests over black overalls with firearms hooked on their shoulders took turns to work on the chest of the man who had called himself lukas they pounded on the chest and didnt stop until the door behind him where he had been held was kicked flat then used as a litter two more of them took him hoisted on the door lukas was carried away eddie didnt know whether it was boredom or impatience or just shit luck that had failed lukas he didnt move his head beyond where lukas had been salvatore lay on his stomach as his hands were hitched behind him and fastened with ties one more of them in the black overalls and the masks stood over salvatore and had a dirty boot across his neck and eddie knew he was alive because the chest heaved and there were small yelps of pain when the boot was shifted or pressed harder eddie was glad he lived he thought it a worse more severe punishment to live than to be proxy shot last they came to him a big man towered over him wearing a suit that now had rents at the knees and elbows and was stained with the dust of the concrete a vivid tie was loosened at the neck and a collar button undone and his hair was a tangled mess and there was blood on his shirt and jacket eddie might have been wrong but he thought he saw wet glisten in the mans eyes a shortbladed knife was used to cut the ties at his ankles and wrists he was turned over the man in the suit stood back another whom they called tractor crouched over him and felt his face with mittened fingers then lifted each of his arms and flexed them did the same for his legs there were cuts abrasions and bruising on every part of his body that the hands touched but he didnt cry out the tractor stood and backed away as if he had no more interest another and he was called the engineer stood over eddie and reached down eddie took the hand the fist closed over his wrist and he was heaved up the suit led the tractor followed then their prisoner with men close around him eddie trailed and the one they called the bomber was behind him the cat that had been shut out scratched at a door but was not admitted they went past the broken apartment he had run into and he saw the wreckage and didnt ask about the man who had opened his home to a fugitive they went through two barred gates one open one destroyed and down three flights of stairs there was a crowd at the main entrance of the block he was not jeered or jostled he was stared at the black overalls were close round their prisoner and hustled him to the transport but the crowd didnt push or surge eddie thought they wanted either their beds or to get back to their work and trade it was a far place that he had come to and he didnt know them and they didnt know him so he gave them no greeting or acknowledgement the suit stood beside the door of a minibus the prisoner was in already the suit waited for him eddie came to the door the suit said id known him for less than one week he was the best what are you are you worth the life of the best but you didnt think of that he climbed in he was driven away it was still dark when they left the hospital a great cavern of a building on the edge of the scampia district the pronto soccorso section was as grim a place as eddie had known and he had been left with two black overalls on a plastic seat in a corridor and the world had gone by him beatenup tarts overdosed druggies knifewound victims complicated pregnancies he had known it was a formality but had sat still and a nurse had come with a bowl and a towel and had cleaned his face wounds and had stitched expertly his lips and he had had sutures under his right eye he had not mentioned the pain in his ribcage had thought it disrespectful of lukass injuries a little after the american consul had arrived with a phalanx of security around him castrolami had emerged from behind the swing doors it had been obvious when they had gone in that the injuries were terminal that lukas was dead but eddie supposed it necessary for them to go through the procedures of resuscitation and fail castrolami the suit had given his name in the minibus in a curt growl and had not offered a hand for the greeting had walked up to him in that wide corridor outside the emergency section and had flicked his fingers as a gesture for eddie to follow him and had kept walking he might have been the damn dog they did not use the minibus there were hugs and cheekbrush kisses between castrolami and one called the tractor another called the engineer and a third called the bomber and the one who had a sniper rifle uncased made a joke of complaining that he had not been given the opportunity to shoot eddie realised then that the prisoner was gone would have been transferred to a different wagon and taken away beside the minibus was a marked carabinieri saloon with a uniformed driver and an escort and the engine idled he was put into the back and castrolami slumped beside him they left the hospital where a body would now be wheeled towards the mortuary building not much to talk about he was the best what are you are you worth the life of the best there was no warmth on offer nothing that soothed the jumbled confusion in his mind he supposed that by now a telephone call would have been made to england to a corner of wiltshire to a bungalow in a lane and that lights had flashed on in answer to the persistence of a bell and that his parents now sat on their bed in their night clothes in shock and relief his mother might have gone to make two mugs of cocoa he couldnt face making a call himself would have to but later they sat silent and they looked out of their different windows the light grew came slowly he did not ask where they went why what are you wasnt prepared to try to answer and the blood of the best was caking his tshirt and jeans they didnt go towards the city but drove away from it and the first light soft gold was above distant hills there was no beauty no majesty alongside the road they went by homes and small farms scorched orchards compact factory units and ribbon developments of advertising hoardings he thought of the orderly managed greenery of the village where he had spent his childhood here there was anarchy the sun peeped a fraction higher and the first glimpse of a segment still gold was over the hills horizon castrolami had taken from his pocket an old leatherbound notepad with scuffed corners and had started to write busily it would have been his memory jottings for his report on the death of the best eddie was and he realised it an intruder not wanted he felt no anger at this but accepted it and sat deep on the seat and the car was driven fast on empty roads he had of course no watch but if he craned forward he could see the dash in front of the driver and thought they had been travelling for a little more than half an hour there was a sign beside the road and the driver slowed and the escort studied his map then written instructions the place was called nola they went into the heart of it past a cathedralsized church the low sun was nestled on the tower the road was rough the pavements worse and a very few hurried to be at work eddie thought the place desolate as if hope had gone he did not ask why they had come here for what purpose nobody had fed him nobody had offered him coffee or water or a beer he saw more churches and the road took them along the perimeter of a hospitals grounds then they veered off a main route and headed on narrower meaner streets the driver stopped a few metres short of a cemeterys main gates they were of heavy ironwork and closed eddie assumed they were locked there was a pedestrians door at the side he could have played hard he could have sat in the car and demanded explanations a man was dead the best man the man with the caved chest and the chairlegthin arms and the knees that had nothing pretty to them was in the mortuary he followed castrolami out of the car he was led first light bloomed inside the small gate a man was lit as he swept dried leaves and when he saw them he eased himself on to his witchs broom and castrolami must have asked the question with his eyes because the sweeper gestured to his right and watched them there was a girls statue on a plinth lifesize and a single rose slotted by her hand she had the sadness of youth snatched and her name carved in the stonework was angelabella he went through avenues of small chapels all with artificial flowers flourishing and some had candles burning and displayed photographs of the longdeceased when they had lived and enjoyed health a great piazza for the dead opened in front of him and castrolami he was considered responsible for the loss of the best he queried nothing was obedient between concrete paths there were gravestones more flowers more candles and more sepia photographs at the far end of the square of the dead there was a wall with five layers of sealed shelves each large enough to take an adults corpse and more flowers decorated it two men stood against it and the sun caught their faces one waved to castrolami who acknowledged and switched course he saw her she would have noticed the two mens reaction and she stood her hand across her forehead to shield her eyes from the sun low and growing in intensity she did not run towards him he followed castrolami kept castrolamis pace in his ear she wanted this myself i would have thrown you on the plane the first she wanted to be here when news came of whether you had survived or not her friend is here her most valued friend her friend is here because of the toxic pollution of what we call the triangle of death the pollution is by the borelli family in part over many years it is why she has collaborated it is in memory of her friend a tribute i was second to her friend you were second eddie to her friend you could not compete it is ludicrous to be here but we are you do not have long her arms were not outstretched welcoming they were behind her back the light on her face did not flatter and there were bags under her eyes lines at her mouth and a frown of worry he thought her drably dressed a plain grey skirt a blouse that seemed darker her hair was uncombed and she wore no lipstick castrolami moved aside the two men behind her edged clear he was in front of her he was as far from her and from the bulge of the blouse as he had been from lukas when he had thought the best man was impatient might have been bored and looked tired enough to drop it was the face of the girl he had slept with and laughed with and he was not certain he knew her and he let his hands hang and hers were behind her back you survived not the moment for the trite or the sarcastic yes i survived you are hurt you have wounds a shrug a grin that dragged on the sutures im fine like if i walked into a door i couldnt help you you could have helped me you chose not to help me it was not easy you made a choice eddie gazed into her eyes held them do you understand the choice i understand that my life was of secondary importance eddie that is so pompous can you not she looked away broke the intensity of the contact he said sort of puts me in my place second place should we talk of whats been the past he smiled almost managed to laugh and the pain was in his ribs at the thought of letting his chest heave in the past here in this damn country in naples there were people of quite outstanding courage top of the list he was called lukas and he tried to save me hes my past theres a fishseller down via forcella and he gave me the warning before the bastard bounced me which was big hes in my past a man in that block when id broken free and was running and the dogs of hell were after me he opened a door for me i dont know what happened to him or the fishseller but lukas died and i lived and what bit of the past do you want to talk about i put a padlock on a bridge in rome and i threw the key in the river immacolata said the sun was in her eyes worse than before it made her squint and took more of the prettiness off her dont know what youre talking about am i supposed to be impressed whats special about a padlock on a bloody bridge she shrugged eddie grimaced do i get to see the padlock whose significance escapes me that doesnt have a key maybe when is maybe some day some time perhaps go home he swung on his heel and his trainer ground at the gravel chips on the avenue between the headstones he walked briskly and castrolami had to stretch his stride to catch him the sun had now risen up and flush on him castrolami said that if they used the light and the siren they would be at capodicino in time for the first flight of the day and to buy a new shirt an hour later marco castrolami wore the suit that was kept on a hanger in a cupboard of his work area a clean shirt and tie and he escorted salvatore il pistole from the front entrance of piazza dante men of the ros section held the arms of the prisoner the tractor and the bomber but their identities were obscured by balaclava masks with eye slits the camera flashes exploded in the hitmans face he winced and turned away which gave an impression of fear that would be frozen irrevocably in the digital memories castrolami saw a reporter he recognised an eager young woman but couldnt remember her name or whether she was employed by cronaca or mattino or an agency and he murmured as he passed her he always threatened to kill himself rather than face arrest in fact confronted with firearms he didnt choose suicidebycop but surrendered without a fight hardly a heros end he would not normally have spoken to what he usually termed the vermin pack but the day was not usual he had dropped his charge at the airport in time for the first london flight out of capodicino had shaken the hand formally and muttered gruffly something about good fortune for the future and better to cut naples out of any future travel plans had cuffed his shoulder in an awkward gesture had not mentioned lukass death and had seen the boy met by his consul who would do the ticket then take him in search of the shirt and had left him he had not in years allowed himself to be photographed for the naples dailies but it was not a normal day with the hitman on his way to a life sentence he would go back to piazza dante clear his desk and cupboard then write the letter to his superior his personal effects would be in a plastic bag and he would drop off his id at the front desk and slip away no fanfare no party he would not be in lucianos trattoria that night where the ros men were due to eat finally swordfish steaks he would be out of naples by the end of the day salvatore was driven away in a convoy of sirens and lights en route for poggioreale what had castrolamis years in the city of magnificence and squalor beauty and rank ugliness glory and shame achieved he would go up north maybe drive a taxi or work in a cheese shop perhaps he had achieved something perhaps he had not more could not have been asked of him a day later men from the misso clan spread out in the sanita district through the little businesses where the carvedwood madonnas watched trading from behind screens of lit candles and called at the shops and bars that had been under the protection and control of the borelli family and men from the mazzarella clan came to the via forcella and the via duomo and the via carbonara and walked in freedom and safety on the narrow alleys guns were carried and remained hidden premises were not earmarked for petrol bombing after dark it was a seamless transfer of authority in all the areas that had been the fiefdom of the borellis grandfather son and grandsons most of their footsoldiers embraced humility and offered themselves to the new masters and the few who had picked fights in the past with misso people and mazzarella people or traded insults or had slept with their women were gone in the night and by midday might have reached southern germany or western austria or the mediterranean coast of france at poggioreale giovanni was pushed from a lunch queue and silvio dared not leave his cell and carmine sat trembled and waited for a doctor to see him and at posilippo anna and gabriella were in the same exercise yard but did not deign to let their eyes meet they had known power and it was stripped from them and they could focus only on their hatred of the young woman who had brought them low immacolata who shared their blood a week later he was lucky that his job was still available the principal had told him eddie had been dutifully grateful he had thanked him outside the staff room he shared a cigarette with lottie and she inevitably asked him about the love of his life the juliet story and hed said something about just didnt work out and nothing about a concept of justice being bigger than the value of his life and near the end of that shared smoke shed looked into his face where the bruising was yellow with mauve traces and the swelling on his lips was still prominent and the scrapes had scabs and the stitches needed to come out shed asked hed said that the memory was a bit dulled might have been a door hed walked into and then again it might have been a set of stairs hed fallen down anyway thats what hed told the principal and hed managed to laugh she quizzed him in naples while he wasnt walking into doors or falling downstairs had he taken a coffee in the galeria umberto i built to revitalise the city after the cholera epidemic no he had not had he wandered in the state rooms of the palazzo reale completed in after a halfcentury of work no he had missed out on that experience in the capella sansevero had he circled the veiled christ the work of the eighteenthcentury sculptor giuseppe sammartino regarded by many as the elite art work housed in the city no he had not been able to had he been to san lorenzo maggiore or the pio monte della misericordia or the gesu nuovo or had he been to the ruins of pompeii or had he climbed to the rim of vesuvio no no no not my business eddie but what did you do there for gods sake naples is one of the wonders of the world did it just pass you by hed shrugged she would have thought him an imbecile and a philistine and the roll of her eyebrows seemed to suggest hed have been better off in milton keynes or welwyn garden city when the cigarette was finished and hed stamped on it and shed ground her heel on it she asked that address we worked out what was there hed said there was a couple of old people the girls grandparents and hed smiled and just seemed to tell her that the subject area was closed no talk about the sail and about a pistol in the neck and the gouge it had made and shots fired and a man who was the best killed no war stories a bell rang in the corridor neither did he tell her about a cemetery with the sun rising and about a girl who looked drained and wan and near broken and was dressed drably and who had spoken of a padlock and he said to lottie that it was good to be back in the comfort zone of agatha christie and poirot and jane marple and the body in the library well for a bit grateful for the work but no one should bet their shirt on him not moving on he thought that lottie had believed nothing he had told her but was too polite to quiz him further he went into his class of course same walls and same posters of tourist britain same desks and same students as there always were for that day of the week at ten in the morning and the same table for him to spread out his notes nothing changed except there was a private emptiness and he did not know how whether it could be filled a month later they were gathered on a viewing platform in the crowders mountain state park it was out west from charlotte beyond gastonia and along route and was a favoured place for those seeking good rockclimbing conditions the family were there and a man from the new york office of ground force security and another represented the federal bureau of investigation those men held back and allowed the mother the wife and the son of foster lukas to do their bit with the small veneer wood casket it could have been a short experience of dignity and respect but ground force had realised early that the blood relatives gave not a damn once a will had been produced that left all worldly chattels to a clinic that helped military veterans acclimatise with their new artificial limbs and the bureau had come up with the idea of scattering the ashes at a place of natural grandeur trouble was the wind was wrong the fbi man was retired as an agent but was kept as a freelancer on the payroll for the funerals of those who had long left the bureau but required recognition what i heard there was burnout too much work till it had gotten to obsessional levels and no hobbies lukas didnt give himself time for women for golf not even for walleye fishing wasnt that old but the work levels and the places they took him sort of left him crisped the wife had the top off the small casket supplied by a crematorium in london and the mother tilted it but the goddam wind was wrong the ground force man said our evaluation from the debriefs of those who were closest to him hed gotten careless happens with burnout cases a good handful of the ash blew back over the viewing platform rail and became embedded on the sons trousers and provoked a barely suppressed oath the bureau man responded there were two factors that killed him the one was that carelessness which comes from having done something so many times that its clockwork but the other was involvement emotional involvement we say that any form of involvement is a road to failure and worse than careless but emotional involvement is the pits thats the combination that killed him but i reckon careless was bigger mother threw some more and a little went into the wifes eye and a sprinkling of it on to her coat the two men walked away left them bickering about the wind and about a dirty coat and a pair of trousers that would need cleaning and a mote in the eye and both thought their work done it was indeed a hell of a place with a hell of a vista and the ground force man said as he fished car keys from his pocket he felt for the boy he was trying to bust out of a bad time wasnt just a dreary routine lukas was the sort of man you need in that kind of scrape difficult taciturn lacking in social skills and as good a type as we throw up the boy was lucky to have him on the case the family had finished and had turned away from the platform they both waved at them and called out their good wishes which were not acknowledged the bureau man said the boy was indeed lucky and will probably never know how lucky they parted would drive in their own hire cars to the airport at charlotte and the flights would take them back to dc and to new york city and neither could have pictured the sail building and a walkway where the washing hung and a little runt of a guy naked except for his boxers a year later the senior judge thanked her she bobbed her head she stood she turned for the aisle and the double doors the prosecutor had told her that the sentences would range between ergastolo life for the younger men except her juvenile brother thirty years for her mother twenty years for the advocate ten years for her grandfather who would die in poggioreale and eighteen months at posilippo for her grandmother in the cage no one looked at her her mother and her three brothers her grandfather and grandmother the lawyer who had known her since she was a babe in arms and the hitman all looked away as if that coordinated gesture demonstrated their contempt of her it was a wasted effort she never glanced at them on earlier hearings the abuse from the cage particularly from giovanni and anna borelli had blistered across the court room and on her fourth day in court vincenzo had come to the front of the cage and spat venomously at her and her mother had declaimed that immacolata would rot in a living hell and on many days silvio had wept her evidence was completed after a month of daily testimony she had forsworn cosmetics and dressed in lifeless colours for her appearances that day her last in court she was different she had brought almost a possessive smirk to the face of orecchia and a bounce to the step of rossi when they had collected her from the safehouse and driven her early to the palace of justice they alone were privy to the transformation rossi and orecchia had taken her the previous evening to the boutique salon in the backstreet on the seaward side of the piazza dei martiri her mothers account of course it would be on her mothers account who would have refused her the owner faced an investigation from the guardia di finanza so easily arranged if immacolata borelli and her escorts were turned away and the account was still open because her mother needed fresh underwear and required the changes of plain clothing that might to a court indicate a misunderstood and guiltless woman that day her daughter had been driven to court in the bulletproof and armourplated lancia in clothing that was chic elegant styled her jacket and skirt were asian silk sea blue and severe her shoes were white with low heels her blouse was cream and hung loose she wore no jewellery also the night before the wife of a court security guard had come to the safehouse cut and styled her hair she had turned heads in court all except those of her family and her familys closest confidants it was as if a trapped bird had escaped a cage she went down the stairs from the court through guarded double doors into a concrete underground cavern and was led to the lancia it was time there beside the car for a brief moment when the professionalism of the servizio centrale protezione was abandoned thrown to the winds orecchia took her hand and kissed it lightly rossi kissed her on each cheek cool lips she knew them knew of their families and their problems their excitements and their moments of despair they were perhaps her only family she sat in the back encased by the dark privacy windows and accepted now and did not query the vest that was laid on the seat beside her orecchia drove for this final journey in the middle of an october afternoon when light rain fell on the city and the mountains summit was hidden in gloomy cloud beyond the tunnel the road ahead was blocked by police motorcycles and they were given a free run on to an open road she would never see the city again knew it at the airport gate rossi laid his machine pistol on his lap rummaged in his briefcase produced her airline ticket and passed it to her he said quietly that the aircraft was due to leave five minutes ago but was held for her then he gave her the new passport that carried the new name they were at the terminals departures door orecchia turned and faced her then tapped the top of his head she took her cue and lowered the dark glasses from her hair covered her eyes with them and her upper face rossi said at the gate theyre expecting us well be taken straight to the aircraft im with you until the hatch closes after you youll be met i dont know orecchia frowned you said you were coming i did it by text the number he used to have what flight where we should have dinner i dont know whether he has a different mobile i didnt call maybe for fear of what i might be told are you sure of this rossi demanded of her very sure ive not had a text back but im sure i hope ill find him she paused then said softly after what i did to him what else now can i do i must look for him at the airport in a restaurant we used in the bar he liked i owe it to him to look orecchia scribbled on a sheet of his notepad then ripped it off call me and tell me if youve found what youre looking for she smiled at them and treasured them for their loyalty youll get one word fatturato in english thats turnover then youll know i found him orecchia changed was the professional the guard you dont stop you follow alessandro you keep close to him goodbye signorina immacolata who is finished goodbye whoever you have become and today you are beautiful i hope youre met the car door was opened for her she walked well the gate closed behind her she didnt know if he would be there she had a brisk stride and remembered a park a bench and a young man and a question put in innocence and a great wrong done to him and to others
