michael connelly the reversal harry bosch mickey haller to shannon byrne with many thanks tuesday february pm the last time id eaten at the water grill i sat across the table from a client who had coldly and calculatedly murdered his wife and her lover shooting both of them in the face he had engaged my services to not only defend him at trial but fully exonerate him and restore his good name in the public eye this time i was sitting with someone with whom i needed to be even more careful i was dining with gabriel williams the district attorney of los angeles county it was a crisp afternoon in midwinter i sat with williams and his trusted chief of staffread political advisorjoe ridell the meal had been set for pm when most courthouse lawyers would be safely back in the ccb and the da would not be advertising his dalliance with a member of the dark side meaning me mickey haller defender of the damned the water grill was a nice place for a downtown lunch good food and atmosphere good separation between tables for private conversation and a wine list hard to top in all of downtown it was the kind of place where you kept your suit jacket on and the waiter put a black napkin across your lap so you neednt be bothered with doing it yourself the prosecution team ordered martinis at the county taxpayers expense and i stuck with the free water the restaurant was pouring it took williams two gulps of gin and one olive before he got to the reason we were hiding in plain sight mickey i have a proposition for you i nodded ridell had already said as much when he had called that morning to set up the lunch i had agreed to the meet and then had gone to work on the phone myself trying to gather any inside information i could on what the proposition would be not even my first exwife who worked in the district attorneys employ knew what was up im all ears i said its not every day that the da himself wants to give you a proposition i know it cant be in regard to any of my clientsthey wouldnt merit much attention from the guy at the top and at the moment im only carrying a few cases anyway times are slow well youre right williams said this is not about any of your clients i have a case i would like you to take on i nodded again i understood now they all hate the defense attorney until they need the defense attorney i didnt know if williams had any children but he would have known through due diligence that i didnt do juvy work so i was guessing it had to be his wife probably a shoplifting grab or a dui he was trying to keep under wraps who got popped i asked williams looked at ridell and they shared a smile no nothing like that williams said my proposition is this i would like to hire you mickey i want you to come work at the das office of all the ideas that had been rattling around in my head since i had taken ridells call being hired as a prosecutor wasnt one of them id been a cardcarrying member of the criminal defense bar for more than twenty years during that time id grown a suspicion and distrust of prosecutors and police that might not have equaled that of the gangbangers down in nickerson gardens but was at least at a level that would seem to exclude me from ever joining their ranks plain and simple they wouldnt want me and i wouldnt want them except for that exwife i mentioned and a half brother who was an lapd detective i wouldnt turn my back on any of them especially williams he was a politician first and a prosecutor second that made him even more dangerous though briefly a prosecutor early in his legal career he spent two decades as a civil rights attorney before running for the da post as an outsider and riding into office on a tide of antipolice and prosecutor sentiment i was employing full caution at the fancy lunch from the moment the napkin went across my lap work for you i asked doing what exactly as a special prosecutor a onetime deal i want you to handle the jason jessup case i looked at him for a long moment first i thought i would laugh out loud this was some sort of cleverly orchestrated joke but then i understood that couldnt be the case they dont take you out to the water grill just to make a joke you want me to prosecute jessup from what i hear theres nothing to prosecute that case is a duck without wings the only thing left to do is shoot it and eat it williams shook his head in a manner that seemed intended to convince himself of something not me next tuesday is the anniversary of the murder he said im going to announce that we intend to retry jessup and i would like you standing next to me at the press conference i leaned back in my seat and looked at them ive spent a good part of my adult life looking across courtrooms and trying to read juries judges witnesses and prosecutors i think ive gotten pretty good at it but at that table i couldnt read williams or his sidekick sitting three feet away from me jason jessup was a convicted child killer who had spent nearly twentyfour years in prison until a month earlier when the california supreme court reversed his conviction and sent the case back to los angeles county for either retrial or a dismissal of the charges the reversal came after a twodecadelong legal battle staged primarily from jessups cell and with his own pen authoring appeals motions complaints and whatever legal challenges he could research the selfstyled lawyer made no headway with state and federal courts but did finally win the attention of an organization of lawyers known as the genetic justice project they took over his cause and his case and eventually won an order for genetic testing of semen found on the dress of the child jessup had been convicted of strangling jessup had been convicted before dna analysis was used in criminal trials the analysis performed these many years later determined that the semen found on the dress had not come from jessup but from another unknown individual though the courts had repeatedly upheld jessups conviction this new information tipped the scales in jessups favor the states supreme court cited the dna findings and other inconsistencies in the evidence and trial record and reversed the case this was pretty much the extent of my knowledge of the jessup case and it was largely information gathered from newspaper stories and courthouse scuttlebutt while i had not read the courts complete order i had read parts of it in the los angeles times and knew it was a blistering decision that echoed many of jessups longheld claims of innocence as well as police and prosecutorial misconduct in the case as a defense attorney i cant say i wasnt pleased to see the das office raked over the media coals with the ruling call it underdog schadenfreude it didnt really matter that it wasnt my case or that the current regime in the das office had nothing to do with the case back in there are so few victories from the defense side of the bar that there is always a sense of communal joy in the success of others and the defeat of the establishment the supreme courts ruling was announced the week before starting a sixtyday clock during which the da would have to retry or discharge jessup it seemed that not a day had gone by since the ruling that jessup was not in the news he gave multiple interviews by phone and in person at san quentin proclaiming his innocence and potshotting the police and prosecutors who put him there in his plight he had garnered the support of several hollywood celebrities and professional athletes and had already launched a civil claim against both the city and county seeking millions of dollars in damages for the many long years during which he was falsely incarcerated in this day of nonstop media cycles he had a neverending forum and was using it to elevate himself to folk hero status when he finally walked out of prison he too would be a celebrity knowing as little as i did about the case in the details i was of the impression that he was an innocent man who had been subjected to a quarter century of torture and that he deserved whatever he could get for it i did however know enough about the case to understand that with the dna evidence cutting jessups way the case was a loser and the idea of retrying jessup seemed to be an exercise in political masochism unlikely to come from the brain trust of williams and ridell unless what do you know that i dont know i asked and that the los angeles times doesnt know williams smiled smugly and leaned forward across the table to deliver his answer all jessup established with the help of the gjp is that his dna was not on the victims dress he said as the petitioner it was not up to him to establish who it did come from so you ran it through the data banks williams nodded we did and we got a hit he offered nothing else well who was it im not going to reveal that to you unless you come aboard on the case otherwise i need to keep it confidential but i will say that i believe our findings lead to a trial tactic that could neutralize the dna question leaving the rest of the caseand the evidencepretty much intact dna was not needed to convict him the first time we wont need it now as in nineteen eightysix we believe jessup is guilty of this crime and i would be delinquent in my duties if i did not attempt to prosecute him no matter the chances of conviction the potential political fallout and the public perception of the case spoken as if he were looking at the cameras and not at me then why dont you prosecute him i asked why come to me you have three hundred able lawyers working for you i can think of one youve got stuck up in the van nuys office who would take this case in a heartbeat why come to me because this prosecution cant come from within the das office i am sure you have read or heard the allegations theres a taint on this case and it doesnt matter that there isnt one goddamn lawyer working for me who was around back then i still need to bring in an outsider an independent to take it to court somebody thats what the attorney generals office is for i said you need an independent counsel you go to him now i was just poking him in the eye and everybody at the table knew it there was no way gabriel williams was going to ask the state ag to come in on the case that would cross the razorwire line of politics the ag post was an elected office in california and was seen by every political pundit in town as williamss next stop on his way to the governors mansion or some other lofty political plateau the last thing williams would be willing to do was hand a potential political rival a case that could be used against him no matter how old it was in politics in the courtroom in life you dont give your opponent the club with which he can turn around and clobber you were not going to the ag with this one williams said in a matteroffact manner thats why i want you mickey youre a wellknown and respected criminal defense attorney i think the public will trust you to be independent in this matter and will therefore trust and accept the conviction youll win in this case while i was staring at williams a waiter came to the table to take our order without ever breaking eye contact with me williams told him to go away i havent been paying a lot of attention to this i said whos jessups defense attorney i would find it difficult to go up against a colleague i know well right now all hes got is the gjp lawyer and his civil litigator he hasnt hired defense counsel because quite frankly hes expecting us to drop this whole thing i nodded another hurdle cleared for the moment but hes got a surprise coming williams said were going to bring him down here and retry him he did it mickey and thats all you really need to know theres a little girl whos still dead and thats all any prosecutor needs to know take the case do something for your community and for yourself who knows you might even like it and want to stay on if so well definitely entertain the possibility i dropped my eyes to the linen tablecloth and thought about his last words for a moment i involuntarily conjured the image of my daughter sitting in a courtroom and watching me stand for the people instead of the accused williams kept talking unaware that i had already come to a decision obviously i cant pay you your rate but if you take this on i dont think youll be doing it for the money anyway i can give you an office and a secretary and i can give you whatever science and forensics you need the very best of every i dont want an office in the das office i would need to be independent of that i have to be completely autonomous no more lunches we make the announcement and then you leave me alone i decide how to proceed with the case fine use your own office just as long as you dont store evidence there and of course you make your own decisions and if i do this i pick second chair and my own investigator out of the lapd people i can trust in or outside my office for your second i would need someone inside then i assume were talking about your exwife thats rightif shell take it and if somehow we get a conviction out of this thing you pull her out of van nuys and put her downtown in major crimes where she belongs thats easier said than thats the deal take it or leave it williams glanced at ridell and i saw the supposed sidekick give an almost imperceptible nod of approval all right williams said turning back to me then i guess ill take it you win and shes in we have a deal he reached his hand across the table and i shook it he smiled but i didnt mickey haller for the people he said has a nice ring to it for the people it should have made me feel good it should have made me feel like i was part of something that was noble and right but all i had was the bad feeling that i had crossed some sort of line within myself wonderful i said friday february am harry bosch stepped up to the front counter of the district attorneys office on the eighteenth floor of the criminal courts building he gave his name and said he had a ten am appointment with district attorney gabriel williams actually your meeting is in conference room a said the receptionist after checking a computer screen in front of her you go through the door turn right and go to the end of the hall right again and conference room a is on the left its marked on the door theyre expecting you the door in the paneledwood wall behind her buzzed free and bosch went through wondering about the fact that they were waiting for him since he had received the summons from the das secretary the afternoon before bosch had been unable to determine what it was about secrecy was expected from the das office but usually some information trickled out he hadnt even known he would be meeting with more than one person until now following the prescribed trail bosch came to the door marked conference room a knocked once and heard a female voice say come in he entered and saw a woman seated by herself at an eightchaired table a spread of documents files photos and a laptop computer in front of her she looked vaguely familiar but he could not place her she was attractive with dark curling hair framing her face she had sharp eyes that followed him as he entered and a pleasant almost curious smile like she knew something he didnt she wore the standard female prosecutors power suit in navy blue harry might not have been able to place her but he assumed she was a dda detective bosch thats me come in have a seat bosch pulled out a chair and sat across from her on the table he saw a crime scene photograph of a childs body in an open dumpster it was a girl and she was wearing a blue dress with long sleeves her feet were bare and she was lying on a pile of construction debris and other trash the white edges of the photo were yellowed it was an old print the woman moved a file over the picture and then offered her hand across the table i dont think weve ever met she said my name is maggie mcpherson bosch recognized the name but he couldnt remember from where or what case im a deputy district attorney she continued and im going to be second chair on the jason jessup prosecution first chair jason jessup bosch asked youre going to take it to trial yes we are well be announcing it next week and i need to ask you to keep it confidential until then i am sorry that our first chair is late coming to our meet the door opened and bosch turned mickey haller stepped into the room bosch did a double take not because he didnt recognize haller they were half brothers and he easily knew him on sight but seeing haller in the das office was one of those images that didnt quite make sense haller was a criminal defense attorney he fit in at the das office about as well as a cat did at the dog pound i know haller said youre thinking what in the hell is this smiling haller moved to mcphersons side of the table and started pulling out a chair then bosch remembered how he knew mcphersons name you two bosch said you were married right thats right haller said eight wonderful years and what shes prosecuting jessup and youre defending him isnt that a conflict of interest hallers smile became a broad grin it would only be a conflict if we were opposing each other harry but were not were prosecuting him together im first chair maggies second and we want you to be our investigator bosch was completely confused wait a minute youre not a prosecutor this doesnt im an appointed independent prosecutor harry its all legit i wouldnt be sitting here if it werent were going after jessup and we want you to help us bosch pulled out a chair and slowly sat down from what i heard this case is beyond help unless youre telling me jessup rigged the dna test no were not telling you that mcpherson said we did our own testing and matching his results were correct it wasnt his dna on the victims dress but that doesnt mean weve lost the case haller quickly added bosch looked from mcpherson to haller and then back again he was clearly missing something then whose dna was it he asked mcpherson glanced sideways at haller before answering her stepfathers she said hes dead now but we believe there is an explanation for why his semen was found on his stepdaughters dress haller leaned urgently across the table an explanation that still leaves room to reconvict jessup of the girls murder bosch thought for a moment and the image of his own daughter flashed in his mind he knew there were certain kinds of evil in the world that had to be contained no matter the hardship a child killer was at the top of that list okay he said im in tuesday february pm the das office had a press conference room that had not been updated since the days theyd used it to hold briefings on the charles manson case its faded woodpaneled walls and drooping flags in the corner had been the backdrop of a thousand press briefings and they gave all proceedings there a threadbare appearance that belied the true power and might of the office the state prosecutor was never the underdog in any undertaking yet it appeared that the office did not have the money for even a fresh coat of paint the setting however served the announcement on the jessup decision well for possibly the first time in these hallowed halls of justice the prosecution would indeed be the underdog the decision to retry jason jessup was fraught with peril and the realistic likelihood of failure as i stood at the front of the room next to gabriel williams and before a phalanx of video cameras bright lights and reporters it finally dawned on me what a terrible mistake i had made my decision to take on the case in hopes of currying favor with my daughter exwife and myself was going to be met with disastrous consequences i was going to go down in flames it was a rare moment to witness firsthand the media had gathered to report the end of the story the das office would assuredly announce that jason jessup would not be subjected to a retrial the da might not offer an apology but would at the very least say the evidence was not there that there was no case against this man who had been incarcerated for so long the case would be closed and in the eyes of the law as well as the public jessup would finally be a free and innocent man the media is rarely fooled in complete numbers and usually doesnt react well when it happens but there was no doubt that williams had punked them all we had moved stealthily in the last week putting together the team and reviewing the evidence that was still available not a word had leaked which mustve been a first in the halls of the ccb while i could see the first inkling of suspicion creasing the brows of the reporters who recognized me as we entered it was williams who delivered the knockout punch when he wasted no time in stepping before a lectern festooned with microphones and digital recorders on a sunday morning twentyfour years ago today twelveyearold melissa landy was taken from her yard in hancock park and brutally murdered an investigation quickly led to a suspect named jason jessup he was arrested convicted at trial and sentenced to life in prison without parole that conviction was reversed two weeks ago by the state supreme court and remanded to my office i am here to announce that the los angeles county district attorneys office will retry jason jessup in the death of melissa landy the charges of abduction and murder stand this office intends once again to prosecute mr jessup to the fullest extent of the law he paused to add appropriate gravity to the announcement as you know the supreme court found that irregularities occurred during the first prosecutionwhich of course occurred more than two decades before the current administration to avoid political conflicts and any future appearance of impropriety on the part of this office i have appointed an independent special prosecutor to handle the case many of you know of the man standing here to my right michael haller has been a defense counselor of some note in los angeles for two decades he is a fairminded and respected member of the bar he has accepted the appointment and has assumed responsibility for the case as of today it has been the policy of this department not to try cases in the media however mr haller and i are willing to answer a few questions as long as they dont tread on the specifics and evidence of the case there was a booming chorus of voices calling questions out at us williams raised his hands for calm in the room one at a time people lets start with you he pointed to a woman sitting in the first row i could not remember her name but i knew she worked for the times williams knew his priorities kate salters from the times she said helpfully can you tell us how you came to the decision to prosecute jason jessup again after dna evidence cleared him of the crime before coming into the room williams had told me that he would handle the announcement and all questions unless specifically addressed to me he made it clear that this was going to be his show but i decided to make it clear from the outset that it was going to be my case ill answer that i said as i leaned toward the lectern and the microphones the dna test conducted by the genetic justice project only concluded that the bodily fluid found on the victims clothing did not come from jason jessup it did not clear him of involvement in the crime there is a difference the dna test only provides additional information for a jury to consider i straightened back up and caught williams giving me a dontfuckwithme stare whose dna was it someone called out williams quickly leaned forward to answer were not answering questions about evidence at this time mickey why are you taking the case the question came from the back of the room from behind the lights and i could not see the owner of the voice i moved back to the microphones angling my body so williams had to step back good question i said its certainly unusual for me to be on the other side of the aisle so to speak but i think this is the case to cross over for im an officer of the court and a proud member of the california bar we take an oath to seek justice and fairness while upholding the constitution and laws of this nation and state one of the duties of a lawyer is to take a just cause without personal consideration to himself this is such a cause someone has to speak for melissa landy i have reviewed the evidence in this case and i think im on the right side of this one the measure is proof beyond a reasonable doubt i think that such proof exists here williams moved in and put a hand on my arm to gently move me off the microphone stand we do not want to go any further than that in regard to the evidence he said quickly jessups already spent twentyfour years in prison salters said anything less than a conviction for firstdegree murder and he will probably walk on time served mr williams is it really worth the expense and effort of retrying this man before she was finished asking the question i knew she and williams had a deal working she lobbed softballs and he hit them out of the park looking good and righteous on the eleven oclock news and in the morning paper her end of the deal would come with inside scoops on the evidence and trial strategy i decided in that moment that it was my case my trial my deal none of that matters i said loudly from my position to the side all eyes turned to me even williams turned can you talk into the microphones mickey it was the same voice from behind the line of lights he knew to call me mickey i once again moved to the microphones boxing williams out like a power forward going for the rebound the murder of a child is a crime that must be prosecuted to the full extent of the law no matter what the possibilities or risks are there is no guarantee of victory here but that was not part of the decision the measure is reasonable doubt and i believe we surpass that we believe that the totality of evidence shows that this man committed this horrible crime and it doesnt matter how much time has gone by or how long he has been incarcerated he must be prosecuted i have a daughter only a little older than melissa was you know people forget that in the original trial the state sought the death penalty but the jury recommended against it and the judge imposed a life sentence that was then and this is now we will once again be seeking the death penalty on this case williams put his hand on my shoulder and pulled me away from the microphones uh lets not get ahead of ourselves here he said quickly my office has not yet made a determination in regard to whether we will be seeking the death penalty that will come at a later time but mr haller makes a very valid and sad point there can be no worse crime in our society than the murder of a child we must do all that is within our power and our reach to seek justice for melissa landy thank you for being here today wait a minute called a reporter from one of the middle seats what about jessup when will he be brought here for trial williams put his hands on both sides of the lectern in a casual move designed to keep me from the microphones earlier this morning mr jessup was taken into custody by the los angeles police and is being transported from san quentin he will be booked into the downtown jail and the case will proceed his conviction was reversed but the charges against him remain in place we have nothing further at this time williams stepped back and signaled me toward the door he waited until i started moving and was clear of the microphones he then followed coming up behind me and whispering into my ear as we went through the door you do that again and ill fire you on the spot i turned to look back at him while i walked do what answer one of your setup questions we moved into the hallway ridell was waiting there with the offices media spokesman a guy named fernandez but williams turned me down the hall away from them he was still whispering when he spoke you went off the script do it again and were done i stopped and turned and williams almost walked into me look im not your puppet i said im an independent contractor remember you treat me otherwise and youre going to be holding this hot potato without an oven mitt williams just glared at me i obviously wasnt getting through and what was this shit about the death penalty he asked we havent even gotten there and you didnt have the goahead to say it he was bigger than me taller he had used his body to crowd my space and back me up against the wall it will get back to jessup and keep him thinking i said and if were lucky he comes in for a deal and this whole thing goes away including the civil action itll save you all that money thats really what this is about right the money we get a conviction and hes got no civil case you and the city save a few million bucks thats got nothing to do with this this is about justice and you still should have told me what you were doing you dont sandbag your own boss the physical intimidation got old real fast i put my palm on his chest and backed him off me yeah well youre not my boss i dont have a boss is that right like i said i could fire your ass right here right now i pointed down the hall to the door to the press conference room yeah thatll look good firing the independent prosecutor you just hired didnt nixon do that during the watergate mess worked real well for him why dont we go back in and tell them im sure there are still a few cameras in there williams hesitated realizing his predicament i had backed him against the wall without even moving he would look like a complete and unelectable fool if he fired me and he knew it he leaned in closer and his whisper dropped lower as he used the oldest threat in the mano a mano handbook i was ready for it do not fuck with me haller then dont fuck with my case this isnt a campaign stop and its not about money this is murder boss you want me to get a conviction then get out of my way i threw him the bone of calling him boss williams pressed his mouth into a tight line and stared at me for a long moment just so we understand each other he finally said i nodded yeah i think we do before you talk to the media about this case you get it approved by my office first understand got it he turned and headed down the hall his entourage followed i remained in the hallway and watched them go the truth was there was nothing in the law that i objected to more than the death penalty it was not that i had ever had a client executed or even tried such a case it was simply a belief in the idea that an enlightened society did not kill its own but somehow that didnt stop me from using the threat of the death penalty as an edge in the case as i stood there alone in the hallway i thought that maybe that made me a better prosecutor than i had imagined i could be tuesday february pm it usually was the best moment of a case the drive downtown with a suspect handcuffed in the backseat there was nothing better sure there was the eventual payoff of a conviction down the line being in the courtroom when the verdict is readwatching the reality shock and then deaden the eyes of the convicted but the drive in was always better more immediate and personal it was always the moment bosch savored the chase was over and the case was about to morph from the relentless momentum of the investigation to the measured pace of the prosecution but this time was different it had been a long two days and bosch wasnt savoring anything he and his partner david chu had driven up to corta madera the day before checking into a motel off the and spending the night in the morning they drove over to san quentin presented a court order that transferred custody of jason jessup to them and then collected their prisoner for the drive back to los angeles seven hours each way with a partner who talked too much seven hours on the return with a suspect who didnt talk enough they were now at the top of the san fernando valley and an hour from the city jail in downtown la boschs back hurt from so many hours behind the wheel his right calf muscle ached from applying pressure to the gas pedal the city car did not have cruise control chu had offered to drive but bosch had said no chu religiously stuck to the speed limit even on the freeway bosch would take the backache over an extra hour on the freeway and the anxiety it would create all of this aside he drove in uneasy silence brooding about a case that seemed to be proceeding backwards he had been on it for only a few days hadnt had the opportunity to even become acquainted with all the facts and here he was with the suspect hooked up and in the backseat to bosch it felt like the arrest was coming first and the investigation wouldnt really start until after jessup was booked he checked his watch and knew the scheduled press conference must be over by now the plan was for him to meet with haller and mcpherson at four to continue kicking around the case but by the time jessup was booked he would be late he also needed to go by lapd archives to pick up two boxes that were waiting for him harry whats wrong bosch glanced at chu nothings wrong he wasnt going to talk in front of the suspect besides he and chu had been partnered for less than a year it was a little soon for chu to be making reads off of boschs demeanor harry didnt want him to know that he had accurately deduced that he was uncomfortable jessup spoke from the backseat his first words since asking for a bathroom break outside of stockton whats wrong is that he doesnt have a case whats wrong is that he knows this whole thing is bullshit and he doesnt want to be part of it bosch checked jessup in the rearview mirror he was slightly hunched forward because his hands were cuffed and locked to a chain that went to a set of shackles around his ankles his head was shaved a routine prison practice among men hoping to intimidate others bosch guessed that with jessup it had probably worked i thought you didnt want to talk jessup you invoked yeah thats right ill just shut the fuck up and wait for my lawyer hes in san francisco i wouldnt hold my breath hes calling somebody the gjps got people all over the country we were ready for this really you were ready you mean you packed your cell up because you thought you were being transferred or was it because you thought you were going home jessup didnt have an answer for that one bosch merged onto the which would take them through the cahuenga pass and into hollywood before they reached downtown howd you get hooked up with the genetic justice project jessup he asked trying once again to get something going you go to them or they come to you website man i sent in my appeal and they saw the bullshit going on in my case they took it over and here i am you people are totally fucked if you think youre going to win this i was railroaded by you motherfuckers once before aint gonna happen again in two months thisll all be over ive been in twentyfour years whats two more months just makes my book rights more valuable i guess i should be thanking you and the district attorney for that bosch glanced at the mirror again normally he would love a talkative suspect most times they talked themselves right into prison but jessup was too smart and too cagey he chose his words carefully stayed away from talking about the crime itself and wouldnt be making a mistake that bosch could use in the mirror now bosch could see jessup staring out the window no telling what he was thinking about his eyes looked dead bosch could see the top of a prison ink tattoo on his neck just breaking the collar line it looked like part of a word but he couldnt tell for sure welcome to la jessup chu said without turning around guess its been a while huh fuck you you chink motherfucker jessup retorted thisll all be over soon and then ill be out and on the beach im going to get a longboard and ride some tasty waves dont count on it killer chu said youre going down we got you by the balls bosch knew chu was trying to provoke a response a slip of the tongue but he was coming off as an amateur and jessup was too wise for him harry grew tired of the backandforth even after six hours of almost complete silence he turned on the cars radio and caught the tail end of a report on the das press conference he turned it up so jessup would hear and chu would keep quiet williams and haller refused to comment on the evidence but indicated they were not as impressed with the dna analysis as the states supreme court was haller acknowledged that the dna found on the victims dress did not come from jessup but he said the findings did not clear him of involvement in the crime haller is a wellknown defense attorney and will be prosecuting a murder case for the first time it did not sound this morning as though he has any hesitation we will once again be seeking the death penalty on this case bosch flicked the volume down and checked the mirror jessup was still looking out the window how about that jessup hes going for the jesus juice jessup responded tiredly assholes posturing besides they dont execute anybody in this state anymore you know what death row means it means you get a cell all to yourself and you control whats on the tv it means better access to phone food and visitors fuck it i hope he does go for it man but it wont matter this is bullshit this whole thing is bullshit its all about the money the last line floated out there for a long moment before bosch finally bit what money my money you watch man theyll come at me with a deal my lawyer told me theyll want me to take a deal and plead to time served so they dont have to pay me the money thats all this fucking is and you two are just the deliverymen fuckin fedex bosch was silent he wondered if it could be true jessup was suing the city and county for millions could it be that the retrial was simply a political move designed to save money both government entities were selfinsured juries loved hitting faceless corporations and bureaucracies with obscenely large judgments a jury believing prosecutors and police had corruptly imprisoned an innocent man for twentyfour years would be beyond generous a hit from an eightfigure judgment could be devastating to both city and county coffers even if they were splitting the bill but if they jammed jessup and maneuvered him into a deal in which he acknowledged guilt to gain his freedom then the lawsuit would go away so would all the book and movie money he was counting on makes a lot of sense doesnt it jessup said bosch checked the mirror and realized that now jessup was studying him he turned his eyes back to the road he felt his phone vibrate and pulled it out of his jacket you want me to take it harry chu asked a reminder that it was illegal to talk on a phone while driving an automobile bosch ignored him and took the call it was lieutenant gandle harry you close getting off the oneohone good i just wanted to give you a headsup theyre lining up at intake comb your hair got it but maybe ill give my partner the airtime bosch glanced over at chu but didnt explain either way gandle said whats next he invoked so we just book him then i have to go back to the war room and meet with the prosecutors ive got questions harry do they have this guy or not bosch checked jessup in the mirror he was back to looking out the window i dont know lieutenant when i know youll know a few minutes later they pulled into the rear lot of the jail there were several television cameras and their operators lined up on a ramp leading to the intake door chu sat up straight perp walk harry yeah you take him in lets both do it nah ill hang back you sure im sure just dont forget my cuffs okay harry the lot was clogged with media vans with their transmitters cranked to full height but they had left the space in front of the ramp open bosch pulled in and parked okay you ready back there jessup chu asked time to sell tickets jessup didnt respond chu opened the door and got out then opened the rear door for jessup bosch watched the ensuing spectacle from the confines of the car tuesday february pm one of the very best things about having previously been married to maggie mcpherson was that i never had to face her in court the marital split created a conflict of interest that saved me professional defeat and humiliation at her hands on more than one occasion she was truly the best prosecutor id ever seen step into the well and they didnt call her maggie mcfierce for no reason now for the first time we would be on the same team in court sitting side by side at the same table but what had seemed like such a good ideanot to mention such a positive potential payoff for maggiewas already manifesting itself as something jagged and rusty maggie was having issues with being second chair and for good reason she was a professional prosecutor from drug dealers and petty thieves to rapists and murderers she had put dozens of criminals behind bars i had appeared in dozens of trials myself but never as a prosecutor maggie would have to play backup to a novice and that realization wasnt sitting well with her we sat in conference room a with the case files spread out before us on the big table though williams had said i could run the case from my own independent office the truth was that wasnt practical at the moment i didnt have an office outside my home i primarily used the backseat of my lincoln town car as my office and that wouldnt do for the people versus jason jessup i had my case manager setting up a temporary office in downtown but we were at least a few days away from that so temporarily there we sat eyes down and tensions up maggie i said when it comes to prosecuting bad guys i will readily admit that i couldnt carry your lunch but the thing is when it comes to politics and prosecuting bad guys the powers that be have put me in the first chair thats the way it is and we can either accept it or not i took this job and asked for you if you dont think we i just dont like the idea of carrying your briefcase through this whole thing maggie said you wont be look press conferences and outward appearances are one thing but i fully assume that well be working as a tag team youll be conducting just as much of the investigation as i will be probably more the trial should be no different well come up with a strategy and choreograph it together but you have to give me a little credit i know my way around a courtroom ill just be sitting at the other table this time thats where youre wrong mickey on the defense side you have a responsibility to one person your client when you are a prosecutor you represent the people and that is a lot more responsibility thats why they call it the burden of proof whatever if youre saying i shouldnt be doing this then im not the guy you should be complaining to go down the hall and talk to your boss but if he kicks me off the case you get kicked as well and then you go back to van nuys for the rest of your career is that what you want she didnt answer and that was an answer in itself okay then i said lets just try to get through this without pulling each others hair out okay remember im not here to count convictions and advance my career for me its one and done so we both want the same thing yes you will have to help me but you will also be helping my phone started vibrating i had left it out on the table i didnt recognize the number on the screen but took the call just to get away from the conversation with maggie haller hey mick howd i do who is this sticks sticks was a freelance videographer who fed footage to the local news channels and sometimes even the bigs i had known him so long i didnt even remember his real name howd you do at what sticks im busy here at the press conference i set you up man i realized that it had been sticks behind the lights throwing the questions to me oh yeah yeah you did good thanks for that now youre going to take care of me on the case right give me the headsup if theres something for me right something exclusive yeah no need to worry sticks i got you covered but i gotta go i ended the call and put the phone back on the table maggie was typing something into her laptop it looked like the momentary discontent had passed and i was hesitant to touch it again that was a guy who works for the news stations he might be useful to us at some point we dont want to do anything underhanded the prosecution is held to a much higher standard of ethics than the defense i shook my head i couldnt win thats bullshit and i am not talking about doing anything un the door opened and harry bosch stepped in pushing the door with his back because he was carrying two large boxes in his hands sorry im late he said he put the boxes down on the table i could tell the larger one was a carton from evidence archives i guessed that the smaller one contained the police file on the original investigation it took them three days to find the murder box it was on the eightyfive aisle instead of eightysix he looked at me and then at maggie and then back at me so whatd i miss war break out in the war room we were talking about prosecutorial tactics and it turns out we have opposing views imagine that he took the chair at the end of the table i could tell he was going to have more to say he lifted the top off the murder box and pulled out three accordion files and put them on the table he then moved the box to the floor you know mick while were airing out our differences i think before you pulled me into this little soap opera you shouldve told me a few things up front like what harry like that this whole goddamn thing is about money and not murder what are you talking about what money bosch just stared at me without responding youre talking about jessups lawsuit i asked thats right he said i had an interesting discussion with jessup today on the drive down got me thinking and it crossed my mind that if we jam this guy into a deal the lawsuit against the city and county goes away because a guy who admits to murder isnt going to be able to sue and claim he was railroaded so i guess what i want to know is what were really doing here are we trying to put a murder suspect on trial or are we just trying to save the city and county a few million bucks i noticed maggies posture straighten as she considered the same thing you gotta be kidding me she said if that hold on hold on i interjected lets be cool about this i dont think thats the case here okay its not that i havent thought about it but williams didnt say one word about going for a dispo on this case he told me to take it to trial in fact he assumes it will go to trial for the same reason you just mentioned jessup will never take a dispo for time served or anything else because there is no pot of gold in that no book no movie no payout from the city if he wants the money hes got to go to trial and win maggie nodded slowly as if weighing a valid supposition bosch didnt seem appeased at all but how would you know what williams is up to he asked youre an outsider they couldve brought you in wound you up and pointed you in the right direction and then sat back to watch you go hes right maggie added jessup doesnt even have a defense attorney as soon as he does hell start talking deal i raised my hands in a calming gesture look at the press conference today i threw out that we were going for the death penalty i just did that to see how williams would react he didnt expect it and afterward he pressed me in the hallway he told me that it wasnt a decision i got to make i told him it was just strategy that i wanted jessup to start thinking about a deal and it gave williams pause he didnt see it if he was thinking of a deal just to blow up the civil action i would have been able to read it im good at reading people i could tell i still hadnt quite won bosch over remember last year with the two men from hong kong who wanted your ass on the next plane to china i read them right and i played them right in his eyes i saw bosch relent that china story was a reminder that he owed me one and i was collecting okay he said so what do we do we assume jessups going to go to trial as soon as he lawyers up well know for sure but we start preparing for it now because if i was going to represent him i would refuse to waive speedy trial i would try to jam the prosecution on time to prepare and make the people put up or shut up i checked the date on my watch if im right that gives us fortyeight days till trial weve got a lot of work to do between now and then we looked at one another and sat in silence for a few moments before i threw the lead to maggie maggie has spent the better part of the last week with the prosecution file on this harry i know what you just brought in will have a lot of overlap but why dont we start here by having mags go through the case as presented at trial in eightysix i think that will give us a good starting point of looking at what we need to do this time out bosch nodded his approval and i signaled for maggie to begin she pulled her laptop over in front of her okay a couple of basics first because it was a death penalty case jury selection was the longest part of the trial almost three weeks the trial itself lasted seven days and then there were three days of deliberation on the initial verdicts then the death penalty phase went another two weeks but seven days of testimony and argumentsthat to me is fast for a capital murder case it was pretty cutanddried and the defense well there wasnt much of a defense she looked at me as if i were responsible for the poor defense of the accused even though i hadnt even gotten out of law school by eightysix who was his lawyer i asked charles barnard she said i checked with the california bar he wont be handling the retrial hes listed as deceased as of ninetyfour the prosecutor gary lintz is also long gone dont remember either of them who was the judge walter sackville hes long retired but i do remember him he was tough i had a few cases with him bosch added he wouldnt take any shit from either side go on i said okay so the prosecutions story was this the landy familythat was our victim melissa who was twelve her thirteenyearold sister sarah mother regina and stepfather kensingtonlived on windsor boulevard in hancock park the home was about a block north of wilshire and in the vicinity of the trinity united church of god which on sundays back then drew about six thousand people to its two morning services people parked their cars all over hancock park to go to the church that is until the residents there got tired of their neighborhood being overrun every sunday with traffic and parking issues and went to city hall about it they got the neighborhood turned into a residential parking zone during weekend hours you had to have a sticker to park on the streets including windsor this opened the door to citycontracted tow truck operators patrolling the neighborhood like sharks on sunday morning any cars without the proper resident sticker on the windshield were fair game they got towed which finally brings us to jason jessup our suspect he drove a tow truck i said exactly he was a driver for a city contractor named aardvark towing cute name got them to the front of the listings in the phone book back when people still used phone books i glanced at bosch and could tell by his reaction that he was somebody who still used the phone book instead of the internet maggie didnt notice and continued on the morning in question jessup was working the hancock park patrol at the landy house the family happened to be putting a pool in the backyard kensington landy was a musician who scored films and was doing quite well at the time so they were putting in a pool and there was a large open hole and giant piles of dirt in the backyard the parents didnt want the girls playing back there thought it was dangerous plus on this morning the girls were in their church dresses the house has a large front yard the stepfather told the girls to play outside for a few minutes before the family was planning to go off to church themselves the older one sarah was told to watch over melissa did they go to trinity united i asked no they went to sacred heart in beverly hills anyway the kids were only out there about fifteen minutes mother was still upstairs getting ready and the stepfather who was also supposed to be keeping an eye on the girls was watching television inside an overnight sports report on espn or whatever they had back then he forgot about the girls bosch shook his head and i knew exactly how he felt it was not in judgment of the father but in understanding of how it could have happened and in the dread of any parent who knows how a small mistake could be so costly at some point he heard screaming maggie continued he ran out the front door and found the older girl sarah in the yard she was screaming that a man took melissa the stepfather ran up the street looking for her but there was no sign like that she was gone my exwife stopped there for a moment to compose herself everyone in the room had a young daughter and could understand the shearing of life that happened at that moment for every person in the landy family police were called and the response was quick she continued this was hancock park after all the first bulletins were out in a matter of minutes detectives were dispatched right away so this whole thing went down in broad daylight bosch asked maggie nodded it happened about tenforty the landys were going to an eleven oclock service and nobody else saw this you gotta remember this was hancock park a lot of tall hedges a lot of walls a lot of privacy people there are good at keeping the world out nobody saw anything nobody heard anything until sarah started screaming and by then it was too late was there a wall or a hedge at the landy house sixfoot hedges down the north and south property lines but not on the street side it was theorized at the time that jessup drove by in his tow truck and saw the girl alone in the yard then he acted impulsively we sat in silence for a few moments as we thought about the wrenching serendipity of fate a tow truck goes by a house the driver sees a girl alone and vulnerable all in a moment he figures he can grab her and get away with it so bosch finally said how did they get him the responding detectives were on the scene in less than an hour the lead was named doral kloster and his partner was chad steiner i checked steiner is dead and kloster is retired and has latestage alzheimers hes no use to us now damn bosch said anyway they got there quickly and moved quickly they interviewed sarah and she described the abductor as being dressed like a garbage man further questioning revealed this to mean that he was wearing dirty coveralls like the city garbage crews used she said she heard the garbage truck in the street but couldnt see it through a bush where she had hidden from her sister during a game of hideandseek problem is that it was a sunday there was no garbage pickup on sundays but the stepfather hears this and puts it together mentions the tow trucks that run up and down the street on sunday mornings that becomes their best lead the detectives get the list of city contractors and they start visiting tow yards there were three contractors who worked the wilshire corridor one of them is aardvark where they go and are told they have three trucks working in the field the drivers are called in and jessup is one of them the other two guys are named derek wilbern and william clintonreally theyre separated and questioned but nothing comes up suspicious they run em through the box and jessup and clinton are clean but wilbern has an arrest but no conviction on an attempted rape two years before that would be good enough to get him a ride downtown for a lineup but the girl is still missing and theres no time for formalities no time to put together a lineup they probably took him back to the house bosch said they had no choice they had to keep things moving thats right but kloster knew he was on thin ice he might get the girl to id wilbern but then hed lose it in court for being unduly suggestiveyou know is this the guy so he did the next best thing he could he took all three drivers in their overalls back to the landy house each was a white man in his twenties they all wore the company overalls kloster broke procedure for the sake of speed hoping to have a chance to find the girl alive sarah landys bedroom was on the second floor in the front of the house kloster takes the girl up to her room and has her look out the window to the street through the venetian blinds he radios his partner who has the three guys get out of two patrol cars and stand in the street but sarah doesnt id wilbern she points to jessup and says thats the guy maggie looked through the documents in front of her and checked an investigative chronology before continuing the id is made at one oclock that is really quick work the girls only been gone a little over two hours they start sweating jessup but he doesnt give up a thing denies it all they are working on him and getting nowhere when the call comes in a girls body has been found in a dumpster behind the el rey theatre on wilshire that was about ten blocks from windsor and the landy house cause of death would later be determined to be manual strangulation she was not raped and there was no semen in the mouth or throat maggie stopped her summary there she looked at bosch and then me and solemnly nodded giving the dead her moment tuesday february pm bosch liked watching her and listening to the way she talked he could tell the case was already under her skin maggie mcfierce of course that was what they called her more important it was what she thought about herself he had been on the case with her for less than a week but he understood this within the first hour of meeting her she knew the secret that it wasnt about code and procedure it wasnt about jurisprudence and strategy it was about taking that dark thing that you knew was out there in the world and bringing it inside making it yours forging it over an internal fire into something sharp and strong that you could hold in your hands and fight back with relentlessly jessup asked for a lawyer and gave no further statement mcpherson said continuing her summary the case was initially built around the older sisters identification and evidence found in jessups tow truck three strands of the victims hair found in the seat crack it was probably where he strangled her there was nothing on the girl bosch asked nothing from jessup or the truck nothing usable in court the dna was found on her dress while it was being examined two days later it was actually the older girls dress the younger girl borrowed it that day one small deposit of semen was found on the front hem it was typed but of course there was no dna in criminal prosecutions back then a blood type was determined and it was apositive the secondmost popular type among humans accounting for thirtyfour percent of the population jessup matched but all it did was include him in the suspect pool the prosecutor decided not to introduce it at trial because it wouldve just given the defense the ability to point out to the jury that the donor pool was more than a million men in los angeles county alone bosch saw her throw another look at her exhusband as if he were responsible for the courtroom obfuscations of all defense attorneys everywhere harry was starting to get an idea about why their marriage didnt work out its amazing how far weve come haller said now they make and break cases on the dna alone moving on mcpherson said the prosecution had the hair evidence and the eyewitness it also had opportunityjessup knew the neighborhood and was working there the morning of the murder as far as motivation went their backgrounding of jessup produced a history of physical abuse by his father and psychopathic behavior a lot of this came out on the record during the death penalty phase too butand i will say this before you jump on it hallerno criminal convictions and you said no sexual assault bosch asked no evidence of penetration or sexual assault but this was no doubt a sexually motivated crime the semen aside it was a classic control crime the perpetrator seizing momentary control in a world where he felt he controlled very little he acted impulsively at the time the semen found on her dress was a piece of the same puzzle it was theorized that he killed the girl and then masturbated cleaning up after himself but leaving one small deposit of semen on the dress by mistake the stain had the appearance of a transfer deposit it wasnt a drop it was a smear the hit we just got on the dna helps explain that haller said possibly mcpherson responded but lets discuss new evidence later right now im talking about what they had and what they knew in nineteen eightysix fine go on thats it on the evidence but not on the prosecutions case two months before trial they get a call from the guy whos in the cell next to jessup at county he jailhouse snitches haller said interrupting never met one who told the truth never met a prosecutor who didnt use them anyway can i continue mcpherson asked indignantly please do haller responded felix turner a repeat drug offender who was in and out of county so often that they made him a jail orderly because he knew the daytoday operations as well as the deputies he delivered meals to inmates in highpower lockdown he tells investigators that jessup provided him with details that only the killer would know he was interviewed and he did indeed have details of the crime that were not made public like that the victims shoes were removed that she was not sexually assaulted that he had wiped himself off on her dress and so they believed him and made him the star witness haller said they believed him and put him on the stand at trial not as a star witness but his testimony was significant nevertheless four years later the times comes out with a frontpage exposé on felix the burner turner professional jailhouse snitch who had testified for the prosecution in sixteen different cases over a sevenyear period garnering significant reductions in charges and jail time and other perks like private cells good jobs and large quantities of cigarettes bosch remembered the scandal it rocked the das office in the early nineties and resulted in changes in the use of jailhouse informants as trial witnesses it was one of many black eyes local law enforcement suffered in the decade turner was discredited in the newspaper investigation it said he used a private investigator on the outside to gather information on crimes and then to feed it to him as you may remember it changed how we used information that comes to us through the jails not enough haller said it didnt end the entire use of jailhouse snitches and it should have can we just focus on our case here mcpherson said obviously tired of hallers posturing sure haller said lets focus okay well by the time the times came out with all of this jessup had long been convicted and was sitting in san quentin he of course launched an appeal citing police and prosecutorial misconduct it went nowhere fast with every appellate panel agreeing that while the use of turner as a witness was egregious his impact on the jury was not enough to have changed the verdict the rest of the evidence was more than enough to convict and that was that haller said they rubberstamped it an interesting note is that felix turner was found murdered in west hollywood a year after the times exposé mcpherson said the case was never solved had it coming as far as im concerned haller added that brought a pause to the discussion bosch used it to steer the meeting back to the evidence and to step in with some questions he had been considering is the hair evidence still available it took mcpherson a moment to drop felix turner and go back to the evidence yes we still have it she said this case is twentyfour years old but it was always under challenge thats where jessup and his jailhouse lawyering actually helped us he was constantly filing writs and appeals so the trial evidence was never destroyed of course that eventually allowed him to get the dna analysis off the swatch cut from the dress but we still have all trial evidence and will be able to use it he has claimed since day one that the hair in the truck was planted by the police i dont think his defense at retrial will be much different from what was presented at his first trial and in his appeals haller said the girl made the wrong id in a prejudicial setting and from then on it was a rush to judgment facing a monumental lack of physical evidence the police planted hair from the victim in his tow truck it didnt play so well before a jury in eightysix but that was before rodney king and the riots in ninetytwo the oj simpson case the rampart scandal and all the other controversies that have engulfed the police department since its probably going to play really well now so then what are our chances bosch asked haller looked across the table at mcpherson before answering based on what we know so far he said i think id have a better chance if i were on the other side of the aisle on this one bosch saw mcphersons eyes grow dark well then maybe you should cross back over haller shook his head no i made a deal it may have been a bad deal but im sticking to it besides its not often i get to be on the side of might and right i could get used to thateven in a losing cause he smiled at his exwife but she didnt return the sentiment what about the sister bosch asked mcpherson swung her gaze toward him the witness thats our second problem if shes alive then shes thirtyseven now finding her is the problem no help from the parents her real father died when she was seven her mother committed suicide on her sisters grave three years after the murder and the stepfather drank himself into liver failure and died while waiting for a transplant six years ago i had one of the investigators here do a quick rundown on her on the computer and sarah landys trail drops off in san francisco about the same time her stepfather died that same year she also cleared a probation tail for a controlled substance conviction records show shes been married and divorced twice arrested multiple times for drugs and petty crimes and then like i said she dropped off the grid she either died or cleaned up her act even if she changed names her prints would have left a trail if shed been popped again in the past six years but theres nothing i dont think we have much of a case if we dont have her haller said were going to need a real live person to point the finger across twentyfour years and say he did it i agree mcpherson said shes key the jury will need to hear the woman tell them that as a girl she did not make a mistake that she was sure then and she is sure now if we cant find her and get her to do that then we have the victims hair to go with and thats about it theyll have the dna and that will trump everything and we will go down in flames haller said mcpherson didnt respond but she didnt have to dont worry bosch said ill find her the two lawyers looked at him it wasnt a time for empty rahrah speeches he meant it if shes alive he said ill find her good haller said thatll be your first priority bosch took out his key chain and opened the small penknife attached to it he used it to cut the red seal on the evidence box he had no idea what would be in the box the evidence that had been introduced at trial twentyfour years earlier was still in the possession of the das office this box would contain other evidence that was gathered but not presented at trial bosch put on a set of latex gloves from his pocket and then opened the box on top was a paper bag that contained the victims dress it was a surprise he had assumed that the dress had been introduced at trial if only for the sympathetic response it would get from the jurors opening the bag brought a musty smell to the room he lifted the dress out holding it up by the shoulders all three of them were silent bosch was holding up a dress that a little girl had been wearing when she was murdered it was blue with a darker blue bow in the front a sixinch square had been cut out of the front hem the location of the semen stain why is this here bosch asked wouldnt they have presented this at trial haller said nothing mcpherson leaned forward and looked closely at the dress as she considered a response i think they didnt show it because of the cutout showing the dress would let the defense ask about the cutout that would lead to the bloodtyping the prosecution chose not to get into it during the presentation of the evidence they probably relied on crime scene photos that showed the girl in the dress they left it to the defense to introduce it and they never did bosch folded the dress and put it down on the table also in the box was a pair of black patent leather shoes they seemed very small and sad to him there was a second paper bag which contained the victims underwear and socks an accompanying lab report stated that the items had been checked for bodily fluids as well as hair and fiber evidence but no such evidence had been found at the bottom of the box was a plastic bag containing a silver necklace with a charm on it he looked at it through the plastic and identified the figure on the charm as winnie the pooh there was also a bag containing a bracelet of aquablue beads on an elastic string thats it he said we should have forensics take a fresh look at it all mcpherson said you never know technology has advanced quite a bit in twentyfour years ill get it done bosch said by the way mcpherson asked where were the shoes found theyre not on the victims feet in the crime scene photos bosch looked at the property report that was taped to the inside of the boxs top according to this they were found underneath the body they mustve come off in the truck maybe when she was strangled the killer threw them into the dumpster first then dropped in her body the images conjured by the items in the box had brought a decidedly somber mood to the prosecution team bosch started to carefully return everything to the box he put the envelope containing the necklace in last how old was your daughter when she left winnie the pooh behind he asked haller and mcpherson looked at each other haller deferred five or six mcpherson said why mine too i think but this twelveyearold had it on her necklace i wonder why maybe because of where it came from haller said hayleyour daughterstill wears a bracelet i got for her about five years ago mcpherson looked at him as if challenging the assertion not all the time haller said quickly but on occasion sometimes when i pick her up maybe the necklace came from her real father before he died a low chime came from mcphersons computer and she checked her email she studied the screen for a few moments before speaking this is from john rivas who handles afternoon arraignments in department one hundred jessups now got a criminal defense attorney and johns working on getting jessup on the docket for a bail hearing hes coming over on the last bus from city jail whos the lawyer haller asked youll love this clever clive royce is taking the case pro bono its a referral from the gjp bosch knew the name royce was a highprofile guy who was a media darling who never missed a chance to stand in front of a camera and say all the things he wasnt allowed to say in court of course hes taking it pro bono haller said hell make it up on the back end sound bites and headlines thats all clive cares about ive never gone up against him mcpherson said i cant wait is jessup actually on the docket not yet but royce is talking to the clerk rivas wants to know if we want him to handle it hell oppose bail no well take it haller said lets go mcpherson closed her computer at the same time bosch put the top back on the evidence box you want to come haller asked him get a look at the enemy i just spent seven hours with him remember i dont think he was talking about jessup mcpherson said bosch nodded no ill pass he said im going to take this stuff over to sid and get to work on tracking down our witness ill let you know when i find her tuesday february pm department was the largest courtroom in the ccb and reserved for morning and evening arraignment court the twin intake points of the local justice system all those charged with crimes had to be brought before a judge within twentyfour hours and in the ccb this required a large courtroom with a large gallery section where the families and friends of the accused could sit the courtroom was used for first appearances after arrest when the loved ones were still naive about the lengthy devastating and difficult journey the defendant was embarking upon at arraignment it was not unusual to have mom dad wife sisterinlaw aunt uncle and even a neighbor or two in the courtroom in a show of support for the defendant and outrage at his arrest in another eighteen months when the case would grind to a finale at sentencing the defendant would be lucky to have even dear old mom still in attendance the other side of the gate was usually just as crowded with lawyers of all stripes grizzled veterans bored public defenders slick cartel reps wary prosecutors and media hounds all mingled in the well or stood against the glass partition surrounding the prisoner pen and whispered to their clients presiding over this anthill was judge malcolm firestone who sat with his head down and his sharp shoulders jutting up and closer to his ears with each passing year his black robe gave them the appearance of folded wings and the overall image was one of firestone as a vulture waiting impatiently to dine on the bloody detritus of the justice system firestone handled the evening arraignment docket which started at three pm and went as far into the night as the list of detainees required consequently he was a jurist who liked to keep things moving you had to act fast in one hundred or risk being run over and left behind in here justice was an assembly line with a conveyor belt that never stopped turning firestone wanted to get home the lawyers wanted to get home everybody wanted to get home i entered the courtroom with maggie and immediately saw the cameras being set up in a sixfoot corral to the left side across the courtroom from the glass pen that housed defendants brought in six at a time without the glare of spotlights this time i saw my friend sticks setting the legs of the tool that provided his nickname his tripod he saw me and gave me a nod and i returned it maggie tapped me on the arm and pointed toward a man seated at the prosecution table with three other lawyers thats rivas on the end okay you go talk to him while i check in with the clerk you dont have to check in haller youre a prosecutor remember oh cool i forgot we headed over to the prosecution table and maggie introduced me to rivas the prosecutor was a baby lawyer probably no more than a few years out of a topranked law school my guess was that he was biding his time playing office politics and waiting to make a move up the ladder and out of the hellhole of arraignment court it didnt help that i had come from across the aisle to grab the golden ring of the offices current caseload by his body language i registered his wariness i was at the wrong table i was the fox in the henhouse and i knew that before the hearing was over i was going to confirm his suspicions after the perfunctory handshake i looked around for clive royce and found him seated against the railing conferring with a young woman who was probably his associate they were leaning toward each other looking into an open folder with a thick sheaf of documents in it i approached with my hand out clive the barrister royce hows it hanging old chap he looked up and a smile immediately creased his welltanned face like a perfect gentleman he stood up before accepting my hand mickey how are you im sorry it looks like were going to be opposing counsel on this one i knew he was sorry but not too sorry royce had built his career on picking winners he would not risk going pro bono and stepping into a heavy media case if he didnt think it would amount to free advertising and another victory he was in it to win it and behind the smile was a set of sharp teeth me too and i am sure you will make me regret the day i crossed the aisle well i guess were both fulfilling our public duty yes you helping out the district attorney and me taking on jessup on the cuff royce still carried an english accent even though he had lived more than half his fifty years in the united states it gave him an aura of culture and distinction that belied his practice of defending people accused of heinous crimes he wore a threepiece suit with a barely discernible chalk line in the gabardine his bald pate was well tanned and smooth his beard dyed black and groomed to the very last hair thats one way of looking at it i said oh where are my manners mickey this is my associate denise graydon shell be assisting me in the defense of mr jessup graydon stood up and shook my hand firmly nice to meet you i said i looked around to see if maggie was standing nearby and could be introduced but she was huddled with rivas at the prosecution table well i said to royce did you get your client on the docket i did indeed hell be first in the group after this one ive already gone back and visited and well be ready to make a motion for bail i was wondering though since we have a few minutes could we step out into the corridor for a word sure clive lets do it now royce told his associate to wait in the courtroom and retrieve us when the next group of defendants was brought into the glass cage i followed royce through the gate and down the aisle between the crowded rows of the gallery we went through the mantrap and into the hallway you want to get a cup of tea royce asked i dont think theres time whats up clive royce folded his arms and got serious i must tell you mick that i am not out to embarrass you you are a friend and colleague in the defense bar but you have gotten yourself into a nowin situation here yes what are we going to do about it i smiled and glanced up and down the crowded hallway nobody was paying attention to us are you saying that your client wants to plead this out on the contrary there will be no plea negotiation on this matter the district attorney has made the wrong choice and its very clear what maneuver he is undertaking here and how he is using you as a pawn in the process i must put you on notice that if you insist on taking jason jessup to trial then you are going to embarrass yourself as a professional courtesy i just thought i needed to tell you this before i could answer graydon came out of the courtroom and headed quickly toward us somebody in the first group is not ready so jessups been moved up and was just brought out well be in straightaway royce said she hesitated and then realized her boss wanted her to go back into the courtroom she went back through the doors and royce turned his attention back to me i spoke before he could i appreciate your courtesy and concern clive but if your client wants a trial hell get a trial well be ready and well see who gets embarrassed and who goes back to prison brilliant then i look forward to the contest i followed him back inside court was in session and on my way down the aisle i saw lorna taylor my office manager and second exwife sitting at the end of one of the crowded rows i leaned over to whisper hey what are you doing here i had to come see the big moment how did you even know i just found out fifteen minutes ago i guess so did knx i was already down here to look at office space and heard it on the radio that jessup was going to appear in court so i came well thanks for being here lorna how is the search going i really need to get out of this building soon i have three more showings after this thatll be enough ill let you know my final choices tomorrow okay yeah thats i heard jessups name called by the clerk look i gotta get in there well talk later go get em mickey i found an empty seat waiting for me next to maggie at the prosecution table rivas had moved to the row of seats against the gate royce had moved to the glass cage where he was whispering to his client jessup was wearing an orange jumpsuitthe jail uniformand looked calm and subdued he was nodding to everything royce whispered in his ear he somehow seemed younger than i had thought he would i guess i expected all of those years in prison to have taken their toll i knew he was fortyeight but he looked no older than forty he didnt even have a jailhouse pallor his skin was pale but it looked healthy especially next to the overtanned royce where did you go maggie whispered to me i thought i was going to have to handle this myself i was just outside conferring with defense counsel do you have the charges handy in case i have to read them into the record you wont have to enter the charges all you have to do is stand up and say that you believe jessup is a flight risk and a danger to the community he but i dont believe hes a flight risk his lawyer just told me theyre ready to go and that theyre not interested in a disposition he wants the money and the only way hell get it is to stick around and go to trialand win so she seemed astonished and looked down at the files stacked in front of her mags your philosophy is to argue everything and give no quarter i dont think thats going to work here i have a strategy and she turned and leaned in closer to me then ill just leave you and your strategy and your bald buddy from the defense bar to it she pushed back her chair and got up grabbing her briefcase from the floor maggie she charged through the gate and headed toward the rear door of the courtroom i watched her go knowing that while i didnt like the result i had needed to set the lines of our prosecutorial relationship jessups name was called and royce identified himself for the record i then stood and said the words i never expected i would say michael haller for the people even judge firestone looked up from his perch peering at me over a pair of reading glasses probably for the first time in weeks something out of the ordinary had occurred in his courtroom a dyedinthewool defense attorney had stood for the people well gentlemen this is an arraignment court and i have a note here saying you want to talk about bail jessup was charged twentyfour years ago with murder and abduction when the supreme court reversed his conviction it did not throw out the charges that had been left to the das office so he still stood accused of the crimes and his notguilty plea of twentyfour years ago remained in place the case now had to be assigned to a courtroom and a judge for trial a motion to discuss bail would usually be delayed until that point except that jessup through royce was pushing the issue forward by coming to firestone your honor royce said my client was already arraigned twentyfour years ago what we would like to do today is discuss a motion for bail and to move this case along to trial mr jessup has waited a long time for his freedom and for justice he has no intention of waiving his right to a speedy trial i knew it was the move royce would make because it was the move i would have made every person accused of a crime is guaranteed a speedy trial most often trials are delayed at the defenses request or acquiescence as both sides want time to prepare as a pressure tactic royce was not going to suspend the speedytrial statute with a case and evidence twentyfour years old not to mention a primary witness whose whereabouts were at the moment unknown it was not only prudent but a nobrainer to put the prosecution on the clock when the supreme court reversed the conviction that clock started ticking the people had sixty days from that point to bring jessup to trial twelve of them had already gone by i can move the case to the clerk for assignment firestone said and i would prefer that the assigned judge handle the question of bail royce composed his thoughts for a moment before responding in doing so he turned his body slightly so the cameras would have a better angle on him your honor my client has been falsely incarcerated for twentyfour years and those arent just my words thats the opinion of the state supreme court now they have pulled him out of prison and brought him down here so he can face trial once again this is all part of an ongoing scheme that has nothing to do with justice and everything to do with money and politics its about avoiding responsibility for corruptly taking a mans freedom to put this over until another hearing on another day would continue the travesty of justice that has beset jason jessup for more than two decades very well firestone still seemed put out and annoyed the assembly line had thrown a gear he had a docket that had probably started with more than seventyfive names on it and a desire to get through them in time to get home for dinner before eight royce was going to slow things down immeasurably with his request for a full debate on whether jessup should be allowed his release while awaiting trial but firestone like royce was about to get the surprise of the day if he didnt make it home in time for dinner it wouldnt be because of me royce asked the judge for an or meaning jessup would have to put up no money as bail and simply be released on his own recognizance this was just his opener he fully expected there to be a financial figure attached to jessups freedom if he was successful at all murder suspects didnt get ored in the rare instance when bail was granted in a murder case it usually came with a steep price tag whether jessup could raise the money through his supporters or from the book and movie deals he was supposedly negotiating was not germane to the discussion royce closed his request by arguing that jessup should not be considered a flight risk for the very same reason i had outlined to maggie he had no interest in running his only interest was in fighting to clear his name after twentyfour years of wrongful imprisonment mr jessup has no other purpose at this time than to stay put and prove once and for all that he is innocent and that he has paid a nightmarish price for the mistakes and misconduct of this district attorneys office the whole time royce spoke i watched jessup in the glass cage he knew the cameras were on him and he maintained a pose of rightful indignation despite his efforts he could not disguise the anger and hate in his eyes twentyfour years in prison had made that permanent firestone finished writing a note and then asked for my response i stood and waited until the judge looked up at me go ahead mr haller he prompted judge providing that mr jessup can show documentation of residence the state does not oppose bail at this time firestone stared at me for a long moment as he computed that my response was diametrically opposite to what he thought it would be the hushed sounds of the courtroom seemed to get even lower as the impact of my response was understood by every lawyer in the room did i get that right mr haller firestone said you are not objecting to an or release in a murder case that is correct your honor we are fully expecting mr jessup to show for trial theres no money in it for him if he doesnt your honor royce cried i object to mr haller infecting the record with such prejudicial pap directed solely at the media in attendance my client has no other purpose at this point than i understand mr royce firestone interjected but i think you did a fair amount of playing to the cameras yourself lets just leave it at that without objection from the prosecution i am releasing mr jessup on his own recognizance once he provides the clerk with documentation of residence mr jessup is not to leave los angeles county without permission of the court to which his case is assigned firestone then referred the case to the clerk of the courts office for reassignment to another department for trial we were now finally out of judge firestones orbit he could restart the assembly line and get home for dinner i picked up the files maggie had left behind and left the table royce was back at the seat at the railing dumping files into a leather briefcase his young associate was helping him how did it feel mick he asked me what being a prosecutor yes crossing the aisle not too much different to tell you the truth it was all procedure today you will be raked over the coals for letting my client walk out of here fuck em if they cant take a joke just make sure he stays clean clive if he doesnt then my ass really will be thrown on the fire and so will his no problem there well take care of him hes the least of your worries you know hows that clive you dont have much in the way of evidence cant find your main witness and the dna is a case killer youre captain of the titanic mickey and gabriel williams put you there makes me wonder what hes got on you out of all that he said i only wondered about one thing how did he know about the missing witness i of course didnt ask him or respond to his jab about what the da might have on me i played it like all the overconfident prosecutors i had ever gone up against tell your client to enjoy himself while hes out there clive because as soon as the verdict comes in hes going back inside royce smiled as he snapped his case closed he changed the subject when can we talk about discovery we can talk about it whenever you like ill start putting a file together in the morning good lets talk soon mick yes like i said anytime clive he headed over to the court deputys desk most likely to see about his clients release i pushed through the gate and connected with lorna and we left the courtroom together waiting for me outside was a small gathering of reporters and cameras the reporters shouted questions about my not objecting to bail and i told them no comment and walked on by they waited in place for royce to come out next i dont know mickey lorna confided how do you think the da is going to respond to the no bail just as she asked it my phone started beeping in my pocket i realized i had forgotten to turn it off in the courtroom that was an error that could have proven costly depending on firestones view of electronic interruptions while court was in session looking at the screen i said to lorna i dont know but i think im about to find out i held up the phone so she could see that the caller id said lada you take it im going to run be careful mickey she kissed me on the cheek and headed off to the elevator alcove i connected to the call i had guessed right it was gabriel williams haller what the hell are you doing what do you mean one of my people said you allowed jessup to walk on an or thats right then ill ask again what the hell are you doing look i no you look i dont know if you were just giving one of your buddies in the defense bar what he wanted or you are just stupid but you never let a murderer walk you understand me now i want you to go back in there and ask for a new hearing on bail no im not going to do that there was a hard silence for at least ten seconds before williams came back did i just hear you right haller i dont know what you heard williams but im not going back for a rehearing you have to understand something you gave me a bag of shit for a case and i have to do the best i can with it what evidence we do have is twentyfour years old we have a big hole blown in the side of the case with the dna and we have an eyewitness we cant find so that tells me i have to do whatever i can do to make this case and whats that got to do with letting this man out of jail dont you see man jessup has been in prison for twentyfour years it was no finishing school whatever he was when he went in hes worse now if hes on the outside hell fuck up and if he fucks up that only helps us so in other words you are putting the general public at risk while this guy is out there no because you are going to talk to the lapd and get them to watch this guy so nobody gets hurt and they are able to step in and grab him the minute he acts out another silence followed but this time i could hear muffled voices and i figured that williams was talking it over with his advisor joe ridell when his voice came back to me it was stern but had lost the tone of outrage okay this is what i want you to do when you want to make a move like this you come to me first you understand thats not going to happen you wanted an independent prosecutor thats what youve got take it or leave it there was a pause and then he hung up without further word i closed my phone and watched for a few moments as clive royce exited the courtroom and waded into the crowd of reporters and cameras like a seasoned expert he waited a moment for everyone to get their positions set and their lenses focused he then proceeded with the first of what would be many impromptu but carefully scripted press briefings i think the district attorneys office is running scared he began it was what i knew he would say i didnt need to listen to the rest i walked away wednesday february am some people dont want to be found they take measures they drag the branch behind them to confuse the trail some people are just running and they dont care what they leave in their wake whats important is that the past is behind them and that they keep moving away from it once he backchecked the da investigators work it took bosch only two hours to find a current name and address for their missing witness melissa landys older sister sarah she hadnt dragged a branch she had used the things that were close and just kept moving the das investigator who lost the trail in san francisco had not looked backwards for clues that was his mistake he had looked forward and hed found an empty trail bosch had started as his predecessor had typing the name sarah landy and birth date april into the computer the departments various search engines provided myriad points of impact with law enforcement and society first there were arrests on drug charges in and handled discreetly and sympathetically by the division of childrens services but she was beyond the reach and understanding of dys for similar charges in late and two more times in there was probation and a period of rehabilitation and this was followed by a few years during which she left no digital fingerprints at all another search site provided bosch with a series of addresses for her in los angeles in the early nineties harry recognized these as marginal neighborhoods where rents were probably low and drugs close by and easy to acquire sarahs illegal substance of choice was crystal meth a drug that burned away brain cells by the billions the trail on sarah landy the girl who had hidden behind the bushes and watched her younger sister get taken by a killer ended there bosch opened the first file he had retrieved from the murder box and looked at the witness information sheet for sarah he found her social security number and fed that along with the dob into the search engine this gave him two new names sarah edwards beginning in and sarah witten in with women changes of last names only were usually an indicator of marriage and the das investigator had reported finding records of two marriages under the name sarah edwards the arrests continued including two pops for property crimes and a tag for soliciting for prostitution but the arrests were spread far enough apart and perhaps her story was sad enough that once again she never saw any jail time bosch clicked through the mug shots for these arrests they showed a young woman with changing hairstyles and colors but the unwavering look of hurt and defiance in her eyes one mug shot showed a deep purple bruise under her left eye and open sores along her jawline the photos seemed to tell the story best a downward spiral of drugs and crime an internal wound that never healed a guilt never assuaged under the name sarah witten the arrests didnt change only the location she had probably realized she was wearing thin on the prosecutors and judges who had repeatedly given her breaksmost likely after reading the summary of her life contained in the presentencing investigations she moved north to san francisco and once again had frequent encounters with the law drugs and petty crime charges that often go hand in hand bosch checked the mug shots and saw a woman who looked old beyond her years she looked like she was forty before she was yet thirty in she did her first significant jail time when she was sentenced to six months in san mateo county jail after pleading guilty to a possession charge the records showed that she served four months in jail followed by a lockdown rehab program it was the last marker on the system for her no one with any of her names or social security number had been arrested since or applied for a drivers license in any of the fifty states bosch tried a few other digital maneuvers he had learned while working in the openunsolved unit where internet tracing was raised to an art form but could not pick up the trail sarah was gone putting the computer aside bosch took up the files from the murder box he started scanning the documents looking for clues that might help him track her he got more than a clue when he found a photocopy of sarahs birth certificate it was then that he remembered that she had been living with her mother and stepfather at the time of her sisters murder the birth name on the certificate was sarah ann gleason he entered it into the computer along with her birth date he found no criminal history under the name but he did find a washington state drivers license that had been established six years earlier and renewed just two months before he pulled up the photo and it was a match but barely bosch studied it for a long time he would have sworn that sarah ann gleason was getting younger his guess was that she had left the hard life behind she had found something that made her change maybe she had taken the cure maybe she had a child but something had changed her life for the better bosch next ran her name through another search engine and got utility and satellite hookups under her name the addresses matched the one on her drivers license bosch was sure he had found her port townsend he went onto google and typed it in soon he was looking at a map of the olympic peninsula in the northwest corner of washington sarah landy had changed her name three times and had run to the farthest tip of the continental united states but he had found her the phone rang as he was reaching for it it was lieutenant stephen wright commander of the lapds special investigation section i just wanted you to know that as of fifteen minutes ago were fully deployed on jessup the full units involved and well get you surveillance logs each morning if you need anything else or want to ride along at any point you call me thank you lieutenant i will lets hope something happens that would be nice bosch disconnected and made the call to maggie mcpherson couple things first sis is in place now on jessup you can let gabriel williams know he thought he heard a small chuckle before she responded ironic huh yeah maybe theyll end up killing jessup and we wont have to worry about a trial the special investigation section was an elite surveillance squad that had existed for more than forty years despite a kill rate higher than that of any other unit in the department including swat the sis was used to clandestinely watch apex predatorsindividuals suspected in violent crimes who would not cease until caught in the act and stopped by the police masters of surveillance sis officers waited to observe suspects committing new crimes before moving in to make arrests often with fatal consequences the irony mcpherson mentioned was that gabriel williams was a civil rights attorney before running for and winning the das post he had sued the department over sis shootings on multiple occasions claiming that the units strategies were designed to draw suspects into deadly confrontations with police he had gone so far as to call the unit a death squad while announcing a lawsuit over an sis shooting that had left four robbers dead outside a tommys fastfood franchise that same death squad was now being used in a gambit that might help win the case against jessup and further williamss political rise youll be informed of his activities mcpherson asked every morning ill get the surveillance log and theyll call me out if anything good happens perfect was there something else im in a bit of a rush im working on one of my preexisting cases and have a hearing about to start yeah i found our witness youre brilliant where is she up in washington on the northern tip of the olympic peninsula a place called port townsend shes using her birth name sarah ann gleason and it appears that shes been living clean up there for about six years thats good for us maybe not how so it looks to me like most of her life has been spent trying to get away from what happened that sunday in hancock park if shes finally gotten past it and is living the clean life up there in port townsend she might not be interested in picking at old scabs if you know what i mean not even for her sister maybe not were talking about twentyfour years ago mcpherson was quiet for a long moment and then finally responded thats a cynical view of the world harry when are you planning on going up there as soon as i can but i have to make arrangements for my daughter she stayed with a friend when i went up to get jessup at san quentin it didnt turn out so good and now i have to hit the road again sorry to hear that i want to go up with you i think i can handle it i know you can handle it but it might be good to have a woman and a prosecutor with you more and more i think shes going to be the key to this whole thing and shes going to be my witness our approach to her will be very important ive been approaching witnesses for about thirty years i think i let me have the travel office here make the arrangements that way we can go up together talk out the strategy bosch paused he knew he wasnt going to be able to change her mind whatever you say good ill tell mickey and contact travel well book a morning flight im clear tomorrow is that too soon for you id hate to wait on this till next week ill make it work bosch had had a third reason to call her but now decided to hold back her taking over the trip to washington made him gunshy about discussing his investigative moves they hung up and he was left drumming his fingers on the edge of his desk as he contemplated what he would say to rachel walling after a few moments he pulled out his cell phone and used it to make the call he had wallings number in its memory to his surprise she answered right away he had envisioned her seeing his name on the id and letting him go to the message theyd had a relationship that was long over but still left a trail of intense feelings hello harry hello rachel how are you im fine and you pretty good im calling about a case of course harry bosch never goes through channels he goes direct there are no channels for this and you know i call you because i trust you and more than anything else respect your opinion i go through channels and i get some profiler in quantico whos just a voice on the phone and not only that he doesnt call me back with anything for two months what would you do if you were me oh probably the same thing besides that i dont want the bureaus official involvement i am just looking for your opinion and advice rachel whats the case i think youre going to like it its a twentyfouryearold murder of a twelveyearold girl a guy went down for it back then and now we have to retry him i was thinking a profile of the crime might be helpful to the prosecutor is this that jessup case thats in the news thats right he knew she would be interested he could hear it in her voice all right well bring by whatever youve got how much time are you giving me ive got my regular job you know no hurry this time not like with that echo park thing ill probably be out of town tomorrow maybe longer i think you can have a few days with the file you still in the same place above the million dollar theater thats it okay ill drop the box by ill be here wednesday february pm the holding cell next to department on the thirteenth floor of the ccb was empty except for my client cassius clay montgomery he sat morosely on the bench in the corner and didnt get up when he saw me come back sorry im late he didnt say anything he didnt acknowledge my presence come on cash its not like youd be going anywhere whats it matter if you were waiting here or back in county they got tv in county man he said looking up at me okay so you missed oprah can you come over here so i dont have to shout our business across the room he got up and came over to the bars i stood on the other side beyond the red line marking the threefoot threshold doesnt matter if you shout our business there aint nobody left to hear it i told you im sorry ive been having a busy day yeah and i guess im just a nocount nigger when it comes to being on tv and turnin into the man whats that supposed to mean i saw you on the news dog now you a prosecutor what kinda shit is that i nodded obviously my client was more concerned with me being a turncoat than with waiting until the last hearing of the day look all i can tell you is that i took the job reluctantly i am not a prosecutor i am a defense attorney im your defense attorney but every now and then they come to you and they want something and its hard to say no so what happens to me nothing happens to you im still your lawyer cash and we have a big decision to make here this hearing is going to be short and sweet its to set a trial date and thats it but mr hellman the prosecutor says the offer he made to you is good only until today if we tell judge champagne were ready to go to trial today then the deal disappears and we go to trial have you thought about it some more montgomery leaned his head in between two bars and didnt speak i realized he couldnt pull the trigger on a decision he was fortyseven and had already spent nine years of his life in prison he was charged with armed robbery and assault with great bodily injury and was looking at a big fall according to the police montgomery had posed as a buyer at a drivethrough drug market in the rodia gardens projects but instead of paying he pulled a gun and demanded the dealers drugs and money roll the dealer went for the gun and it went off now the dealer a gang member named darnell hicks was in a wheelchair for the rest of his life as is usual in the projects no one cooperated with the investigation even the victim said he didnt remember what happened choosing in his silence to trust that his fellow crips would handle justice in the matter but investigators made a case anyway picking up my clients car on a video camera at the entrance to the projects they found the car and matched blood on the door to the victim it wasnt a strong case but it was solid enough for us to entertain an offer from the prosecution if montgomery took the deal hed be sentenced to three years in prison and would likely serve two and a half if he gambled and took a conviction at the end of a trial then hed be looking at a mandatory minimum of fifteen years inside the addon of gbi and use of a firearm in the commission of a robbery were the killers and i knew firsthand that judge judith champagne wasnt soft on gun crimes i had recommended to my client that he take the deal it was a nobrainer to me but then i wasnt the one who had to do the time montgomery couldnt decide it wasnt so much about the prison time it was the fact that the victim hicks was a crip and the street gang had a long reach into every prison in the state even taking the threeyear sentence could be a death penalty montgomery wasnt sure he would make it i dont know what to tell you i said its a good offer the da doesnt want to go to trial on this he doesnt want to put a victim on the stand who doesnt want to be there and may hurt the case more than help it so hes gone as low as he can go but its up to you your decision youve had a couple weeks now and this is it we have to go out there in a couple minutes montgomery tried to shake his head but his forehead was pressed between the two bars whats that mean i asked it means shit cant we win this case man i mean you a prosecutor now cant you get a good word in for me on this theyre two different matters cash i cant do anything like that you got your choice take the three or we go to trial and like i told you before we can certainly do some stuff at trial theyve got no weapon and a victim who wont tell the story but they still got his blood on the door of your car and they got video of you driving it out of rodia right after the shooting we can try to play it the way you said it went down selfdefense you were there to buy a rock and he saw your roll and tried to rip you off the jury might believe it especially if he wont testify and they might believe it even if he does testify because ill make him take the fifth so many times theyll think hes al capone before he gets off the stand whos al capone youre kidding me right no man who is he never mind cash what do you want to do youre cool if we go to trial im cool with it its just that there is that gap you know gap there is a wide gap between what theyre offering you right now and what you could get if we lose at trial were talking about a minimum twelveyear swing cash thats a lot of time to gamble with montgomery backed away from the bars they had left twin impressions on both sides of his forehead he now gripped the bars in his hands the thing is three years fifteen years i aint going to make it either way they got hit men in every prison but in county they got the system and evrybody is separated and locked up tight im okay there i nodded but the problem was that any sentence over a year had to be served in a state prison the county system was a holding system for those awaiting trial or sentenced to short terms okay then i guess we go to trial i guess we do sit tight theyll be coming back for you soon i knocked quietly on the courtroom door and the deputy opened it court was in session and judge champagne was holding a status conference on another case i saw my prosecutor sitting against the rail and went over to confer this was the first case id had with philip hellman and i had found him to be extremely reasonable i decided to test the limits of that reason one last time so mickey i hear we are now colleagues he said with a smile temporarily i said i dont plan to make it a career good i dont need the competition so what are we going to do here i think we are going to put it over one more time mickey come on ive been very generous i cant keep no youre right youve been completely generous phil and i appreciate that my client appreciates that its just that he cant take a deal because anything that puts him in a state prison is a death penalty we both know that the crips will get him first of all i dont know that and second of all if thats what he thinks then maybe he shouldnt have tried to rip off the crips and shoot one of their guys i nodded in agreement thats a good point but my client maintains it was selfdefense your vic drew first so i guess we go to trial and youve got to ask a jury for justice for a victim who doesnt want it who will testify only if you force him to and will then claim he doesnt remember shit maybe he doesnt he did get shot after all yeah and maybe the jury will buy that especially when i bring out his pedigree ill ask him what he does for a living for starters according to what cisco my investigator has found out hes been selling drugs since he was twelve years old and his mother put him on the street mickey weve already been down this road what do you want im getting ready to just say fuck it lets go to trial what do i want i want to make sure you dont fuck up the start of your brilliant career what look man you are a young prosecutor remember what you just said about not wanting the competition well another thing you dont want is to risk putting a loss on your ledger not this early in the game you just want this to go away so heres what i want a year in county and restitution you can name your price on restitution are you kidding me he said it too loud and drew a look from the judge he then spoke very quietly are you fucking kidding me not really its a good solution when you think about it phil it works for everybody yeah and whats judge judy going to say when i present this the victim is in a wheelchair for life she wont sign off on this we ask to go back to chambers and we both sell it to her we tell her that montgomery wants to go to trial and claim selfdefense and that the state has real reservations because of the victims lack of cooperation and status as a highranking member of a criminal organization she was a prosecutor before she was a judge shell understand this and shell probably have more sympathy for montgomery than she does for your drugdealing victim hellman thought for a long moment the hearing before champagne ended and she instructed the courtroom deputy to bring montgomery out it was the last case of the day now or never phil i prompted okay lets do it he finally said hellman stood up and moved to the prosecution table your honor he intoned before we bring the defendant out could counsel discuss this case in chambers champagne a veteran judge who had seen everything at least three times creased her brow on the record gentlemen thats probably not necessary hellman said we would like to discuss the terms of a disposition in the case then by all means lets go the judge stepped down from the bench and headed back toward her chambers hellman and i started to follow as we got to the gate next to the clerks pod i leaned forward to whisper to the young prosecutor montgomery gets credit for time served right hellman stopped in his tracks and turned back to me youve got to be just kidding i quickly said i held my hands up in surrender hellman frowned and then turned back around and headed toward the judges chambers i had thought it was worth a try thursday february am it was a silent breakfast madeline bosch poked at her cereal with her spoon but managed to put very little of it into her stomach bosch knew that his daughter wasnt upset because he was going away for the night and she wasnt upset because she wasnt going he believed she had come to enjoy the breaks his infrequent travels gave her the reason she was upset was the arrangements he had made for her care while he was gone she was fourteen going on twentyfour and her first choice would have been to simply be left alone to fend for herself her second choice would have been to stay with her best friend up the street and her last choice would have been to have mrs bambrough from the school stay at the house with her bosch knew she was perfectly capable of fending for herself but he wasnt there yet they had been living together for only a few months and it had been only those few months since she had lost her mother he just wasnt ready to turn her loose no matter how fervently she insisted she was ready he finally put down his spoon and spoke look maddie its a school night and last time when you stayed with rory you both stayed up all night slept through most of your classes and had your parents and all your teachers mad at both of you i told you we wouldnt do that again i just think we need to wait on that a little bit ill tell mrs bambrough that its all right if rory comes over just not till midnight you guys can do your homework together or something like shes really going to want to come here when im being watched by the assistant principal thanks for that dad bosch had to concentrate on not laughing this issue seemed so simple compared with what she had faced in october after coming to live with him she still had regular therapy sessions and they seemed to go a long way toward helping her cope with her mothers death bosch would take a dispute over child care over those other deeper issues any day he checked his watch it was time to go if youre done playing with your food you can put your bowl in the sink we have to get going finished dad you should use the correct word sorry about that are you finished playing with your cereal yes good lets go he got up from the table and went back to his room to grab his overnight bag off the bed he was traveling light expecting the trip to last one night at the most if they got lucky they might even catch a late flight home tonight when he came back out maddie was standing by the door her backpack over one shoulder ready no im just standing here for my health he walked up to her and kissed the top of her head before she could move away from him she tried though gotcha daaaad he locked the door behind them and put his bag in the backseat of the mustang you have your key right yes just making sure can we go i dont want to be late they drove down the hill in silence after that when they got to the school he saw sue bambrough working the dropoff lane getting the slowmoving kids out of the cars and into the school keeping things moving you know the routine mads call me text me vid me let me know youre doing okay ill get out here she opened the door early before they got to where the assistant principal was stationed maddie got out and then reached back in to grab her bag bosch waited for it the sign that everything was really okay be safe dad there it was you too baby she closed the door he lowered the window and drove down to sue bambrough she leaned into the open window hey sue shes a little upset but shell get over it by the end of the day i told her that aurora smith could come by but not to make it late who knows maybe theyll do some homework shell be fine harry i left the check on the kitchen counter and theres some cash there for anything you guysll need thanks harry just let me know if you think it will be more than one night no problem on my end bosch checked the rearview he wanted to ask a question but didnt want to hold people up what is it harry uh to say youre done doing something is that wrong you know bad english sue tried to hide a smile if shes correcting you thats the natural course of things dont take it personally we drill it into them here they go home and want to drill somebody else it would be proper to say you finished doing something but i know what you meant bosch nodded somebody in the line behind him tapped the hornbosch assumed it was a man hurrying to make dropoff and then get to work he waved his thanks to sue and pulled out maggie mcfierce had called bosch the night before and told him that there was nothing out of burbank so they were taking a direct flight out of lax that meant it would be a brutal drive in morning traffic bosch lived on a hillside right above the hollywood freeway but it was the one freeway that wouldnt help him get to the airport instead he took highland down into hollywood and then cut over to la cienega it bottlenecked through the oil fields near baldwin hills and he lost his cushion of time he took la tijera from there and when he got to the airport he was forced to park in one of the expensive garages close in because he didnt have time to ride a shuttle bus in from an economy lot after filling out the law enforcement officer forms at the counter and being walked through security by a tsa agent he finally got to the gate while the plane was in the final stages of loading its passengers he looked for mcpherson but didnt see her and assumed she was already on the plane he boarded and went through the required meetandgreet stepping into the cockpit showing his badge and shaking the hands of the flight crew he then made his way toward the back of the plane he and mcpherson had exitrow seats across the aisle from each other she was already in place a tall starbucks cup in hand she had obviously arrived early for the flight thought you werent going to make it she said it was close howd you get here so early you have a daughter just like me i dropped her with mickey last night bosch nodded exit row nice whos your travel agent weve got a good one thats why i wanted to handle it well send lapd the bill for you yeah good luck with that bosch had put his bag in an overhead compartment so he would have room to extend his legs after he sat down and buckled in he saw that mcpherson had shoved two thick files into the seat pocket in front of her he had nothing out to prep with his files were in his bag but he didnt feel like getting them out he pulled his notebook out of his back pocket and was about to lean across the aisle to ask mcpherson a question when a flight attendant came down the aisle and stooped down to whisper to him youre the detective right uh yes is there a before he could finish the dirty harry line the flight attendant informed him that they were upgrading him to an unclaimed seat in the firstclass section oh thats nice of you and the captain but i dont think i can do that theres no charge its no its not that see im with this lady here and shes my boss and ii mean weneed to talk and go over our investigation shes a prosecutor actually the attendant took a moment to track his explanation and then nodded and said shed go back to the front of the plane and inform the powers that be and i thought chivalry was dead mcpherson said you gave up a firstclass seat to sit with me actually i shouldve told her to give it to you that would have been real chivalry uhoh here she comes back bosch looked up the aisle the same smiling attendant was headed back to them were moving some people around and we have room for you both come on up they got up and headed forward bosch grabbing his bag out of the overhead and following mcpherson she looked back at him smiled and said my tarnished knight right bosch said the seats were side by side in the first row mcpherson took the window soon after they were resituated the plane took off for its threehour flight to seattle so mcpherson said mickey told me our daughter has never met your daughter bosch nodded yeah i guess we need to change that definitely i hear theyre the same age and you guys compared photos and they even look alike well her mother sort of looked like you same coloring and fire bosch thought he pulled out his phone and turned it on he showed her a photo of maddie thats remarkable mcpherson said they could be sisters bosch looked at his daughters photo as he spoke its just been a tough year for her she lost her mother and moved across an ocean left all her friends behind ive been kind of letting her move at her own pace all the more reason she should know her family here bosch just nodded in the past year he had fended off numerous calls from his half brother seeking to get their daughters together he wasnt sure if his hesitation was about the potential relationship between the two cousins or the two half brothers sensing that angle of conversation was at an end mcpherson unfolded her table and pulled out her files bosch turned his phone off and put it away so were going to work he asked a little i want to be prepared how much do you want to tell her up front i was thinking we just talk about the id confirm it and see if shes willing to testify again and not bring up the dna right that could turn a yes into a no but shouldnt she know everything shes going to be getting into eventually yes its been a long time i did the trace she hit some hard times and rough spots but it looks like she mightve come out okay i guess well see when we get up there lets play it by ear then i think if it feels right we need to tell her everything you make the call the one thing thats good is that shell only have to do it once we dont have to go through a preliminary hearing or a grand jury jessup was held over for trial in eightysix and that is not what the supreme court reversed so we just go directly to trial well need her one time and that will be it thats good and youll be handling her yes bosch nodded the assumption was that she was a better prosecutor than haller after all it was hallers first case harry was happy to hear she would be handling the most important witness at trial what about me which one of you will take me i dont think thats been decided mickey anticipates that jessup will actually testify i know hes waiting for that but we havent talked about who will take you my guess is that youll be doing a lot of readbacks to the jury of sworn testimony from the first trial she closed the file and it looked like that was it for work they spent the rest of the flight smalltalking about their daughters and looking through the magazines in their seat pockets the plane landed early at seatac and they picked up a rental car and started north bosch did the driving the car came equipped with a gps system but the da travel assistant had also provided mcpherson with a full package of directions to port townsend they drove up to seattle and then took a ferry across puget sound they left the car and went up for coffee on the concessions deck finding an open table next to a set of windows bosch was staring out the window when mcpherson surprised him with an observation youre not happy are you harry bosch looked at her and shrugged its a weird case twentyfour years old and we start with the bad guy already in prison and we take him out it doesnt make me unhappy its just kind of strange you know she had a half smile on her face i wasnt talking about the case i was talking about you youre not a happy man bosch looked down at the coffee he held on the table with two hands not because of the ferrys movement but because he was cold and the coffee was warming him inside and out oh he said a long silence opened up between them he wasnt sure what he should reveal to this woman he had known her for only a week and she was making observations about him i dont really have time to be happy right now he finally said mickey told me what he felt he could about hong kong and what happened with your daughter bosch nodded but he knew maggie didnt know the whole story nobody did except for madeline and him yeah he said she caught some bad breaks there thats the thing i guess i think if i can make my daughter happy then ill be happy but i am not sure when that will be he brought his eyes up to hers and saw only sympathy he smiled yeah we should get the two cousins together he said moving on absolutely she said thursday february pm the los angeles times carried a lengthy story on jason jessups first day of freedom in twentyfour years the reporter and photographer met him at dawn on venice beach where the fortyeightyearold tried his hand at his boyhood pastime of surfing on the first few sets he was shaky on a borrowed longboard but soon he was up and riding the break a photo of jessup standing upright on the board and riding a curl with his arms outstretched his face turned up to the sky was the centerpiece photo on the newspapers front page the photo showed off what two decades of lifting prison iron will do jessups body was roped with muscle he looked lean and mean from the beach the next stop was an innout franchise in westwood for hamburgers and french fries with all the catsup he wanted after lunch jessup went to clive royces storefront office in downtown where he attended a twohour meeting with the battery of attorneys representing him in both criminal and civil matters this meeting was not open to the times jessup rounded out the afternoon by watching a movie called shutter island at the chinese theater in hollywood he bought a tub of buttered popcorn large enough to feed a family of four and ate every puffed kernel he then returned to venice where he had a room in an apartment near the beach courtesy of a highschool surfing buddy the day ended at a beach barbecue with a handful of supporters who had never wavered in their belief in his innocence i sat at my desk studying the color photos of jessup that graced two inside pages of the a section the paper was going allout on the story as it had all along surely smelling the journalistic honors to be gathered at the end of jessups journey to complete freedom springing an innocent man from prison was the ultimate newspaper story and the times was desperately trying to take credit for jessups release the largest photo showed jessups unabashed delight at the red plastic tray sitting in front of him at a table at innout the tray contained a fully loaded doubledouble with fries smothered in catsup and melted cheese the caption said why is this man smiling jessup eats his first doubledouble in years ive been thinking about this forever the other photos carried similarly lighthearted captions below shots of jessup at the movies with his bucket of popcorn hoisting a beer at the barbecue and hugging his highschool pal walking through a glass door that said royce and associates attorneysatlaw there was no indication in the tone of the article or photos that jason jessup was a man who happened to still be accused of murdering a twelveyearold girl the story was about jessup relishing his freedom while being unable to plan his future until his legal issues were resolved it was a nice turn of phrase i thought calling abduction and murder charges and a pending trial merely legal issues i had the paper spread wide on the desk lorna had rented for me in my new office on broadway we were on the second floor of the bradbury building and only three blocks from the ccb i think you need to put something up on the walls i looked up it was clive royce he had walked through the reception room unannounced because i had sent lorna over to philippes to get us lunch royce gestured to the empty walls of the temporary office i flipped the newspaper closed and held up the front page i just ordered a twentybytwenty shot of jesus on the surfboard here im going to hang him on the wall royce stepped up to the desk and took the paper studying the photo on the front as if for the first time which we both knew was not the case royce had been deeply involved in the generation of the story the payoff being the photo of the office door with his firms name on the glass yes they did a good job with it didnt they he handed it back i guess so if you like your killers happygolucky royce didnt respond so i continued i know what youre doing clive because i would do it too but as soon as we get a judge im going to ask him to stop you im not going to let you taint the jury pool royce frowned as if i had suggested something completely untoward its a free press mick you cant control the media the man just got out of prison and like it or not its a news story right and you can give exclusives in exchange for display display that might plant a seed in a potential jurors mind what do you have planned for today jessup cohosting the morning show on channel five or is he judging the chili cookoff at the state fair as a matter of fact npr wanted to hang with him today but i showed restraint i said no make sure you tell the judge that as well wow you actually said no to npr was that because most people who listen to npr are the kind of people who can get out of jury duty or because you got something better lined up royce frowned again looking as though i had impaled him with an integrity spear he looked around grabbed the chair from maggies desk and pulled it over so he could sit in front of mine once he was seated with his legs crossed and had arranged his suit properly he spoke now tell me mick does your boss think that housing you in a separate building is really going to make people think you are acting independently of his direction youre having us on right i smiled at him his effort to get under my skin was not going to work let me state once again for the record clive that i have no boss in this matter i am working independently of gabriel williams i gestured to the room im here not in the courthouse and all decisions on this case will be made from this desk but at the moment my decisions arent that important its you who has the decision clive and what would that be a disposition mick thats right todays special good until five oclock only your boy pleads guilty ill come down off the death penalty and we both roll the dice with the judge on sentencing you never know jessup could walk away with time served royce smiled cordially and shook his head i am sure that would make the powers that be in this town happy but im afraid i must disappoint you mick my client remains absolutely uninterested in a plea and that is not going to change i was actually hoping that by now you would have seen the uselessness of going to trial and would simply drop the charges you cant win this thing mick the state has to bend over on this one and you unfortunately are the fool who volunteered to take it in the arse well i guess well see wont we we will indeed i opened the desks center drawer and removed a green plastic case containing a computer disc i slid it across the desk to him i wasnt expecting you to come by for it yourself clive thought youd send an investigator or a clerk you gotta bunch of them working for you dont you along with that fulltime publicist royce slowly collected the disc the plastic case was marked defense discovery well arent we snarky today seems that only two weeks ago you were one of us mick a lowly member of the defense bar i nodded my contrition he had nailed me there sorry clive perhaps the power of the office is getting to me apology accepted and sorry to waste your time coming over here as i told you on the phone thats got everything we have up until this morning mostly the old files and reports i wont play discovery games with you clive ive been on the wrong end of that too many times to count so when i get it you get it but right now thats all ive got royce tapped the disc case on the edge of the desk no witness list there is but as of now its essentially the same list from the trial in eightysix ive added my investigator and subtracted a few namesthe parents other people no longer alive no doubt felix turner has been redacted i smiled like the cheshire cat thankfully you wont get the chance to bring him up at trial yes a pity i would have loved the opportunity to shove him up the states ass i nodded noting that royce had come off the english colloquialisms and was hitting me with pure americana now it was a symptom of his frustration over turner and as a longtime counsel for the defense i certainly felt it in the retrial there would be no mention of any aspect of the first trial the new jurors would have no knowledge of what had transpired before and that meant the states use of the fraudulent jailhouse informantno matter how grievous a prosecutorial sinwould not hurt the current prosecution i decided to move on i should have another disc for you by the end of the week yes i cant wait to see what you come up with sarcasm noted just remember one thing clive discovery is a twoway street you go beyond thirty days and well go see the judge the rules of evidence required that each side complete its discovery exchange no later than thirty days before the start of trial missing this deadline could lead to sanctions and open the door to a trial delay as the judge would grant the offended party more time to prepare yes well as you can imagine we werent expecting the turn of events that has transpired here royce said consequently our defense is in its infancy but i wont play games with you either mick a disc will be along to you in short orderprovided that we have any discovery to give i knew that as a practical matter the defense usually had little in the way of discovery to give unless the plan was to mount an extensive defense but i sounded the warning because i was leery of royce in a case this old he might try to dig up an alibi witness or something else out of left field i wanted to know about it before it came up in court i appreciate that i said over his shoulder i saw lorna enter the office she was carrying two brown bags one of which contained my french dip sandwich oh i didnt realize royce turned around in his seat ah the lovely lorna how are you my darling hello clive i see you got the disc indeed thank you lorna i had noticed that royces english accent and formal parlance became more pronounced at times especially in front of attractive women i wondered if that was a conscious thing or not i have two sandwiches here clive lorna said would you like one it was the wrong time for lorna to be magnanimous i think he was just about to leave i said quickly yes love i must go but thank you for the most gracious offer ill be out here if you need me mickey lorna went back to the reception room closing the door behind her royce turned back to me and spoke in a low voice you know you should never have let that one go mick she was the keeper and now joining forces with the first mrs haller to deprive an innocent man of his longdeserved freedom there is something incestuous about the whole thing isnt there i just looked at him for a long moment is there anything else clive he held up the disc i think this should do it for today good i have to get back to work i walked him out through reception and closed the door after him i turned and looked at lorna feels weird doesnt it she said being on this side of itthe prosecution side it does she held up one of the sandwich bags can i ask you something i said whose sandwich were you going to give him yours or mine she looked at me with a straight face then a smile of guilt leaked out i was being polite okay i thought you and i could share i shook my head dont be giving my french dip sandwich to anybody especially a defense lawyer i snatched the bag from her hand thank you love i said in my best british accent she laughed and i headed back into my office to eat thursday february pm after driving off the ferry at port townsend bosch and mcpherson followed directions from the rental cars gps to the address on sarah ann gleasons drivers license the trail led them through the small victorian sea village and then out into a more rural area of large and isolated properties gleasons house was a small clapboard house that failed to keep the nearby towns victorian theme the detective and the prosecutor stood on the porch and knocked but got no response maybe shes at work or something mcpherson said could be we could go back into town and get rooms then come back after five bosch checked his watch he realized that school was just over and maddie was probably heading home with sue bambrough he guessed that his daughter was giving the assistant principal the silent treatment he stepped off the porch and started walking toward the corner of the house where are you going to check the back hold on but as soon as bosch turned the corner he could see that a hundred yards beyond the house there was another structure it was a windowless barn or garage what stood out was that it had a chimney he could see heat waves but no smoke rising from the two black pipes that extended over the roofline there were two cars and a van parked in front of the closed garage doors bosch stood there watching for so long that mcpherson finally came around the corner as well whats taking bosch held up his hand to silence her then pointed toward the outbuilding what is it mcpherson whispered before bosch could answer one of the garage doors slid open a few feet and a figure stepped out it looked like a young man or a teenager he was wearing a fulllength black apron over his clothes he took off heavy elbowlength gloves so he could light a cigarette shit mcpherson whispered answering her own question bosch stepped back to the corner of the house to use it as a blind he pulled mcpherson with him all her arrestsher drug of choice was meth he whispered great mcpherson whispered back our main witness is a meth cook the young smoker turned when apparently called from within the barn he threw down his cigarette stepped on it and went back inside he yanked the door closed behind him but it slid to a stop six inches before closing lets go bosch said he started to move but mcpherson put her hand on his arm wait what are you talking about we need to call port townsend police and get some backup dont we bosch looked at her a moment without responding i saw the police station when we went through town mcpherson said as if to assure him that backup was waiting and willing if we call for backup theyre not going to be very cooperative since we didnt bother to check in when we got to town in the first place bosch said theyll arrest her and then we have a main witness awaiting trial on drug charges how do you think that will work with jessups jury she didnt answer tell you what he said you hold back here and ill go check it out three vehicles probably three cooks if i cant handle it we call backup theyre probably armed harry you theyre probably not armed ill check it out and if it looks like a situation well call port townsend i dont like this it could work to our favor what how think about it watch for my signal if something goes wrong get in the car and get out of here he held up the car keys and she reluctantly took them he could tell she was thinking about what he had said the advantage if they caught their witness in a compromising situation it could give them the leverage they needed to assure her cooperation and testimony bosch left mcpherson there and headed on foot down the crushedshell drive to the barn he didnt attempt to hide in case they had a lookout he put his hands in his pocket to try to convey he was no threat somebody just lost and looking for directions the crushed shell made it impossible for him to make a completely silent approach but as he got closer he heard loud music coming from the barn it was rock and roll but he could not identify it something heavy on the guitar and with a pounding beat it had a retro feel to it like he had heard the song a long time ago maybe in vietnam bosch was twenty feet from the partially opened door when it moved open another two feet and the same young man stepped out again seeing him closer bosch pegged his age at twentyone or so in the moment he stepped out bosch realized he should have expected that hed be back out to finish his interrupted smoke now it was too late and the smoker saw him but the young man didnt hesitate or sound an alarm of any sort he looked at bosch curiously as he started tapping a cigarette out of a soft pack he was sweating profusely you parked up at the house he asked bosch stopped ten feet from him and took his hands out of his pockets he didnt look back toward the house choosing instead to keep his eyes on the kid uh yes is that a problem he asked no but most people just drive on down to the barn sarah usually tells them to oh i didnt get that message is sarah here yeah inside go on in you sure yeah were almost done for the day bosch was getting the idea that he had walked into something that was not what he thought it was he now glanced back and saw mcpherson peering around the corner of the house this wasnt the best way to do this but he turned and headed toward the open door the heat hit him the moment he entered the inside of the barn was like an oven and for good reason the first thing bosch saw was the open door of a huge furnace that was glowing orange with flames standing eight feet from the heat source was another young man and an older woman they also wore fulllength aprons and heavy gloves the man was using a pair of iron tongs to hold steady a large piece of molten glass attached to the end of an iron pipe the woman was shaping it with a wooden block and a pair of pliers they were glassmakers not drug cooks the woman wore a welders mask over her face as protection bosch could not identify her but he was pretty sure he was looking at sarah ann gleason bosch stepped back through the door and signaled to mcpherson he gave the okay sign but was unsure she would be able to identify it from the distance he waved her in whats going on man the smoker asked thats sarah gleason in there you said bosch responded yeah thats her i need to talk to her youre going to have to wait until shes set the piece she cant stop while its soft weve been working it for almost four hours how much longer maybe an hour you can probably talk to her while shes working you want a piece made thats okay i think we can wait mcpherson drove up in the rental car and got out bosch opened the door for her and explained quietly that they had read wrong what they had seen he told her the barn was a glassmaking studio he told her how he wanted to play it until they could get gleason into a private setting mcpherson shook her head and smiled what if we had gone in there with backup i guess we wouldve broken some glass and had one pissedoff witness she got out of the car and bosch reached in for the file he had put on the dashboard he put it inside his jacket and under his arm so he could carry it unseen they entered the studio and gleason was waiting for them with her gloves off and her mask folded up to reveal her face she had obviously been told by the smoker that they were potential customers and bosch initially did nothing to dissuade her of that interpretation he didnt want to reveal their true business until they were alone with her im harry and this is maggie sorry to barge in like this oh no problem we like it when people get a chance to see what we do in fact were right in the middle of a project right now and need to get back to it youre welcome to stay and watch and i can tell you a little bit about what were doing that would be great you just have to stay back were dealing with very hot material here not a problem where are you from seattle no actually were all the way up from california were pretty far from home if the mention of her native state caused gleason any concern she didnt show it she pulled the mask back down over a smile put her gloves on and went back to work over the next forty minutes bosch and mcpherson watched gleason and her two assistants finish the glass piece gleason provided a steady narration as she worked explaining that the three members of her team had different duties one of the young men was a blower and the other was a blocker gleason was the gaffer the one in charge the piece they were sculpting was a fourfootlong grape leaf that would be part of a larger piece commissioned to hang in the lobby of a business in seattle called rainier wine gleason also filled in some of her recent history she said she started her own studio only two years ago after spending three years apprenticing with a glass artist in seattle it was useful information to bosch both hearing her talk about herself and watching her work the soft glass gathering color as she called it using heavy tools to manipulate something beautiful and fragile and glowing with redhot danger all at the same time the heat from the furnace was stifling and both bosch and mcpherson took off their jackets gleason said the oven burned at degrees and bosch marveled at how the artists could spend so many hours working so close to the source the glory hole the small opening into which they repeatedly passed the sculpture to reheat and add layers glowed like the gateway to hell when the days work was completed and the piece was placed in the finishing kiln gleason asked the assistants to clean up the studio before heading home she then invited bosch and mcpherson to wait for her in the office while she got cleaned up herself the office doubled as a break room it was sparely furnished with a table and four chairs a filing cabinet a storage locker and a small kitchenette there was a binder on the table containing plastic sleeves with photos of glass pieces made previously in the studio mcpherson studied these and seemed taken with several bosch took out the file he had been carrying inside his jacket and put it down on the table ready to go it must be nice to be able to make something out of nothing mcpherson said i wish i could bosch tried to think of a response but before he could come up with anything the door opened and sarah gleason entered the bulky mask apron and gloves were gone and she was smaller than bosch had expected she barely crested five feet and he doubted there were more than ninety pounds on her tiny frame he knew that childhood trauma sometimes stunted growth so it was no wonder sarah gleason looked like a woman in a childs body her auburn hair was down now instead of tied into a knot behind her head it framed a weary face with dark blue eyes she wore blue jeans clogs and a black tshirt that said death cab on it she headed directly to the refrigerator can i get you something dont have any alcohol in here but if you need something cold bosch and mcpherson passed harry noticed she had left the door to the office open he could hear someone sweeping in the studio he stepped over and closed it gleason turned from the refrigerator with a bottle of water she saw bosch closing the door and a look of apprehension immediately crossed her face bosch raised one hand in a calming gesture as he pulled his badge with the other ms gleason everything is okay were from los angeles and just need to speak privately with you he opened his badge wallet and held it up to her what is this my name is harry bosch and this is maggie mcpherson she is a prosecutor with the la county district attorneys office why did you lie she said angrily you said you wanted a piece made no actually we didnt your assistant the blocker just assumed that we never said why we were here her guard was clearly up and bosch thought they had blown their approach and with that the opportunity to secure her as a witness but then gleason stepped forward and grabbed the badge wallet out of his hand she studied it and the facing id card it was an unusual move taking the badge from him no more than the fifth time that had ever happened to bosch in his long career as a cop he saw her eyes hold on the id card and he knew she had noticed the discrepancy between what he had said his name was and what was on the id you said harry bosch harry for short hieronymus bosch youre named after the artist bosch nodded my mother liked the paintings well i like them too i think he knew something about inner demons is that why your mother liked him i think so yeah she handed the badge wallet back to him and bosch sensed a calmness come over her the moment of anxiety and apprehension had passed thanks to the painter whose name bosch carried what do you want with me i havent been to la in more than ten years bosch noted that if she was telling the truth then she had not returned when her stepfather was ill and dying we just want to talk he said can we sit down talk about what your sister my sister i dontlook you need to tell me what this is you dont know do you know what sit down and well tell you finally she moved to the lunch table and took a seat she pulled a soft pack of cigarettes out of her pocket and lit one sorry she said its my one remaining addiction and you two showing up like thisi need a smoke for the next ten minutes bosch and mcpherson traded off the story and walked her through the short version of jason jessups journey to freedom gleason showed almost no reaction to the news no tears no outrage and she didnt ask questions about the dna test that had sprung him from prison she only explained that she had no contact with anyone in california owned no television and never read newspapers she said they were distractions from work as well as from her recovery from addiction were going to retry him sarah mcpherson said and were here because were going to need your help bosch could see sarah turn inward to start to measure the impact of what they were telling her it was so long ago she finally responded cant you just use what i said from the first trial mcpherson shook her head we cant sarah the new jury cant even know there was an earlier trial because that could influence how they weigh the evidence it would prejudice them against the defendant and a guilty verdict wouldnt stand so in situations where witnesses from the first trial are dead or mentally incompetent we read their earlier testimony into the trial record without telling the jury where its from but where thats not the case like with you we need the person to come to court and testify it wasnt clear whether gleason had even registered mcphersons response she sat staring at something far away even as she spoke her eyes didnt come off their distant focus ive spent my whole life since then trying to forget about that day i tried different things to make me forget i used drugs to make a big bubble with me in the middle of it i made never mind the point is i dont think im going to be much help to you before mcpherson could respond bosch stepped in ill tell you what he said lets just talk here for a few minutes about what you can remember okay and if its not going to work then it wont work you were a victim sarah and we dont want to victimize you all over again he waited a moment for gleason to respond but she sat mute staring at the water bottle in front of her on the table lets start with that day bosch said i dont need you at this point to go through the horrible moments of your sisters abduction but do you remember making the identification of jason jessup for the police she slowly nodded i remember looking through the window upstairs they opened the blinds a little bit so i could look out they werent supposed to be able to see me the men he was the one with the hat they made him take it off and thats when i saw it was him i remember that bosch was encouraged by the detail of the hat he didnt recall seeing that in the case records or hearing it in mcphersons summary but the fact that gleason remembered it was a good sign what kind of hat was he wearing he asked a baseball cap gleason said it was blue a dodgers cap im not sure i dont think i knew back then either bosch nodded and moved in do you think if i showed you a photo lineup you would be able to identify the man who took your sister you mean the way he looks now i doubt it no not now mcpherson said what we would need to do in trial is confirm the identification you made back then we would show you photos from back then gleason hesitated and then nodded sure through everything ive done to myself over the years ive never been able to forget that mans face well lets see while bosch opened the file on the table gleason lit a new cigarette off the end of her old one the file contained a lineup of six blackandwhite booking photos of men of the same age build and coloring a photo of jessup was included in the spread harry knew that this was the makeorbreak moment of the case the photos were displayed in two rows of three jessups shot was in the middle window on the bottom row the five hole it had always been the lucky spot for bosch take your time he said gleason drank some water and then put the bottle to the side she leaned over the table bringing her face within twelve inches of the photos it didnt take her long she pointed to the photo of jessup without hesitation i wish i could forget him she said but i cant hes always there in the back of my mind in the shadows do you have any doubt about the photo you have chosen bosch asked gleason leaned down and looked again then shook her head no he was the man bosch glanced at mcpherson who made a slight nod it was a good id and they had handled it right the only thing that was missing was a show of emotion on gleasons part but maybe twentyfour years had drained her of everything harry took out a pen and handed it to gleason would you put your initials and the date below the photo you chose please why it confirms your id it just helps make it more solid when it comes up in court bosch noted that she had not asked if she had chosen the right photo she didnt have to and that was a secondary confirmation of her recall another good sign after she handed the pen back to bosch he closed the file and slid it to the side he glanced at mcpherson again now came the hard part by prior agreement maggie was going to make the call here on whether to bring up the dna now or to wait until gleason was more firmly onboard as a witness mcpherson decided not to wait sarah there is a second issue to discuss now we told you about the dna that allowed this man to get this new trial and what we hope is only his temporary freedom yes we took the dna profile and checked it against the california data bank we got a match the semen on the dress your sister was wearing came from your stepfather bosch watched sarah closely not even a flicker of surprise showed on her face or in her eyes this information was not news to her in two thousand four the state started taking dna swabs from all suspects in felony arrests that same year your father was arrested for a felony hitandrun with injuries he ran a stop sign and hit stepfather excuse me you said your father he wasnt my father he was my stepfather my mistake im sorry the bottom line is kensington landys dna was in the data bank and its a match with the sample from the dress what could not be determined is how long that sample was on the dress at the time of its discovery it could have been deposited on the dress the day of the murder or the week before or maybe even a month before sarah started flying on autopilot she was there but not there her eyes were fixed on a distance that was far beyond the room they were in we have a theory sarah the autopsy that was conducted on your sister determined that she had not been sexually abused by her killer or anyone else prior to that day we also know the dress she wore happened to be yours and melissa was borrowing it that morning because she liked it mcpherson paused but sarah said nothing when we get to trial were going to have to explain the semen found on the dress if we cant explain it the assumption will be that it came from the killer and that killer was your stepfather we will lose the case and jessup the real killer will walk away free im sure you dont want that do you sarah there are some people out there who think twentyfour years in prison is enough time served for the murder of a twelveyearold girl they dont know why were doing this but i want you to know that i dont think that sarah not by a long shot sarah gleason didnt answer at first bosch expected tears but none came and he began to wonder if her emotions had been cauterized by the traumas and depravities of her life or maybe she simply had an internal toughness that her diminutive stature camouflaged either way when she finally responded it was in a flat emotionless voice that belied the heartfelt words she spoke you know what i always thought she said mcpherson leaned forward what sarah that that man killed three people that day my sister then my mother and then me none of us got away there was a long moment of silence mcpherson slowly reached out and put her hand on gleasons arm a gesture of comfort where no comfort could exist im sorry sarah mcpherson whispered okay gleason said ill tell you everything thursday february pm my daughter was already missing her mothers cookingand shed only been gone one day i was dropping her halfeaten sandwich into the garbage and wondering how the hell i couldve messed up a grilled cheese when my cell phones ring interrupted it was maggie checking in from the road tell me something good i said by way of greeting you get to spend the evening with our beautiful daughter yes thats something good except she doesnt like my cooking now tell me something else thats good our primary witness is good to go shell testify she made the id she did she told you about the dna and it fits with our theory she did and it does and shell come down here and testify to all of it at the trial she will i felt a twelvevolt charge go through my body thats actually a lot of good things maggie is there any downside well i felt the wind go out of the sails i was about to learn that sarah was still a drug addict or there was some other issue that would prevent me from using her at trial well what well there are going to be challenges to her testimony of course but shes pretty solid shes a survivor and it shows theres really only one thing missing emotions shes been through a lot in her life and she basically seems to be a bit burned outemotionally no tears no laughter just straight down the middle we can work on that we can coach her yeah well we just have to be careful with that i am not saying she isnt fine the way she is im just saying that shes sort of a flat line everything else is good i think youre going to like her and i think shell help us put jessup back in prison thats fantastic maggie really and youre still all right handling her at trial right ive got her royce will attack her on the methmemory loss and all of that her lifestyle youll have to be ready for anything and everything i will be that leaves you with bosch and jessup you still think hell testify jessup yes hes got to clive knows he cant do that to a jury not after twentyfour years so yes ive got him and ive got bosch at least with harry you dont have to worry about any baggage that clive knows about yet and whats that supposed to mean it means dont underestimate clever clive royce see thats what you prosecutors always do you get overconfident and it makes you vulnerable thank you f lee bailey ill keep that in mind how was bosch today he was bosch what happened on your end i checked through the door of the kitchen hayley was sitting on the couch with her homework spread out on the coffee table well for one thing weve got a judge breitman department onetwelve maggie considered the case assignment for a moment before responding i would call that a nowin for either side shes straight down the middle never a prosecutor never a defense attorney just a good solid civil trial lawyer i think neither side gets an advantage with her wow a judge whos going to be impartial and fair imagine that she didnt respond she set the first status conference in chambers wednesday morning at eight before court starts you read anything into that this meant the judge wanted to meet the lawyers and discuss the case in chambers starting things off informally and away from the lens of the media i think thats good shes probably going to set the rules with media and procedure it sounds to me like shes going to run a tight ship that was what i was thinking youre free wednesday to be there ill have to check my calendar but i think so im trying to clear everything except for this i gave royce the first bit of discovery today it was mostly composed of material from the first trial you know you could have held off on that until the thirtyday marker yeah but whats the point the point is strategy the earlier you give it to him the more time he has to be ready for it hes trying to put the squeeze on us by not waiving speedy trial you should put the squeeze right back on him by not showing our hand until we have to thirty days before trial ill remember that with the next round but this was pretty basic stuff was sarah gleason on the witness list yes but under the name sarah landyas it was in eightysix and i gave the office as the address clive doesnt know we found her we need to keep it that way until we have to reveal it i dont want her harassed or feeling threatened what did you tell her about coming down for the trial i told her she would probably be needed for two days in trial plus the travel and thats not going to be a problem well she runs her own business and has been at it only a couple years she has one big ongoing project but otherwise said that things are slow my guess is we can get her down when we need her are you still in port townsend yes we just got finished with her about an hour ago we grabbed dinner and checked in at a hotel its been a long day and youre coming back tomorrow we were planning on it but our flights not till two we have to take a ferryits a journey just to the airport okay call me in the morning before you leave just in case i think of something involving the witness okay did either of you take notes no we thought it might freeze her did you record it no same reason good i want to keep as much of this out of discovery as possible tell bosch not to write anything up we can copy royce on the sixpack she made the id off of but thats it right ill tell harry when tonight or tomorrow whats that supposed to mean nothing never mind anything else yes i braced for it my petty jealousy had slipped out for one small moment i would like to say good night to my daughter now oh i said relief bursting through my body ill put her on i took the phone out to hayley its your mother tuesday february pm each of them worked in silence bosch at one end of the dining room table his daughter at the other he with the first batch of sis surveillance logs she with her homework her school books and laptop computer spread out in front of her they were close in proximity but not in much else the jessup case had become allencompassing with bosch tracing old witnesses and trying to find new ones he had spent little time with her in recent days like her parents maddie was good at holding grudges and had not let go of the perceived slight of having been left for a night in the care of an assistant school principal she was giving harry the silent treatment and already at fourteen she was an expert at it the sis logs were another frustration to bosch not because of what they contained but because of their delay in reaching him they had been sent through bureaucratic channels from the sis office to the rhd office and then to boschs supervisor where they had sat in an in basket for three days before finally being dropped on boschs desk the result was he had logs from the first three days of the surveillance of jason jessup and he was looking at them three to six days after the fact that process was too slow and bosch was going to have to do something about it the logs were terse accounts of the surveillance subjects movements by date time and location most entries carried only a single line of description the logs came with an accompanying set of photos as well but most of the shots were taken at a significant distance so the followers could avoid detection these were grainy images of jessup as he moved about the city as a free man bosch read through the reports and quickly surmised that jessup was already leading separate public and private lives by day his movements were in concert with the media as he very publicly reacquainted himself with life outside a prison cell it was about learning to drive again to choose off a menu to go for a threemile run without having to make a turn but by night a different jessup emerged unaware that he was still being watched by eyes and cameras he went out cruising alone in his borrowed car he went to all corners of the city he went to bars strip clubs a prostitutes trick pad of all his activities one was most curious to bosch on his fourth night of freedom jessup had driven up to mulholland drive the winding road atop the crest of the santa monica mountains which cut the city in half day or night mulholland offered some of the best views of the city it was no surprise that jessup would go up there there were overlooks that offered north and south views of the shimmering lights of the city they could be invigorating and even majestic bosch had gone to these spots himself in the past but jessup didnt go to any of the overlooks he pulled his car off the road near the entrance to franklin canyon park he got out and then entered the closed park sneaking around a gate this caused a surveillance issue for the sis team because the park was empty and the watchers were at risk of being seen if they got too close the report here was briefer than most entries in the log subject entered franklin canyon park observed at picnic table area northeast corner blind man trailhead subject leaves park proceeds west on mulholland to freeway and then south after that jessup returned to the apartment where he was living in venice and stayed in for the rest of the night there was a printout of an infrared photograph taken of jessup in the park it showed him sitting at a picnic table in the dark just sitting there bosch put the photo print down on the table and looked at his daughter she was lefthanded like he was it looked like she was writing out a math problem on a work sheet what she had her mothers radar uh are you online there yes what do you need can you pull up a map of franklin canyon park its off of mulholland drive let me finish this he waited patiently for her to complete her computations on a mathematical problem he knew would be lightyears beyond his understanding for the past four months he had lived in fear that his daughter would ask him for help with her homework she had passed by his skills and knowledge long ago he was useless in this area and had tried to concentrate on mentoring her in other areas observation and selfprotection chief among them okay she put her pencil down and pulled her computer front and center bosch checked his watch it was almost nine here maddie slid the computer down the table turning the screen toward him the park was larger than bosch had thought running south of mulholland and west of coldwater canyon boulevard a key in the corner of the map said it was acres bosch hadnt realized that there was such a large public reserve in this prime section of the hollywood hills he noticed that the map had several of the hiking trails and picnic areas marked the picnic area in the northeast section was off of blinderman trail he assumed it had been misspelled in the sis log as blind man trailhead what is it harry looked at his daughter it was her first attempt at conversation in two days he decided not to miss it well weve been watching this guy the special investigations section theyre the departments surveillance experts and theyre watching this guy who just got out of prison he killed a little girl a long time ago and for some reason he went to this park and just sat there at a picnic table so isnt that what people do at parks well this was in the middle of the night the park was closed and he snuck in and then he sort of just sat there did he grow up near the park maybe hes checking out the places where he grew up i dont think so we have him growing up out in riverside county he used to come to la to surf but i havent found any connection to mulholland bosch studied the map once more and noticed there was an upper and lower entrance to the park jessup had gone in through the upper entrance this would have been out of his way unless that picnic area and blinderman trail were specific destinations for him he slid the computer back to his daughter and checked his watch again are you almost done your work finished dad are you almost finished or you could say done with sorry are you almost finished i have one more math problem good i have to make a quick call lieutenant wrights cell number was on the surveillance log bosch expected him to be home and annoyed with the intrusion but decided to make the call anyway he got up and walked into the living room so he would not disturb maddie on her last problem he punched the number into his cell wright sis lieutenant its harry bosch whats up bosch he didnt sound annoyed sorry to intrude on you at home i just wanted im not at home bosch im with your guy bosch was surprised is something wrong no the night shift is just more interesting where is he right now were with him at a bar on venice beach called the townhouse you know it ive been there is he alone yes and no he came alone but he got recognized he cant buy a drink in there and probably has his pick of the skanks like i said more interesting at night are you calling to check up on us not really i just have a couple of things i need to ask im looking at the logs and the first thing is how can i get them sooner im looking at stuff from three days ago or longer the other thing is franklin canyon park what can you tell me about his stop there which one hes been there twice actually three times hes gone there the last two nights after the first stop four days ago this information was very intriguing to bosch mostly because he had no idea what it meant what did he do the last two times maddie got up from the dining room table and came into the living room she sat on the couch and listened to boschs side of the conversation the same thing he did the first night wright said he sneaks in there and goes to the same picnic area he just sits there like hes waiting for something for what you tell me bosch i wish i could did he go at the same time each night give or take a half hour or so does he go in through the mulholland entrance each time thats right he sneaks in and picks up the same trail that takes him to the picnic area i wonder why he doesnt go in the other entrance it would be easier for him to get to maybe he likes driving on mulholland and seeing the lights that was a good point and bosch needed to consider it lieutenant can you have your people call me the next time he goes there i dont care what time it is i can have them call you but youre not going to be able to get in there and get close its too risky we dont want to expose the surveillance i understand but have them call me i just want to know now what about these logs is there a way for me to get them a little quicker you can come by sis and pick one up every morning if you want as you probably noticed the logs run six pm to six pm each daily log is posted by seven the following morning okay lt ill do that thanks for the info have a good one bosch closed the phone wondering about jessup in franklin canyon and what he was doing on his visits there what did he say maddie asked bosch hesitated wondering for the hundredth time whether he should be telling her as much as he did about his cases he said my guys gone back to that park the last two nights each time he just sits there and waits for what nobody knows maybe he just wants to be somewhere where hes completely by himself and away from everybody maybe but bosch doubted it he believed there was a plan to almost everything jessup did bosch just had to figure out what it was im finished with my homework maddie said you want to watch lost they had been slowly going through the dvds of the television show catching up on five years worth of episodes the show was about several people who survived a plane crash on an uncharted island in the south pacific bosch had trouble keeping track of things from show to show but watched because his daughter had been completely taken in by the story he had no time to watch television right now okay one episode he said then you have to go to bed and i have to get back to work she smiled this made her happy and for the moment boschs grammatical and parental transgressions seemed forgotten set it up bosch said and be prepared to remind me whats happening five hours later bosch was on a jet that was shaking with wild turbulence his daughter was sitting across the aisle from him rather than in the open seat next to him they reached across the aisle to each other to hold hands but the bouncing of the plane kept knocking them apart he couldnt grab her hand just as he turned in his seat to see the tail section break off and fall away he was awakened by a buzzing sound he reached to the bed table and grabbed his phone he struggled to find his voice as he answered this is bosch this is shipley sis i was told to call jessups at the park hes in a park yeah but tonight its a different one where fryman canyon off mulholland bosch knew fryman canyon it was about ten minutes away from franklin canyon whats he doing hes just sort of walking on one of the trails just like at the other park he walks the trail and then he sits down he doesnt do anything after that he just sits for a while and then leaves okay bosch looked at the glowing numbers on the clock it was two oclock exactly are you coming out shipley asked bosch thought about his daughter asleep in her bedroom he knew he could leave and be back before she woke up uh no i have my daughter here and i cant leave her suit yourself when does your shift end about seven can you call me then if you want id like you to call me every morning when you are getting off to tell me where hes been uh all right i guess can i ask you something this guy killed a girl right thats right and youre sure about that i mean no doubt right bosch thought about the interview with sarah gleason i have no doubt okay well thats good to know bosch understood what he was saying he was looking for assurance if circumstances dictated the use of deadly force against jessup it was good to know who and what they would be shooting at nothing else needed to be said about it thanks shipley bosch said ill talk to you later bosch disconnected and put his head back on the pillow he remembered the dream about the plane about reaching out to his daughter but being unable to grab her hand wednesday february am judge diane breitman welcomed us into her chambers and offered a pot of coffee and a plate of shortbread cookies an unusual move for a criminal courts judge in attendance were myself and my second chair maggie mcpherson and clive royce who was without his second but not without his temerity he asked the judge if he could have hot tea instead well this is nice the judge said once we were all seated in front of her desk cups and saucers in hand i have not had the opportunity to see any of you practice in my courtroom so i thought it would be good for us to start out a bit informally in chambers we can always step out into the courtroom to go on the record if necessary she smiled and none of the rest of us responded let me start by saying that i have a deep respect for the decorum of the courtroom breitman continued and i insist that the lawyers who practice before me do as well i am expecting this trial to be a spirited contest of the evidence and facts of the case but i wont stand for any acting out or crossing of the lines of courtesy and jurisprudence i hope that is clearly understood yes your honor maggie responded while royce and i nodded good now lets talk about media coverage the media is going to be hovering over this case like the helicopters that followed oj down the freeway that is clearly a given i have requests here from three local network affiliates a documentary filmmaker and dateline nbc they all want to film the trial in its entirety while i see no problem with that as long as proper protections of the jury are put in place my concern is in the extracurricular activity that is bound to occur outside the courtroom do any of you have any thoughts in this regard i waited a beat and when no one spoke up i did judge i think because of the nature of this casea retrial of a case twentyfour years oldthere has already been too much media attention and were going to have a difficult time seating twelve people and two alternates who arent aware of the case through the filter of the media i mean weve had the accused surfing on the front page of the times and sitting courtside at the lakers how are we going to get an impartial jury out of this the media with no lack of help from mr royce is presenting this guy as this poor persecuted innocent man and they dont have the slightest idea what the evidence is against him your honor i object royce said you cant object i said this isnt a court hearing you used to be a defense attorney mick whatever happened to innocent until proven guilty he already has been in a trial the top court in this state termed a travesty is that what you want to stand on listen clive im an attorney and innocent until proven guilty is a measure you apply in court not on larry king live we havent been on larry king liveyet see what i mean judge he wants to gentlemen please breitman said she waited a moment until she was certain our debate had subsided this is a classic situation where we need to balance the publics right to know with safeguards that will provide us an untainted jury an unimpeded trial and a just result but your honor royce said quickly we cant forbid the media to examine this case freedom of the press is the cornerstone of american democracy and further i draw your attention to the very ruling that granted this retrial the court found serious deficiencies in the evidence and castigated the district attorneys office for the corrupt manner in which it has prosecuted my client now you are going to prohibit the media from looking at this oh please maggie said dismissively were not talking about prohibiting the media from looking at anything and your lofty defense of the freedom of the press aside thats not what this is about you are clearly trying to influence voir dire with your pretrial manipulation of the media that is absolutely untrue royce howled i have responded to media requests yes but i am not trying to influence anything your honor this is an there was a sharp crack from the judges desk she had grabbed a gavel from a decorative pen set and brought it down hard on the wood surface lets cool down here breitman said and lets hold off on the personal attacks as i indicated before there has to be a happy medium i am not inclined to muzzle the press but i will issue a gag order against the lawyers in my court if i believe they are not acting in a manner that is responsible to the case at hand i am going to start off by leaving each of you to determine what is reasonable and responsible interaction with the media but i will warn you now that the consequences for a transgression in this area will be swift and possibly detrimental to ones cause no warnings you cross the line and thats it she paused and waited for a comeback no one said anything she placed the gavel back in its special holder next to the gold pen her voice returned to its friendly tone good she said i think thats understood then she said she wanted to move on to other matters germane to the trial and her first stop was the trial date she wanted to know if both sides would be ready to proceed to trial as scheduled less than six weeks away royce said once again that his client would not waive the speedy trial statute the defense will be ready to go on april fifth provided that the prosecution doesnt continue to play games with discovery i shook my head i couldnt win with this guy i had gone out of my way to get the discovery pipeline going but he had decided to take a shot at making me look like a cheater in front of the judge games i said judge ive already turned over to mr royce an initial discovery file but as you know its a twoway street and the prosecution has received nothing in return from him he turned over the discovery file from the first trial judge breitman complete with a nineteen eightysix witness list it completely subverts the spirit and the rules of discovery breitman looked at me and i could see that royce had successfully scored a hit is this true mr haller she asked hardly your honor the witness list was both subtracted from and added to additionally i turned over one name royce interjected he added one name and it was his own investigator big deal like i didnt know his investigator might be a witness well thats the only new name i have at the moment maggie jumped into the fray with both feet your honor the prosecution is dutybound to turn over all discovery materials thirty days prior to trial by my count we are still forty days out mr royce is complaining about a goodfaith effort on the part of the prosecution to provide him with discovery material before it even has to it seems that no good deed goes unpunished with mr royce the judge held up her hand to stop commentary while she looked at the calendar hanging on the wall to the left of her desk i think ms mcpherson makes a good point she said your complaint is premature mr royce all discovery materials are due to both sides by this friday march fifth if you have a problem then we will take this up again yes your honor royce said meekly i wanted to reach over raise maggies hand in the air and shake it in victory but i didnt think that would be appropriate still it felt good to win at least one point against royce after discussion of a few more routine pretrial issues the meeting ended and we walked out through the judges courtroom i stopped there to talk small talk with the judges clerk i didnt really know her that well but i didnt want to walk out of the courtroom with royce i was afraid i might lose my temper which would be exactly what hed want after he went through the double doors at the back of the courtroom i cut off the conversation and headed out with maggie at my side you kicked his ass maggie mcfierce i said to her verbally doesnt matter unless we kick it at trial dont worry we will i want you to take over discovery fulfillment go ahead and do what you prosecutors do haystack everything give him so much material hell never see what and whos important she smiled as she turned and used her back to push through the door now youre getting it i hope so what about sarah hes got to figure we found her and if hes smart he wont wait for discovery he probably has his own guy looking she can be found harry proved that theres not a whole lot we can do about it speaking of harry where is he this morning he called me and said he had some things to check out hell be around later you didnt really answer my question about sarah what should tell her that she might have another visitor somebody working for the defense but that she doesnt have to talk to anybody unless she wants to we headed out into the hallway and then went left toward the elevator bank if she doesnt talk to them royce will complain to the judge shes the key witness mickey so the judge wont be able to make her talk if she doesnt want to talk meantime royce loses prep time he wants to play games like he did with the judge in there then well play games too in fact how about this we put every convict jessup ever shared a prison cell with on the witness list that should keep his investigators out of the way for a while a broad smile broke across maggies face you really are getting it arent you we squeezed onto the crowded elevator maggie and i were close enough to kiss i looked down into her eyes as i spoke thats because i dont want to lose wednesday february am after school dropoff bosch turned his car around and headed back up woodrow wilson past his house and to what those in the neighborhood called the upper crossing with mulholland drive both mulholland and woodrow wilson were long and winding mountain roads they intersected twice at the bottom and top of the mountain thus the local description of upper and lower crossings at the top of the mountain bosch turned right onto mulholland and followed it until it crossed laurel canyon boulevard he then pulled off the road to make a call on his cell he punched in the number shipley had given him for the sis dispatch sergeant his name was willman and he would know the current status of any sis surveillance at any given time sis could be working four or five unrelated cases each was given a code name in order to keep them in order and so that the real names of suspects did not ever go out over the radio bosch knew that the jessup surveillance had been termed operation retro because it involved an old case and a retrial this is bosch rhd im lead on the retro case i want to get a location on the suspect because im about to pull into one of his favorite haunts i want to make sure i dont run into him hold one bosch could hear the phone being put down then a radio conversation in which the duty sergeant asked for jessups location the response was garbled with static by the time it reached bosch over the phone he waited for the sergeants official response retro is in pocket right now he promptly reported to bosch they think hes catching zs in pocket meant he was at home then im clear bosch said thank you sergeant any time bosch closed the phone and pulled the car back onto mulholland a few curves later he reached fryman canyon park and turned in bosch had talked to shipley early that morning as he was passing surveillance off to the day team he reported that jessup had once again visited both franklin and fryman canyons bosch was becoming consumed with curiosity about what jessup was up to and this was only increased by the report that jessup had also driven by the house on windsor where the landy family had once lived fryman was a rugged inclined park with steep trails and a flatsurface parking and observation area on top and just off mulholland bosch had been there before on cases and was familiar with its expanse he pulled to a stop with his car pointing north and the view of the san fernando valley spread before him the air was pretty clear and the vista stretched all the way across the valley to the san gabriel mountains the brutal week of storms that had ended january had cleared the skies out and the smog was only now climbing back into the valleys bowl after a few minutes bosch got out and walked over to the bench where shipley had told him jessup had sat for twenty minutes while looking out at the lights below bosch sat down and checked his watch he had an eleven oclock appointment with a witness that gave him more than an hour sitting where jessup had sat brought no vibe or insight into what the suspect was doing on his frequent visits to the mountainside parks bosch decided to move on down mulholland to franklin canyon but franklin canyon park offered him the same thing a large natural respite in the midst of a teeming city bosch found the picnic area shipley and the sis reports had described but once again didnt understand the pull the park had for jessup he found the terminus of blinderman trail and walked it until his legs started to hurt because of the incline he turned around and headed back to the parking and picnic area still puzzled by jessups activities on his return bosch passed a large old sycamore that the trail had been routed around he noticed a buildup of a grayishwhite material at the base of the tree between two fingers of exposed roots he looked closer and realized it was wax somebody had burned a candle there were signs all over the park warning against smoking or the use of matches as fire was the parks greatest threat but somebody had lit a candle at the base of the tree bosch wanted to call shipley to ask if jessup could have lit a candle while in the park the night before but knew it was the wrong move shipley had just come off a night of surveillance and was probably in his bed asleep harry would wait for the evening to make the call he looked around the tree for any other signs that jessup had possibly been in the area it looked like an animal had burrowed recently in a few spots under the tree but otherwise there was no sign of activity as he came off the trail and into the clearing where the picnic area was located bosch saw a city parks ranger looking into a trash can from which he had removed the top harry approached him officer the man whipped around still holding the top of the trash can away from his body yes sir sorry i didnt mean to sneak up on you i was i was walking up on that trail and theres a big tree therei think a sycamoreand it looks like somebody burned a candle down at its base i was wondering where up on blinderman trail show me actually im not going to go all the way back up there i dont have the right shoes its the big tree in the middle of the trail im sure you can find it you cant light fires in the park the ranger put the top back on the trash can banging it loudly to underline his statement i know thats why i was reporting it but i wanted to ask you is there anything special about that tree that would make somebody do that every tree is special here the whole park is special yes i get that can you just tell can i see some id please excuse me id i want to see some id a man in a shirt and tie walking the trails with the wrong shoes is a little bit suspicious to me bosch shook his head and pulled out his badge wallet yeah heres my id he opened it and held it out and gave the ranger a few moments to study it bosch saw the nameplate on his uniform said brorein okay bosch said can we get to my questions now officer brorein im a city ranger not an officer brorein said is this part of an investigation no its part of a situation where you just answer my questions about the tree up on that trail bosch pointed in the direction he had come from you get it now he asked brorein shook his head im sorry but youre on my turf here and its my obligation to no pal youre actually on my turf but thanks for all the help ill make a note of it in the report bosch walked away from him and headed back toward the parking clearing brorein called after him as far as i know theres nothing special about that tree its just a tree detective borsh bosch waved without looking back he added poor reading skills to the list of things he didnt like about brorein wednesday february pm my successes as a defense attorney invariably came when the prosecution was unprepared for and surprised by my moves the entire government grinds along on routine prosecuting violators of the governments laws is no different as a newly minted prosecutor i took this to heart and vowed not to succumb to the comfort and dangers of routine i promised myself that i would be more than ready for clever clive royces moves i would anticipate them i would know them before royce did and i would be like a sniper in a tree waiting to skillfully pick them off from a distance one by one this promise brought maggie mcfierce and me together in my new office for frequent strategy sessions and on this afternoon the discussion was focused on what would be the centerpiece of our opponents pretrial defense we knew royce would be filing a motion to dismiss the case that was a given what we were discussing were the grounds on which he would make the motion i wanted to be ready for each one it is said that in war the sniper ambushes an enemy patrol by first taking out the commander the radioman and the medic if he accomplishes this the remaining members of the patrol panic and scatter this was what i hoped to quickly do when royce filed his motion i wanted to move swiftly and thoroughly with demoralizing arguments and answers that would put the defendant on strong notice that he was in trouble if i panicked jessup i might not even have to go to trial i might get a disposition a plea and a plea was a conviction that was as good as a win on this side of the aisle i think one thing hes going to argue is that the charges are no longer valid without a preliminary hearing maggie said this will give him two bites out of the apple hell first ask the judge to dismiss but at the very least to order a new prelim but the verdict of the trial was what was reversed i said it goes back to the trial and we have a new trial the prelim is not what was challenged well thats what well argue good you get to handle that one what else im not going to keep throwing out angles if you keep giving them back to me to be prepared for thats the third one youve given me and by my scorecard youve only taken one okay ill take the next one sight unseen what do you have maggie smiled and i realized i had just walked into my own ambush but before she could pull the trigger the office door opened and bosch entered without knocking saved by the bell i said harry whats up ive got a witness i think you two should hear i think hes going to be good for us and they didnt use him in the first trial who maggie asked bill clinton bosch said i didnt recognize the name as belonging to anyone associated with the case but maggie with her command of case detail brought it together one of the tow truck drivers who worked with jessup bosch pointed at her right he worked with jessup back then at aardvark towing now he owns an auto repair shop on labrea near olympic its called presidential motors of course it is i said what does he do for us as a witness bosch pointed toward the door i got him sitting out there with lorna why dont i bring him in and he can tell you himself i looked at maggie and seeing no objection i told bosch to bring clinton in before stepping out bosch lowered his voice and reported that he had run clinton through the crime databases and he had come up clean he had no criminal record nothing bosch said not even an unpaid parking ticket good maggie said now lets see what he has to say bosch went out to the reception room and came back with a short man in his midfifties who was wearing blue work pants and a shirt with an oval patch above the breast pocket it said bill his hair was neatly combed and he didnt wear glasses i saw grease under his fingernails but figured that could be remedied before he ever appeared in front of a jury bosch pulled a chair away from the wall and placed it in the middle of the room and facing my desk why dont you sit down here mr clinton and well ask you some questions he said bosch then nodded to me passing the lead first of all mr clinton thank you for agreeing to come in and talk to us today clinton nodded thats okay things are kind of slow at the shop right now what kind of work do you do at the shop is there a specialty yeah we do restoration mostly british cars triumphs mgs jags collectibles like that i see whats a triumph tr twofifty go for these days clinton looked up at me surprised by my apparent knowledge of one of the cars he specialized in depends on the shape i sold a beauty last year for twentyfive i put almost twelve into the restoration that and a lot of manhours i nodded i had one in high school wish id never sold it they only made them for one year sixtyeight makes it one of the most collectible i nodded we had just covered everything i knew about the car i just liked it because of its wooden dashboard and the drop top i used to cruise up to malibu in it on weekends hang out on the surf beaches even though i didnt know how to surf well lets jump from sixtyeight to eightysix okay clinton shrugged fine by me if you dont mind ms mcpherson is going to take notes clinton shrugged again so then lets start how well do you remember the day that melissa landy was murdered clinton spread his hands well see i remember it real well because of what happened that little girl getting killed and it turning out i was working with the guy who did it mustve been pretty traumatic yeah it was for a while there and then you put it out of your mind no not exactly but i stopped thinking about it all the time i started my business and everything i nodded clinton seemed genuine enough and honest it was a start i looked at bosch i knew he had pulled some nugget from clinton that he believed was gold i wanted him to take over bill bosch said tell them a little about what was going on with aardvark at the time about how business was bad clinton nodded yeah well back then we werent doing so hot what happened was they passed a law that nobody could park on the side streets off of wilshire without a resident sticker you know anybody else we got to tow so we would go in the neighborhoods on a sunday morning and hook up cars right and left on account of the church services in the beginning mr korish was the owner and we were getting so many cars that he hired another driver and even started paying us for our overtime it was fun because there were a couple other companies with the same contract so we were all competing for tows it was like keeping score and we were a team clinton looked at bosch to see if he was telling the right story harry nodded and told him to keep going so then it all kind of went bad the people started getting wise and they stopped parking over there somebody said the church was even making announcements dont park north of wilshire so we went from having too much to do to not enough so mr korish said he had to cut back on costs and one of us was going to have to go and maybe even two of us he said he was going to watch our performance levels and make his decision based on that when did he tell you this in relation to the day of the murder bosch asked it was right before because all three of us were still there see he didnt fire anybody yet taking over the questioning i asked him what the new edict did to the competition among tow truck drivers well it made it rough you know we were all friends and then all of a sudden we didnt like each other because we wanted to keep our jobs how was jason jessup to work with then well jason was real cutthroat the pressure got to him yeah because he was in last place mr korish put up a tote board to keep track of the tows and he was last place and he wasnt happy about it no not happy he became a real prick to work with excuse my french do you remember how he acted on the day of the murder a little bit like i told detective bosch he started claiming streets like saying windsor was all his and las palmas and lucerne like that and me and derekhe was the other driverwe told him there were no rules like that and he said fine try hooking a car on one of those streets and see what happens he threatened you yeah you could say that definitely do you remember specifically that windsor was one of the streets he claimed was his yes i do he claimed windsor this was all good information it would go to the state of mind of the defendant it would be a challenge getting it on the record if there wasnt additional corroboration from wilbern or korish if either was still alive and available did he ever act on that threat in any way maggie asked no clinton said but that was the same day as the girl so he got arrested and that was that i cant say i was too upset about seeing him go turned out mr korish then laid off derek cause he lied about not having a record i was the last man standing i worked there another four yearstill i saved up the money to start my place a regular american success story i waited to see if maggie had a follow but she didnt i did mr clinton did you ever talk about any of this with the police or prosecutors twentyfour years ago clinton shook his head not really i mean i spoke to the detective who was in charge back then he asked me questions but i wasnt ever brought to court or anything like that because they didnt need you back then i thought but im going to need you now what makes you so sure that this threat from jessup occurred on the day of the murder i just know it was that day i remember that day because its not every day that a guy youre working with gets arrested for murder he nodded as if to underscore the point i looked at bosch to see if we had missed anything bosch took the cue and took back the lead bill tell them what you told me about being in the police car with jessup on the way to windsor clinton nodded he could be led easily and i took that as another good sign well what happened was they really thought that derek was the guy the police did he had a criminal record and lied about it and they found out so that made him suspect numero uno so they put derek in the back of one patrol car and then me and jason in another did they say where they were taking you they said they had additional questions so we thought we were going to the police station there were two officers in the car with us and we heard them talking about all of us being in a lineup jason asked them about it and they said it was no big thing they just wanted guys in overalls because they wanted to see if a witness could pick out derek clinton stopped there and looked expectantly from bosch to me and then to maggie so what happened i asked well first jason told the two cops that they couldnt just take us and put us in a lineup like that they just said that they were following orders so we go over to windsor and pull up in front of a house the cops got out and went and talked to the lead detective who was standing there with some other detectives jason and i were watching out the windows but didnt see any witness or anything then the detective in charge goes inside the house and doesnt come back out we dont know whats going on and then jason says to me he wants to borrow my hat your hat maggie asked yeah my dodgers hat i was wearing it like i always did and jason said he needed to borrow it because he recognizes one of the other cops that was already standing there at the house when we pulled up he said that he got in a fight with the guy over a tow and if he sees him theres going to be trouble he goes on like that and says let me have your hat what did you do i asked well i didnt think it was a big deal on account of i didnt know what i knew later you know what i mean so i gave him my hat and he put it on then when the cops came back to get us out of the car they didnt seem to notice that the hat was switched they made us get out of the car and we had to go over and stand next to derek we were standing there and then one of the cops gets a call on the radioi remember thatand he turns and tells jason to take off the hat he did and then a few minutes later theyre all of a sudden surrounding jason and putting the cuffs on him and it wasnt derek it was him i looked from clinton to bosch and then to maggie i could see in her expression that the hat story was significant you know the funny thing clinton asked no what i said i never got that hat back he smiled and i smiled back well well have to get you a new hat when this is all said and done now let me ask you the key question what you have told us here are you willing to testify to all of it at jason jessups trial clinton seemed to think about it for a few seconds before nodding yeah i could do that he said i stood up and came around the desk extending my hand then it looks like weve got ourselves a witness many thanks to you mr clinton we shook hands and then i gestured to bosch harry i should have asked you did we cover everything bosch stood up as well i think so for now ill take mr clinton back to his shop excellent thank you again mr clinton clinton stood up please call me bill we will i promise well call you bill and well call you as a witness everybody laughed in that phony way and then bosch shepherded clinton out of the office i went back to my desk and sat down so tell me about the hat i said to maggie its a good connection she said when we interviewed sarah she remembered that kloster radioed from the bedroom down to the street and had them make jessup take off his hat that was when she made the id harry then looked through the case file and found a property list from jessups arrest the dodgers hat was on there were still trying to track his propertyhard to do after twentyfour years but it might have gone up to san quentin either way if we dont have the hat we have the list i nodded this was good on a number of levels it showed witnesses independently corroborating each other put a crack in any sort of defense contention that memories cannot be trusted after so many years and last but not least showed state of mind of the defendant jessup knew he was somehow in danger of being identified someone had seen him abduct the girl all right good i said what do you think about the initial stuff about how there was competition between them and somebody was going to get laid off maybe two of them again its good stateofmind material jessup was under pressure and he acted out maybe this whole thing was about that maybe we should put a shrink on the witness list i nodded did you tell bosch to find and interview clinton she shook her head he did it on his own hes good at this i know i just wish hed tell me a little more about what hes up to thursday february am rachel walling wanted to meet at an office in one of the glass towers in downtown bosch went to the address and took the elevator up to the thirtyfourth floor the door to the offices of franco becerra itzuris attorneysatlaw was locked and he had to knock rachel answered promptly and invited him into a luxurious suite of offices that was empty of lawyers clerks and anybody else she led him to the firms boardroom where he saw the box and files he had given her the week before on a large oval table they entered and he walked over to the floortoceiling windows that looked out over downtown bosch couldnt remember being up so high in downtown he could see all the way to dodger stadium and beyond he checked out the civic center and saw the glasssided pab sitting next to the los angeles times building his eyes then scanned toward echo park and he remembered a day there with rachel walling they had been a team then in more ways than one but now that seemed so long ago what is this place he said still staring out and with his back to her where is everybody there isnt anybody we just used this in a moneylaundering sting so its been empty half of this building is empty the economy this was a real law office but it went out of business so we just sort of borrowed it the management was happy for the government subsidy they were washing money from drugs guns you know i cant say harry i am sure youll read about it in a few months youll put it together then bosch nodded as he remembered the firms name on the door franco becerra itzuris fbi clever i wonder if management will tell the next tenants that this place was used by the bureau to take down some bad people friends of those bad people could come looking she didnt respond to that she just invited him to sit down at the table he did taking a good look at her as she sat across from him her hair was down which was unusual he had seen her that way before but not while she was on duty the dark ringlets framed her face and helped direct attention to her dark eyes the firms refrigerator is empty or id offer you something to drink im fine she opened the box and started taking out the files he had given her rachel i really appreciate this bosch said i hope it didnt disrupt your life too much the work no i enjoyed it but you harry you coming back into my life was a disruption bosch wasnt expecting that what do you mean im in a relationship and id told him about you about the singlebullet theory all of that so he wasnt happy that ive been spending my nights off working this up for you bosch wasnt sure about how to respond rachel walling always hid deeper messages in the things she said he wasnt sure if there was more to be considered than what she had just said out loud im sorry he finally said did you tell him it was only work that i just wanted your professional opinion that i went to you because i can trust you and youre the best at this he knows im the best at it but it doesnt matter lets just do this she opened a file my exwife is dead he said she was killed last year in hong kong he wasnt sure why hed blurted it out like that she looked up at him sharply and he knew she hadnt known oh my god im so sorry bosch just nodded deciding not to tell her the details what about your daughter she lives with me now shes doing okay but its been pretty tough on her its only been four months she nodded and then seemed to lose her grounding as she took in what had just been said what about you i assume its been rough for you too he nodded but couldnt think of the right words he had his daughter fully in his life now but at a terrible cost he realized that he had brought the subject up but couldnt talk about it look he said that was weird i dont know why i just laid that on you you mentioned the single bullet and i remember i told you about her we can talk about it some other time i mean if you want lets just get to the case now is that okay yes sure i was just thinking about your daughter to lose her mother and then have to move so far from the place she knows i mean i know living with you will be fine but its quite an adjustment yeah but they say kids are resilient because they actually are shes got a lot of friends already and is doing well in school its been a major adjustment for both of us but i think shell come out okay and how will you come out bosch held her eyes for a moment before answering ive already come out ahead i have my daughter with me and shes the best thing in my life thats good harry it is she broke eye contact and finished removing the files and photos from the box bosch could see the transformation she was now all business an fbi profiler ready to report her findings he reached into his pocket and pulled out his notebook it was in a folding leather case with a detective shield embossed on the cover he opened it and got ready to write i want to start with the photos she said fine she spread out four photos of melissa landys body in the dumpster turning them to face him she then added two photos from the autopsy in a row above these photos of a dead child were never easy to look at for bosch but these were particularly difficult he stared for a long moment before coming to the realization that the clutch in his gut was due to the setting of the body in a dumpster for the girl to be disposed of like that seemed almost like a statement about the victim and an added insult to those who loved her the dumpster he said you think that was chosen as a statement walling paused as if considering it for the first time im actually going at it from a different standpoint i think that it was an almost spontaneous choice that it wasnt part of a plan he needed a place to dump the body where he wouldnt be seen and it wouldnt be immediately found he knew about that dumpster behind that theater and he used it it was a convenience not a statement bosch nodded he leaned forward and wrote a note on his pad to remind himself to go back to clinton and ask about the dumpster the el rey was in the wilshire corridor the aardvark drivers worked it might have been familiar to them sorry i didnt mean to start things off in the wrong direction he said as he wrote thats okay the reason i wanted to start with the photos of the girl is that i believe that this crime may have been misunderstood from the very beginning misunderstood well it appears that the original investigators took the crime scene at face value and looked at it as the result of the suspects kill plan in other words jessup grabbed this girl and his plan was to strangle her and leave her in the dumpster this is evidenced by the profile that was drawn up of the crime and submitted to the fbi and the california department of justice for comparison to other crimes on record she opened a file and pulled out the lengthy profile and submission forms prepared by detective kloster twentyfour years earlier detective kloster was looking for similar crimes that he might be able to attach jessup to he got zero hits and that was the end of that bosch had spent several days studying the original case file and knew everything that walling was telling him but he let her run with it without interruption because he had a feeling she would take him somewhere new that was her beauty and art it didnt matter that the fbi didnt recognize it and use her to the best of her abilities he always would i think what happened was that this case had a faulty profile from the beginning add to that the fact that back then the data banks were obviously not as sophisticated or as inclusive as they are now this whole angle was misdirected and wrong and so no wonder they hit a dead end with it bosch nodded and wrote a quick note you tried to rebuild the profile he asked as much as i could and the starting point is right here the photos take a look at her injuries bosch leaned across the table and over the first row of photographs he actually didnt see injuries to the girl she had been dropped haphazardly into the almost full trash bin there must have been stage building or a renovation project going on inside the theater because the bin contained mostly construction refuse sawdust paint buckets small pieces of cut and broken wood there were small cuts of wallboard and torn plastic sheeting melissa landy was faceup near one of the corners of the dumpster bosch didnt see a drop of blood on her or her dress what injuries are we talking about he asked walling stood up in order to lean over she used the point of a pen to outline the places she wanted bosch to look on each of the photos she circled discolorations on the victims neck her neck injuries she said if you look you see the ovalshaped bruising on the right side of the neck and on the other side you have a larger corresponding bruise this evidence makes it clear that she was choked to death with one hand she used the pen to illustrate what she was saying the thumb here on her right side and the four fingers on the left onehanded now why onehanded she sat back down and bosch leaned back away from the photos himself the idea that melissa had been strangled with one hand was not new to bosch it was in klosters original profile of the murder twentyfour years ago it was suggested that jessup strangled the girl with his right hand while he masturbated with his left this theory was built on one thingthe semen collected from the victims dress it was deposited by someone with the same blood type as jessup and so it was assumed to have come from him you follow all of this im with you okay so the problem is we now know that the semen didnt come from jessup and so the basic profile or theory of the crime in nineteen eightysix is wrong it is further demonstrated as being wrong because jessup is righthanded according to a sample of his writing in the files and studies have shown that with righthanders masturbation is almost always carried out by the dominant hand theyve done studies on that youd be surprised i sure was when i went online to look for this i knew there was something wrong with the internet she smiled but was not a bit embarrassed by the subject matter of their discussion it was all in a days work theyve done studies on everything including which hand people use to wipe their butts i actually found it to be fascinating reading but the point here is that they had this wrong from the beginning this murder did not occur during a sex act now let me show you a few other photos she reached across the table and slid all of the photos together in one stack and then put them to the side she then spread out photos taken of the inside of the tow truck jessup was driving on the day of the murder the truck actually had a name which was stenciled on the dashboard okay so on the day in question jessup was driving matilda walling said bosch studied the three photos she had spread out the cab of the tow truck was in neat order thomas brothers mapsno gps back thenwere neatly stacked on top of the dashboard and a small stuffed animal that bosch presumed was an aardvark hung from the rearview mirror a cup holder on the center console held a big gulp from eleven and a sticker on the glove compartment door read grass or assnobody rides for free with her trusty pen walling circled a spot on one of the photos it was a police scanner mounted under the dashboard did anybody consider what this means bosch shrugged back then i dont know whats it mean now okay jessup worked for aardvark which was a towing company licensed by the city however it wasnt the only one there was competition among tow companies the drivers listened to scanners picking up police calls about accidents and parking infractions it gave them the jump on the competition right except that every tow truck had a scanner and everybody was listening and trying to get the jump on everyone else right so whats it mean well lets look at the abduction first it is pretty clear from the witness testimony and everything else that this was not a crime of great planning and patience this was an impulse crime that much theyve had right from the beginning we can talk about the motivating factors at length in a little while but suffice it to say something caused jessup to act out in an almost uncontrollable way i think i might have motivating factors covered bosch said good im eager to hear about it but for now we will assume that some sort of internal pressure led jessup to act on an undeniable impulse and he grabbed the girl he took her back to the truck and took off he obviously didnt know about the sister hiding in the bushes and that she would sound the alarm so he completes the abduction and drives away but within minutes he hears the report about the abduction on the police scanner he has in the truck that brings home to him the reality of what hes done and what his predicament is he never imagined things would move so fast he more or less comes to his senses he realizes he must abandon his plan now and move into preservation mode he needs to kill the girl to eliminate her as a witness and then hide her body in order to prevent his arrest bosch nodded as he understood her theory so what youre saying is the crime that occurred was not the crime that he intended correct he abandoned the true plan so when kloster went to the bureau looking for similars he was looking for the wrong thing right again but could there actually have been a plan you just said yourself that it was a crime of compulsion he saw an opportunity and within a few seconds acted on it what plan could there have been actually it is more than likely that he had a complex and complete plan killers like these have a paraphiliaa set construct of the perfect psychosexual experience they fantasize about it in great detail and as you can expect it often involves torture and murder the paraphilia is part of their daily fantasy life and it builds to the point where the desire becomes the urge which eventually becomes a compulsion to act out when they do cross that line and act out the abduction of the victim may be completely unplanned and improvisational but the killing sequence is not the victim is unfortunately dropped into a set construct that has played over and over in the killers mind bosch looked at his notebook and realized he had stopped taking notes okay but youre saying that didnt happen here he said he abandoned the plan he heard the abduction report on the scanner and that took him from fantasy to reality he realized that they could be closing in on him he killed her and dumped her hoping to avoid detection exactly and therefore as you just noted when investigators attempted to compare elements of this murder to others they were comparing apples and oranges they found nothing that matched and believed that this was a onetime crime of opportunity and compulsion i dont think it was bosch looked up from the photos to rachels eyes you think he did this before i think the idea that he had acted out before in this way is compelling it would not surprise me if you were to find that he was involved in other abductions youre talking about more than twentyfour years ago i know and since there was no linking of jessup to known unsolved murders we are probably talking about missing children and runaways cases where there was never a crime scene established the girls were never found bosch thought of jessups middleofthenight visits to the parks along mulholland drive he thought he might now know why jessup would light a candle at the base of a tree then a more stunning and scary thought pushed through do you think a guy like this would use those crimes from so long ago to feed his fantasy now of course he would hes been in prison what other choice did he have bosch felt an urgency take hold inside an urgency that came with the growing certainty that they werent dealing with an isolated instance of murder if wallings theory was correct and he had no reason to doubt it jessup was a repeater and though he had been on ice for twentyfour years he was now roaming the city freely it would not be long now before he became vulnerable to the pressures and urges that had driven him to deadly action before bosch came to a fast resolve the next time jessup was seized by the pressures of his life and overcome by the compulsion to kill bosch was going to be there to destroy him his eyes refocused and he realized rachel was looking at him oddly thank you for all of this rachel he said i think i need to go thursday march am it was only a hearing on pretrial motions but the courtroom was packed lots of courthouse gadflies and media and a fair number of trial lawyers were sitting in as well i sat at the prosecution table with maggie and we were going over our arguments once again all issues before judge breitman had already been argued and submitted on paper this would be when the judge could ask further questions and then announce her rulings i had a growing sense of anxiety the motions submitted by clive royce were all pretty routine and maggie and i had submitted solid responses we were also ready with oral arguments to back them but a hearing like this was also a time for the unexpected on more than one occasion i had sandbagged the prosecution in a pretrial hearing and sometimes the case is won or lost before the trial begins with a ruling in one of these hearings i leaned back and looked behind us and then took a quick glance around the courtroom i gave a phony smile and nod to a lawyer i saw in the spectator section then turned back to maggie wheres bosch i asked i dont think hes going to be here why not hes completely disappeared in the last week hes been working on something he called yesterday and asked if he had to be here for this and i said he didnt hed better be working on something related to jessup he tells me it is and that hes going to bring it to us soon thats nice of him the trial starts in four weeks i wondered why bosch had chosen to call her instead of me the lead prosecutor i realized that this made me upset with maggie as well as bosch listen i dont know what happened between you two on your little trip to port townsend but he should be calling me maggie shook her head as if dealing with a petulant child look you dont have to worry he knows youre the lead prosecutor he probably figures you are too busy for the daytoday updates on what hes doing and im going to forget what you said about port townsend this one time you make another insinuation like that and you and i are going to have a real problem okay im sorry its just that my attention was drawn across the aisle to jessup who was sitting at the defense table with royce he was staring at me with a smirk on his face and i realized he had been watching maggie and me maybe even listening excuse me a second i said i got up and walked over to the defense table i leaned over him can i help you with something jessup before jessup could say a word his lawyer cut in dont talk to my client mick royce said if you want to ask him something then you ask me now jessup smiled again emboldened by his attorneys defensive move just go sit down jessup said i got nothing to say to you royce held his hand up to quiet him ill handle this you be quiet he threatened me you should complain to the judge i said be quiet and that i would handle this jessup folded his arms and leaned back in his chair mick is there a problem here royce asked no no problem i just dont like him staring at me i walked back to the prosecution table annoyed with myself for losing my calm i sat down and looked at the pool camera set up in the jury box judge breitman had approved the filming of the trial and the various hearings leading up to it but only through the use of a pool camera which would provide a universal feed that all channels and networks could use a few minutes later the judge took the bench and called the hearing to order one by one we went through the defense motions and the rulings mostly fell our way without much further argument the most important one was the routine motion to dismiss for lack of evidence which the judge rejected with little comment when royce asked to be heard she said that it wasnt necessary to discuss the issue further it was a solid rebuke and i loved it even though outwardly i acted as though it were routine and boring the only ruling the judge wanted to discuss in detail was the oddball request by royce to allow his client to use makeup during trial to cover the tattoos on his neck and fingers royce had argued in his motion that the tattoos were all prison tattoos applied while he was falsely incarcerated for twentyfour years he said the tattoos could be prejudicial when noticed by jurors his client intended to cover these with skintone makeup and he wanted to bar the prosecution from addressing it in front of the jury i have to admit i have not had a motion like this come before me the judge said im inclined to allow it and hold the prosecution from drawing attention to it but i see the prosecution has objected to the motion saying that it contains insufficient information about the content and history of these tattoos can you shed some light on the subject mr royce royce stood and addressed the court from his place at the defense table i looked over and my eyes were drawn to jessups hands i knew the tattoos across his knuckles were royces chief concern the neck markings could largely be covered with a collared shirt which he would wear with a suit at trial but the hands were difficult to hide across the four digits of each hand he had inked the sentiment fuck this and royce knew that i would make sure it was seen by jurors that sentiment was probably the chief impediment to having jessup testify in his defense because royce knew i would find a way either casually or specifically to make sure the jury got his message your honor it is the defenses position that these tattoos were administered to mr jessups body while he was falsely imprisoned and are a product of that harrowing experience prison is a dangerous place judge and inmates take measures to protect themselves sometimes it is through tattooing that is designed to be intimidating or to show an association the prisoner might not actually have or believe in it would certainly be prejudicial for the jury to see and therefore we ask for relief this i might add is merely a tactic by the prosecution to delay the trial and the defense firmly stands by its decision to not delay justice in this case maggie stood up quickly she had handled this motion on paper and therefore it was hers to handle in court your honor may i be heard on the defenses accusation one moment ms mcpherson i want to be heard myself mr royce can you explain your last statement royce bowed politely yes of course judge breitman the defendant has begun to go through a tattoo removal process but this takes time and will not be completed by trial by objecting to our simple request to use makeup the prosecution is trying to push the trial back until this removal process is completed its an effort to subvert the speedy trial statute which since day one the defense to the prosecutions consternation has refused to waive the judge turned her gaze to maggie mcfierce it was her turn your honor this is simply a defense fabrication the state has not once asked for a delay or opposed the defenses request for a speedy trial in fact the prosecution is ready for trial so this statement is outlandish and objectionable the true objection on the part of the prosecution to this motion is to the idea of the defendant being allowed to disguise himself a trial is a search for truth and allowing him to use makeup to cover up who he really is would be an affront to the search for truth thank you your honor judge may i respond royce still standing said immediately breitman paused for a moment while she wrote a few notes from maggies brief that wont be necessary mr royce she finally said im going to make a ruling on this and i will allow mr jessup to cover his tattoos if he chooses to testify on his behalf the prosecution will not address this issue with him in front of the jury thank you your honor maggie said she sat down without showing any outward sign of disappointment it was just one ruling among many others and most had gone the prosecutions way this loss was minor at worst okay the judge said i think we have covered everything anything else from counsel at this time yes your honor royce said as he stood again defense has a new motion we would like to submit he stepped away from the defense table and brought copies of the new motion first to the judge and then to us giving maggie and me individual copies of a onepage motion maggie was a fast reader a skill she had genetically passed on to our daughter who was reading two books a week on top of her homework this is bullshit she whispered before i had even finished reading the title of the document but i caught up quickly royce was adding a new lawyer to the defense team and the motion was to disqualify maggie from the prosecution because of a conflict of interest the new lawyers name was david bell maggie quickly turned around to scan the spectator seats my eyes followed and there was david bell sitting at the end of the second row i knew him on sight because i had seen him with maggie in the months after our marriage had ended one time i had come to her apartment to pick up my daughter and bell had opened the door maggie turned back and started to stand to address the court but i put my hand on her shoulder and held her in place im taking this i said no wait she whispered urgently ask for a tenminute recess we need to talk about this exactly what i was going to do i stood and addressed the judge your honor like you we just got this we can take it with us and submit but we would rather argue it right now if the court could indulge us with a brief recess i think we would be ready to respond fifteen minutes mr haller i have another matter holding i could handle it and come back to you thank you your honor this meant we had to leave the table while another prosecutor handled his business before the judge we pushed our files and maggies laptop to the back of the table to make room then got up and walked toward the back door of the courtroom as we passed bell he raised a hand to get maggies attention but she ignored him and walked by you want to go upstairs maggie asked as we came through the double doors she was suggesting that we go up to the das office there isnt time to wait for an elevator we could take the stairs its only three flights we walked through the door into the buildings enclosed stairwell but then i grabbed her arm this is good enough right here i said tell me what we do about bell that piece of shit hes never defended a criminal case let alone a murder in his life yeah you wouldnt have made the same mistake twice she looked pointedly at me whats that supposed to mean never mind bad joke lets just stay on point she had her arms folded tightly against her chest this is the most underhanded thing ive ever seen royce wants me off the case so he goes to bell and bell i cant believe he would do something like this to me yeah well hes probably in it for a dip into the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow we probably should have seen something like this coming it was a defense tactic i had used myself before but not with such obviousness if you didnt like the judge or the prosecutor one way of getting them off the case was to bring someone onto your team who has a conflict of interest with them since the defendant is constitutionally guaranteed the defense counsel of his choice it is usually the judge or prosecutor who must be disqualified from the trial it was a shrewd move by royce you see what hes doing right maggie said he is trying to isolate you he knows im the one person you would trust as second chair and hes trying to take that away from you he knows that without me you are going to lose thanks for your confidence in me you know what i mean youve never prosecuted a case im there to help you through it if he gets me kicked off the table then who are you going to have who would you trust i nodded she was right okay give me the facts how long were you with bell with him i wasnt we went out briefly seven years ago no more than two months and if he says differently hes a liar is the conflict that you had the relationship or is there something else something you did or said something he has knowledge of that creates the conflict theres nothing we went out and it just didnt take who dropped who she paused and looked down at the floor he did i nodded then theres the conflict he can claim you carry a grudge a woman scorned is that it this is such bullshit you men are hold on maggie hold on im saying that is their argument i am not agreeing in fact i want the door to the stairwell opened and the prosecutor who took our places when we had gotten up for the recess entered and started up the steps i checked my watch only eight minutes had gone by she went back into chambers he said as he passed you guys are fine thanks i waited until i heard his steps on the next landing before continuing in a quiet tone with maggie okay how do i fight this you tell the judge that this is an obvious attempt to sabotage the prosecution theyve hired an attorney for the sole reason that he had a relationship with me not because of any skill he brings to the table i nodded okay what else i dont know i cant think it was remote in time no strong emotional attachment no effect on professional judgment or conduct yeah yeah yeah and what about bell does he have something or know something i have to watch out for she looked at me like i was some sort of traitor maggie i need to know so theres no surprise on top of the surprise okay fine theres nothing he must really be hard up if hes taking a fee just to knock me off the case dont worry two can play this game lets go we went back into the courtroom and as we went through the gate i nodded to the clerk so she could call the judge back from chambers instead of going to the prosecution table i diverted to the defense side where royce was sitting next to his client david bell was now seated at the table on the other side of jessup i leaned over royces shoulder and whispered just loud enough that his client would hear clive when the judge comes out ill give you the chance to withdraw this motion if you dont number one im going to embarrass you in front of the camera and it will be digitally preserved forever and number two the releaseandremuneration offer i made to your client last week is withdrawn permanently i watched jessups eyebrows rise a few centimeters he hadnt heard anything about an offer involving money and freedom this was because i hadnt made one but now it would be up to royce to convince his client that he had not withheld anything from him good luck with that royce smiled like he was pleased with my comeback he leaned back casually and tossed his pen on his legal pad it was a montblanc with gold trim and that was no way to treat it this is really going to get good yes mick he said well ill tell you im not withdrawing the motion and i think if you had made me an offer involving release and remuneration i wouldve remembered it so he had called my bluff hed still have to convince his client i saw the judge step out from the door of her chambers and start up the three steps to the bench i took one more whispered shot at royce whatever you paid bell you wasted i stepped over to the prosecution table and remained standing the judge brought the courtroom to order okay back on the record in california versus jessup mr haller do you want to respond to the defendants latest motion or take it on submission your honor the prosecution wishes to respond right now to this motion go right ahead then i tried to build a good tone of outrage into my voice judge i am as cynical as the next guy but i have to say i am surprised by the defenses tactics here with this motion in fact this isnt a motion this is very plainly an attempt to subvert the trial system by denying the people of cal your honor royce interjected jumping to his feet i strenuously object to the character assassination mr haller is putting on the record and before the media this is nothing more than grand mr royce you will have an opportunity to respond after mr haller responds to your motion please be seated yes your honor royce sat down and i tried to remember where i was go ahead mr haller yes your honor as you know the prosecution turned over all discovery materials to the defense on tuesday what you have before you now is a very disingenuous motion spawned by mr royces realization of what he will be up against at trial he thought the state was going to roll over on this case he now knows that it is not going to do so but what does this have to do with the motion at hand mr haller the judge asked impatiently everything i said youve heard of judge shopping well mr royce is prosecutor shopping he knows through his examination of discovery materials that margaret mcpherson is perhaps the most important part of the prosecution team rather than take on the evidence at trial he is attempting to undercut the prosecution by splintering the team that has assembled that evidence here we are just four weeks before trial and he makes a move against my second chair he has hired an attorney with little to no experience in criminal defense not to mention defending a murder case why would he do that judge other than for the purpose of concocting this supposed conflict of interest your honor royce was on his feet again mr royce the judge said i told you you will have your chance the warning was very clear in her voice but your honor i cant sit down royce sat down and the judge put her attention back on me judge this is a cynical move made by a desperate defense i would hope that you would not allow him to subvert the intentions of the constitution like two men on a seesaw i went down and royce immediately popped up one moment mr royce the judge said holding up her hand and signaling him back down to his seat i want to talk to mr bell now it was bells turn to stand up he was a welldressed man with sandy hair and a ruddy complexion but i could see the apprehension in his eyes whether he had come to royce or royce had come to him it was clear that he had not anticipated having to stand in front of a judge and explain himself mr bell i have not had the pleasure of seeing you practice in my courtroom do you handle criminal defense sir uh no maam not ordinarily i am a trial attorney and i have been lead counsel in more than thirty trials i do know my way around a courtroom your honor well good for you how many of those trials were murder trials i felt total exhilaration as i watched what i had set in motion take on its own momentum royce looked mortified as he watched his plan shatter like an expensive vase none of them were murder trials per se but several were wrongful death cases not the same thing how many criminal trials do you have under your belt mr bell again judge none were criminal cases what do you bring to the defense of mr jessup your honor i bring a wealth of trial experience but i dont think that my résumé is on point here mr jessup is entitled to counsel of his choice and what exactly is the conflict you have with ms mcpherson bell looked perplexed did you understand the question the judge asked yes your honor the conflict is that we had an intimate relationship and now we would be opposing each other at trial were you married no your honor when was this intimate relationship and how long did it last it was seven years ago and it lasted about three months have you had contact with her since then bell raised his eyes to the ceiling as if looking for an answer maggie leaned over and whispered in my ear no your honor bell said i stood up your honor in the interest of full disclosure mr bell has sent ms mcpherson a christmas card for the past seven years she has not responded likewise there was a murmur of laughter in the courtroom the judge ignored it and looked down at something in front of her she looked like she had heard enough where is the conflict you are worried about mr bell uh judge this is a bit difficult to speak of in open court but i was the one who ended the relationship with ms mcpherson and my concern is that there could be some lingering animosity there and thats the conflict the judge wasnt buying this and everyone in the courtroom knew it it was becoming uncomfortable even to watch ms mcpherson the judge said maggie pushed back her chair and stood do you hold any lingering animosity toward mr bell no your honor at least not before today i moved on to better things i could hear another low rumble from the seats behind me as maggies spear struck home thank you ms mcpherson the judge said you can sit and so can you mr bell bell thankfully dropped into his chair the judge leaned forward and spoke matteroffactly into the benchs microphone the motion is denied royce stood up immediately your honor i was not heard before the ruling it was your motion mr royce but i would like to respond to some of the things mr haller said about mr royce ive made my ruling on it i dont see the need for further discussion do you royce realized his defeat could get even worse he cut his losses thank you your honor he sat down the judge then ended the hearing and we packed up and headed toward the rear doors but not as quickly as royce he and his client and supposed cocounsel split the courtroom like men who had to catch the last train on a friday night and this time royce didnt bother stopping outside the courtroom to chat with the media thanks for sticking up for me maggie said when we got to the elevators i shrugged you stuck up for yourself did you really mean that what you said about moving on from bell to better things from him yes definitely i looked at her but couldnt read her beyond the spoken line the elevator doors opened and there was harry bosch waiting to step off thursday march am bosch stepped off the elevator and almost walked right into haller and mcpherson is it over he asked you missed it haller said bosch quickly turned and hit one of the bumpers on the elevator doors before it could close are you going down thats the plan haller said in a tone that didnt hide his annoyance with bosch i thought you werent coming to the hearing i wasnt i was coming to get you two they rode the elevator down and bosch convinced them to walk with him a block over to the police administration building he signed them in as visitors and they went up to the fifth floor where robberyhomicide division was located this is the first time ive been here mcpherson said its as quiet as an insurance office yeah i guess we lost a lot of the charm when we moved bosch replied the pab had been in operation for only six months it had a quiet and sterile quality about it most of the buildings denizens including bosch missed the old headquarters parker center even though it was beyond decrepit ive got a private room over here he said pointing to a door on the far side of the squad room he used a key to unlock the door and they walked into a large space with a boardroomstyle table at center one wall was glass that looked out on the squad room but bosch had lowered and closed the blinds for privacy on the opposite wall was a large whiteboard with a row of photos across the top margin and numerous notes written beneath each shot the photos were of young girls ive been working on this nonstop for a week bosch said you probably have been wondering where i disappeared to so i figured it was time to show you what ive got mcpherson stopped just a few steps inside the door and stared squinting her eyes and revealing to bosch her vanity she needed glasses but hed never seen her wearing them haller stepped over to the table where there were several archival case boxes gathered he slowly pulled out a chair to sit down maggie bosch prompted why dont you sit down mcpherson finally broke from her stare and took the chair at the end of the table is this what i think it is she asked they all look like melissa landy well bosch said let me just go over it and youll draw your own conclusions bosch stayed on his feet he moved around the table to the whiteboard with his back to the board he started to tell the story okay i have a friend shes a former profiler ive never for whom haller asked the fbi but does it matter what im saying is that ive never known anybody who was better at it so shortly after i came into this i asked her informally to take a look at the case files and she did her conclusions were that back in eightysix this case was read all wrong and where the original investigators saw a crime of impulse and opportunity she saw something different to keep it short she saw indications that the person who killed melissa landy may have killed before here we go haller said look man i dont know why youre giving me the attitude bosch said you pulled me in as investigator on this thing and im investigating why dont you just let me tell you what i know then you can do with it whatever you want you think its legit then run with it you dont then shitcan it i will have done my job by bringing it to you im not giving you any attitude harry im just thinking out loud thinking about all the things that can complicate a trial complicate discovery you realize that everything you are telling us has to be turned over to royce now only if you intend to use it what i thought youd know the rules of discovery better than me i know the rules why did you bring us here for this dog and pony show if you dont think we should use it why dont you just let him tell the story mcpherson said and then maybe well understand then go ahead haller said anyway all i said was here we go which i think is a pretty common phrase indicating surprise and change of direction thats all continue harry please bosch glanced back at the board for a moment and then turned back to his audience of two and continued so my friend the profiler thinks jason jessup killed before he killed melissa landy and most likely was successful in hiding his involvement in these previous crimes so you went looking mcpherson said i did now remember our original investigator kloster was no slouch he went looking too only problem was he was using the wrong profile they had semen on the dress strangulation and a body dump in an accessible location that was the profile so that is what he went looking for and he found no similars or at least no cases that connected end of story end of search they believed jessup acted out this one time was exceedingly disorganized and sloppy and got caught harry turned and gestured to the row of photographs on the whiteboard behind him so i went a different way i went looking for girls who were reported missing and never showed up again girls reported as runaways as well as possible abductions jessup is from riverside county so i expanded the search to include riverside and la counties since jessup was twentyfour when he was arrested i went back to when he was eighteen putting the search limits from nineteen eighty to eightysix as far as victim profile i went caucasian aged twelve to eighteen why did you go as old as eighteen mcpherson asked our victim was twelve rachel saidi mean the profiler said that sometimes starting out these people pick from their own peer group they learn how to kill and then they start to define their targets according to their paraphilias a paraphilia is i know what it is mcpherson said you did all of this work yourself or did this rachel help you no she just worked up the profile i had some help from my partner pulling all of this together but it was tough because not all the records are complete especially on cases that never got above runaway status and a lot was cleared out most of the runaway files from back then are gone they didnt digitize mcpherson asked bosch shook his head not in la county they prioritized when they switched over to computerized records and went back and captured records for major crimes no runaway cases unless there was the possibility of abduction involved riverside county was different fewer cases out there so they archived everything digitally anyway for that time period in these two counties we came up with twentynine cases over the sixyear period were looking at again these were unresolved cases in each the girl disappeared and never came home we pulled what records we could find and most didnt fit because of witness statements or other issues but i couldnt rule out these eight bosch turned to the board and looked at the photos of eight smiling girls all of them long gone over time im not saying that jessup had anything to do with any of these girls dropping off the face of the earth but he could have as maggie already noticed they all have a resemblance to one another and to melissa landy and by the way the resemblance extends to body type as well theyre all within ten pounds and two inches of one another and our victim bosch turned back to his audience and saw mcpherson and haller transfixed by the photographs beneath each photo ive put the particulars he said physical descriptors date and location of disappearance the basic stuff did jessup know any of them haller asked is he connected in any way to any of them that was the bottom line bosch knew nothing really solidi mean not that ive found so far he said the best connection that we have is this girl he turned and pointed to the first photo on the left the first girl valerie schlicter she disappeared in nineteen eightyone from the same neighborhood in riverside that jessup grew up in he wouldve been nineteen and she was seventeen they both went to riverside high but because he dropped out early it doesnt look like they were there at the same time anyway she was counted as a runaway because there were problems in her home it was a singleparent home she lived with her mother and a brother and then one day about a month after graduating from high school she split the investigation never rose above a missing persons case largely because of her age she turned eighteen a month after she disappeared in fact i wouldnt even call it an investigation they more or less waited to see if shed come home she didnt nothing else bosch turned back and looked at haller so far thats it then discovery is not an issue theres nothing here theres no connection between jessup and any of these girls the closest one you have is this riverside girl and she was five years older than melissa landy this whole thing seems like a stretch bosch thought he detected a note of relief in hallers voice well he said theres still another part to all of this he stepped over to the case boxes at the end of the table and picked up a file he walked it down and put it in front of mcpherson as you know weve had jessup under surveillance since he was released mcpherson opened the file and saw the stack of surveillance shots of jessup with jessup theyve learned that there is no routine schedule so they stick with him twentyfourseven and what theyre documenting is that he has two remarkably different lives the public one which is carried in the media as his socalled journey to freedom everything from smiling for the cameras and eating hamburgers to surfing venice beach to the talkshow circuit yes were well aware haller said and most of it orchestrated by his attorney and then theres the private side bosch said the bar crawls the latenight cruising and the middleofthenight visits visits where mcpherson asked bosch went to his last visual aid a map of the santa monica mountains he unfolded it on the table in front of them nine different times since his release jessup has left the apartment where he stays in venice and in the middle of the night driven up to mulholland on top of the mountains from there he has visited one or two of the canyon parks up there per night franklin canyon is his favorite hes been there six times but he also has hit stone canyon runyon canyon and the overlook at fryman canyon a few times each whats he doing at these places mcpherson asked well first of all these are public parks that are closed at dusk bosch replied so hes sneaking in were talking two three oclock in the morning he goes in and he just sort of sits he communes he lit candles a couple times always the same spots in each of the parks usually on a trail or by a tree we dont have photos because its too dark and we cant risk getting in close ive gone out with the sis a couple times this week and watched it looks like he just sort of meditates bosch circled the four parks on the map each was off mulholland and close to the others have you talked to your profiler about all this haller asked yeah i did and she was thinking what i was thinking that hes visiting graves communing with the dead his victims oh man haller said yeah bosch said there was a long pause as haller and mcpherson considered the implications of boschs investigation harry has anybody done any digging in any of these spots mcpherson asked no not yet we didnt want to go too crazy with the shovels because he keeps coming back hed know something was up and we dont want that yet right what about cadaver dogs yeah we brought them out there undercover yesterday we how do you make a dog go undercover haller asked bosch started to laugh and it eased some of the tension in the room what i mean is there were two dogs and they werent brought out in official vehicles and handled by people in uniforms we tried to make it look like somebody walking their dog but even that was a problem because the park doesnt allow dogs on these trails anyway we did the best we could and got in and got out i checked with sis to make sure jessup wasnt anywhere near mulholland when we went in he was surfing and mcpherson asked impatiently these dogs are the type that just lie down on the ground when they pick up the scent of human decay supposedly they can pick it up through the ground after even a hundred years anyway at three of the four places jessups gone in these parks the dogs didnt react but at one spot one of the two dogs did bosch watched mcpherson swivel in her seat and look at haller he looked back at her and there was some sort of silent communication there it should also be noted that this particular dog has a history of being wrongthat is giving a false positiveabout a third of the time bosch said the other dog didnt react to the same spot great haller said so what does that tell us well thats why i invited you over bosch said weve reached the point where maybe we should start digging at least in that one spot but if we do we run the risk that jessup will find out and hell know weve been following him and if we dig and we find human remains do we have enough here to charge jessup mcpherson leaned forward while haller leaned back clearly deferring to his second chair well i see no legal embargo on digging she finally said its public property and there is nothing that would stop you legally no need for a search warrant but do you want to dig right now based on this one dog with what seems like a high falsepositive rate or do we wait until after the trial or maybe even during the trial haller said the second question is the more difficult mcpherson said for the sake of argument lets say there are remains buried in one or even all of those spots yes jessups activities seem to form an awareness of what is below the earth in the places he visits in the middle of the night but does that prove hes responsible hardly we could charge him yes but he could mount a number of defenses based on what we know right now you agree michael haller leaned forward and nodded suppose you dig and you find the remains of one of these girls even if you can confirm the idand thats going to be a big ifyou still dont have any evidence connecting her death to jessup all you have is his guilty knowledge of the burial spot that is very significant but is it enough to go into court with i dont know i think id rather be defense counsel than prosecutor on that one i think maggies right there are any number of defenses that he could employ to explain his knowledge of the burial sites he could invent a straw mansomebody else who did the killings and told him about them or forced him to take part in the burials jessups spent twentyfour years in prison how many other convicts has he been exposed to thousands tens of thousands how many of them were murderers he could lay this whole thing on one of them say that he heard in prison about these burial spots and he decided to come and pray for the souls of the victims he could make up anything he shook his head again the bottom line is there are a lot of ways to go with a defense like this without any sort of physical evidence connecting him or a witness i think you would have a problem maybe there is physical evidence in the graves that connects him bosch offered maybe but what if there isnt haller shot right back you never know you could also pull a confession out of jessup but i doubt that too mcpherson took it from there michael mentioned the big if the remains can they be ided will we be able to establish how long they were in the ground remember jessup has an ironclad alibi for the last twentyfour years if you pull up a set of bones and we cant say for sure that theyve been down there since at least eightysix then jessup would walk haller got up and went to the whiteboard grabbing a marker off the ledge in a clear spot he drew two circles side by side heres what weve got so far one is our case and one is this whole new thing youve come up with theyre separate we have the case with the trial about to go and then we have your new investigation when theyre separate like this were fine your investigation has no bearing on our trial so we can keep the two circles separate understand sure bosch said haller grabbed the eraser off the ledge and wiped the two circles off the board he then drew two new circles but this time they overlapped now if you go out there and start digging and you find bones this is what happens our two circles become connected and thats when your thing becomes our thing and we have to reveal this to the defense and the whole wide world mcpherson nodded in agreement so then what do we do bosch asked drop it no we dont drop it haller said we just be careful and we keep them separate you know what is universally held as the best trial strategy keep it simple stupid so lets not complicate things lets keep our circles separate and go to trial and get this guy for killing melissa landy and when were done that we go up to mulholland with shovels done with what when were done with that whatever professor boschs eyes moved from hallers connected circles on the board to the row of faces all his instincts told him that at least some of those girls did not get any older than they were in the photos they were in the ground and had been buried there by jason jessup he hated the idea of them spending another day in the dirt but knew that they would have to wait a little longer okay he said ill keep working it on the side for now but theres also one other thing from the profiler that you should know the other shoe drops mcpherson said what haller had returned to his seat bosch pulled out a chair and sat down himself she said a killer like jessup doesnt reform in prison the dark matter inside doesnt go away it stays it waits its like a cancer and it reacts to outside pressures hell kill again mcpherson said bosch slowly nodded he can visit the graves of his past victims for only so long before hell feel the need for fresh inspiration and if he feels under pressure the chances are good hell move in that direction even sooner then wed better be ready haller said im the guy who let him out if you have any doubts about him being covered then i want to hear them no doubts bosch said if jessup makes a move well be on him when are you planning on going out with the sis again mcpherson asked whenever i can but ive got my daughter so its whenever shes on a sleepover or i can get somebody to come in i want to go once why i want to see the real jessup not the one in the papers and on tv well what well there are no women on the team and theyre constantly moving with this guy there wont be any bathroom breaks they piss in bottles dont worry harry i think i can handle it then ill set it up friday march am i checked my watch when i heard maggie say hello to lorna in the reception room she entered the office and dropped her case on her desk it was one of those slim and stylish italian leather laptop totes that she never would have bought for herself too expensive and too red i wanted to know who gave it to her like i wanted to know a lot of things she would never tell me but the origin of her red briefcase was the least of my worries in thirteen days we would start picking jurors in the jessup case and clive royce had finally landed his best pretrial punch it was an inch thick and sat in front of me on my desk where have you been i said with a clear note of annoyance in my voice i called your cell and got no answer she came over to my desk dragging the extra chair with her more like where were you i glanced at my calendar blotter and saw nothing in the days square what are you talking about my phone was turned off because i was at hayleys honors assembly they dont like cell phones ringing when they are calling the kids up to get their pins ah shit she had told me and copied me on the email i printed it out and put it on the refrigerator but not on my desk blotter or into my phones calendar i blew it you shouldve been there haller you wouldve been proud i know i know i messed up its all right youll get other chances to mess up or stand up that hurt it wouldve been better if she had chewed my ass out like she used to but the passiveaggressive approach always got deeper under the skin and she probably knew that ill be at the next one i said thats a promise she didnt sarcastically say sure haller or ive heard that one before and somehow that made it worse instead she just got down to business what is that she nodded at the document in front of me this is clive royces last best stand its a motion to exclude the testimony of sarah ann gleason and of course he drops it off on a friday afternoon three weeks before trial more like seventeen days my mistake whats he say i turned the document around and slid it across the desk to her it was held together with a large black clip hes been working on this one since the start because he knows the case comes down to her shes our primary witness and without her none of the other evidence matters even the hair in the truck is circumstantial if he takes out sarah he takes out our case i get that but hows he trying to get rid of her she started flipping through the pages it was delivered at nine and is eightysix pages long so i havent had the time to completely digest it but its a twopronged effort hes attacking her original identification from when she was a kid says the setup was prejudicial and he that was already argued accepted by the trial court and it held up on appeal hes wasting the courts time hes got a new angle this time remember klosters got alzheimers and is no good as a witness he cant tell us about the investigation and he cant defend himself so this time out royce alleges that kloster told sarah which man to identify he pointed jessup out for her and what is his backup supposedly only sarah and kloster were in the room i dont know theres no backup but my guess is hes riffing on the radio call kloster made telling them to make jessup take off his hat it doesnt matter the lineup was put together to see if sarah could identify derek wilbern the other driver any argument that he then told her to put the finger on jessup is ridiculous that id came quite unexpectedly but naturally and convincingly this is nothing to get worked up about even without kloster well tear this one up i knew she was right but the first attack wasnt really what i was most worried about thats just his opening salvo i said thats nothing compared with part two he also seeks to exclude her entire testimony based on unreliable memory hes got her whole drug history laid out in the motion seemingly down to every chip of meth she ever smoked hes got arrest records jail records witnesses who detail her consumption of drugs multiplepartner sex and what they term her belief in outofbody experiencesi guess she forgot to mention that part up in port townsend and to top it all off hes got experts on memory loss and false memory creation as a byproduct of meth addiction so in all you know what hes got hes got us fucked coming and going maggie didnt respond as she was scanning the summary pages at the end of royces motion hes got investigators here and up in san francisco i added its thorough and exhaustive mags and you know what it doesnt even look like hes gone up to port townsend to interview her yet he says he doesnt have to because it doesnt matter what she says now it cant be relied upon hell have his experts and well have ours on rebuttal she said calmly we expected this part and ive already been lining ours up at worst we can turn this into a wash you know that the experts are only a small part of it well be fine she insisted and look at these witnesses her exhusbands and boyfriends i see royce conveniently didnt bother to include their own arrest records here theyre all tweakers themselves well make them look like pimps and pedophiles with grudges against her because she left them in the dust when she got straight she married the first one when she was eighteen and he was twentynine she told us id love to get him in the chair in front of the judge i really think you are overreacting to this haller we can argue this we can make him put some of these socalled witnesses in front of the judge and we can knock every one of them out of the box youre right about one thing though this is royces last best stand its just not going to be good enough i shook my head she was seeing only what was on paper and what could be blocked or parried with our own swords not what was not written look this is about sarah he knows the judge is not going to want to chop our main witness he knows well get by this but hes putting the judge on notice that this is what he is going to put sarah through if she takes the stand her whole life every sordid detail every pipe and dick she ever smoked shes going to have to sit up there and take it then hell trot out some phd wholl put pictures of a melted brain on the screen and say this is what meth does do we want that for her is she strong enough to take it maybe we have to go to royce offer a deal for time served and some kind of payout from the city something everybody can live with maggie flopped the motion onto the desk are you kidding me youre running scared because of this im not running scared im being realistic i didnt go up to washington i have no feel for this woman i dont know if she can stand up to this or not besides we can always take a second bite of the apple with those cases bosch has been working maggie leaned back in her chair theres no guarantee that anything will come out of those other cases we have to put everything we have into this one haller i could go back up there and hold sarahs hand a little bit tell her more about what to expect get her ready she already understood it wasnt going to be pretty to put it mildly i think shes strong enough i think in some weird way she might need it you know get it all out there expiate her sins its about redemption with her michael you know about that we held each others eyes for a long moment anyway i think shell be more than strong and the jury will see it she said shes a survivor and everybody likes a survivor i nodded you have a way of convincing people mags its a gift we both know you should be lead on this not me thank you for saying that all right go up there and get her prepped for this next week maybe by then we should have a witness schedule and you can tell her when well be bringing her down okay she said meantime hows your weekend looking we have to put together an answer to this i pointed at the defense motion on the desk well harry finally got me a ridealong with the sis tomorrow night hes going tooi think his daughter has a sleepover other than that im around why are you going to spend all that time watching jessup the police have that covered like i said before i want to see jessup out there when he doesnt think anyone is watching i would suggest that you come too but youve got hayley i wouldnt waste the time but when you see bosch can you give him a copy of this motion were going to need him to run down some of these witnesses and statements not all of them were in royces discovery package yeah he played it smart he keeps them off his witness list until they show up here if the judge shoots down the motion saying gleasons credibility is a jury question hell come back with an amended witness list saying okay i need to put these people in front of the jury in regard to credibility and shell allow it or shell be contradicting her own ruling clever clive he knows what hes doing anyway ill get a copy to harry but i think hes still chasing those old cases doesnt matter the trial is the priority we need complete backgrounds on these people you want to deal with him or do you want me to in our divvying up of pretrial duties i had given maggie the responsibility of prepping for defense witnesses all except jessup if he testified he was still mine ill talk to him she said she furrowed her brow it was a habit id seen before what nothing im just thinking about how to attack this i think we throw in a motion in limine seeking to limit royce on the impeachable stuff we argue that the events of her life in between are not relevant to credibility if her identification of jessup now matches her identification back then i shook my head i would argue that youre infringing on my clients sixth amendment right to crossexamine his accuser the judge might limit some of this stuff if its repetitive but dont count on her disallowing it she pursed her lips as she recognized that i was right its still worth a try i said everything is worth a try in fact i want to drown royce in paper lets hit him back with a phonebook to wade through she looked at me and smiled what i like it when you get all angry and righteous you havent seen anything yet she looked away before it went a step further where do you want to set up shop this weekend she asked remember you have hayley shes not going to like it if we work the entire weekend i had to think about that for a moment hayley loved museums to the point that i was tired of going to the same museums over and over she also loved movies i would need to check and see if a new movie was out bring her to my house in the morning and be prepared to work on our response we can maybe trade off ill take her to a movie or something in the afternoon and then you go on and do your thing with the sis well make it work okay thats a deal or or what you could bring her over tonight and we could have a little dinner celebrating our kid making second honors and we might even get a little work on this done and i stay over is that what you mean sure if you want you wish haller i do by the way it was first honors you better have it right when you see her tonight i smiled tonight you mean that i think so then dont worry ill have everything right saturday march pm because bosch had mentioned that a prosecutor wanted to join the sis surveillance lieutenant wright arranged his schedule to work saturday night and be the driver of the car the visitors were assigned to the pickup point was in venice at a public parking lot six blocks off the beach bosch met mcpherson there and then he put a radio call in to wright saying they were ready and waiting fifteen minutes later a white suv entered the lot and drove up to them bosch gave mcpherson the front seat and he climbed into the back he wasnt being chivalrous the long bench seat would allow him to stretch out during the long night of surveillance steve wright the lieutenant said offering mcpherson his hand maggie mcpherson thanks for letting me come along no sweat we always like it when the district attorneys office takes an interest lets hope tonight is worth your while wheres jessup now when i left he was at the brig on abbot kinney he likes crowded places which works in our favor i have a couple guys inside and a few more on the street were kind of used to his rhythm now he hits a place waits to be recognized and for people to start buying him drinks then he moves onquickly if he isnt recognized i guess im more interested in his latenight travels than his drinking habits its good that hes out drinking bosch said from the backseat theres a causal relationship the nights he takes in alcohol are usually the nights he goes up to mulholland wright nodded in agreement and headed the suv out of the lot he was a perfect surveillance man because he didnt look like a cop in his late fifties with glasses a thinning hairline and always two or three pens in his shirt pocket he looked more like an accountant but he had been with the sis for more than two decades and had been in on several of the squads kills every five years or so the times did a story on the sis usually analyzing its kill record in the last exposé bosch remembered reading the paper had labeled wright siss unlikely chief gunslinger while the reporters and editors behind the story probably viewed that as an editorial putdown wright wore it like a badge of honor he had the sobriquet printed below his name on his business card in quotes of course wright drove down abbot kinney boulevard and past the brig which was located in a twostory building on the east side of the street he went two blocks down and made a uturn he came back up the street and pulled to the curb in front of a fire hydrant a half block from the bar the lighted sign outside the brig depicted a boxer in a ring his red gloves up and ready it was an image that seemed at odds with the name of the bar but bosch knew the story behind it as a much younger man he had lived in the neighborhood he knew the sign with the boxer was put up by a former owner who had bought out the original owners the new man was a retired fighter and had decorated the interior with a boxing motif he also put the sign up out front there was still a mural on the side of the building that depicted the fighter and his wife but they were long gone now this is five wright said whats our status he was talking to the microphone clipped to the sun visor over his head bosch knew there was a foot button on the floor that engaged it the return speaker was under the dash the radio setup in the cars allowed the surveillance cops to keep their hands free while driving and more important helped them maintain their cover talking into a handheld rover was a dead giveaway the sis was too good for that three a voice said over the radio retro is still in the location along with one and two roger that wright said retro mcpherson said our name for him wright said our freqs are pretty far down the bandwidth and on the fcc registry theyre listed as dwp channels but you never know who might be listening we dont use the names of people or locations on the air got it it wasnt even nine yet bosch wasnt expecting jessup to leave anytime soon especially if people were buying him drinks as they settled in wright seemed to like mcpherson and liked informing her about procedures and the art of highlevel surveillance she might have been bored with it but she never let on see once we establish a subjects rhythms and routines we can react much better take this place for example the brig is one of three or four places retro hits sort of regularly weve assigned different guys to different bars so they can go in while hes in the location and be like regulars the two guys ive got right now in the brig are the same two guys that always go in there and two other guys would go into townhouse when hes there and two others have james beach it goes like that if retro notices them hell think its because hes seen them in there before and theyre regulars in the place now if he saw the same guy at two different places hed start getting suspicious i understand lieutenant sounds like the smart way to do it call me steve okay steve can your people inside communicate yes but theyre deaf deaf weve all got body mikes you know like the secret service but we dont put in the earpieces when were in play inside a place like a bar too obvious so they call in their positions when possible but they dont hear anything coming back unless they pull the receiver up from under their collar and put it in unfortunately its not like tv where they just put the bean in their ear and theres no wire i see and do your men actually drink while in a bar on a surveillance a guy in a place like that ordering a coke or a glass of water is going to stand out as suspicious so they order booze but then they nurse it luckily retro likes to go to crowded places makes it easier to maintain cover while the small talk continued in the front seat bosch pulled his phone and started what some would consider a conversation of small talk himself he texted his daughter though he knew there were several sets of eyes on the brig and even inside on jessup he looked up and checked the door of the bar every few seconds howzit going having fun madeline was staying overnight at her friend aurora smiths house it was only a few blocks from home but bosch would not be nearby if she needed him it was several minutes before she grudgingly answered the text but they had a deal she must answer his calls and texts or her freedomwhat she called her leashwould be shortened everythings fine you dont have to check on me yes i do im your father dont stay up too late k and that was it a childs shorthand in a shorthand relationship bosch knew he needed help there was so much he didnt know at times they seemed fine and everything appeared to be perfect other times he was sure she was going to sneak out the door and run away living with his daughter had resulted in his love for her growing more than he thought was possible thoughts of her safety as well as hopes for her happy future invaded his mind at all times his longing to make her life better and take her far past her own history had at times become a physical ache in his chest still he couldnt seem to reach across the aisle the plane was bouncing and he kept missing he put his phone away and checked the front of the brig again there was a crowd of smokers standing outside just then a voice and the sharp crack of billiard balls colliding in the background came over the radio speaker coming out retro is coming out this seems early wright said does he smoke mcpherson asked maybe hes just not that weve seen bosch kept his eyes on the door and soon it pushed open a man he recognized even from a distance as jessup stepped out and headed along the sidewalk abbot kinney slashed in a northwesterly direction across venice he was heading that way where did he park bosch asked he didnt wright said he only lives a few blocks from here he walked over they watched in silence after that jessup walked two blocks on abbot kinney passing a variety of restaurants coffee shops and galleries the sidewalk was busy almost every place was still open for saturdaynight business he stepped into a coffee shop called abbots habit wright got on the radio and assigned one of his men to enter it but before that could happen jessup stepped back out coffee in hand and proceeded on foot again wright started the suv and pulled into traffic going the opposite direction he made a uturn when he was two blocks further down and away from jessups view should he happen to turn around all the while he maintained constant radio contact with the other followers jessup had an invisible net around him even if he knew it was there he couldnt lose it hes heading home a radio voice reported might be an early night abbot kinney named for the man who built venice more than a century earlier became brooks avenue which then intersected with main street jessup crossed main and headed down one of the walk streets where automobiles could not travel wright was ready for this and directed two of the tail cars over to pacific avenue so they could pick him up when he came through wright pulled to a stop at brooks and main and waited for the report that jessup had passed through and was on pacific after two minutes he started to get anxious and went to the radio where is he people there was no response no one had jessup wright quickly sent somebody in two you go in use the twentythree got it mcpherson looked over the seatback at bosch and then at wright the twentythree we have a variety of tactics we use we dont describe them on the air he pointed through the windshield thats the twentythree bosch saw a man wearing a red windbreaker and carrying an insulated pizza bag cut across main and into the walk street named breeze avenue they waited and finally the radio burst to life im not seeing him i walked all the way through and hes not the transmission cut off wright said nothing they waited and then the same voice came back in a whisper i almost walked into him he came out between two houses he was pulling up his zipper okay did he make you wright asked thats a negative i asked for directions to breeze court and he said this was breeze avenue were cool he should be coming through now this is four we got him hes heading toward san juan the fourth car was one of the vehicles wright had put on pacific jessup was living in an apartment on san juan avenue between speedway and the beach bosch felt the momentary tension in his gut start to ease surveillance work was sometimes tough to take jessup had ducked between two houses to take a leak and it had caused a near panic wright redirected the teams to the area around san juan avenue between pacific and speedway jessup used a key to enter the secondfloor apartment where he was staying and the teams quickly moved into place it was time to wait again bosch knew from past surveillance gigs that the main attribute a good watcher needed was a comfort with silence some people are compelled to fill the void harry never was and he doubted anyone in the sis was he was curious to see how mcpherson would do now that the surveillance lesson from wright was over and there was nothing left but to wait and watch bosch pulled his phone to see if he had missed a text from his daughter but it was clear he decided not to pester her with another checkin and put the phone away the genius of his giving mcpherson the front seat now came into play he turned and put his legs up and across the seat stretching himself into a lounging position with his back against the door mcpherson glanced back and smiled in the darkness of the car i thought you were being a gentleman she said you just wanted to stretch out bosch smiled you got me everyone was silent after that bosch thought about what mcpherson had said while they had waited in the parking lot to be picked up by wright first she handed him a copy of the latest defense motion which he locked in the trunk of his car she told him he needed to start vetting the witnesses and their statements looking for ways to turn their threats to the case into advantages for the prosecution she said she and haller had worked all day crafting a response to the attempt to disqualify sarah ann gleason from testifying the judges ruling on the issue could decide the outcome of the trial it always bothered bosch when he saw justice and the law being manipulated by smart lawyers his part in the process was pure he started at a crime scene and followed the evidence to a killer there were rules along the way but at least the route was clear most of the time but once things moved into the courthouse they took on a different shape lawyers argued over interpretations and theories and procedures nothing seemed to move in a straight line justice became a labyrinth how could it be he wondered that an eyewitness to a horrible crime would not be allowed to testify in court against the accused he had been a cop more than thirtyfive years and he still could not explain how the system worked this is three retros on the move bosch was jarred out of his thoughts a few seconds went by and the next report came from another voice hes driving wright took over okay we get ready for an auto tail one get out to main and rose two go down to pacific and venice everybody else sit tight until we have his direction a few minutes later they had their answer north on main same as usual wright redirected his units and the carefully orchestrated mobile surveillance began moving with jessup as he took main street to pico and then made his way to the entrance of the freeway jessup headed east and then merged onto the northbound which was crowded with cars even at the late hour as expected he was heading toward the santa monica mountains the surveillance vehicles ranged from wrights suv to a black mercedes convertible to a volvo station wagon with two bikes on a rear rack to a pair of generic japanese sedans the only thing missing for a surveillance in the hollywood hills was a hybrid the teams employed a surveillance procedure called the floating box two outriders on either side of the target car another car up front and one behind all moving in a choreographed rotation wrights suv was the floater running backup behind the box the whole way jessup stayed at or below the speed limit as the freeway rose to the crest of the mountains bosch looked out his window and saw the getty museum rising in the mist at the top like a castle the sky black behind it anticipating that jessup was heading to his usual destinations on mulholland drive wright told two teams to break off from the box and move ahead he wanted them already up and on mulholland ahead of jessup he wanted a ground team with night vision goggles in franklin canyon park before jessup went in true to form jessup took the mulholland exit and was soon heading east on the winding twolane snake that runs the spine of the mountain chain wright explained that this was when the surveillance was most vulnerable to exposure you need a bee to properly do this up here but thats not in the budget he said a bee mcpherson asked part of our code means helicopter we could sure use one the first surprise of the night came five minutes later when jessup drove by franklin canyon park without stopping wright quickly recalled his ground team from the park as jessup continued east jessup passed coldwater canyon boulevard without slowing and next drove by the overlook above fryman canyon when he passed through the intersection of mulholland and laurel canyon boulevard he was taking the surveillance team into new territory what are the chances hes made us bosch asked none wright said were too good hes got something new on his mind for the next ten minutes the follow continued east toward the cahuenga pass the command car was well behind the surveillance and wright and his two passengers had to rely on radio reports to know what was happening one car was moving in front of jessup while all the rest were behind the rear cars followed a continual rotation of turning off and moving up so the headlight configurations would keep changing in jessups rearview finally a radio report came in that made bosch move forward in his seat as if closer proximity to the source of the information would make things clearer theres a stop sign up here and retro turned north its too dark to see the street sign but i had to stay on mulholland too risky next up turn left at the stop roger that we got the left wait bosch said urgently tell him to wait wright checked him in the mirror what do you have in mind he asked theres only one stop on mulholland woodrow wilson drive i know it it winds down and reconnects with mulholland at the light down at highland the lead car can pick him up there but woodrow wilson is too tight if you send a car down there he may know hes being followed you sure im sure i live on woodrow wilson wright thought for a moment and then went on the radio cancel that left wheres the volvo were holding up until further command okay go on up and make the left on the two wheelers watch for oncoming and watch for our guy roger that soon wrights suv got to the intersection bosch saw the volvo pulled off to the side the bike rack was empty wright pulled over to wait checking the teams on the radio one are you in position thats a roger were at the light at the bottom no sign of retro yet three you up there was no response okay everybody hold till we hear what do you mean bosch asked what about the bikes they mustve gone down deaf well hear when they this is three a voice said in a whisper we came up on him hed closed his eyes and went to sleep wright translated for his passengers he killed his lights and stopped moving bosch felt his chest start to tighten are they sure hes in the car wright communicated the question over the radio yeah we can see him hes got a candle burning on the dashboard where exactly are you three about halfway down we can hear the freeway bosch leaned all the way forward between the two front seats ask him if he can pick a number off the curb he said get me an address wright relayed the request and almost a minute went by before the whisper came back its too dark to see the curbs here without using a flash but we got a light next to the door of the house hes parked in front of its one of those cantilever jobs hanging its ass out over the pass from here it looks like seventytwoohthree bosch slid back and leaned heavily against the seat mcpherson turned to look at him wright used the mirror to look back you know that address wright asked bosch nodded in the darkness yeah he said its my house sunday march am my daughter liked to sleep in on sundays normally i hated losing the time with her i only had her every other weekend and wednesdays but this sunday was different i was happy to let her sleep while i got up early to go back to work on the motion to save my chief witnesss testimony i was in the kitchen pouring the first cup of coffee of the day when i heard knocking on my front door it was still dark out i checked the peep before opening it and was relieved to see it was my exwife with harry bosch standing right behind her but that relief was shortlived the moment i turned the knob they pushed in and i could immediately feel a bad energy enter with them weve got a problem maggie said whats wrong i asked whats wrong is that jessup camped outside my house this morning bosch said and i want to know how he found it and what the hell hes doing he came up too close to me when he said it i didnt know which was worse his breath or the accusatory tone of his words i wasnt sure what he was thinking but i realized all the bad energy was coming from him i stepped back from him hayleys still asleep let me just go close her bedroom door theres fresh decaf in the kitchen and i can brew some fully leaded if you need it i went down the hall and checked on my daughter she was still down i closed the door and hoped the voices that were bound to get loud would not wake her my two visitors were still standing when i got back to the living room neither had gone for coffee bosch was silhouetted by the big picture window that looked out upon the citythe view that made me buy the house i could see streaks of light entering the sky behind his shoulders no coffee they just stared at me okay lets sit down and talk about this i gestured toward the couch and chairs but bosch seemed frozen in his stance come on lets figure it out i walked past them and sat down in the chair by the window finally bosch started to move he sat down on the couch next to hayleys school backpack maggie took the other chair she spoke first ive been trying to convince harry that we didnt put his home address on the witness list absolutely not we gave no personal addresses in discovery for you i listed two addresses your office and mine i even gave the general number for the pab didnt even give a direct line then how did he find my house bosch asked the accusatory tone still in his voice look harry youre blaming me for something i had nothing to do with i dont know how he found your house but it couldnt have been that hard i mean come on anybody can find anybody on the internet you own your house right you pay property taxes have utility accounts and i bet youre even registered to voterepublican im sure independent fine the point is people can find you if they want added to that you have a singular name all anybody would have to do is punch in you gave them my full name i had to its whats required and whats been given in discovery for every trial youve ever testified in it doesnt matter all jessup needed was access to the internet and he couldve jessups been in prison for twentyfour years he knows less about the internet than i do he had to have help and im betting it came from royce look we dont know that bosch looked pointedly at me a darkness crossing his eyes youre defending him now no im not defending anybody im just saying we shouldnt rush to any conclusions here jessups got a roommate and is a minor celebrity celebrities get people to do things for them okay so why dont you calm down and lets back up a little bit tell me what happened at your house bosch seemed to take it down a notch but he was still anything but calm i half expected him to get up and take a swing at a lamp or punch a hole in a wall thankfully maggie was the one who told the story we were with the sis watching him we thought he was going to go up to one of the parks hes been visiting instead he drove right by them all and kept going on mulholland when we got to harrys street we had to hang back so he wouldnt see us the sis has a bike car two of them saddled up and rode down they found jessup sitting in his car in front of harrys house goddamn it bosch said i have my daughter living with me if this prick is harry not so loud and watch what you say i said my daughters on the other side of that wall now please go back to the story what did jessup do bosch hesitated maggie didnt he just sat there maggie said for about a half hour and he lit a candle a candle in the car yeah on the dashboard what the hell does that mean who knows bosch couldnt remain sitting he jumped up from the couch and started pacing and after a half hour he drove off and went home maggie said that was it we just came from venice now i stood up and started to pace but in a pattern clear of boschs orbit okay lets think about this lets think about what he was doing no shit sherlock bosch said thats the question i nodded i had that coming is there any reason to think that he knows or suspects hes being followed i asked no no way bosch said immediately wait a minute not so fast on that maggie said ive been thinking about it there was a nearmiss earlier in the night you remember harry on breeze avenue bosch nodded maggie explained it to me they thought they lost him on a walk street in venice the lieutenant sent a guy in with a pizza box jessup came out from between two houses after taking a leak it was a close call i spread my hands well maybe that was it maybe that planted suspicion and he decided to see if he was being followed you show up outside the lead investigators house and its a good way to draw out the flies if youve got them on you you mean like a test bosch asked exactly nobody approached him out there right no we left him alone maggie said if he had gotten out of his car i think it wouldve been a different story i nodded okay so it was either a test or hes got something planned in that case it wouldve been a reconnaissance mission he wanted to see where you live bosch stopped and stared out the window the sky was fully lit now but one thing you have to keep in mind is that what he did was not illegal i said its a public street and the or put no restrictions on travel within los angeles county so no matter what he was up to its a good thing you didnt stop him and reveal yourself bosch stayed at the window his back to us i didnt know what he was thinking harry i said i know your concerns and i agree with them but we cant let this be a distraction the trial is coming up quick and we have work to do if we convict this guy he goes away forever and it wont matter if he knows where you live so what do i do till then sit on my front porch every night with a shotgun the sis is on him twentyfourseven right maggie said do you trust them bosch didnt answer for a long moment they wont lose him he finally said maggie looked at me and i could see the concern in her eyes each of us had a daughter it would be hard to put your trust in anybody else even an elite surveillance squad i thought for a moment about something i had been considering since the conversation began what about you moving in here with your daughter she can use hayleys room because hayleys going back to her mothers today and you can use the office its got a sleeper sofa that ive spent more than a few nights on its actually comfortable bosch turned from the window and looked at me what stay here through the whole trial why not our daughters will finally get a chance to meet when hayley comes over its a good idea maggie said i didnt know if she was referring to the daughters meeting or the idea of bosch and child staying with me and look im here every night i said if you have to go out with the sis i got you covered with your daughter especially when hayleys here bosch thought about it for a few moments but then shook his head i cant do that he said why not i asked because its my house my home im not going to run from this guy hes going to run from me what about your daughter maggie asked ill take care of my daughter harry think about it she said think about your daughter you dont want her in harms way look if jessup has my address then he probably has this address too moving in here isnt the answer its just just running from him maybe thats his testto see what i do so im not doing anything im not moving ive got the sis and if he comes back and so much as crosses the curb out front ill be waiting for him i dont like this maggie said i thought about what bosch had said about jessup having my address neither do i i said wednesday march am bosch didnt need to be in court in fact he wouldnt be needed until after jury selection and the actual trial began but he wanted to get a close look at the man he had been shadowing from a distance with the sis he wanted to see if jessup would show any reaction to seeing him in return it had been a month and a half since they had spent the long day in the car driving down from san quentin bosch felt the need to get closer than the surveillance allowed him to it would help him keep the fire burning it was billed as a status conference the judge wanted to deal with all final motions and issues before beginning jury selection the next day and then moving seamlessly into the trial there were scheduling and jury issues to discuss and each sides list of exhibits were to be handed in as well the prosecution team was locked and loaded in the last two weeks haller and mcpherson had sharpened and streamlined the case run through mock witness examinations and reconsidered every piece of evidence they had carefully choreographed the ways in which they would bring the twentyfouryearold evidence forward they were ready the bow had been pulled taut and the arrow was ready to fly even the decision on the death penalty had been madeor rather announced haller had officially withdrawn it even though bosch assumed all along that his use of it to threaten jessup had merely been a pose he was a defense attorney by nature and there was no getting him across that line a conviction on the charges would bring jessup a sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole and that would have to be enough justice for melissa landy bosch was ready as well he had diligently reinvestigated the case and located the witnesses who would be called to testify all the while he was still out riding with the sis as often as possiblenights that his daughter stayed at the homes of friends or with sue bambrough the assistant principal he was prepared for his part and had helped haller and mcpherson get ready for theirs confidence was high and that was another reason for bosch to be in the courtroom he wanted to see this thing get started judge breitman entered and the courtroom was brought to order at a few minutes after nine bosch was in a chair against the railing directly behind the prosecution table where haller and mcpherson sat side by side they had told him to pull the chair up to the table but harry wanted to hang back he wanted to be able to watch jessup from behind and besides there was too much anxiety coming from the two prosecutors the judge was going to make a ruling on whether sarah ann gleason would be allowed to testify against jessup as haller had said the night before nothing else mattered if they lost sarah as a witness they would surely lose the case on the record with california versus jessup again the judge said upon taking the bench good morning to all after a chorus of good mornings fired back to her the judge got right down to business tomorrow we begin jury selection in this case and then we proceed to trial therefore today is the day that were going to clean out the garage so to speak so that we can finally bring the car in any last motions any pending motions anything anybody wants to talk about in regard to exhibits or evidence or anything else now is the time we have a number of motions pending and i will get to them first the prosecutions request to redress the issue of the defendants use of makeup to cover certain body tattoos is dismissed we argued that at length already and i do not see the need to go at it further bosch checked jessup he was at a sharp angle to him so he could not see the defendants face but he did see jessup nod his head in approval of the judges first ruling of the day breitman then went through a housekeeping list of minor motions from both sides she seemed to want to accommodate all so neither side emerged as a clear favorite bosch saw that mcpherson was meticulously keeping notes on each decision on a yellow legal pad it was all part of the buildup to the ruling of the day since sarah was to be mcphersons witness to question during trial she had handled the oral arguments on the defense motion two days earlier though bosch had not attended that hearing haller had told him that maggie had held forth for nearly an hour in a wellprepared response to the motion to disqualify she had then backed it with an eighteenpage written response the prosecution team was confident in the argument but neither member of the team knew breitman well enough to be confident in how she would rule now the judge said we come to the defense motion to disqualify sarah ann gleason as a witness for the prosecution the question has been argued and submitted by both sides and the court is ready to make a ruling your honor could i be heard royce said standing up at the defense table mr royce the judge said i dont see the need for further argument you made the motion and i allowed you to respond to the prosecutions submission what more needs to be said yes your honor royce sat back down leaving whatever he was going to add to his attack on sarah gleason a secret the defenses motion is dismissed the judge said immediately i will be allowing the defense wide latitude in its examination of the prosecutions witness as well as in the production of its own witnesses to address ms gleasons credibility before the jury but i believe that this witnesss credibility and reliability is indeed something that jurors will need to decide a momentary silence enveloped the courtroom as if everyone collectively had drawn in a breath no response followed from either the prosecution or defense table it was another downthemiddle ruling bosch knew and both sides were probably pleased to have gotten something gleason would be allowed to testify so the prosecutions case was secured but the judge was going to let royce go after her with all he had it would come down to whether sarah was strong enough to take it now i would like to move on the judge said lets talk about jury selection and scheduling first and then well get to the exhibits the judge proceeded to outline how she wanted voir dire to proceed though each side would be allowed to question prospective jurors she said she would strictly limit the time for each side she wanted to start a momentum that would carry into the trial she also limited each side to only twelve peremptory challengesjuror rejections without causeand said she wanted to pick six alternates because it was her practice to be quick with the hook on jurors who misbehaved were chronically late or had the audacity to fall asleep during testimony i like a good supply of alternates because we usually need them she said the low number of peremptory challenges and the high number of alternates brought objections from both the prosecution and the defense the judge grudgingly gave each side two more challenges but warned that she would not allow voir dire to get bogged down i want jury selection completed by the end of the day friday if you slow me down then i will slow you down i will hold the panel and every lawyer in here until friday night if i have to i want opening statements first thing monday any objection to that both sides seemed properly cowed by the judge she was clearly exerting command of her own courtroom she next outlined the trial schedule stating that testimony would begin each morning at nine sharp and continue until five with a ninetyminute lunch and morning and afternoon breaks of fifteen minutes each that leaves a solid six hours a day of testimony she said any more and i find the jurors start losing interest so i keep it to six a day it will be up to you to be in here and ready to go each morning when i step through the door at nine any questions there were none breitman then asked each side for estimates on how long their case would take to present haller said he would need no more than four days depending on the length of the crossexaminations of his witnesses this was already a shot directed at royce and his plans to attack sarah ann gleason for his part royce said he needed only two days the judge then did her own math adding four and two and coming up with five well im thinking an hour each for opening statements on monday morning i think that means well finish friday afternoon and go right to closing arguments the following monday neither side objected to her math the point was clear keep it moving find ways to cut time of course a trial was a fluid thing and there were many unknowns neither side would be held to what was said at this hearing but each lawyer knew that there might be consequences from the judge if they didnt keep a continuous velocity to their presentations finally we come to exhibits and electronics breitman said i trust that everyone has looked over each others lists any objections to these both haller and royce stood up the judge nodded at royce you first mr royce yes judge the defense has an objection to the prosecutions plans to project numerous images of melissa landys body on the courtrooms overhead screens this practice is not only barbaric but exploitative and prejudicial the judge swiveled in her seat and looked at haller who was still standing your honor it is the prosecutions duty to produce the body to show the crime that brings us here the last thing we want to do is be exploitative or prejudicial i will grant mr royce that it is a fine line but we do not plan to step across it royce came back with one more shot this case is twentyfour years old in nineteen eightysix there were no overhead screens none of this hollywood stuff i think it infringes on my clients right to a fair trial haller was ready with his own comeback the age of the case has nothing to do with this issue but the defense is perfectly willing to present these exhibits the way they wouldve mcpherson had grabbed his sleeve to interrupt him he bent down and she whispered in his ear he then quickly straightened up excuse me your honor i misspoke the prosecution is more than willing to present these exhibits in the manner they would have been presented to the jury in nineteen eightysix we would be happy to hand out color photographs to the jurors but in earlier conversation the court indicated that she did not like this practice yes i find that handing these sorts of photos directly to the jurors to be possibly more exploitative and prejudicial breitman said is that what you wish mr royce royce had walked himself into a jam no judge i would agree with the court on this point the defense was simply trying to limit the scope and use of these photographs mr haller lists more than thirty photographs that he wants to put on the big screen it seems overthetop that is all judge breitman these are photographs of the body in the place it was found as well as during autopsy each one is mr haller the judge intoned let me just stop you right there crime scene photographs are acceptable as long as they come with appropriate foundation and testimony but i see no need to show our jurors this poor girls autopsy shots were not going to do that yes your honor haller said he remained standing while royce sat down with his partial victory breitman spoke while writing something and you have an objection to mr royces exhibit list mr haller yes your honor the defense has a variety of drug paraphernalia alleged to have once been owned by ms gleason on its exhibit list it also lists photos and videos of ms gleason the prosecution has not been given the opportunity to examine these materials but we believe they only go to the point that we will be conceding at trial and eliciting in direct examination of this witness that is that at one time in her life she used drugs on a regular basis we do not see the need to show photos of her using drugs or the pipes through which she ingested drugs its inflammatory and prejudicial it is not needed based on the concessions of the prosecution royce stood back up and was ready to go the judge gave him the floor judge these exhibits are vitally important to the defense case the prosecution of mr jessup hinges on the testimony of a longtime drug addict who cannot be relied upon to remember the truth let alone tell it these exhibits will help the jury understand the depth and breadth of this witnesss use of illegal substances over a lengthy period of time royce was finished but the judge was silent as she studied the defense exhibit list all right she finally said putting the document aside you both make cogent arguments so what we are going to do is take these exhibits one at a time when the defense would like to proffer an exhibit we will discuss it first out of earshot of the jury ill make a decision then the lawyers sat down bosch almost shook his head but didnt want to draw the judges attention still it burned him that she had not slapped the defense down on this one twentyfour years after seeing her little sister abducted from the front yard sarah ann gleason was willing to testify about the awful nightmarish moment that had changed her life forever and for her sacrifice and efforts the judge was actually going to entertain the defenses request to attack her with the glass pipes and accoutrements she had once used to escape what she had been through it didnt seem fair to bosch it didnt seem like anything that approached justice the hearing ended soon after that and all parties packed their briefcases and moved through the doors of the courtroom en masse bosch hung back and then insinuated himself into the group right behind jessup he said nothing but jessup soon enough felt the presence behind him and turned around he smirked when he saw it was bosch well detective bosch are you following me should i be oh you never know hows your investigation going youll find out soon enough yes i cant dont talk to him it was royce he had turned and noticed and dont you talk to him he added pointing a finger at bosch if you continue to harass him ill complain to the judge bosch held his hands out in a notouching gesture were cool counselor just making small talk there is no such thing when it comes to the police he reached out and put his hand on jessups shoulder and shepherded him away from bosch in the hallway outside they moved directly to the waiting huddle of reporters and cameras bosch moved past but looked back in time to see jessups face change his eyes went from the steely glare of a predator to the wounded look of a victim the reporters quickly gathered around him monday april am i watched the jury file in and take their assigned seats in the box i watched them closely keying on their eyes mostly checking for how they looked at the defendant you can learn a lot from that a furtive glance or a strong judgmental stare jury selection had gone as scheduled we went through the first panel of ninety prospective jurors in a day but had sat only eleven after most were eliminated because of their media knowledge of the case the second panel was just as difficult to choose from and it wasnt until friday evening at fiveforty that we had our final eighteen i had my jury chart in front of me and my eyes were jumping between the faces in the box and the names on my postits trying to memorize who was who i already had a good handle on most of them but i wanted the names to become second nature to me i wanted to be able to look at them and address them as if they were friends and neighbors the judge was on the bench and ready to go at nine sharp she first asked the attorneys if there was any new or unfinished business to address upon learning there was not she called in the jurors okay we are all here she said i want to thank all of the jurors and other parties for being on time we begin the trial with opening statements from the attorneys these are not to be construed as evidence but merely the judge stopped her eyes fixed on the back row of the jury box a woman had timidly raised her hand the judge stared for a long moment and then checked her own seating chart before responding ms tucci do you have a question i checked my chart number ten carla tucci she was one of the jurors i had not yet committed to memory a mousy brunette from east hollywood she was thirtytwo years old unmarried and she worked as a receptionist at a medical clinic according to my colorcoded chart i had her down as a juror who could be swayed by stronger personalities on the panel this was not a bad thing it just depended on whether those personalities were for a guilty verdict or not i think i saw something i wasnt supposed to see she said in a frightened voice judge breitman hung her head for a moment and i knew why she couldnt get the wheels out of the mud we were ready to go and now the trial would be delayed before opening statements were even in the record okay lets try to take care of this quickly i want the jury to stay in place everyone else stay in place and ms tucci and the attorneys and i will go quickly back to chambers to find out what this is about as we got up i checked my jury chart there were six alternates i had three of them pegged as proprosecution two in the middle and one siding with the defense if tucci was ejected for whatever misconduct she was about to reveal her replacement would be chosen randomly from the alternates this meant that i had a betterthaneven chance of seeing her replaced with a juror who was partial to the prosecution and only a one in six chance of getting a juror who was prodefense as i followed the entourage into chambers i decided that i liked my chances and i would do what i could to have tucci ejected from the panel in chambers the judge didnt even go behind her desk perhaps hoping this was only going to be a minor question and delay we stood in a group in the middle of her office all except the court reporter who sat on the edge of a side chair so she could type okay on the record the judge said ms tucci please tell us what you saw and what is bothering you the juror looked down at the ground and held her hands in front of her i was riding on the metro this morning and the man sitting across from me was reading the newspaper he was holding it up and i saw the front page i didnt mean to look but i saw a photo of the man on trial and i saw the headline the judge nodded you are talking about jason jessup correct yes what newspaper i think it was the times what did the headline say ms tucci new trial old evidence for jessup i hadnt seen the actual la times that morning but had read the story online citing an unnamed source close to the prosecution the story said the case against jason jessup was expected to be comprised entirely of evidence from the first trial and leaning heavily on the identification provided by the victims sister kate salters had the byline on it did you read the story ms tucci breitman asked no judge i just saw it for a second and when i saw his picture i looked away you told us not to read anything about the case it just kind of popped up in front of me the judge nodded thoughtfully okay ms tucci can you step back into the hallway for a moment the juror stepped out and the judge closed the door the headline tells the story doesnt it she said she looked at royce and then me seeing if either of us was going to make a motion or a suggestion royce said nothing my guess was that he had juror number ten pegged the same way that i did but he might not have considered the leanings of the six alternates i think the damage is done here judge i said she knows there was a previous trial anybody with any basic knowledge of the court system knows they dont retry you if you get a notguilty so shell know jessup went down on a guilty before as much as that prejudices things in the prosecutions favor i think to be fair she has to go breitman nodded mr royce i would agree with mr hallers assessment of the prejudice not his socalled desire to be fair he simply wants her off the jury and one of those churchgoing alternates on it i smiled and shook my head i wont dignify that with a response you dont want to kick her off thats fine with me but its not counsels choice the judge said she opened the door and invited the juror back in ms tucci thank you for your honesty you can go back to the jury room and gather your things you are dismissed and can report back to the juror assembly room to check with them tucci hesitated does that mean yes unfortunately you are dismissed that headline gives you knowledge of the case you should not have for you to know that mr jessup was previously tried for these crimes is prejudicial therefore i cannot keep you on the jury you may go now im sorry judge yes so am i tucci left the chambers with her shoulders slumped and with the hesitant walk of someone who has been accused of a crime after the door closed the judge looked at us if nothing else this will send the right message to the rest of the jury were now down to five alternates and we havent even started but we now clearly see how the media can impact our trial i have not read this story but i will and if i see anyone in this room quoted in it i am going to be very disappointed there are usually consequences for those who disappoint me judge royce said i read the story this morning and no one here is quoted by name but it does attribute information to a source close to the prosecution i was planning to bring this to your attention i shook my head and thats the oldest defense trick in the book cut a deal with a reporter to hide behind the story a source close to the prosecution hes sitting four feet across the aisle from me that was probably close enough for the reporter your honor royce blurted i had nothing to were holding up the trial breitman said cutting him off lets get back to court we trudged back as we went back into the courtroom i scanned the gallery and saw salters the reporter in the second row i quickly looked away hoping my brief eye contact had not revealed anything i had been her source my goal was to manipulate the storythe scene setter as the reporter had called itinto being something that gave the defense false confidence i hadnt intended it as a means of changing the makeup of the jury back on the bench the judge wrote something on a pad and then turned and addressed the jury once again warning the panelists about reading the newspaper or watching television news programs she then turned to her clerk audrey the candy bowl please the clerk then took the bowl of individually wrapped sourballs off the counter in front of her desk dumped the candy into a drawer and took the bowl to the judge the judge tore a page from her notebook tore it again into six pieces and wrote on each piece i have written the numbers one through six on pieces of paper and i will now randomly select an alternate to take juror number tens seat on the panel she folded the pieces of paper and dropped them into the bowl she then swirled the bowl in her hand and raised it over her head with her other hand she withdrew one piece of paper unfolded it and read it out loud alternate number six breitman said would you please move with any belongings you might have to seat number ten in the jury box thank you i could do nothing but sit and watch the new juror number ten was a thirtysixyearold film and television extra named philip kirns being an extra probably meant that he was an actor who had not yet been successful he took jobs as a background extra to make ends meet that meant that every day he went to work and stood around and watched those who had made it this put him on the bitter side of the gulf between the haves and havenots and this would make him partial to the defensethe underdog facing off against the man i had him down as a red juror and now i was stuck with him maggie whispered into my ear at the prosecution table as we watched kirns take his new seat i hope you didnt have anything to do with that story haller because i think we just lost a vote i raised my hands in a not me gesture but it didnt look like she was buying it the judge turned her chair fully toward the jury finally i believe we are ready to start she said we begin with the opening statements from the attorneys these statements are not to be taken as evidence these statements are merely an opportunity for the prosecution and defense to tell the jury what they expect the evidence will show it is an outline of what you can expect to see and hear during the trial and it is incumbent upon counsel to then present evidence and testimony that you will later weigh during deliberations we start with the prosecution statement mr haller i stood up and went to the lectern that was positioned between the prosecution table and the jury box i took no legal pad cards or anything else with me i believed that it was important first to sell myself to the jury then my case to do that i could not look away from them i needed to be direct open and honest the whole time besides my statement was going to be brief and to the point i didnt need notes i started by introducing myself and then maggie i next pointed to harry bosch who was seated against the rail behind the prosecution table and introduced him as the case investigator then i got down to business we are here today about one thing to speak for someone who can no longer speak for herself twelveyearold melissa landy was abducted from her front yard in nineteen eightysix her body was found just a few hours later discarded in a dumpster like a bag of trash she had been strangled the man accused of this horrible crime sits there at the defense table i pointed the finger of accusation at jessup just as i had seen prosecutor after prosecutor point it at my clients over the years it felt falsely righteous of me to point a finger at anyone even a murderer but that didnt stop me not only did i point at jessup but i pointed again and again as i summarized the case telling the jury of the witnesses i would call and what they would say and show i moved along quickly making sure to mention the eyewitness who identified melissas abductor and the finding of the victims hair in jessups tow truck i then brought it around to a big finish jason jessup took the life of melissa landy i said he grabbed her in the front yard and took her away from her family and this world forever he put his hand around this beautiful little girls throat and choked the life out of her he robbed her of her past and of her future he robbed her of everything and the state will prove this to you beyond a reasonable doubt i nodded once to underline the promise and then returned to my seat the judge had told us the day before to be brief in our openers but even she seemed surprised by my brevity it took her a moment to realize i was finished she then told royce he was up as i expected he would royce deferred to the second half meaning he reserved his opening statement until the start of the defenses case that put the judges focus back on me very well then mr haller call your first witness i went back to the lectern this time carrying notes and printouts i had spent most of the previous week before jury selection preparing the questions i would ask my witnesses as a defense attorney i am used to crossexamining the states witnesses and picking at the testimony brought forward by the prosecutor its a task quite different from direct examination and building the foundation for the introduction of evidence and exhibits i fully acknowledge that it is easier to knock something down than to build it in the first place but in this case i would be the builder and i came prepared the people call william johnson i turned to the back of the courtroom as i had gone to the lectern bosch had left the courtroom to retrieve johnson from a witness waiting room he now returned with the man in tow johnson was small and thin with a dark mahogany complexion he was fiftynine but his pure white hair made him look older bosch walked him through the gate and then pointed him in the direction of the witness stand he was quickly sworn in by the court clerk i had to admit to myself that i was nervous i felt what maggie had tried to describe to me on more than one occasion when we were married she always called it the burden of proof not the legal burden but the psychic burden of knowing that you stood as representative of all the people i had always dismissed her explanations as selfserving the prosecutor was always the overdog the man there was no burden in that at least nothing compared to the burden of the defense attorney who stands all alone and holds someones freedom in his hands i never understood what she was trying to tell me until now now i got it i felt it i was about to question my first witness in front of the jury and i was as nervous as i had been at my first trial out of law school good morning mr johnson i said how are you sir i am good yes thats good can you tell me sir what you do for a living yes sir i am head of operations for the el rey theatre on wilshire boulevard head of operations what does that mean i make sure everything works right and runsfrom the stage lights to the toilets its all part of my job mind you i have electricians work on the lights and plumbers work on the toilets his answer was greeted with polite smiles and modest laughter he spoke with a slight caribbean accent but his words were clear and understandable how long have you worked at the el rey mr johnson for going on thirtysix years now i started in nineteen seventyfour wow thats an achievement congratulations have you been head of operations for all that time no i worked my way up i started as a janitor i would like to draw your attention back to nineteen eightysix you were working there then correct yes sir i was a janitor back then okay and do you remember the date of february sixteenth of that year in particular yes i do it was a sunday yes i remember can you tell the court why that was the day i found the body of a little girl in the trash bin out back of the el rey that was a terrible day i checked the jury all eyes were on my witness so far so good i can imagine that being a terrible day mr johnson now can you tell us what it was that brought you to discover the body of the little girl we were working on a project in the theater we were putting new drywall into the ladies room on account of a leak so i took a wheelbarrow full of the stuff we had demoedthe old wall and some rotting wood and suchand wheeled it out to put in the dumpster i opened the top and there this poor little girl was she was on top of the debris already in the trash bin thats right was she covered at all with any trash or debris no sir not at all as if whoever threw her in there had been in a hurry and didnt have time to cover objection royce had jumped to his feet i knew he would object but i had almost gotten the whole sentenceand its suggestionto the jury mr haller is leading the witness and asking for conclusions for which he would have no expertise royce said i withdrew the question before the judge could sustain the objection there was no sense in having the judge side with the defense in front of the jury mr johnson was that the first trip you had made to the trash bin that day no sir i had been out there two times before before the trip during which you found the body when had you last been to the trash bin about ninety minutes before did you see a body on top of the trash in the bin that time no there was no body there so it had to have been placed in that bin in the ninety minutes prior to you finding it correct yes thats right okay mr johnson if i could draw your attention to the screen the courtroom was equipped with two large flatscreen monitors mounted high on the wall opposite the jury box one screen was slightly angled toward the gallery to allow courtroom observers to see the digital presentations as well maggie controlled what appeared on the screens through a powerpoint program on her laptop computer she had constructed the presentation over the last two weeks and weekends as we choreographed the prosecutions case all of the old photos from the case files had been scanned and loaded into the program she now put up the trials first photo exhibit a shot of the trash bin melissa landys body had been found in does that look like the trash bin in which you found the little girls body mr johnson thats it what makes you so sure sir the addressfiftyfive fifteenspraypainted on the side like that i did that thats the address and i can tell thats the back of the el rey ive worked there a long time okay and is this what you saw when you raised the top and looked inside maggie moved to the next photo the courtroom was already quiet but it seemed to me that it grew absolutely silent when the photo of melissa landys body in the trash bin went up on the screens under the existing rules of evidence as carved by a recent ruling by the ninth district i had to find ways of bringing old evidence and exhibits to the present jury i could not rely on investigative records i had to find people who were bridges to the past and johnson was the first bridge johnson didnt answer my question at first he just stared like everyone else in the courtroom then unexpectedly a tear rolled down his dark cheek it was perfect if i had been at the defense table i would have viewed it with cynicism but i knew johnsons response was heartfelt and it was why i had made him my first witness thats her he finally said thats what i saw i nodded as johnson blessed himself and what did you do when you saw her we didnt have no cell phones back then you see so i ran back inside and i called nineoneone on the stage phone and the police came quickly they came real quick like they were already looking for her one final question mr johnson could you see that trash bin from wilshire boulevard johnson shook his head emphatically no it was behind the theater and you could only see it if you drove back there and down the little alley i hesitated here i had more to bring out from this witness information not presented in the first trial but gathered by bosch during his reinvestigation it was information that royce might not be aware of i could just ask the question that would draw it out or i could roll the dice and see if the defense opened a door on crossexamination the information would be the same either way but it would have greater weight if the jury believed the defense had tried to hide it thank you mr johnson i finally said i have no further questions the witness was turned over to royce who went to the lectern as i sat down just a few questions he said did you see who put the victims body in the bin no i did not johnson said so when you called nineoneone you had no idea who did it is that correct correct before that day had you ever seen the defendant before no i dont think so thank you and that was it royce had performed a typical cross of a witness who had little value to the defense johnson couldnt identify the murderer so royce got that on the record but he should have just let johnson pass by asking if johnson had ever seen jessup before the murder he opened a door i stood back up so i could go through it redirect mr haller the judge asked briefly your honor mr johnson back during this period that were talking about did you often work on sundays no it was my day off usually but if we had some special projects i would be told to come in royce objected on the grounds that i was opening up a line of questioning that was outside the scope of his crossexamination i promised the judge that it was within the scope and that it would become apparent soon she indulged me and overruled the objection i went back to mr johnson i had hoped royce would object because in a few moments it would look like he had been trying to stop me from getting to information damaging to jessup you mentioned that the trash bin where you found the body was at the end of an alley is there no parking lot behind the el rey theatre there is a parking lot but it does not belong to the el rey theatre we have the alley that gives us access to the back doors and the bins who does the parking lot belong to a company that has lots all over the city its called city park is there a wall or a fence separating this parking lot from the alley royce stood again your honor this is going on and on and it has nothing to do with what i asked mr johnson your honor i said i will get there in two more questions you may answer mr johnson breitman said there is a fence johnson said so i said from the el reys alley and the location of its trash bin you can see into the adjoining parking lot and anyone in the adjoining parking lot could see the trash bin correct yes and prior to the day you discovered the body did you have occasion to be at work on a sunday and to notice that the parking lot behind the theater was being used yes like a month previously i came to work and in the back there were many cars and i saw tow trucks towing them in i couldnt help myself i had to glance over at royce and jessup to see if they were squirming yet i was about to draw the first blood of the trial they thought johnson was going to be a noncritical witness meaning he would establish the murder and its location and nothing else they were wrong did you inquire as to what was going on i asked yes johnson said i asked what they were doing and one of the drivers said that they were towing cars from the neighborhood down the street and holding them there so people could come and pay and get their cars so it was being used like a temporary holding lot is that what you mean yes and did you know what the name of the towing company was it was on the trucks it was called aardvark towing you said trucks you saw more than one truck there yeah there were two or three trucks when i saw them what did you tell them after you were informed what they were doing there i told my boss and he called city park to see if they knew about it he thought there could be an insurance concern especially with people being mad about being towed and all and it turned out aardvark wasnt supposed to be there it wasnt authorized what happened they had to stop using the lot and my boss told me to keep an eye out if i worked on weekends to see if they kept using it so they stopped using the lot behind the theater thats right and this was the same lot from which you could see the trash bin in which you would later find the body of melissa landy yes sir when mr royce asked you if you had ever seen the defendant before the day of the murder you answered that you didnt think so correct correct you dont think so why are you not sure because i think he couldve been one of the aardvark drivers i saw using that lot so i cant be sure i didnt see him before thank you mr johnson i have no further questions monday april am for the first time since he had been brought into the case bosch felt as though melissa landy was in good hands he had just watched mickey haller score the first points of the trial he had taken a small piece of the puzzle bosch had come up with and used it to land the first punch it wasnt a knockout by any means but it had connected solidly it was the first step down the path of proving jason jessups familiarity with the parking lot and trash bin behind the el rey theatre before the trial would end its importance would be made clear to the jury but what was even more significant to bosch at the moment was the way haller had used the information harry had provided he had hung it on the defense made it look as though it had been their attempt to obfuscate the facts of the case that drew the information out it was a smooth move and it gave bosch a big boost in his confidence in haller as a prosecutor he met johnson at the gate and walked him out of the courtroom to the hallway where he shook his hand you did real good in there mr johnson we cant thank you enough you already have convicting that man of killing that little girl well were not quite there yet but thats the plan except most people who read the paper think were going after an innocent man no you got the right man i can tell bosch nodded and felt awkward you take care mr johnson detective your music is jazz right bosch had already turned to go back to the courtroom now he looked back at johnson howd you know that just a guess we got jazz acts that come through new orleans jazz you ever want tickets to a show at the el rey you look me up yeah ill do that thanks bosch pushed through the doors leading back into the courtroom he was smiling thinking about johnsons guess about his music if he was right about that then maybe he would be right about the jury convicting jessup as he moved down the aisle he heard the judge telling haller to call his next witness the state calls regina landy bosch knew he was on this part had been choreographed a week earlier by the judge and over the objection of the defense regina landy was unavailable to testify because she was dead but she had testified in the first trial and the judge had ruled that her testimony could be read to the current jurors breitman now turned to the jurors to offer the explanation guarding against revealing any hint that there had been an earlier trial ladies and gentlemen the state has called a witness who is no longer available to testify however previously she gave sworn testimony that we will read to you today you are not to consider why this witness is unable to testify or where this previous sworn testimony is from your concern is the testimony itself i should add that i have decided to allow this over the objection of the defense the us constitution holds that the accused is entitled to question his accusers however as you will see this witness was indeed questioned by an attorney who previously represented mr jessup she turned back to the court you may proceed mr haller haller called bosch to the stand he was sworn in and then took the seat pulling the microphone into position he opened the blue binder he had carried with him and haller began detective bosch can you tell us a little bit about your experience as a law enforcement officer bosch turned toward the jury box and moved his eyes over the faces of the jurors as he answered he did not leave the alternates out i have been a sworn officer for thirtysix years i have spent more than twentyfive of those years working homicides i have been the lead investigator in more than two hundred murder investigations in that time and you are the lead investigator on this case yes i am now i did not take part in the original investigation however i came into this case in february of this year thank you detective we will be talking about your investigation later in the trial are you prepared to read the sworn testimony of regina landy taken on october seventh nineteen eightysix i am okay i will read the questions that were posed at the time by deputy district attorney gary lintz and defense counsel charles barnard and you will read the responses from the witness we start with direct examination from mr lintz haller paused and studied the transcript in front of him bosch wondered if there would be any confusion from his reading the responses of a woman in deciding to allow the testimony the week before the judge had disallowed any reference to emotions described as having been exhibited by regina landy bosch knew from the transcript that she was crying throughout her testimony but he would not be able to communicate that to the present jurors here we go haller said mrs landy can you please describe your relationship with the victim melissa landy i am her mother bosch read she was my daughter until she was taken away from me monday april pm the reading of regina landys testimony from the first trial took us right up to lunch the testimony was needed to establish who the victim was and who had identified her but without the incumbent emotion of a parents testimony the reading by bosch was largely procedural and while the first witness of the day brought reason to be hopeful the second witness was about as anticlimactic as a voice from the grave could possibly be i imagined that boschs reading of regina landys words was confusing to the jurors when they were not provided with any explanation for her absence from the trial of her daughters alleged killer the prosecution team had lunch at duffys which was close enough to the ccb to be convenient but far enough away that we wouldnt have to worry about jurors finding the same place to eat nobody was ecstatic about the start of the trial but that was to be expected i had planned the presentation of evidence like the unfolding of scheherazade the symphonic suite that starts slow and quiet and builds to an allencompassing crescendo of sound and music and emotion the first day was about the proof of facts i had to bring forward the body i had to establish that there was a victim that she had been taken from her home and later found dead and that she had been murdered i had hit two of those facts with the first witnesses and now the afternoon witness the medical examiner would complete the proof the prosecutions case would then shift toward the accused and the evidence that tied him to the crime that would be when my case would really come to life only bosch and i came back from lunch maggie had gone over to the checkers hotel to spend the afternoon with our star witness sarah ann gleason bosch had gone up to washington on saturday and flown down with her sunday morning she wasnt scheduled to testify until wednesday morning but i had wanted her close and i had wanted maggie to spend as much time as possible prepping her for her part in the trial maggie had already been up to washington twice to spend time with her but i believed that any time they could spend together would continue to promote the bond i wanted them to have and the jury to see maggie left us reluctantly she was concerned that i would make a misstep in court without her there watching over me as my second i assured her that i could handle the direct examination of a medical examiner and would call her if i ran into trouble little did i know how important this witnesss testimony would come to be the afternoon session got off to a late start while we waited ten minutes for a juror who did not return from lunch on time once the panel was assembled and returned to court judge breitman lectured the jurors again on timeliness and ordered them to eat as a group for the remainder of the trial she also ordered the courtroom deputy to escort them to lunch this way no one would stray from the pack and no one would be late finished with the lunch business the judge gruffly ordered me to call my next witness i nodded to bosch and he headed to the witness room to retrieve david eisenbach the judge grew impatient as we waited but it took eisenbach a few minutes longer than most witnesses to make his way into the courtroom and to the witness stand eisenbach was seventynine years old and walked with a cane he also carried a pillow with a handle on it as if he were going to a usc football game at the coliseum after being sworn in he placed the pillow on the hard wood of the witness chair and then sat down dr eisenbach i began can you tell the jury what you do for a living currently i am semiretired and derive an income from being an autopsy consultant a gun for hire you lawyers like to call it i review autopsies for a living and then tell lawyers and juries what the medical examiner did right and did wrong and before you were semiretired what did you do i was assistant medical examiner for the county of los angeles had that job for thirty years as such you conducted autopsies yes sir i did in thirty years i conducted over twenty thousand autopsies thats a lot of dead people that is a lot dr eisenbach do you remember them all of course not i remember a handful off the top of my head the rest of them i would need my notes to remember after receiving permission from the judge i approached the witness stand and put down a fortypage document i draw your attention to the document i have placed before you can you identify it yes its an autopsy protocol dated february eighteenth nineteen eightysix the deceased is listed as melissa theresa landy my name is also on it it is one of mine meaning you conducted the autopsy yes that is what i said i followed this with a series of questions that established the autopsy procedures and the general health of the victim prior to death royce objected several times to what he termed leading questions few of these were sustained by the judge but that was not the point royce had adopted the tactic of attempting to get me out of rhythm by incessantly interrupting whether such interruptions were valid or not working around these interruptions eisenbach was able to testify that melissa landy was in perfect health until the moment of her violent death he said she had not been sexually attacked in any determinable way he said there was no indication of prior sexual activityshe was a virgin he said the cause of her death was asphyxiation he said the evidence of crushed bones in her neck and throat indicated she had been choked by a powerful forcea mans single hand using a laser pointer to mark locations on photographs of the body taken at autopsy eisenbach identified a bruise pattern on the victims neck that was indicative of a onehanded choke hold with the laser point he delineated a thumb mark on the right side of the girls neck and the larger fourfinger mark on the left side doctor did you make a determination of which hand the killer used to choke the victim to death yes it was quite simple to determine the killer had used the right hand to choke this girl to death just one hand that is correct was there any determination of how this was done had the girl been suspended while she was choked no the injuries particularly the crushed bones indicated that the killer put his hand on her neck and pressed her against a surface that offered resistance could that have been the seat of a vehicle yes how about a mans leg royce objected saying the question called for pure speculation the judge agreed and told me to move on doctor you mentioned twenty thousand autopsies i assume that many of these were homicides involving asphyxiation was it unusual to come across a case where only one hand was used to choke a victim to death royce objected again this time saying the question asked for an answer outside the witnesss expertise but the judge went my way the man has conducted twenty thousand autopsies she said im inclined to think that gives him a lot of expertise im going to allow the question you can answer doctor i said was this unusual not necessarily many homicides occur during struggles and other circumstances ive seen it before if one hand is otherwise occupied the other must suffice we are talking about a twelveyearold girl who weighed ninetyone pounds she could have been subdued with one hand if the killer needed the left hand for something else would driving a vehicle fall into that category objection royce said same argument and same ruling breitman said you may answer doctor yes eisenbach said if one hand was being used to maintain control of a vehicle the other hand could be used to choke the victim that is one possibility at this point i believed i had gotten all that there was to get from eisenbach i ended direct examination and handed the witness over to royce unfortunately for me eisenbach was a witness who had something for everybody and royce went after it one possibility is that what you called it dr eisenbach excuse me you said the scenario mr haller describedone hand on the wheel one hand on the neckwas one possibility is that correct yes that is a possibility but you werent there so you cant know for sure isnt that right doctor yes that is right you said one possibility what are some of the other possibilities well i wouldnt know i was responding to the question from the prosecutor how about a cigarette what could the killer have been holding a cigarette in his left hand while he choked the girl with his right yes i suppose so yes and how about his penis his his penis doctor could the killer have choked this girl with his right hand while holding his penis with his left i would have to yes that is a possibility too he could have been masturbating with one hand while he choked her with the other correct doctor anything is possible but there is no indication in the autopsy report that supports this what about what is not in the file doctor im not aware of anything is this what you meant about being a hired gun doctor you take the prosecutions side no matter what the facts are i dont always work for prosecutors im happy for you i stood up your honor hes badgering the witness with mr royce the judge said please keep it civil and on point yes your honor doctor of the twenty thousand autopsies you have performed how many of them were on victims of sexually motivated violence eisenbach looked across the floor to me but there was nothing i could do for him bosch had taken maggies place at the prosecution table he leaned over to me and whispered whats he doing trying to make our case i held up my hand so i would not be distracted from the backandforth between royce and eisenbach no hes making their case i whispered back eisenbach still hadnt answered doctor the judge said please answer the question i dont have a count but many of them were sexually motivated crimes was this one based on the autopsy findings i could not make that conclusion but whenever you have a young child particularly a female and there is a stranger abduction then you are almost always move to strike the answer as nonresponsive royce said cutting the witness off the witness is assuming facts not in evidence the judge considered the objection i stood up ready to respond but said nothing doctor please answer only the question you are asked the judge said i thought i was eisenbach said then let me be more specific royce said you found no indications of sexual assault or abuse on the body of melissa landy is that correct doctor that is correct what about on the victims clothing the body is my jurisdiction the clothing is analyzed by forensics of course royce hesitated and looked down at his notes i could tell he was trying to decide how far to take something it was a case of so far so gooddo i risk going further finally he decided now doctor a moment ago when i objected to your answer you called this a stranger abduction what evidence from the autopsy supported that claim eisenbach thought for a long moment and even looked down at the autopsy report in front of him doctor uh there is nothing i recall from the autopsy alone that supports this actually the autopsy supports a conclusion quite the opposite doesnt it eisenbach looked genuinely confused i am not sure what you mean can i draw your attention to page eight of the autopsy protocol the preliminary examination of the body royce waited a moment until eisenbach turned to the page i did as well but didnt need to i knew where royce was going and couldnt stop him i just needed to be ready to object at the right moment doctor the report states that scrapings of the victims fingernails were negative for blood and tissue do you see that on page eight yes i scraped her nails but they were clean this indicates she did not scratch her attacker her killer correct that would be the indication yes and this would also indicate that she knew her attack objection i was on my feet but not quick enough royce had gotten the suggestion out and to the jury assumes facts not in evidence i said your honor defense counsel is clearly attempting to plant seeds with the jury that do not exist sustained mr royce a warning yes your honor the defense has no further questions for this prosecution witness monday april pm bosch knocked on the door of room and looked directly at the peephole the door was quickly opened by mcpherson who was checking her watch as she stood back to let him enter why arent you in court with mickey she asked bosch entered the room was a suite with a decent view of grand avenue and the back of the biltmore there was a couch and two chairs one of them occupied by sarah ann gleason bosch nodded his hello because he doesnt need me there im needed here whats going on royce tipped his hand on the defenses case i need to talk to sarah about it he started toward the couch but mcpherson put her hand on his arm and stopped him wait a minute before you talk to sarah you talk to me whats going on bosch nodded she was right he looked around but there was no place for private conversation in the suite lets take a walk mcpherson went to the coffee table and grabbed a key card well be right back sarah do you need anything no im fine ill be here she held up a sketchpad it would keep her company bosch and mcpherson left the room and took the elevator down to the lobby there was a bar crowded with prehappy hour drinkers but they found a private spot in a sitting area by the front door okay how did royce tip his hand mcpherson asked when he was crossexamining eisenbach he riffed off of mickeys question about the killer using only his right hand to choke her right while he was driving he panicked when he heard the call on the police radio and killed her right thats the prosecution theory well royce is already setting up a defense theory on cross he asked whether it was possible that the killer was choking her with one hand while masturbating with the other she was silent as she computed this this is the old prosecution theory she said from the first trial that it was murder in the commission of a sex act mickey and i sort of figured that once royce got all the discovery material and learned that the dna came from the stepfather the defense would play it this way theyre setting up the stepfather as the straw man theyll say he killed her and the dna proves it mcpherson folded her arms as she worked it out further its good but there are two things wrong with it sarah and the hair evidence so were missing something royce has got to have something or someone who discredits sarahs id thats why im here i brought royces witness list these people have been playing hideandseek with me and i havent run them all down sarahs got to look at this list and tell me which one i need to focus on how the hell will she know shes got to these are her people boyfriends husbands fellow tweakers all of them have records theyre the people she hung out with before she got straight every address is a lastknown and worthless royce has got to be hiding them mcpherson nodded thats why they call him clever clive okay lets talk to her let me try first okay she stood up wait a minute bosch said she looked at him what is it what if the defense theory is the right one are you kidding me he didnt answer and she didnt wait long she headed back toward the elevator he got up and followed they went back to the room bosch noticed that gleason had sketched a tulip on her pad while they had been gone he sat down on the couch across from her and mcpherson took the chair right next to her sarah mcpherson said we need to talk we think that somebody you used to know during those lost years we were talking about is going to try to help the defense we need to figure out who it is and what they are going to say i dont understand sarah said but i was thirteen years old when this happened to us what does it matter who my friends were after it matters because they can testify about things you might have done or said what things mcpherson shook her head thats what is so frustrating we dont really know we only know that today in court the defense made it clear that they are going to try to put the blame for your sisters death on your stepfather sarah raised her hands as if warding off a blow thats crazy i was there i saw that man take her we know that sarah but its a matter of what is conveyed to the jury and what and who the jurors believe now detective bosch has a list of the defenses witnesses i want you to take a look at it and tell us what the names mean to you bosch pulled the list from his briefcase he handed it to mcpherson who handed it to sarah sorry all those notes are things i added bosch said when i was trying to track them down just look at the names bosch watched her lips move slightly as she started to read then they stopped moving and she just stared at the paper he saw tears in her eyes sarah mcpherson prompted these people gleason said in a whisper i thought id never see them again you may never see them again mcpherson said just because theyre on that list it doesnt mean theyll be called they pull names out of the records and load up the list to confuse us sarah its called haystacking they hide the real witnesses and our investigatordetective boschwastes his time checking out the wrong people but theres got to be at least one name on there that counts who is it sarah help us she stared at the list without responding someone who will be able to say you two were close who you spent time with and told secrets to i thought a husband couldnt testify against a wife one spouse cant be forced to testify against the other but what are you talking about sarah this one she pointed to a name on the list bosch leaned over to read it edward roman bosch had traced him to a lockdown rehab center in north hollywood where sarah had spent nine months after her last incarceration the only thing bosch had guessed was that theyd had contact in group therapy the last known address provided by royce was a motel in van nuys but roman was long gone from there bosch had gotten no further with it and had dismissed the name as part of royces haystack roman he said you were with him in rehab right yes gleason said then we got married when mcpherson said we have no record of that marriage after we got out he knew a minister we got married on the beach but it didnt last very long did you get divorced mcpherson asked no i never really cared then when i got straight i just didnt want to go back there it was one of those things you block out like it didnt happen mcpherson looked at bosch it might not have been a legal marriage he said theres nothing in the county records doesnt matter if it was a legal marriage or not she said he is obviously a volunteer witness so he can testify against her what matters is what his testimony is going to be whats he going to say sarah sarah slowly shook her head i dont know well what did you tell him about your sister and your stepfather i dont know those years i can hardly remember anything from back then there was a silence and then mcpherson asked sarah to look at the rest of the names on the list she did and shook her head i dont know who some of these people are some people in the life i just knew them by street names but edward roman you know yes we were together how long gleason shook her head in embarrassment not long inside rehab we thought we were made for each other once we were out it didnt work it lasted maybe three months i got arrested again and when i got out of jail he was gone is it possible that it wasnt a legitimate marriage gleason thought for a moment and halfheartedly shrugged anything is possible i guess okay sarah im going to step out with detective bosch again for a few minutes i want you to think about edward roman anything you can remember will be helpful ill be right back mcpherson took the witness list from her and handed it back to bosch they left the room but just took a few paces down the hallway before stopping and talking in whispers i guess youd better find him she said it wont matter bosch said if hes royces star witness he wont talk to me then find out everything you can about him so when the time comes we can destroy him got it bosch turned and headed down the hall toward the elevators mcpherson called after him he stopped and looked back did you mean it mcpherson asked mean what what you said down in the lobby what you asked you think twentyfour years ago she made it all up bosch looked at her for a long moment then shrugged i dont know well what about the hair in the truck doesnt that tie her story in bosch held a hand up empty its circumstantial and i wasnt there when they found it whats that supposed to mean it means sometimes things happen when the victim is a child and that i wasnt there when they found it boy maybe you should be working for the defense bosch dropped his hand to his side im sure theyve thought of all of this already he turned back toward the elevators and headed down the hallway tuesday april am sometimes the wheels of justice roll smoothly the second day of trial started exactly as scheduled the full jury was in the box the judge was on the bench and jason jessup and his attorney were seated at the defense table i stood and called my first witness of what i hoped would be a productive day for the prosecution harry bosch even had izzy gordon in the courtroom ready to go by five minutes after the hour she was sworn in and seated she was a small woman with blackframed glasses that magnified her eyes my records said she was fifty years old but she looked older ms gordon can you tell the jury what you do for a living yes i am a forensic technician and crime scene supervisor for the los angeles police department i have been so employed in the forensics unit since nineteen eightysix were you so employed on february sixteenth of that year yes i was it was my first day of work and what was your assignment on that day my job was to learn i was assigned to a crime scene supervisor and i was to get onthejob training izzy gordon was a major find for the prosecution two technicians and a supervisor had worked the three separate crime scenes relating to the melissa landy casethe home on windsor the trash bin behind the el rey and the tow truck driven by jessup gordon had been assigned to be at the supervisors side and therefore had been in attendance at all three crime scenes the supervisor was long since dead and the other techs were retired and unable to offer testimony about all three locations finding gordon allowed me to streamline the introduction of crime scene evidence who was that supervisor that was art donovan and you got a call out with him that day yes we did an abduction that turned into a homicide we ended up going from scene to scene to scene that day three related locations okay lets take those scenes one at a time over the next ninety minutes i walked gordon through her sunday tour of crime scenes on february using her as the conduit i could deliver crime scene photographs videos and evidence reports royce continued his tack of objecting at will in an effort to prevent the unimpeded flow of information to the jury but he was scoreless and getting under the judges skin i could tell and so i did not complain i wanted that annoyance to fester it might come in handy later gordons testimony was fairly pedestrian as she first discussed the unsuccessful efforts to find shoe prints and other trace evidence on the front lawn of the landys house it turned more dramatic when she recalled being urgently called to a new crime scenethe trash bin behind the el rey we were called when they found the body it was handled in whispers because the family was there in the house and we did not want to upset them until it was confirmed that there was a body and that it was the little girl you and donovan went to the el rey theatre yes along with detective kloster we met the assistant medical examiner there we now had a homicide so more technicians were called in too the el rey portion of gordons testimony was largely an opportunity for me to show more video footage and photographs of the victim on the overhead screens if nothing else i wanted every juror in the box to be incensed by what they saw i wanted to light the fire of one of the basic instincts vengeance i counted on royce to object and he did but by then he had exhausted his welcome with the judge and his argument that the images were graphic and cumulatively excessive fell on deaf ears they were allowed finally izzy gordon brought us to the last crime scenethe tow truckand she described how she had spotted three long hairs caught in the crack that split the bench seat and pointed them out to donovan for collection what happened to those hairs i asked they were individually bagged and tagged and then taken to the scientific investigation division for comparison and analysis gordons testimony was smooth and efficient when i turned her over to the defense royce did the best he could he did not bother to assail the collection of evidence but merely attempted once again to gain a foothold for the defense theory in doing so he skipped the first two crime scenes and zeroed in on the tow truck ms gordon when you got to the aardvark towing yard were there police officers already there yes of course how many i didnt count but there were several what about detectives yes there were detectives conducting a search of the whole business under the authority of a search warrant and were these detectives you had seen earlier at the previous crime scenes i think so yes i would assume so but i do not remember specifically but you seem to remember other things specifically why dont you remember which detectives you were working with there were several people working this case detective kloster was the lead investigator but he was dealing with three different locations as well as the girl who was the witness i dont remember if he was at the tow yard when i first arrived but he was there at some point i think that if you refer to the crime scene attendance logs you will be able to determine who was at what scene and when ah then we shall do just that royce approached the witness stand and gave gordon three documents and a pencil he then returned to the lectern what are those three documents ms gordon these are crime scene attendance logs and which scenes are they from the three i worked in regard to the landy case can you please take a moment to study those logs and use the pencil i have given you to circle any name that appears on all three lists it took gordon less than a minute to complete the task finished royce asked yes there are four names can you tell us yes myself and my supervisor art donovan and then detective kloster and his partner chad steiner you were the only four who were at all three crime scenes that day correct that is correct maggie leaned into me and whispered crossscene contamination i shook my head slightly and whispered back that suggests accidental contamination i think hes going for intentional planting of evidence maggie nodded and leaned away royce asked his next question being one of only four who were at all four scenes you had a keen understanding of this crime and what it meant isnt that correct im not sure what you mean among police personnel were emotions high at these crime scenes well everyone was very professional you mean nobody cared that this was a twelveyearold girl no we cared and you could say things were at least tense at the first two scenes we had the family at one and the dead little girl at the other i dont really remember things being emotional at the tow yard wrong answer i thought she had opened a door for the defense okay royce said but you are saying that at the first two scenes the emotions were high correct i stood up just to give royce a dose of his own medicine objection asked and answered already your honor sustained royce was undaunted then how did these emotions display themselves he asked well we talked art donovan told me to keep professional detachment he said we had to do our best work because this had been just a little girl what about detectives kloster and steiner they said the same thing that we couldnt leave any stone unturned that we had to do it for melissa he called the victim by her name yes i remember that how angry and upset would you say detective kloster was i stood and objected assumes facts not in evidence or testimony the judge sustained it and told royce to move on ms gordon can you refer to the crime scene attendance logs still in front of you and tell us if the arrival and departure of law enforcement personnel is kept by time yes it is there are arrival and departure times listed after each name you have previously stated that detectives kloster and steiner were the only two investigators besides yourself and your supervisor to appear at all three scenes yes they were the lead investigators on the case did they arrive at each of the scenes before you and mr donovan it took gordon a moment to confirm the information on the lists yes they did so they would have had access to the victims body before you ever arrived at the el rey theatre correct i dont know what you mean by access but yes they were on scene first and so they would have also had access to the tow truck before you got there and saw the three strands of hair conveniently caught in the seat crack correct i objected saying the question required the witness to speculate on things she would not have witnessed and was argumentative because of the use of the word conveniently royce was obviously playing to the jury the judge told royce to rephrase the question without taking editorial license the detectives would have had access to the tow truck before you got there and before you were the first to see the three strands of hair lodged in the seat crack correct gordon took the hint from my objection and answered the way i wanted her to i dont know because i wasnt there still royce had gotten his point across to the jury he had also gotten the point of his case across to me it was now fair to assume that the defense would put forth the theory that the policein the person of kloster andor his partner steinerhad planted the hair evidence to secure a conviction of jessup after he had been identified by the thirteenyearold sarah further to this the defense would posit that sarahs wrongful identification of jessup was intentional and part of the landy familys effort to hide the fact that melissa had died either accidentally or intentionally at the hands of her stepfather it would be a tough road to take to be successful it would take at least one person on the jury buying into what amounted to two conspiracies working independently of one another and yet in concert but i could think of only two defense attorneys in town who could pull it off and royce was one of them i had to be prepared what happened after you noticed the hair on the tow trucks seat do you remember royce asked the witness i pointed it out to art because he was doing the actual collection of evidence i was just there to observe and gather experience were detectives kloster and steiner called over to take a look yes i believe so do you recall what if anything they did then i dont recall them doing anything in relation to the hair evidence it was their case and so they were notified of the evidence find and that was it were you happy with yourself i dont think i understand it was your first day on the jobyour first case were you pleased with yourself after spotting the hair evidence were you proud gordon hesitated before answering as if trying to figure out if the question was a trap i was pleased that i had contributed yes and did you ever wonder why you the rookie spotted the hair in the seat crack before your supervisor or the two lead investigators gordon hesitated again and then said no royce said he had no further questions it had been an excellent cross planting multiple seeds that could later bloom into something larger in the defense case i did what i could on redirect asking gordon to recite the names of the six uniformed police officers and two other detectives who were listed as arriving ahead of kloster and steiner on the crime scene attendance log kept at the location where melissa landys body was found so hypothetically if detective kloster or steiner had wanted to take hair from the victim to plant elsewhere they would have had to do it under the noses of eight other officers or enlist them in allowing them to do it is that correct yes it would seem so i thanked the witness and sat down royce then went back to the lectern for recross also hypothetically if kloster or steiner wanted to plant hair from the victim at the third crime scene it would not have been necessary to take it directly from the victims head if there were other sources for it correct i guess not if there were other sources for example a hairbrush in the victims home could have provided hair to them correct i guess so they were in the victims home werent they yes that was one of the locations where they signed in nothing further royce had nailed me and i decided not to pursue this any further royce would have a comeback no matter what i brought forward from the witness gordon was dismissed and the judge broke for lunch i told bosch that he would be on the stand after the break reading klosters testimony into the record i asked if he wanted to grab lunch together to talk about the defenses theory but he said he couldnt that he had something to do maggie was heading over to the hotel to have lunch with sarah ann gleason so that left me on my own or so i thought as i headed down the center aisle to the rear door of the courtroom an attractive woman stepped out of the back row in front of me she smiled and stepped up to me mr haller im rachel walling with the fbi at first it didnt compute but then the name caught on a memory prompt somewhere inside yes the profiler you distracted my investigator with your theory that jason jessup is a serial killer well i hope it was more help than distraction i guess that remains to be seen what can i do for you agent walling i was going to ask if you might have time for lunch but since you consider me a distraction then maybe i should just guess what agent walling youre in luck im free lets have lunch i pointed to the door and we headed out tuesday april pm this time it was the judge who was late returning to court the prosecution and defense teams were seated at the appointed time and ready to go but there was no sign of breitman and there had been no indication from the clerk as to whether the delay was because of personal business or some sort of trial issue bosch got up from his seat at the railing and approached haller tapping him on the back harry were about to start you ready im ready but we need to talk whats wrong bosch turned his body so his back was to the defense table and lowered his voice into a barely audible whisper i went to see the sis guys at lunch they showed me some stuff you need to know about he was being overly cryptic but the photos lieutenant wright had showed him from the surveillance the night before were troubling jessup was up to something and whatever it might be it was going to go down soon before haller could respond the background hubbub of the courtroom ceased as the judge took the bench after court haller whispered he then turned back to the front of the courtroom and bosch returned to his seat at the railing the judge told the deputy to seat the jury and soon everyone was in place i want to apologize breitman said this delay was my responsibility i had a personal matter come up and it took far longer than i expected it would mr haller please call your next witness haller stood and called for doral kloster bosch stood and headed for the witness stand while the judge once again explained to the jury that the witness called by the prosecution was unavailable and that prior sworn testimony would be read by bosch and haller though all of this had been worked out in a pretrial hearing and over the objection of the defense royce stood once again and objected mr royce weve already argued this issue the judge responded i would ask that the court reconsider its ruling as this form of testimony entirely undercuts mr jessups constitutional right to confront his accusers detective kloster was not asked the questions i would want to ask him based on the defenses current view of the case again mr royce this issue has been settled and i do not wish to rehash it in front of the jury but your honor i am being inhibited from presenting a full defense mr royce i have been very generous in allowing you to posture in front of the jury my patience is now growing thin you may sit down royce stared the judge down bosch knew what he was doing playing to the jury he wanted them to see him and jessup as the underdogs he wanted them to understand that it was not just the prosecution against jessup but the judge as well when he had drawn out the stare as long as he dared he spoke again judge i cannot sit down when my clients freedom is at stake this is an egregious breitman angrily slammed her hand down making a sound as loud as a shot were not going to do this in front of the jury mr royce will the jurors please return to the assembly room wideeyed and alert to the tension that had engulfed the courtroom the jurors filed out to a person glancing back over their shoulders to check the action behind them the whole time royce held his glare on the judge and bosch knew it was mostly an act this was exactly what royce wanted for the jury to see him being persecuted and prevented from bringing his case forward it didnt matter that they would be sequestered in the jury room they all knew that royce was about to get slapped down hard by the judge once the door to the jury assembly room was closed the judge turned back to royce in the thirty seconds it had taken the jury to leave the courtroom she had obviously calmed down mr royce at the end of the trial we will be holding a contempt hearing during which your actions today will be examined and penalized until then if i ever order you to sit down and you refuse that order i will have the courtroom deputy forcibly place you in your seat and it will not matter to me if the jury is present or not do you understand yes your honor and i would like to apologize for allowing the emotions of the moment to get the best of me very well mr royce you will now sit down and well bring the jury back in they held each others eyes for a long moment until royce finally and slowly sat down the judge then told the courtroom deputy to retrieve the jury bosch glanced at the jurors as they returned they all had their eyes on royce and harry could see the defense attorneys gambit had worked he saw sympathy in their eyes as if they all knew that at any moment they might cross the judge and be similarly rebuked they didnt know what happened while they were behind the closed door but royce was like the kid who had been sent to the principals office and had returned to tell everyone about it at recess the judge addressed the jury before continuing the trial i want the members of the jury to understand that in a trial of this nature emotions sometimes run high mr royce and i have discussed the issue and it is resolved you are to pay it no mind so lets proceed with the reading of prior sworn testimony mr haller yes your honor haller stood and went to the lectern with his printout of doral klosters testimony detective bosch you are still under oath do you have the transcript of sworn testimony provided by detective doral kloster on october eighth nineteen eightysix yes i do bosch placed the transcript on the stand and took a pair of reading glasses out of his jackets inside pocket okay then once again i will read the questions that were posed to detective kloster under oath by deputy district attorney gary lintz and you will read the responses from the witness after a series of questions used to elicit basic information about kloster the testimony moved quickly into the investigation of the murder of melissa landy now detective you are assigned to the detective squad at wilshire division correct yes i am on the homicide and major crimes table and this case did not start out as a homicide no it did not my partner and i were called in from home after patrol units were dispatched to the landy house and a preliminary investigation determined that it appeared to be a stranger abduction that made it a major crime and we were called out what happened when you got to the landy house we initially separated the individuals therethe mother father and sarah the sisterand conducted interviews we then brought the family together and conducted a joint interview it often works best that way and it did this time in the joint interview we found our investigative direction tell us about that how did you find this direction in the individual interview sarah revealed that the girls had been playing a hideandseek game and that she was hiding behind some bushes at the front corner of her house these bushes blocked her view of the street she said she heard a trash truck and saw a trashman cross the yard and grab her sister these events occurred on a sunday so we knew there was no city trash pickup but when i had sarah recount this story in front of her parents her father quickly said that on sunday mornings several tow trucks patrol the neighborhood and that the drivers wear overalls like the city sanitation workers do and that became our first lead and how did you follow that lead we were able to obtain a list of citylicensed tow truck companies that operated in the wilshire district by this time i had called in more detectives and we split the list up there were only three companies that were operating on that day each pair of detectives took one my partner and i went to a tow yard on la brea boulevard that was operated by a business called aardvark towing and what happened when you got there we found that they were about to shut down for the day because they essentially worked noparking zones around churches by noon they were done there were three drivers and they were securing things and about to head out when we got there they all voluntarily agreed to identify themselves and answer our questions while my partner asked preliminary questions i went back to our car and called their names into central dispatch so they could check them for criminal records who were these men detective kloster their names were william clinton jason jessup and derek wilbern and what was the result of your records search only wilbern had an arrest record it was an attempted rape with no conviction the case as i recall was four years old did this make him a suspect in the melissa landy abduction yes it did he generally fit the description we had gotten from sarah he drove a large truck and wore overalls and he had an arrest record involving a sex crime that made him a strong suspect in my mind what did you do next i returned to my partner and he was still interviewing the men in a group setting i knew that time was of the essence this little girl was still missing she was still out there somewhere and usually in a case like this the longer the individual is missing the less chance you have of a good ending so you made some decisions didnt you yes i decided that sarah landy ought to see derek wilbern to see if she could identify him as the abductor so did you set up a lineup for her to view no i didnt no no i didnt feel there was time i had to keep things moving we had to try to find that girl so what i did was ask if the three men would agree to go to a separate location where we could continue the interview they each said yes no hesitation no none they agreed by the way what happened when the other detectives visited the other towing companies that worked in the wilshire district they did not find or interview anyone who rose to the level of suspect you mean no one with a criminal record no criminal records and no flags came up during interviews so you were concentrating on derek wilbern thats right so when wilbern and the other two men agreed to be interviewed at another location what did you do we called for a couple of patrol cruisers and we put jessup and clinton in the back of one car and wilbern in the back of the other we then closed and locked the aardvark tow yard and drove ahead in our car so you got back to the landy house first by design we had told the patrol officers to take a circuitous route to the landy house on windsor so we could get there first when we arrived back at the house i took sarah upstairs to her bedroom which was located at the front and was overlooking the front yard and street i closed the blinds and had her look through just a crack so she would not be visibly exposed to the tow truck drivers what happened next my partner had stayed out front when the patrol cruisers arrived i had him take the three men out of the cars and have them stand together on the sidewalk i asked sarah if she recognized any of them did she not at first but one of the menjessupwas wearing a baseball hat and he was looking down using the brim to guard his face bosch flipped over two pages of the testimony at this point the pages had been xed out they contained several questions about jessups demeanor and attempt to use his hat to hide his face these questions were objected to by jessups thendefense counsel sustained by the trial judge then resculpted and reasked and objected to again in the pretrial hearing breitman had agreed with royces contention that the current jury should not even hear them it was one of the only points royce had won haller picked up the reading at the point the skirmish had ended okay detective why dont you tell the jury what happened next sarah asked me if i could ask the man with the hat to remove it i radioed my partner and he told jessup to take off the hat almost immediately sarah said it was him the man who abducted her sister yes wait a minute you said derek wilbern was your suspect yes based on his having a record of a prior arrest for a sex crime i thought he was the most likely suspect was sarah sure of her identification i asked her several times to confirm the identification she did what did you do next i left sarah in her room and went back downstairs when i got outside i placed jason jessup under arrest handcuffed him and put him in the back of a patrol car i told other officers to put wilbern and clinton in another car and take them down to wilshire division for questioning did you question jason jessup at this point yes i did again time was of the essence i didnt feel that i had the time to take him to wilshire division and set up a formal interview instead i got in the car with him read him the miranda warning and asked if he would talk to me he said yes did you record this no i did not frankly i forgot things were moving so quickly and all i could think about was finding that little girl i had a recorder in my pocket but i forgot to record this conversation okay so you questioned jessup anyway i asked questions but he gave very few answers he denied any involvement in the abduction he acknowledged that he had been on tow patrol in the neighborhood that morning and could have driven by the landy house but that he did not remember specifically driving on windsor i asked him if he remembered seeing the hollywood sign because if you are on windsor you have a straight view of it up the street and on top of the hill he said he didnt remember seeing the hollywood sign how long did this questioning go on not long maybe five minutes we were interrupted by what detective my partner knocked on the cars window and i could tell by his face that whatever he had was important i got out of the car and thats when he told me they had found her a girls body had been found in a dumpster down on wilshire that changed everything yes everything i had jessup transported downtown and booked while i proceeded to the location of the body what did you discover when you got there there was a body of a girl approximately twelve or thirteen years old discarded in the dumpster she was unidentified at that time but she appeared to be melissa landy i had her photograph i was pretty sure it was her and you moved the focus of your investigation to this location absolutely my partner and i started conducting interviews while the crime scene people and coroners people dealt with the body we soon learned that the parking lot adjacent to the rear yard of the theater had previously been used as a temporary auto storage point by a towing company we learned that company was aardvark towing what did that mean to you to me it meant there was now a second connection between the murder of this girl and aardvark we had the lone witness sarah landy identifying one of the aardvark drivers as the abductor and now we had the victim found in a dumpster next to a parking lot used by aardvark drivers to me the case was coming together what was your next step at that point my partner and i split up he stayed with the crime scene and i went back to wilshire division to work on search warrants search warrants for what one for the entire premises at aardvark towing one for the tow truck jessup was driving that day and two more for jessups home and personal car and did you receive these search warrants yes i did judge richard pittman was on call and he happened to be playing golf at wilshire country club i brought him the warrants and he signed them on the ninth hole we then began the searches starting at aardvark were you present at this search yes i was my partner and i were in charge of it and at some point did you become aware of any particular evidence being found that you deemed important to the case yes at one point the forensics team leader a man named art donovan informed me that they had recovered three hairs that were brown in color and over a foot in length each from the tow truck that jason jessup was driving that day did donovan tell you specifically where in the truck these hair specimens were found yes he said they were caught in the crack between the lower and upper parts of the trucks bench seat bosch closed the transcript there klosters testimony continued but they had reached the point where haller had said he would stop because he would have all he needed on the record the judge then asked royce if he wished to have any of the defenses crossexamination read into the record royce stood to respond holding two paperclipped documents in his hand for the record i am reluctant to participate in a procedure i object to but since the court is calling the game i shall play along i have two brief readbacks of detective klosters crossexamination may i give a highlighted printout to detective bosch i think it will make this much easier very well the judge said the courtroom deputy took one of the documents from royce and delivered it to bosch who quickly scanned it it was only two pages of testimony transcriptions two exchanges were highlighted in yellow as bosch read them over the judge explained to the jury that royce would read questions posed by jessups previous defense attorney charles barnard while bosch would continue to read the responses of detective doral kloster you may proceed mr royce thank you your honor now reading from the transcript detective how long was it from when you closed and locked aardvark towing and took the three drivers over to windsor and returned with the search warrant may i refer to the case chronology you may it was about two hours and thirtyfive minutes and when you left aardvark towing how did you secure those premises we closed the garages and one of the driversi believe mr clintonhad a key to the door i borrowed it to lock the door did you return the key to him after no i asked if i could keep it for the time being and he said that was okay so when you went back with the signed search warrant you had the key and you simply unlocked the door to enter that is correct royce flipped the page on his copy and told bosch to do likewise okay now reading from another point in the crossexamination detective kloster what did you conclude when you were told about the hair specimens found in the tow truck mr jessup had been driving that day nothing the specimens had not been identified yet at what later point were they identified two days later i got a call from sid a hairandfiber tech told me that the hairs had been examined and that they closely matched samples taken from the victim she said that she could not exclude the victim as a source so then what did that tell you that it was likely that melissa landy had been in that tow truck what other evidence in that truck linked the victim to it or mr jessup to the victim there was no other evidence no blood or other bodily fluids no no fibers from the victims dress no nothing else nothing with the lack of other corroborating evidence in the truck did you ever consider that the hair evidence was planted in the truck well i considered it in the way i considered all aspects of the case but i dismissed it because the witness to the abduction had identified jessup and that was the truck he was driving i didnt think the evidence was planted i mean by who no one was trying to set him up he was identified by the victims sister that ended the readback bosch glanced over at the jury box and saw that it appeared that everyone had remained attentive during what was most likely the most boring stage of the trial anything further mr royce the judge asked nothing further judge royce responded very well breitman said i think this brings us to our afternoon break i will see everyone back in placeand i will admonish myself to be on timein fifteen minutes the courtroom started to clear and bosch stepped down from the witness stand he went directly to haller who was huddled with mcpherson bosch butted into their whispered conversation atwater right haller looked up at him yes right have her ready in fifteen minutes and you have time to talk after court ill make time i had an interesting conversation at lunch as well i need to tell you bosch left them and headed out to the hall he knew the line at the coffee urn in the little concession stand near the elevators would be long and full of jurors from the case he decided he would hit the stairwell and find coffee on another floor but first he ducked into the restroom as he entered he saw jessup at one of the sinks he was leaning over and washing his hands his eyes were below the mirror line and he didnt realize bosch was behind him bosch stood still and waited for the moment thinking about what he would say when he and jessup locked eyes but just as jessup raised his head and saw bosch in the mirror the door to a stall to the left opened and juror number ten stepped out it was an awkward moment as all three men said nothing finally jessup grabbed a paper towel out of the dispenser dried his hands and tossed it into the wastebasket he headed to the door while the juror took his place at the sink bosch moved silently to a urinal but looked back at jessup as he was pushing through the door bosch shot him in the back with his finger jessup never saw it coming tuesday april pm during the break i checked on my next witness and made sure she was good to go i had a few spare minutes so i tracked bosch down in the line at the coffee concession one floor down juror number six was two spots in front of him i took bosch by the elbow and led him away you can get your coffee later theres no time to drink it anyway i wanted you to know that i had lunch with your girlfriend from the bureau what who agent walling shes not my girlfriend why did she have lunch with you i led him to the stairwell and we headed back upstairs as we talked well i think she wanted to have lunch with you but you split out of here too fast so she settled for me she wanted to give us a warning she said shes been watching and reading the reports on the trial and she thinks if jessup is going to blow its going to be soon she said he reacts to pressure and hes probably never been under more than he is right now bosch nodded thats sort of what i wanted to talk to you about before he looked around to make sure that no one was in earshot the sis says jessups nighttime activities have increased since the start of the trial hes going out every night now has he gone down your street no he hasnt been back there or to any of the other spots off mulholland in a week but over the last two nights hes done things that are new like what harry like on sunday they followed him down the beach from venice and he went into the old storage area under the santa monica pier what storage area whats this mean its an old city storage facility but it got flooded by high tides so many times its locked up and abandoned jessup dug underneath one of the old wood sidings and crawled in why who knows they couldnt go in or they would risk exposing the surveillance but thats not the real news the real news is last night he met with a couple of guys at the townhouse in venice and then went out to a car in one of the beach lots one of the guys took something wrapped in a towel out of the trunk and gave it to him a gun bosch shrugged whatever it was they never saw but through the cars plates they ided one of the two guys marshall daniels he was in san quentin in the ninetiessame time as jessup i was now catching some of the tension and urgency that was coming off bosch they couldve known each other what was daniels up there for drugs and weapons i checked my watch i needed to be back in court then we have to assume jessup has a weapon we could violate his or right now for associating with a convicted felon do they have pictures of jessup and daniels together they have photos but i am not sure we want to do that if hes got a gun do you trust the sis to stop him before he makes a move or does some damage i do but it would help if we knew what the move was we stepped out into the hallway and saw no sign of any jurors or anyone else from the trial everybody was back in court but me well talk about this later i have to get back into court or the judge will jump on my ass next im not like royce i cant afford a contempt hearing just to make a point with the jury go get atwater and bring her in i hurried back to department and rudely pushed around a couple of the courthouse gadflies who were moving slowly through the door judge breitman had not waited for me i saw everyone but me in place and the jury was being seated i moved up the aisle and through the gate and slipped into the seat next to maggie that was close she whispered i think the judge was hoping to even things up by holding you in contempt yeah well she may still the judge turned away from the jurors and noticed me at the prosecution table well thank you for joining us this afternoon mr haller did you have a nice excursion i stood my apologies your honor i had a personal matter come up and it took far longer than i expected it would she opened her mouth to deliver a rebuke but then paused as she realized i had thrown her words from the mornings delayher delayright back at her just call your next witness counselor she said curtly i called lisa atwater to the stand and glanced to the back of the courtroom to see bosch leading the dna lab technician down the aisle to the gate i checked the clock up on the rear wall my goal was to use up the rest of the day with atwaters testimony bringing her to the nuts and bolts just before we recessed for the day that might give royce a whole night to prepare his crossexamination but i would happily trade that for what i would get out of the dealevery juror going home with knowledge of the unimpeachable evidence that linked jason jessup to the murder of melissa landy as i had asked her to atwater had kept her lab coat on when she walked over from the lapd lab the light blue jacket gave her a look of competence and professionalism that the rest of her didnt convey atwater was very youngonly thirtyoneand had blond hair with a pink stripe down one side modeling her look after a supercool lab tech on one of the tv crime shows after meeting her for the first time i tried to get her to think about losing the pink but she told me she wouldnt give up her individuality the jurors she said would have to accept her for who and what she was at least the lab coat wasnt pink atwater identified herself and was sworn in after she took the witness seat i started asking questions about her educational pedigree and work experience i spent at least ten more minutes on this than i normally would have but i kept seeing that ribbon of pink hair and thought i had to do all i could to turn it into a badge of professionalism and accomplishment finally i got to the crux of her testimony with me carefully asking the questions she testified that she had conducted dna typing and comparison on two completely different evidence samples from the landy case i went with the more problematic analysis first ms atwater can you describe the first dna assignment you received on the landy case yes on february fourth i was given a swatch of fabric that had been cut from the dress that the victim had been wearing at the time of her murder where did you receive this from it came from the lapds property division where it had been kept in controlled evidence storage her answers were carefully rehearsed she could give no indication that there had been a previous trial in the case or that jessup had been in prison for the past twentyfour years to do so would create prejudice against jessup and trigger a mistrial why were you sent this swatch of fabric there was a stain on the fabric that twentyfour years ago had been identified by the lapd forensics unit as semen my assignment was to extract dna and identify it if possible when you examined this swatch was there any degradation of the genetic material on it no sir it had been properly preserved okay so you got this swatch of material from melissa landys dress and you extracted dna from it do i have that right so far thats right what did you do next i turned the dna profile into a code and entered it into the codis database what is codis its the fbis combined dna index system think of it as a national clearinghouse of dna records all dna signatures gathered by law enforcement end up here and are available for comparison so you entered the dna signature obtained from semen on the dress melissa landy wore on the day she was murdered correct correct did you get a hit i did the profile belonged to her stepfather kensington landy a courtroom is a big space there is always a lowlevel current of sound and energy you can feel it even if you cant really hear it people whisper in the gallery the clerk and deputy handle phone calls the court reporter touches the keys on her steno machine but the sound and air went completely out of department after lisa atwater said what she said i let it ride for a few moments i knew this would be the lowest point of the case with that one answer i had in fact revealed jason jessups case but from this point on it would all be my case and melissa landys case i wouldnt forget about her why was kensington landys dna in the codis database i asked because california has a law that requires all felony arrest suspects to submit a dna sample in two thousand four mr landy was arrested for a hitandrun accident causing injury though he eventually pleaded to lesser charges it was originally charged as a felony thus triggering the dna law upon his booking his dna was entered into the system okay now getting back to the victims dress and the semen that was on it how did you determine that the semen was deposited on the day that melissa landy was murdered atwater seemed confused by the question at first it was a skilled act i didnt she said it is impossible to know exactly when that deposit was made you mean it could have been on the dress for a week before her death yes theres no way of knowing what about a month its possible because there is what about a year again it is objection royce stood about time i thought your honor how long does this have to go on past the point withdrawn judge mr royce is right were well past the point i paused for a moment to underline that atwater and i would now be moving in a new direction ms atwater you recently handled a second dna analysis in regard to the melissa landy case correct yes i did can you describe what that entailed before answering she secured the pink band of hair behind her ear yes it was a dna extraction and comparison of hair specimens hair from the victim melissa landy which was contained in a kit taken at the time of her autopsy and hair recovered from a tow truck operated by the defendant jason jessup how many hair specimens are we talking about ultimately one of each our objective was to extract nuclear dna which is available only in the root of a hair sample of the specimens we had there was only one suitable extraction from the hairs recovered from the tow truck so we compared dna from the root of that hair to dna from a hair sample taken from the autopsy kit i walked her through the process trying to keep the explanations as simple as possible just enough to get by like on tv i kept one eye on my witness and one on the jury box making sure everybody was staying plugged in and happy finally we came out the other end of the technogenetic tunnel and arrived at lisa atwaters conclusions she put several colorcoded charts and graphs up on the screens and thoroughly explained them but the bottom line was always the same thing to feel it jurors had to hear it the most important thing a witness brings into a courtroom is her word after all the charts were displayed it came down to atwaters words i turned and looked back at the clock i was right on schedule in less than twenty minutes the judge would recess for the evening i turned back and moved in for the kill ms atwater do you have any hesitation or doubt at all about the genetic match you have just testified about no none whatsoever do you believe beyond a doubt that the hair from melissa landy is a unique match to the hair specimen obtained from the tow truck the defendant was operating on february sixteenth nineteen eightysix yes i do is there a quantifiable way of illustrating this match yes as i illustrated earlier we matched nine out of the thirteen genetic markers in the codis protocol the combination of these nine particular genetic markers occurs in one in onepointsix trillion individuals are you saying it is a oneinonepointsixtrillion chance that the hair found in the tow truck operated by the defendant belonged to someone other than melissa landy you could say it that way yes ms atwater do you happen to know the current population of the world its approaching seven billion thank you ms atwater i have no further questions at this time i moved to my seat and sat down immediately i started stacking files and documents getting it all ready for the briefcase and the ride home this day was in the books and i had a long night ahead of me preparing for the next one the judge didnt seem to begrudge me finishing ten minutes early she was shutting down herself and sending the jury home we will continue with the crossexamination of this witness tomorrow i would like to thank all of you for paying such close attention to todays testimony we will be adjourned until nine oclock sharp tomorrow morning and i once again admonish you not to watch any news program or your honor i looked up from the files royce was on his feet yes mr royce my apologies judge breitman for interrupting but by my watch it is only fourfifty and i know that you prefer to get as much testimony as possible in each day i would like to crossexamine this witness now the judge looked at atwater who was still on the witness stand and then back to royce mr royce i would rather you begin your cross tomorrow morning rather than start and then interrupt it after only ten minutes we dont go past five oclock with the jury that is a rule i will not break i understand judge but i am not planning to interrupt it i will be finished with this witness by five oclock and then she will not be required to return tomorrow the judge stared at royce for a long moment a disbelieving look on her face mr royce ms atwater is one of the prosecutions key witnesses are you telling me you only need five minutes for crossexamination well of course it depends on the length of her answers but i have only a few questions your honor very well then you may proceed ms atwater you remain under oath royce moved to the lectern and i was as confused as the judge about the defenses maneuver i had expected royce to take most of the next morning on cross this had to be a trick he had a dna expert on his own witness list but i would never give up a shot at the prosecutions witness ms atwater royce said did all of the testing and typing and extracting you conducted on the hair specimen from the tow truck tell you how the specimen got inside that truck to buy time atwater asked royce to repeat the question but even upon hearing it a second time she did not answer until the judge intervened ms atwater can you answer the question breitman asked uh yes im sorry my answer is no the lab work i conducted had nothing to do with determining how the hair specimen found its way into the tow truck that was not my responsibility thank you royce said so to make it crystal clear you cannot tell the jury how that hairwhich you have capably identified as belonging to the victimgot inside the truck or who put it there isnt that right i stood objection assumes facts not in evidence sustained would you like to rephrase mr royce thank you your honor ms atwater you have no ideaother than what you were perhaps toldhow the hair you tested found its way into the tow truck correct that would be correct yes so you can identify the hair as melissa landys but you cannot testify with the same sureness as to how it ended up in the tow truck correct i stood up again objection i said asked and answered i think i will let the witness answer breitman said ms atwater yes that is correct atwater said i cannot testify about anything regarding how the hair happened to end up in the truck then i have no further questions thank you i turned back and looked at the clock i had two minutes if i wanted to get the jury back on track i had to think of something quick any redirect mr haller the judge asked one moment your honor i turned and leaned toward maggie to whisper what do i do nothing she whispered back let it go or you might make it worse you made your points he made his yours are more importantyou put melissa inside his truck leave it there something told me not to leave it as is but my mind was a blank i couldnt think of a question derived from royces cross that would get the jury off his point and back onto mine mr haller the judge said impatiently i gave it up no further questions at this time your honor very well then we will adjourn for the day court will reconvene at nine am tomorrow and i admonish the jurors not to read newspaper accounts about this trial or view television reports or talk to family or friends about the case i hope everyone has a good night with that the jury stood and began to file out of the box i casually glanced over at the defense table and saw royce being congratulated by jessup they were all smiles i felt a hollow in my stomach the size of a baseball it was as though i had played it to near perfection all day longfor almost six hours of testimonyand then in the last five minutes managed to let the last out in the ninth go right between my legs i sat still and waited until royce and jessup and everybody else had left the courtroom you coming maggie said from behind me in a minute how about i meet you back at the office lets walk back together im not good company mags haller get over it you had a great day we had a great day he was good for five minutes and the jury knows that okay ill meet you there in a little bit she gave up and i heard her leave after a few minutes i reached over to the top file on the stack in front of me and opened it up halfway a school photo of melissa landy was clipped inside the folder smiling at the camera she looked nothing like my daughter but she made me think of hayley i made a silent vow not to let royce outsmart me again a few moments later someone turned out the lights tuesday april pm bosch stood by the swing set planted in the sand a quarter mile south of the santa monica pier the black water of the pacific to his left was alive with the dancing reflection of light and color from the ferris wheel at the end of the boardwalk the amusement park had closed fifteen minutes earlier but the light show would go on through the night an electronic display of everchanging patterns on the big wheel that was mesmerizing in the cold darkness harry raised his phone and called the sis dispatcher he had checked in earlier and set things up its bosch again hows our boy he appears to be tucked in for the night you mustve worn him out in court today bosch on the way home from the ccb he went to ralphs to pick up some groceries and then straight home where hes been ever since first night in five he hasnt been out and about at this time yeah well dont count on it staying that way theyve got the back door covered right and the windows and the car and the bicycle we got him detective dont worry then i wont youve got my number call me if he moves will do bosch put the phone away and headed toward the pier the wind was strong off the water and a fine mist of sand stung his face and eyes as he approached the huge structure the pier was like a beached aircraft carrier it was long and wide it had a large parking lot and an assortment of restaurants and souvenir shops on top at its midpoint it had a full amusement park with a roller coaster and the signature ferris wheel and at its furthest extension into the sea it was a traditional fishing pier with a bait shop management office and yet another restaurant all of it was supported on a thick forest of wood pilings that started landside and carried seven hundred feet out beyond the wave break and to the cold depths landside the pilings were enclosed with a wooden siding that created a semisecure storage facility for the city of santa monica only semisecure for two reasons the storage area was vulnerable to extreme high tides which came on rare occasion during offshore earthquakes also the pier spanned a hundred yards of beach which entailed anchoring the wood siding in moist sand the wood was always in the process of rotting and was easily compromised the result was that the storage facility had become an unofficial homeless shelter that had to be periodically cleared out by the city the sis observers had reported that jason jessup had slipped underneath the south wall the night before and had spent thirtyone minutes inside the storage area bosch reached the pier and started walking its length looking for the spot in the wood siding where jessup had crawled under he carried a mini maglite and quickly found a depression where the sand had been dug out at the walls base and partially filled back in he crouched down put the light into the hole and determined that it was too small for him to fit through he put the light down to the side reached down and started digging like a dog trying to escape the yard soon the hole seemed big enough and he crawled through he was dressed for the effort old black jeans and work boots and a longsleeved tshirt beneath a plastic raid jacket he wore inside out to hide the luminescent yellow lapd across the front and back he came up inside to a dark cavernous space with slashes of light filtering down between the planks of the parking lot above he stood up and brushed the sand off his clothes then swept the area with the flashlight it had been made for closein work so its beam did little to illuminate the far reaches of the space there was a damp smell and the sound of waves crashing through the pilings only twentyfive yards away echoed loudly in the enclosed space bosch pointed the light up and saw fungus caked on the piers crossbeams he moved forward into the gloom and quickly came upon a boat covered by a tarp he lifted up a loose end and saw that it was an old lifeguard boat he moved on and came upon stacks of buoys and then stacks of traffic barricades and mobile barriers all of them stenciled with city of santa monica he next came to three stacks of scaffolding used for paint and repair projects on the pier they looked long untouched and were slowly sinking in the sand across the rear was a line of enclosed storage rooms but the wood sidings had cracked and split over time making storage in them porous at best the doors were unlocked and bosch went down the line finding each one empty until the second to the last here the door was secured with a shiny new padlock he put the beam of his light into one of the cracks between the planks of the siding and tried to look in he saw what appeared to be the edge of a blanket but that was all bosch moved back to the door and knelt down in front of the lock he held the light with his mouth and extracted two lock picks from his wallet he went to work on the padlock and quickly determined that it had only four tumblers he got it open in less than five minutes he entered the storage corral and found it largely empty there was a folded blanket on the ground with a pillow on top of it nothing else the sis surveillance report had said that the night before jessup had walked down the beach carrying a blanket it did not say that he had left it behind under the pier and there had been nothing in the report about a pillow harry wasnt even sure he was in the same spot that jessup had come to he moved the light over the wall and then up to the underside of the pier where he held it he could clearly see the outline of a door a trapdoor it was locked from underneath with another new padlock bosch was pretty sure that he was standing beneath the piers parking lot he had occasionally heard the sound of vehicles up above as the pier crowd went home he guessed that the trapdoor had been used as some sort of loading door for materials to be stored he knew he could grab one of the scaffolds and climb up to examine the second lock but decided not to bother he retreated from the corral as he was relocking the door with the padlock he felt his phone begin to vibrate in his pocket he quickly pulled it out expecting to learn from sis dispatch that jessup was on the move but the caller id told him the call was from his daughter he opened the phone hey maddie dad are you there her voice was low and the sound of crashing waves was loud bosch yelled im here whats wrong well when are you coming home soon baby ive got a little bit more work to do she dropped her voice even lower and bosch had to clamp a hand over his other ear to hear her in the background he could hear the freeway on her end he knew she was on the rear deck dad shes making me do homework that isnt even due until next week bosch had once again left her with sue bambrough the assistant principal so next week youll be thanking her when everybody else is doing it and youll be all done dad ive been doing homework all night you want me to tell her to let you take a break his daughter didnt respond and bosch understood she had called because she wanted him to know the misery she was suffering but she didnt want him to do anything about it ill tell you what he said when i get back i will remind mrs bambrough that you are not in school when you are at home and you dont need to be working the whole time okay i guess why cant i just stay at rorys this isnt fair maybe next time i need to get back to work mads can we talk about it tomorrow i want you in bed by the time i get home whatever good night madeline make sure all the doors are locked including on the deck and ill see you tomorrow good night the disapproval in her voice was hard to miss she disconnected the call ahead of bosch he closed his phone and just as he slid it into his pocket he heard a noise like a banging of metal parts coming from the direction of the hole he had slid through into the storage area he immediately killed his flashlight and moved toward the tarp that covered the boat crouching behind the boat he saw a human figure stand up by the wall and start moving in the darkness without a flashlight the figure moved without hesitation toward the storage corral with the new lock on it there were streetlights over the parking lot above they sent slivers of illumination down through the cracks formed by retreating planks in the boardwalk as the figure moved through these bosch saw that it was jessup harry dropped lower and instinctively reached his hand to his belt just to make sure his gun was there with his other hand he pulled his phone and hit the mute button he didnt want the sis dispatcher to suddenly remember to call him to alert him that jessup was moving bosch noticed that jessup was carrying a bag that appeared to be heavily weighted he went directly to the locked storage room and soon swung the door open he obviously had a key to the padlock jessup stepped back and bosch saw a slash of light cross his face as he turned and scanned the entire storage area making sure he was alone he then went inside the room for several seconds there was no sound or movement then jessup reappeared in the doorway he stepped out and closed the door relocking it he then stepped back into the light and did a degree scan of the larger storage area bosch lowered his body even further he guessed that jessup was suspicious because he had found the hole under the wall freshly dug out whos there he called out bosch didnt move he didnt even breathe show yourself bosch snaked his hand under the raid jacket and closed his hand on his guns grips he knew the indications were that jessup had obtained a weapon if he made even a feint in boschs direction harry was going to pull his own weapon and be ready to fire first but it never happened jessup started moving quickly back to the entrance hole and soon he disappeared in the darkness bosch listened but all he could hear was the crashing of the waves he waited another thirty seconds and then started moving toward the opening in the wall he didnt turn on the light he wasnt sure jessup had actually left as he moved around the stack of scaffolding frames he banged his shin hard on a metal pipe that was extending out from the pile it sent a sudden burst of pain up his left leg and shifted the balance of metal frames the top two loudly slid off stack clattering to the sand bosch threw himself to the sand next to the pile and waited but jessup didnt appear he was gone bosch slowly got up he was in pain and he was angry he pulled his phone and called sis dispatch you were supposed to call me when jessup moved he whispered angrily i know that said the dispatcher he hasnt moved what are youpatch me through to whoevers in charge out there im sorry detective but thats not how look shithead jessup is not tucked in for the night i just saw him and it almost turned bad now let me talk to somebody out there or my next call is to lieutenant wright at home while he waited bosch moved to the sidewall so he could get out of the storage area his leg hurt badly and he was walking with a limp in the darkness he couldnt find the spot where he could slip under the wall finally he put the light on holding it low to the ground he found the spot but saw that jessup had pushed sand into the hole just as he had the night before a voice finally came to him over the phone bosch this is jacquez you claim you just saw our subject i dont claim i saw him i did see him where are your people were sitting on his zero man he hasnt left zero was a surveillance subjects home location bullshit i just saw him under the santa monica pier get your people up here now we got his zero down tight bosch theres no listen jackass jessup is my case i know him and he almost just crawled up my ass now call your men and find out which one went off post because ill get back to you jacquez said curtly and the line went dead bosch turned the phones ringer back on and put it in his pocket once again he dropped to his knees and quickly dug out the hole using his hands as a scoop he then pushed his body through half expecting jessup to be waiting for him when he came up on the other side but there was no sign of him bosch got up gazed south down the beach in the direction of venice and saw no one in the light from the ferris wheel he then turned and looked up toward the hotels and apartment buildings that ran along the beach several people were on the beach walk that fronted the buildings but he didnt recognize any of the figures as jessup twentyfive yards up the pier was a set of stairs leading topside and directly to the piers parking lot bosch headed that way still limping badly he was halfway up the stairs when his phone rang it was jacquez all right where is he were on our way thats the thing i lost him i had to hide and i thought you people were on him im going to the top of the pier now what the hell happened jacquez we had a guy step out to drop a deuce said his stomach was giving him trouble i dont think hell be in the unit after tonight jesus christ bosch got to the top of the steps and walked out onto the empty parking lot there was no sign of jessup okay im up on the pier i dont see him hes in the wind okay bosch were two minutes out were going to spread well find him he didnt take the car or the bike so hes on foot he couldve grabbed a cab at any one of the hotels over here the bottom line is we dont know where bosch suddenly realized something i gotta go call me as soon as you have him jacquez you got that got it bosch ended the call and then immediately called his home on the speed dial he checked his watch and expected sue bambrough to answer since it was after eleven but his daughter picked up the call dad hey baby why are you still up because i had to do all that homework i wanted a little break before i went to sleep thats fine listen can you put mrs bambrough on the line dad im in my bedroom and im in my pajamas thats okay just go to the door and tell her to pick up the phone in the kitchen i need to talk to her and meantime you have to get dressed youre leaving the house what dad i have madeline listen to me this is important i am going to tell mrs bambrough to take you to her house until i can get there i want you out of the house why you dont need to know that you just need to do what i ask now please get mrs bambrough on the phone she didnt respond but he heard the door of her room open then he heard his daughter say its for you a few moments later the extension was picked up in the kitchen hello sue its harry i need you to do something i need you to take maddie to your house right now i will be there in less than an hour to get her i dont understand sue listen weve been watching a guy tonight who knows where i live and we lost him now there is no reason to panic or to believe he is heading that way but i want to take all precautions so i want you to take maddie and get out of the house right now go to your place and i will see you there can you do this sue were leaving right now he liked the strength in her voice and realized it probably came with the territory of being a teacher and assistant principal in the public school system okay im on my way call me back as soon as you get to your place but bosch wasnt really on his way after the call he put the phone away and went back down the steps to the beach he returned to the hole he had dug under the storage area wall he crawled back under and this time used his flashlight to find his way to the locked storage room he used his picks again on the padlock and the whole time he worked he was distracted by thoughts of jessups escape from the surveillance had it just been a coincidence that he had left his apartment at the same time the sis watcher had left his post or was he aware of the surveillance and did he break free when he saw the opportunity at the moment there was no way to know finally he got the lock open taking longer than he had the first time he entered the storage room and moved the light to the blanket and pillow on the ground the bag jessup had carried was there it said ralphs on its side bosch dropped to his knees and was about to open it when his phone buzzed it was jacquez we got him hes on nielson at ocean park it looks like hes walking home then try not to lose him this time jacquez i gotta go he disconnected before jacquez could reply he quickly called his daughters cell she was in the car with sue bambrough bosch told her they could turn around and go back home this news was not received with a thankful release of tension his daughter was left upset and angry over the scare bosch couldnt blame her but he couldnt stay on the line ill be home in less than an hour we can talk about it then if youre still awake ill see you soon he disconnected the call and focused on the bag he opened it without moving it from its spot next to the blanket the bag contained a dozen singleservingsize cans of fruit there were diced peaches in heavy syrup chopped pineapple and something called fruit medley also in the bag was a package of plastic spoons bosch stared at the contents for a long moment and then his eyes moved up the wall to the crossbeams and the locked trapdoor above who are you bringing here jessup he whispered wednesday april pm all eyes were on the back of the courtroom it was time for the main event and while i had ringside seats i was still going to be just a spectator like everybody else that didnt sit very well with me but it was a choice i could live with and trust the door opened and harry bosch led our main witness into the courtroom sarah ann gleason told us she didnt own any dresses and didnt want to buy one to testify in she wore black jeans and a purple silk blouse she looked pretty and she looked confident we didnt need a dress bosch stayed on her right side and when opening the gate for her positioned his body between her and jessup who sat at the defense table turned like everybody else toward his main accusers entrance bosch let her go the rest of the way by herself maggie mcfierce was already at the lectern and she smiled warmly at her witness as she went by this was maggies moment too and i read her smile as one of hope for both women wed had a good morning with testimony from bill clinton the former tow truck driver and then bosch taking the case through to lunch clinton told his story about the day of the murder and jessup borrowing his dodgers cap just before they became part of the impromptu lineup outside the house on windsor boulevard he also testified to the aardvark drivers frequent use of and familiarity with the parking lot behind the el rey theatre and jessups claim to windsor boulevard on the morning of the murder these were good solid points for the prosecution and clinton gave no quarter to royce on cross then bosch took the stand for a third time in the trial rather than read previous testimony this time he testified about his own recent investigation of the case and produced the dodgers capwith the initials bc under the brimfrom property that had been seized from jessup during his arrest twentyfour years earlier we were forced to dance around the fact that the hat as well as jessups other belongings had been in the property room at san quentin for the past twentyfour years to bring that information out would be to reveal that jessup had previously been convicted of melissa landys murder and now sarah gleason would be the prosecutions final witness through her the case would come together in the emotional crescendo i was counting on one sister standing for a longlost sister i leaned back in my seat to watch my exwifethe best prosecutor i had ever encounteredtake us home gleason was sworn in and then took her seat on the stand she was small and required the microphone to be lowered by the courtroom deputy maggie cleared her voice and began good morning ms gleason how are you today im doing pretty good can you please tell the jury a little bit about yourself um im thirtyseven years old not married i live in port townsend washington and ive been there about seven years now what do you do for a living im a glass artist and what was your relationship to melissa landy she was my younger sister how much younger was she than you thirteen months maggie put a photograph of the two sisters up on the overhead screen as a prosecution exhibit it showed two smiling girls standing in front of a christmas tree can you identify this photo that was me and melissa at the last christmas right before she was taken so that would be christmas nineteen eightyfive yes i notice that she and you are about the same size yes she wasnt really my little sister anymore she had caught up to me did you share the same clothes we shared some things but we also had our favorite things that we didnt share that could cause a fight she smiled and maggie nodded that she understood now you said she was taken were you referring to february sixteenth of the following year the date of your sisters abduction and murder yes i was okay sarah i know it will be difficult for you but i would like you to tell the jury what you saw and did on that day gleason nodded as if steeling herself for what was ahead i checked the jury and saw every eye holding on her i then turned and glanced at the defense table and locked eyes with jessup i did not look away i held his defiant stare and tried to send back my own message that two womenone asking the questions the other answering themwere going to take him down finally it was jessup who looked away well it was a sunday gleason said we were going to go to church my whole family melissa and i were in our dresses so my mother told us to go out front why couldnt you use the backyard my stepfather was building a pool and there was a lot of mud in the back and a big hole my mother was worried we might fall down and get our dresses dirty so you went out to the front yard yes and where were your parents at this time sarah my mother was still upstairs getting ready and my stepfather was in the tv room he was watching sports where was the tv room in the house in the back next to the kitchen okay sarah i am going to show you a photo called peoples prosecution exhibit eleven is this the front of the house where you lived on windsor boulevard all eyes went to the overhead screen the yellowbrick house spread across the screen it was a long shot from the street showing a deep front yard with tenfoot hedges running down both sides there was a front porch that ran the width of the house and that was largely hidden behind ornamental vegetation there was a paved walkway extending from the sidewalk across the lawn and to the steps of the front porch i had reviewed our photo exhibits several times in preparation for the trial but for the first time i noticed that the walkway had a crack running down the center of its entire length from sidewalk to front steps it somehow seemed appropriate considering what had happened at the home yes that was our house tell us what happened that day in the front yard sarah well we decided to play hideandseek while we waited for our parents i was it first and i found melissa hiding behind that bush on the right side of the porch she pointed to the exhibit photo that was still on the screen i realized we had forgotten to give gleason the laser pointer we had prepared her testimony with i quickly opened maggies briefcase and found it i stood and handed it to her with the judges permission she gave it to the witness okay sarah could you use the laser to show us maggie asked gleason moved the red laser dot in a circle around a thick bush at the north corner of the front porch so she hid there and you found her yes and then when it was her turn to be it i decided to hide in the same spot because i didnt think she would look there at first when she was finished counting she came down the steps and stood in the middle of the yard you could see her from your hiding place yes through the bush i could see her she was sort of turning in a half circle looking for me then what happened well first i heard a truck go by and let me just stop you right there sarah you say you heard a truck you didnt see it no not from where i was hiding how do you know that it was a truck it was very loud and heavy i could feel it in the ground like a little earthquake okay what happened after you heard the truck suddenly i saw a man in the yard and he went right up to my sister and grabbed her by her wrist gleason cast her eyes down and held her hands together on the dais in front of her seat sarah did you know this man no i did not had you ever seen him before no i had not did he say anything yes i heard him say you have to come with me and my sister said she said are you sure and that was it i think he said something else but i didnt hear it he led her away to the street and you stayed in hiding yes i couldnt for some reason i couldnt move i couldnt call for help i couldnt do anything i was very scared it was one of those solemn moments in the courtroom when there was absolute silence except for the voices of the prosecutor and the witness did you see or hear anything else sarah i heard a door close and then i heard the truck drive away i saw the tears on sarah gleasons cheeks i thought the courtroom deputy had noticed as well because he took a box of tissues from a drawer in his desk and crossed the courtroom with them but instead of taking them to sarah he handed the box to juror number two who had tears on her cheeks as well this was okay with me i wanted the tears to stay on sarahs face sarah how long was it before you came out from behind the bush where you were hiding and told your parents that your sister had been taken i think it was less than a minute but it was too late she was gone the silence that followed that statement was the kind of void that lives can disappear into forever maggie spent the next half hour walking gleason through her memory of what came after her stepfathers desperate call to the police the interview she gave to the detectives and then the lineup she viewed from her bedroom window and her identifying jason jessup as the man she saw lead her sister away maggie had to be very careful here we had used sworn testimony of witnesses from the first trial the record of that entire trial was available to royce as well and i knew without a doubt that he had his assistant counsel who was sitting on the other side of jessup comparing everything sarah gleason was saying now with the testimony she gave at the first trial if she changed one nuance of her story royce would be all over her on it during his crossexamination using the discrepancy to try to cast her as a liar to me the testimony came off as fresh and not rehearsed this was a testament to the prep work of the two women maggie smoothly and efficiently brought her witness to the vital moment when sarah reconfirmed her identification of jessup was there any doubt at all in your mind when you identified jason jessup in nineteen eightysix as the man who took your sister no none at all it has been a long time sarah but i ask you to look around the courtroom and tell the jury whether you see the man who abducted your sister on february sixteenth nineteen eightysix yes him she spoke without hesitation and pointed her finger at jessup would you tell us where he is seated and describe an article of clothing he is wearing hes sitting next to mr royce and he has a dark blue tie and a light blue shirt i paused and looked at judge breitman let the record show that the witness has identified the defendant she said i went right back to sarah after all these years do you have any doubt that he is the man who took your sister none at all maggie turned and looked at the judge your honor it may be a bit early but i think now would be a good time to take the afternoon break i am going to go in a different direction with this witness at this point very well breitman said we will adjourn for fifteen minutes and i will expect to see everyone back here at twothirtyfive thank you sarah said she wanted to use the restroom and left the courtroom with bosch running interference and making sure she would not cross paths with jessup in the hallway maggie sat down at the defense table and we huddled you have em maggie this is what theyve been waiting all week to hear and its better than they thought it was going to be she knew i was talking about the jury she didnt need my approval or encouragement but i had to give it now comes the hard part she said i hope she holds up shes doing great and im sure harrys telling her that right now maggie didnt respond she started flipping through the legal pad that had her notes and the rough script of the examination soon she was immersed in the next hours work wednesday april pm bosch had to shoo away the reporters when sarah gleason came out of the restroom using his body as a shield against the cameras he walked her back to the courtroom sarah youre doing really well he said you keep it up and this guys going right back to where he belongs thanks but that was the easy part its going to get hard now dont kid yourself sarah there is no easy part just keep thinking about your sister melissa somebody has to stand up for her and right now thats you as they got to the courtroom door he realized that she had smoked a cigarette in the restroom he could smell it on her inside he walked her down the center aisle and delivered her to maggie mcfierce who was waiting at the gate bosch gave the prosecutor the nod she was doing really well herself finish the job he said we will maggie said after passing the witness off bosch doubled back up the center aisle to the sixth row he had spotted rachel walling sitting in the middle of the row he now squeezed around several reporters and observers to get to her the space next to her was open and he sat down harry rachel i think the man who was in that space was planning on coming back thats okay once court starts i have to move back up you shouldve told me you were coming mickey said you were here the other day when i have some time i like to come by its a fascinating case so far well lets hope the jury thinks its more than fascinating i want this guy back in san quentin so bad i can taste it mickey told me jessup was moonlighting is that still she lowered her voice to a whisper when she saw jessup walking down the aisle and back to his seat at the defense table happening bosch matched her whisper yeah and last night it almost went completely south on us the sis lost him oh no the judges door opened and she stepped out and headed up to the bench everyone stood bosch knew he had to get back to the prosecution table in case he was needed but i found him he whispered i have to go but are you sticking around this afternoon no i have to go back to the office im just on a break right now okay rachel thanks for coming by ill talk to you as people started sitting back down he worked his way out of the row and then quickly went back down the aisle and through the gate to take a seat in the row of chairs directly behind the prosecution table mcpherson continued her direct examination of sarah ann gleason bosch thought that both prosecutor and witness had been doing an exceptional job so far but he also knew that they were moving into new territory now and soon everything said before wouldnt matter if what was said now wasnt delivered in a believable and unassailable fashion sarah mcpherson began when did your mother marry kensington landy when i was six did you like ken landy no not really at first things were okay but then everything changed you in fact attempted to run away from home just a few months before your sisters death isnt that right yes i show you peoples exhibit twelve a police report dated november thirtieth nineteen eightyfive can you tell the jury what that is mcpherson delivered copies of the report to the witness the judge and the defense table bosch had found the report during his record search on the case it had been a lucky break its a missing persons report gleason said my mother reported me missing and did the police find you no i just came home i didnt have anyplace to go why did you run away sarah because my stepfather was having sex with me mcpherson nodded and let the answer hang out there in the courtroom for a long moment three days ago bosch would have expected royce to jump all over this part of the testimony but now he knew that this played to the defenses case as well kensington landy was the straw man and any testimony that supported that would be welcomed when did this start mcpherson finally asked the summer before i ran away gleason responded the summer before melissa got taken sarah i am sorry to put you through these bad memories you testified earlier that you and melissa shared some of each others clothes correct yes the dress she wore on the day she was taken that was your dress wasnt it yes mcpherson then introduced the dress as the states next exhibit and bosch set it up for display to the jury on a headless manikin he placed in front of the jury box is this the dress sarah yes it is now you notice that there is a square of material removed from the bottom front hem of the dress you see that sarah yes do you know why that was removed yes because they found semen on the dress there you mean forensic investigators yes now is this something you knew back at the time of your sisters death i know it now i wasnt told about it back then do you know who the semen was genetically identified as belonging to yes i was told it came from my stepfather did that surprise you no unfortunately do you have any explanation for how it could have gotten on your dress now royce objected saying that the question called for speculation it also called for the witness to diverge from the defense theory but he didnt mention that breitman sustained the objection and mcpherson had to find another way of getting there sarah prior to your sister borrowing your dress on the morning she was abducted when was the last time you wore it royce stood and objected again same objection were speculating about events twentyfour years old and when this witness was only thirteen years old your honor mcpherson rejoined mr royce was fine with this socalled speculation when it fit with the defenses scheme of things but now he objects as we get to the heart of the matter this is not speculation ms gleason is testifying truthfully about the darkest saddest days of her life and i dont think objection overruled breitman said the witness may answer thank you your honor as mcpherson repeated the question bosch studied the jury he wanted to see if they saw what he sawa defense attorney attempting to stop the forward progression of truth bosch had found sarah gleasons testimony to be fully convincing up to this point he wanted to hear what she had to say and his hope was that the jury was in the same boat and would look unkindly upon defense efforts to stop her i wore it two nights before gleason said that would have been friday night the fourteenth valentines day yes why did you wear the dress my mother was making a nice dinner for valentines day and my stepfather said we should get dressed up for it gleason was looking down again losing all eye contact with the jurors did your stepfather engage in a sexual act with you on that night yes were you wearing the dress at the time yes sarah do you know if your father ejac he wasnt my father she yelled it and her voice echoed in the courtroom reverberating around a hundred people who now knew her darkest secret bosch looked at mcpherson and saw her checking out the jurys reaction it was then bosch knew that the mistake had been intentional i am sorry sarah i meant your stepfather do you know did he ejaculate in the course of this moment with you yes and some of it got on my dress mcpherson studied her notes flipping over several pages of her yellow pad she wanted that last answer to hang out there as long as possible sarah who did the laundry at your house a lady came her name was abby after that valentines day did you put your dress in the laundry no i didnt why not because i was afraid abby would find it and know what happened i thought she might tell my mother or call the police why would that have been a bad thing sarah i my mother was happy and i didnt want to ruin things for her so what did you do with the dress that night i cleaned off the spot and hung it in my closet i didnt know my sister was going to wear it so two days later when she wanted to put it on what did you say she already had it on when i saw her i told her that i wanted to wear it but she said it was too late because it wasnt on my list of clothes i didnt share with her could you see the stain on the dress no i looked and because it was down at the hem i didnt see any stain mcpherson paused again bosch knew from the prep work that she had covered all the points she wanted to in this line of questioning she had sufficiently explained the dna that was the cause of everyones being here she now had to take gleason further down the road of her dark journey because if she didnt royce certainly would sarah did your relationship with your stepfather change after your sisters death yes how so he never touched me again do you know why did you talk to him about it i dont know why i never talked to him about it it just never happened again and he tried to act like it had never happened in the first place but for you all of thisyour stepfather your sisters deathit took a toll didnt it yes in what way sarah uh well i started getting into drugs and i ran away again i ran away a lot actually i didnt care about sex it was something i used to get what i needed and were you ever arrested yes a bunch of times for what drugs mostly i got arrested once for soliciting an undercover too and for stealing you were arrested six times as a juvenile and five more times as an adult is that correct i didnt keep count what drugs were you taking crystal meth mostly but if there was something else available i would probably take it that was the way i was did you ever receive counseling and rehabilitation a lot of times it didnt work at first and then it did i got clean when was that about seven years ago when i was thirty youve been clean for seven years yes totally my life is different now i want to show you peoples exhibit thirteen which is an intake and evaluation form from a private rehab center in los angeles called the pines do you remember going there yes my mother sent me there when i was sixteen was that when you first started getting into trouble yes mcpherson distributed copies of the evaluation form to the judge clerk and defense table okay sarah i want to draw your attention to the paragraph i have outlined in yellow in the evaluation section of the intake form can you please read it out loud to the jury candidate reports ptsd in regard to the murder of her younger sister three years ago suffers unresolved guilt associated with murder and also evinces behavior typical of sexual abuse full psych and physical evaluation is recommended thank you sarah do you know what ptsd means posttraumatic stress disorder did you undergo these recommended evaluations at the pines yes did discussion of your stepfathers sexual abuse come up no because i lied how so by then id had sex with other men so i never mentioned my stepfather before revealing what you have today in court did you ever talk about your stepfather and his having sex with you with anyone just you and detective bosch nobody else have you been married yes more than once yes and you didnt even tell your husbands about this no its not the kind of thing you want to tell anybody you keep it to yourself thank you sarah i have no further questions mcpherson took her pad and returned to her seat where she was greeted with a squeeze on the arm by haller it was a gesture designed for the jury to see but by then all eyes were on royce it was his turn and boschs measure of the room was that sarah gleason had everybody riding with her any effort by royce to destroy her ran the strong risk of backfiring against his client royce did the smart thing he decided to let emotions cool for a night he stood and told the judge that he reserved the right to recall gleason as a witness during the defense phase of the trial in effect he put off her crossexamination he then retook his seat bosch checked his watch it was fourfifteen the judge told haller to call his next witness but bosch knew there were no more witnesses haller looked at mcpherson and in unison they nodded haller then stood up your honor he said the people rest wednesday april pm the prosecution team convened for dinner at casa haller i made a thick bolognese using a storebought sauce for a base and boiled a box of bow tie pasta maggie chipped in with her own recipe for caesar salad that i had always loved when we were married but hadnt had in years bosch and his daughter were the last to arrive as harry first took sarah ann gleason back to her hotel room following court and made sure she was secure for the night our daughters were shy upon meeting and embarrassed by how obvious their parents were about watching the longawaited moment they instinctively knew to move away from us and convened in the back office ostensibly to do their homework pretty soon after we started to hear laughter from down the hall i put the pasta and sauce into a big bowl and mixed it all together i then called the girls out first to serve themselves and take their dishes back to the office hows it going back there anyway i asked them while they were making their plates any homework getting done dad hayley said dismissively as if my question were a great invasion of privacy so i tried the cousin maddie um im almost finished with mine both girls looked at each other and laughed as if either the question or its answer were cause for great glee they scurried out of the kitchen then and back to the office i put everything out on the table where the adults were sitting the last thing i did was make sure the door to the office was closed so the girls would not hear our conversation and we would not hear theirs well i said as i passed the pasta to bosch were finished with our part now comes the hard part the defense maggie said what do we think they have in store for sarah i thought for a moment before answering and tried my first bow tie it was good i was proud of my dish we know theyll throw everything they can at her i finally said shes the case bosch reached inside his jacket and brought out a folded piece of paper he opened it on the table i could see that it was the defenses witness list at the end of court today royce told the judge he would complete the defenses case in one day he said he said hes calling only four witnesses but hes got twentythree listed on here well we knew all along that most of that list was subterfuge maggie said he was hiding his case okay so we have sarah coming back i said holding up one finger then we have jessup himself my guess is that royce knows he has to put him on thats two who else maggie waited until she finished a mouthful of food before speaking hey this is good haller when did you learn to make this its a little thing i like to call newmans own no you added to it you made it better how come you never cooked like this when we were married i guess it came out of necessity being a single father what about you harry what do you cook bosch looked at us both like we were crazy i can fry an egg he said thats about it lets get back to the trial maggie said i think royce has got jessup and sarah then i think hes got the secret witness we havent found the guy from the last rehab center edward roman bosch said right roman that makes three and the fourth one could be his investigator or maybe his meth expert but is probably just bullshit there is no fourth so much of what royce does is misdirection he doesnt want anybodys eyes on the prize wants them looking anywhere but right at the truth what about roman i said we havent found him but have we figured out his testimony not by a long shot maggie said ive gone over and over this with sarah and she has no idea what hes going to say she couldnt remember ever talking about her sister with him the summary royce provided in discovery says he will testify about sarahs revelations about her childhood bosch said nothing more specific than that and of course royce claims he didnt take any notes during the interview look i said we have his record and we know exactly what kind of guy were dealing with here hes going to say whatever royce wants him to say its that simple whatever works for the defense so we should be less concerned by what he saysbecause we know it will be liesand more concerned with knocking him out of the box what do we have that can help us there maggie and i both looked at bosch and he was ready for us i think i might have something im going to go see somebody tonight if it pans out well have it in the morning ill tell you then my frustrations with boschs methods of investigation and communication boiled over at that point harry come on were part of a team here this secret agent stuff doesnt really work when were in that courtroom every day with our asses on the line bosch looked down at his plate and i saw the slow burn his face grew as dark as the sauce your asses on the line he said i didnt see anywhere in the surveillance reports that jessup was hanging around outside your house haller so dont tell me about your ass being on the line your job is in that courtroom its nice and safe and sometimes you win and sometimes you lose but no matter what happens youre back in court the next day you want your ass on the line try working out there he pointed out the window toward the view of the city hey guys lets just calm down here maggie said quickly harry whats the matter has jessup gone back to woodrow wilson maybe we should just revoke this guy and put him back in lockup bosch shook his head not to my street he hasnt been back there since that first night and he hasnt been up to mulholland in more than a week then what is it bosch put his fork down and pushed his plate back we already know theres a good chance that jessup has a gun from that meeting the sis saw him have with a convicted gun dealer they didnt see what he got from the guy but since it came wrapped in a towel it doesnt take a lot to figure it out and then you want to know what happened last night some bright guy on the surveillance decides to leave his post to use the john without telling anybody and jessup walked right out of the net they lost him maggie asked yeah until i found him right before he found me which might not have turned out so well and you know what hes up to hes building a dungeon for somebody and for all i know he leaned forward over the table and finished in an urgent whisper might be for my kid whoa wait harry maggie said back up hes building a dungeon where under the pier theres like a storage room he put a lock on the door and dropped canned food off there last night like hes getting it ready for somebody okay thats scary maggie said but your daughter we dont know that you said he went by your place only the one time what makes you think because i cant afford not to think it you understand she nodded yes i do then i come back to what i just said we violate him for associating with a known criminalthe gun dealerand pull his or release theres only a few days left in the trial and he obviously didnt act out or make the mistake we thought he would lets be safe and put him back inside until this is over and what if we dont get the conviction bosch said what happens then this guy walks and thatll also be the end of the surveillance hell be out there without any eyes on him that brought a silence to the table i stared at bosch and understood the pressure he was under the case the threat to his daughter and no wife or exwife to help him out at home bosch finally broke the uneasy silence maggie are you taking hayley home with you tonight maggie nodded yes when were finished here can maddie stay with you two tonight she brought a change of clothes in her backpack id come by in the morning in time to take her to school the request seemed to take maggie by surprise especially since the girls had just met bosch pressed her i need to meet somebody tonight and i dont know where it will take me bosch said it might even lead to roman i need to be able to move without worrying about maddie she nodded okay thats fine it sounds like theyre becoming fast friends i just hope they dont stay up all night thank you maggie about thirty seconds of silence went by before i spoke tell us about this dungeon harry i was standing in it last night why the santa monica pier my guess is that its because of the proximity to whats on top of the pier prey bosch nodded but what about noise youre saying this place is directly below the pier there are ways of controlling human sound and last night the sound of waves crashing against the pilings under there was so loud you couldve screamed all night and nobody wouldve heard you you probably wouldnt even hear a gunshot from down there bosch spoke with a certain authority of the dark places of the world and the evil they held i lost my appetite then and pushed my plate away i felt dread come inside me dread for melissa landy and all the other victims in the world wednesday april pm gilbert and sullivan were waiting for him in a car parked on lankershim boulevard near its northern terminus at san fernando road it was a blighted area populated primarily with usedcar lots and repair shops in the midst of all of this lowrent industry was a rundown motel advertising rooms for fifty dollars a week the motel had no name on display just the lighted sign that said motel gilbert and sullivan were gilberto reyes and john sullivan a pair of narcs assigned to the valley enforcement team a streetlevel drug unit when bosch was looking for edward roman he put the word out in all such units in the department his assumption from romans record was that he had never gotten away from the life as sarah gleason had there had to be somebody in the departments narco units with a line on him it paid off with a call from reyes he and his partner didnt have a bead on roman but they knew him from past interactions on the street and knew where his current trick partner was holed up and apparently awaiting his return longterm drug addicts often partnered with a prostitute offering her protection in exchange for a share of the drugs her earnings bought bosch pulled his car up behind the narcs uc car and parked he got out and moved up to their car getting in the back after checking the seat to make sure it was clean of vomit and any other detritus from the people they had transported lately detective bosch i presume said the driver whom bosch guessed was reyes yeah how are you guys he offered his fist over the seat and they both gave him a bump while identifying themselves bosch had it wrong the one who looked to be of latin origin was sullivan and the one who looked like a bag of white bread was reyes gilbert and sullivan huh thats what they called us when we got partnered sullivan said kind of stuck bosch nodded that was enough for the meetandgreet everybody had a nickname and a story to go with it these guys together didnt add up to how old bosch was and they probably had no clue who gilbert and sullivan were anyway so you know eddie roman weve had the pleasure reyes said just another piece of human shit that floats around out here but like i told you on the phone we aint seen him in a month or so sullivan added so we got you his next best thing his onion shes over there in room three whats her name sullivan laughed and bosch didnt get it her name is sonia reyes said reyes no relation that he knows of sullivan added he burst into laughter which bosch ignored spell it for me he said he took out his notebook and wrote it down and youre sure shes in the room were sure reyes said okay anything else i should know before i go in no reyes said but we were planning on goin in with you she might get squirrelly with you bosch reached forward and clapped him on the shoulder no i got this i dont want a crowd in the room reyes nodded message delivered bosch did not want any witnesses to what he might need to do here but thanks for the help it will be noted an important case huh sullivan said bosch opened the door and got out they all are he said he closed the door slapped the roof twice and walked away the hotel had an eightfoot security fence around it bosch had to press a buzzer and hold his badge up to a camera he was buzzed into the compound but walked right by the office and down a breezeway leading to the rooms hey a voice called from behind bosch turned and saw a man with an unbuttoned shirt leaning out the door of the motels office where the fuck you goin dude go back inside and shut the door this is police business dont matter man i let you in but this is private property you cant just come through the bosch started quickly moving back up the breezeway toward the man the man took his measure and backed down without bosch saying a word never mind man youre good he quickly stepped back inside and closed the door bosch turned back and found room three without a further problem he leaned close to the jamb to see if he could pick up any sound he heard nothing there was a peephole he put his finger over it and knocked he waited and then knocked again sonia open up eddie sent me who are you the voice was female ragged and suspicious bosch used the universal pass code doesnt matter eddie sent me with somethin to hold you over till hes done no response okay sonia ill tell him you werent interested ive got someone else who wants it he took his finger off the peep and started walking away almost immediately the door opened behind him wait bosch turned back the door was open six inches he saw a set of hollow eyes looking out at him a dim light behind them let me see bosch looked around what out here he said they got cameras all over the place eddie tol me not to open the door for strangers you look like a cop to me well maybe i am but that doesnt change that eddie sent me bosch started to turn again like i said ill tell him i tried have a nice night okay okay you can come in but only to make the drop nothing else bosch walked back toward the door she moved behind it and opened it he entered and turned to her and saw the gun it was an old revolver and he saw no bullets in the exposed chambers bosch raised his hands chest high he could tell she was hurting shed been waiting too long for somebody putting blind junkie trust in something that wouldnt pay off thats not necessary sonia besides i dont think eddie left you with any bullets i got one left you want to try it probably the one she was saving for herself she was skin and bones and close to the end of the line no junkie went the distance give it to me she ordered now okay take it easy i have it right here he reached his right hand into his coat pocket and pulled out a balled piece of aluminum foil he had taken from a roll in mickey hallers kitchen he held it out to the right of his body and he knew her desperate eyes would follow it he shot his left hand out and snatched the gun out of her hand he then stepped forward and roughly shoved her onto the bed shut up and dont move he commanded what is i said shut up he popped the guns barrel out and checked it she had been right there was one bullet left he slid it out into his palm and then put it in his pocket he hooked the gun into his belt then he pulled his badge wallet and opened it for her to see you had that right he said what do you want well get to that bosch moved around the bed looking about the threadbare room it smelled like cigarettes and body odor there were several plastic grocery bags on the floor containing her belongings shoes in one clothing in a few others on the beds lone side table was an overloaded ashtray and a glass pipe what are you hurting for sonia crack heroin or is it meth she didnt answer i can help you better if i know what you need i dont want your help bosch turned and looked at her so far things were going exactly as he predicted they would really he said dont need my help you think eddie roman is going to come back for you hes coming back i got news for you hes already gone im guessing they got him cleaned up nice and neat and he wont be coming back up here once he does what they want him to do hell take the paycheck and when that runs out hell just find himself a new trick partner he paused and looked at her somebody who still has something somebody would want to buy her eyes took on the distant look of someone who knows the truth when she hears it leave me alone she said in a hoarse whisper i know im not telling you anything you dont already know youve been waiting for eddie longer than you thought you would huh how many days you have left on the room he read the answer in her eyes already past huh probably giving the guy in the office blowjobs to let you stay how longs that going to last pretty soon hell just want the money i said go away i will but you come with me sonia right now what do you want i want to know everything you know about eddie roman thursday april am before the judge called for the jury clive royce stood and asked the court for a directed verdict of acquittal he argued that the state had failed to live up to its duty in carrying the burden of proof he said that the evidence presented by the prosecutors failed to cross the threshold of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt i was ready to stand to argue the states side but the judge held up her hand to signal me to stay in place she then quickly dispensed with royces motion motion denied breitman said the court holds that the evidence presented by the prosecution is sufficient for the jury to consider mr royce are you ready to proceed with the defense i am your honor okay sir then we will recall the jury now will you have an opening statement a brief one your honor very well i am going to hold you to that the jurors filed in and took their assigned places on many of them i saw expressions of anticipation i took this as a good sign as if they were wondering how in the hell the defense would be able to dig its way out of all the evidence the state had dumped on it it was probably all wishful thinking on my part but i had been studying juries for most of my adult life and i liked what i saw after welcoming the jury back the judge turned the courtroom over to royce reminded the jurors that this was an opening statement not a listing of facts unless backed up later with testimony and evidence royce strode with full confidence to the lectern without a note or file in his hand i knew he had the same philosophy as i did when it came to making opening statements look them in the eyes and dont flinch and dont back down from your theory no matter how farfetched or unbelievable sell it if they dont think you believe it they never will his strategy of deferring his opener until the start of the defenses case would now pay dividends he would begin the day and his case by delivering to the jury a statement that didnt have to be true that could be as outlandish as anything ever heard in the courtroom as long as he kept the jury riding along nothing else really mattered ladies and gentlemen of the jury good morning today begins a new phase of the trial the defense phase this is when we start to tell you our side of the story and believe me we have another side to almost everything the prosecution has offered you over the past three days i am not going to take a lot of your time here because i am very eager and jason jessup is very eager to get to the evidence that the prosecution has either failed to find or chosen not to present to you it doesnt matter which at this point the only things that matter are that you hear it and that it allows you to see the full picture of what transpired on windsor boulevard on february sixteenth nineteen eightysix i urge you to listen closely to watch closely if you do that you will see the truth emerge i looked over at the legal pad on which maggie had been doodling while royce spoke in large letters she had written windbag i thought she hasnt seen anything yet this case royce continued is about one thing a familys darkest secrets you got only a glimpse of them during the prosecutions presentation you got the tip of the iceberg from the prosecution but today you will get the whole iceberg today you will get the cold hard truth that being that jason jessup is the true victim here today the victim of a familys desire to hide their darkest secret maggie leaned toward me and whispered brace yourself i nodded i knew exactly where we were going this trial is about a monster who killed a child a monster who defiled one young girl and was going to move on to the next when something went wrong and he killed that child this trial is about the family that was so fearful of that monster that they went along with the plan to cover up the crime and point the finger elsewhere at an innocent man royce pointed righteously at jessup as he said this last line maggie shook her head in disgust a calculated move for the jury jason would you please stand up royce said his client did as instructed and turned fully to the jury his eyes boldly scanning from face to face not flinching or looking away jason jessup is an innocent man royce said with the requisite outrage in his voice he was the fall guy an innocent man caught in an impromptu plan to cover up the worst kind of crime the taking of a childs life jessup sat down and royce paused so his words would burn into every jurors conscience it was highly theatrical and planned that way there are two victims here he finally said melissa landy is a victim she lost her life jason jessup is also a victim because they are trying to take his life the family conspired against him and then the police followed their lead they ignored the evidence and planted their own and now after twentyfour years after witnesses are gone and memories have dimmed theyve come calling for him royce cast his head down as if tremendously burdened by the truth i knew he would now wrap things up ladies and gentlemen of the jury we are here for only one reason to seek the truth before the end of this day you will know the truth about windsor boulevard you will know that jason jessup is an innocent man royce paused again then thanked the jury and moved back to his seat in what i was sure was a wellrehearsed moment jessup put his arm around his lawyers shoulders gave him a squeeze and thanked him but the judge gave royce little time to savor the moment or the slick delivery of his opening statement she told him to call his first witness i turned in my seat and saw bosch standing in the back of the courtroom he gave me the nod i had sent him to get sarah ann gleason from the hotel as soon as royce had informed me upon arriving at court that she would be his first witness the defense calls sarah ann gleason to the stand royce said putting the accent on defense in a way that suggested that this was an unexpected turnabout bosch stepped out of the courtroom and quickly returned with gleason he walked her down the aisle and through the gate she went the rest of the way on her own she again was dressed for court informally wearing a white peasant blouse and a pair of jeans gleason was reminded by the judge that she was still under oath and turned over to royce this time when he went to the lectern he carried a thick file and a legal pad probably most of itthe file at leastwas just an attempt to intimidate gleason to make her think he had a big fat file on everything she had ever done wrong in life good morning ms gleason good morning now you testified yesterday that you were the victim of sexual abuse at the hands of your stepfather kensington landy is that correct yes with the first word of her testimony i detected trepidation she hadnt been allowed to hear royces opening statement but we had prepared gleason for the way we thought the defense case would go she was exhibiting fear already and this never played well with the jury there was little maggie and i could do sarah was up there on her own at what point in your life did this abuse start when i was twelve and it ended when when i was thirteen right after my sisters death i notice you didnt call it your sisters murder you called it her death is there a reason for that im not sure what you mean well your sister was murdered correct it wasnt an accident was it no it was murder then why did you refer to it as her death just a moment ago im not sure are you confused about what happened to your sister maggie was on her feet objecting before gleason could answer counsel is badgering the witness she said hes more interested in eliciting an emotional response than an answer your honor i simply am trying to learn how and why this witness views this crime the way she does it goes to state of mind of the witness i am not interested in eliciting anything other than an answer to the question i asked the judge weighed things for a moment before ruling im going to allow it the witness may answer the question ill repeat it royce said ms gleason are you confused about what happened to your sister during the exchange between lawyers and the judge gleason had found some resolve she answered forcefully while hitting royce with a hard stare of defiance no im not confused about what happened i was there she was kidnapped by your client and after that i never saw her again there is no confusion about that at all i wanted to stand and clap instead i just nodded to myself it was a fine fine answer but royce moved on acting as though he had not been hit with the tomato there have been times in your life when you were confused however correct about my sister and what happened and who took her never im talking about times you were incarcerated in mental health facilities and the psych wards of jails and prisons gleason lowered her head in full realization that she would not escape this trial without a full airing of the lost years of her life i just had to hope she would respond in the way maggie had told her to after the murder of my sister many things went wrong in my life she said she then looked up directly at royce as she continued yes i spent some time in those kinds of places i think and my counselors agreed that it was because of what happened to melissa good answer i thought she was fighting well get back into that later on royce said but getting back to your sister she was twelve at the time of her murder correct thats right this would have been the same age you were when your stepfather began to sexually abuse you am i right about the same yes did you warn your sister about him there was a long pause as gleason considered her answer this was because there was no good answer ms gleason the judge prompted please answer the question no i didnt warn her i was afraid to afraid of what royce asked him as youve already pointed out ive been through a lot of therapy in my life i know that it is not unusual for a child to be unable to tell anyone you get trapped in the behavior trapped by fear ive been told that many times in other words you go along to get along sort of but that is a simplification it was more but you did live with a lot of fear in your life back then yes i did your stepfather tell you not to tell anyone about what he was doing to you yes he said did he threaten you he said that if i told anyone i would be taken away from my mother and sister he said he would make sure that the state would think my mother knew about it and they would consider her unfit they would take melissa and me away then we would get split up because foster homes couldnt always take two at a time did you believe him yes i was twelve i believed him and it scared you didnt it yes i wanted to stay with my fam wasnt it that same fear and control that your stepfather had over you that made you go along to get along after he killed your sister again maggie jumped up to object stating that the question was leading and assumed facts not in evidence the judge agreed and sustained the objection undeterred royce went at gleason relentlessly isnt it true that you and your mother did and said exactly what your stepfather told you to in the coverup of melissas murder no thats not he told you to say it was a tow truck driver and that you were to pick one of the men the police brought to the house no he didnt objection there was no hideandseek game outside the house was there your sister was murdered inside the house by kensington landy isnt that true your honor maggie was now shouting counsel is badgering the witness with these leading questions he doesnt want her answers he just wants to deliver his lies to the jury the judge looked from maggie to royce all right everyone just calm down the objection is sustained mr royce ask the witness one question at a time and allow her the time to answer and you will not ask leading questions need i remind you you called her as a witness if you wanted to lead her you shouldve conducted a crossexamination when you had the opportunity royce put on his best look of contrition it mustve been difficult i apologize for getting carried away your honor he said it wont happen again it didnt matter if it happened again royce had already gotten his point across his purpose was not to get an admission from gleason in fact he expected none his purpose was to get his alternate theory to the jury in that he was being very successful okay lets move on royce said you mentioned earlier that you spent a considerable part of your adult life in counseling and drug rehab not to mention incarceration is that correct to a point gleason said i have been clean and sober and a just answer the question that was asked royce quickly interjected objection maggie said she is trying to answer the question he asked but mr royce doesnt like the full answer and is trying to cut her off let her answer the question mr royce breitman said tiredly go ahead ms gleason i was just saying that i have been clean for seven years and a productive member of society thank you ms gleason royce then led her through a tragic and sordid history literally going arrest by arrest and revealing all the details of the depravity sarah wallowed in for so long maggie objected often arguing that it had little to do with sarahs identification of jessup but breitman allowed most of the questioning to continue finally royce wrapped up his examination by setting up his next witness getting back to the rehabilitation center in north hollywood you were there for five months in nineteen ninetynine correct i dont remember exactly when or for how long you obviously have the records there but you do remember meeting another client named edward roman known as eddie yes i do and you got to know him well yes how did you meet him we were in group counseling together how would you describe the relationship you had with eddie roman back then well in counseling we sort of realized that we knew some of the same people and liked doing the same thingsmeaning drugs so we started hanging out and it continued after we were both released was this a romantic relationship gleason laughed in a way that was not supposed to impart humor what passed for romance between two drug addicts she said i think the term is enablers by being together we were enabling each other but romance is not a word i would use we had sex on occasionwhen he was able to but there was no romance mr royce but didnt you in fact believe at one point that you two were married eddie set something up on the beach with a man he said was a minister but it wasnt real it wasnt legal but at the time you thought it was didnt you yes so were you in love with him no i wasnt in love with him i just thought he could protect me so you were married or at least thought you were did you live together yes where in different motels in the valley all this time you were together you mustve confided in eddie yes about some things yes did you ever confide in him about your sisters murder i am sure i did i didnt keep it a secret i would have talked about it in group therapy in north hollywood and he was sitting right there did you ever tell him that your stepfather killed your sister no because that didnt happen so if eddie roman were to come to this courtroom and testify that you did indeed tell him that then he would be lying yes but you have already testified yesterday and today that you have lied to counselors and police you have stolen and committed many crimes in your life but youre not lying here is that what we are to believe im not lying you are talking about a period of my life when i did those things i dont deny that i was human trash okay but i am past that now and have been past it for a long time im not lying now okay ms gleason no further questions as royce returned to his seat maggie and i put our heads together and whispered she held up really well maggie said i think we should let it stand and ill just hit a couple high notes sounds good ms mcpherson the judge prompted maggie stood yes your honor just a few questions she went to the lectern with her trusty legal pad she skipped the buildup and got right to the matters she wanted to cover sarah this man eddie roman and the phony marriagewhose idea was it to get married eddie asked me to get married he said we would work together as a team and share everything that he would protect me and that we could never be forced to testify against each other if we got arrested and what did working together as a team mean in that circumstance well i he wanted me to sell myself so we would have money to buy drugs and to have a motel room did you do that for eddie for a little bit of time and then i got arrested did eddie bail you out no did he come to court no your record shows you pleaded guilty to soliciting and were sentenced to time served is that correct yes how long was that i think it was thirteen days and was eddie there waiting when you got out of jail no did you ever see him again no i didnt maggie checked her notes flipped up a couple pages and found what she was looking for okay sarah you mentioned several times during your testimony earlier today that you did not remember specific dates and occurrences that mr royce asked you about during the time you were a drug user is that a fair characterization yes thats true during all of those years of drug abuse and counseling and incarceration were you ever able to forget what happened to your sister melissa no never i thought about it every day i still do were you ever able to forget about the man who crossed your front yard and grabbed your sister while you watched from the bushes no never i thought about him every day and still do have you ever had a moment of doubt about the man you identified as your sisters abductor no maggie turned and pointedly looked at jessup who was looking down at a legal pad and writing what were probably meaningless notes her eyes held on him and she waited just as jessup looked up to see what was holding up the testimony she asked her last question never a single doubt sarah no never thank you sarah no further questions thursday april am the judge followed sarah gleasons testimony by announcing the midmorning break bosch waited in his seat at the railing until royce and jessup got up and started to file out he then stood and moved against the grain to get to his witness as he passed by jessup he clapped him hard on the arm i think your makeups starting to run jason he said it with a smile as he went by jessup stopped and turned and was about to respond to the taunt when royce grabbed him by the other arm and kept him going bosch moved forward to collect gleason from the witness stand after parts of two days on the stand she looked like she was both emotionally and physically drained like she might need help just getting up from the chair sarah you did great he told her thank you i couldnt tell if anybody believed me they all did sarah they all did he walked her back to the prosecution table where haller and mcpherson had similar reviews of her testimony mcpherson got up out of her seat and hugged her you stood up to jessup and you stood up for your sister she said you can be proud of that for the rest of your life gleason suddenly burst into tears and held her hand over her eyes mcpherson quickly pulled her back into the hug i know i know youve held it together and stayed strong its okay to let it go now bosch walked over to the jury box and grabbed the box of tissues he brought them to gleason and she wiped away her tears youre almost done haller said to her youve totally finished testifying so now all we want you to do is sit in court and observe the trial we want you to sit up here in the front row when eddie roman testifies after that we can put you on a plane home this afternoon okay but why because hes going to tell lies about you and if he is going to do that then hes going to have to tell them to your face i dont think hes going to have a problem with that he never did well then the jury will want to see how you react and how hell react and dont worry weve got something else cooking thatll make eddie feel some heat at that haller turned to bosch you ready with this just give me the sign can i ask something gleason said sure haller said what if i dont want to get on a plane today what if i want to be here for the verdict for my sister we would love that sarah maggie said you are welcome and can stay as long as you like bosch stood in the hallway outside the courtroom he had his phone out and was slowly typing a text to his daughter with one finger his efforts were interrupted when he received a text it was from haller and was only one word now he put his phone away and walked to the witness waiting room sonia reyes was slumped in a chair with her head down two empty coffee cups on the table in front of her okay sonia rise and shine were going to go do this you okay you ready she looked up at him with tired eyes thats too many questions policeman okay ill settle for one howre you feeling about how i look you got any more of that stuff they gave me at the clinic that was it but im going to have someone take you right back there as soon as were finished here whatever you say policeman i dont think ive been up this early since the last time i was in county lockup yeah well its not that early lets go he helped her up and they headed toward department reyes was what they called a silent witness she wouldnt be testifying in the trial she was in no condition to but by walking her down the aisle and putting her in the front row bosch would make sure she would be noticed by edward roman the hope was that shed knock roman off his game maybe even make him change it up they were banking on his not knowing the rules of evidence and therefore not understanding that her appearance in the gallery precluded her from testifying at the trial and exposing his lies harry hit the door with a fist as he pushed it open because he knew it would draw attention inside the court he then ushered reyes in and walked her down the aisle edward roman was already on the stand sworn in and testifying he wore an illfitting suit borrowed from royces client closet and was cleanshaven with short neat hair he stumbled verbally when he saw sonia in the courtroom we had group counseling twice only twice royce asked unaware of the distraction in the aisle behind him what you said you only had group counseling with sarah gleason twice nah man i meant twice a day bosch escorted reyes to a seat with a reserved sign on it he then sat down next to her and approximately how long did this last royce asked each one was fifty minutes i think roman answered his eyes holding on reyes in the audience i mean how long were you both in counseling a month a year how long oh it was for five months and did you become lovers while you were in the center roman lowered his eyes uh yeah thats right how did you manage that i assume there are rules against that well if theres a will theres always a way you know we found time we found places did this relationship continue after you two were released from the center yes she got out a couple weeks ahead of me then i got out and we hooked up did you live together uhhuh is that a yes yes can i ask a question royce paused he hadnt expected this no mr roman the judge said you cant ask a question you are a witness in these proceedings but how can they bring her in here like that who mr roman roman pointed out to the gallery and right at reyes her the judge looked at reyes and then at bosch sitting next to her a look of deep suspicion crossed her face im going to ask the jury to step back into the jury room for a few moments this should not take long the jurors filed back into the jury room the moment the last one in closed the door the judge zeroed in on bosch detective bosch harry stood up who is the woman sitting to your left your honor haller said can i answer that question please do detective bosch is sitting with sonia reyes who has agreed to help the prosecution as a witness consultant the judge looked from haller to reyes and back to haller you want to run that by me again mr haller judge ms reyes is acquainted with the witness because the defense did not make mr roman available to us prior to his testimony here we have asked ms reyes to give us advice on how to proceed with our crossexamination hallers explanation had done nothing to change the look of suspicion on breitmans face are you paying her for this advice we have agreed to help her get into a clinic i should hope so your honor royce said may i be heard go ahead mr royce i think it is quite obvious that the prosecution is attempting to intimidate mr roman this is a gangster move judge not something i would expect to see from the district attorneys office well i strongly object to that characterization haller said it is perfectly acceptable within the canon of courtroom procedure and ethics to hire and use consultants mr royce employed a jury consultant last week and that was perfectly acceptable but now that the prosecution has a consultant that he knows will help expose his witness as a liar and someone who preys on women he objects with all due respect i would call that the gangster move okay were not going to debate this now breitman said i find that the prosecution is certainly within bounds in using ms reyes as a consultant lets bring the jury back thank you judge haller said as he sat down as the jurors filed back into the box haller turned and looked back at bosch he gave a slight nod and bosch knew that he was happy the exchange with the judge could not have worked better in delivering a message to roman the message being that we know your game and come our turn to ask the questions so will the jury roman now had a choice he could stick with the defense or start playing for the prosecution testimony continued once the jury was back in place royce quickly established through roman that he and sarah gleason had a relationship that lasted nearly a year and involved the sharing of personal stories as well as drugs but when it came to revealing those personal stories roman did a cut and run leaving royce hanging in the wind now did there come a time when she spoke about her sisters murder a time there were lots of times she talked about it a lot man and did she ever tell you in detail what she called the real story yes she did can you tell the court what she told you roman hesitated and scratched his chin before answering bosch knew this was the moment that his work either paid off or went for naught she told me that they were playing hideandseek in the yard and a guy came and grabbed her sister and that she saw the whole thing boschs eyes made a circuit of the room first he checked the jurors and it seemed that even they had been expecting roman to say something else then the prosecution table he saw that mcpherson had grabbed haller by the back of his arm and was squeezing it and lastly royce who was now the one hesitating he stood at the lectern looking down at his notes one armed cocked with his fist on his hip like a frustrated teacher who could not draw the correct answer from a student that is the story you heard sarah gleason tell in group counseling at the rehabilitation center correct he finally asked thats right but isnt it true that she told you a different version of eventswhat she called the real storywhen you were in more private settings uh no she pretty much stuck to the same story all the time bosch saw mcpherson squeeze hallers arm again this was the whole case right here royce was like a man left behind in the water by a dive boat he was treading water but he was in the open sea and it was only a matter of time before he went down he tried to do what he could now mr roman on march second of this year did you not contact my office and offer your services as a witness for the defense i dont know about the date but i called there yeah and did you speak to my investigator karen revelle i spoke to a woman but i cant remember her name and didnt you tell her a story that is quite different from the one you just recounted but i wasnt under oath or nothin then thats right sir but you did tell karen a different story true i mightve i cant remember didnt you tell karen at that time that ms gleason had told you that her stepfather had killed her sister haller was up with the objection arguing that not only was royce leading the witness but that there was no foundation for the question and that counsel was trying to get testimony to the jury that the witness was not willing to give the judge sustained the objection your honor royce said the defense would like to request a short break to confer with its witness before haller could object the judge denied the request by this witnesss own testimony this morning you have had since march second to prepare for this moment we go to lunch in thirtyfive minutes you can confer with him then mr royce ask your next question thank you your honor royce looked down at his legal pad from boschs angle he could tell he was looking at a blank page mr royce the judge prompted yes your honor just rechecking a date mr roman why did you call my office on march second well i seen something about the case on the tv in fact it was you i seen you talking about it and i knew something about it from knowing sarah like i did so i called up to see if i was needed and then you came to my offices correct yeah thats right you sent that lady to pick me up and when you came to my office you told me a different story than you are telling the jury now isnt that right like i said i dont remember exactly what i said then im a drug addict sir i say a lot of things i dont remember and dont really mean all i remember is that the woman who came said shed put me up in a nicer hotel and i had no money for a place at that time so i sort of said what she told me to say bosch made a fist and bounced it once on his thigh this was an unmitigated disaster for the defense he looked over at jessup to see if he realized how bad things had just turned for him and jessup seemed to sense it he turned and looked back at bosch his eyes dark with growing anger and realization bosch leaned forward and slowly raised a finger he dragged it across his throat jessup turned away thursday april am i have had many good moments in court ive stood next to men at the moment they knew that they were going free because of my good work i have stood in the well in front of a jury and felt the tingle of truth and righteousness roll down my spine and i have destroyed liars without mercy on the witness stand these are the moments i live for in my professional life but few of them measured up to the moment i watched jason jessups defense unravel with the testimony of edward roman as roman crashed and burned on the stand my exwife and prosecution partner squeezed my arm to the point of pain she couldnt help it she knew it too this was not something royce was going to recover from a key part of what was already going to be a fragile defense was crumbling before his eyes it wasnt so much that his witness had pulled a oneeighty on him it was the jury seeing a defense that was now obviously built upon a liar the jury would not forgive this it was over and i believed everyone in the courtroomfrom the judge to the gadflies in the back row of the galleryknew it jessup was going down i turned and looked back to share the moment with bosch after all the silent witness maneuver had been his idea and i caught him giving jessup the throat slashthe internationally recognized sign that it was over i looked back to the front of the court mr royce the judge said are you continuing with this witness a moment your honor royce said it was a valid question royce had few ways with which to go with roman at this point he could cut his losses and simply end the questioning or he could ask the judge to declare roman to be a hostile witnessa move that was always professionally embarrassing when the hostile witness is one you called to the stand but it was a move that would allow royce more latitude in asking leading questions that explored what roman had initially said to the defense investigator and why he was dissembling now but this was fraught with danger especially since this initial interview had not been recorded or documented in an effort to hide roman during the discovery process mr royce the judge barked i consider the courts time quite valuable please ask your next question or i will turn the witness over to mr haller for crossexamination royce nodded to himself as he came to a decision im sorry your honor but no further questions at this time royce walked dejectedly back to his seat and a waiting client who was visibly upset with the turnabout i stood up and started moving to the lectern even before the judge turned the witness over to me mr roman i said your testimony has been somewhat confusing to me so let me get this straight are you telling this jury that sarah ann gleason did or did not tell you that her stepfather murdered her sister she didnt thats just what they wanted me to say who is they sir the defense the lady investigator and royce besides a hotel room were you to receive anything else if you testified to such a story today they just said theyd take care of me that a lot of money was at objection royce yelled he jumped to his feet your honor the witness is clearly hostile and acting out a vindictive fantasy hes your witness mr royce he can answer the question go ahead sir they said there was a lot of money at stake and they would take care of me roman said it just kept getting better for me and worse for jessup but i had to make sure i didnt come off to the jury as gleeful or vindictive myself i recalibrated and focused on what was important what was the story that sarah told you all those years ago mr roman like i said that she was in the yard and she was hiding and she saw the guy who grabbed her sister did she ever tell you she identified the wrong man no did she ever tell you that the police told her who to identify no did she ever once tell you that the wrong man was charged with her sisters murder no no further questions i checked the clock as i returned to my seat we still had twenty minutes before the lunch break rather than break early the judge asked royce to call his next witness he called his investigator karen revelle i knew what he was doing and i was going to be ready revelle was a mannishlooking woman who wore slacks and a sport jacket she had excop written all over her dour expression after she was sworn in royce got right to the point probably hoping to stem the flow of blood from his case before the jurors went to lunch what do you do for a living ms revelle i am an investigator for the law firm of royce and associates you work for me correct that is correct on march second of this year did you conduct a telephone interview with an individual named edward roman i did what did he tell you in that call i stood and objected i asked the judge if i could discuss my objection at a sidebar conference come on up she said maggie and i followed royce to the side of the bench the judge told me to state my objection my first objection is that anything this witness states about a conversation with roman is clearly hearsay and not allowed but the larger objection is to mr royce trying to impeach his own witness hes going to use revelle to impeach roman and you cant do that judge its damn near suborning perjury on mr royces part because one of these two people is lying under oath and he called them both i strongly object to mr hallers last characterization royce said leaning over the sidebar and moving in closer to the judge suborning perjury i have been practicing law for more than first of all back up mr royce youre in my space breitman said sternly and second you can save your selfserving objection for some other time mr haller is correct on all counts if i allow this witness to continue her testimony you are not only going to go into hearsay but we will have a situation where one of your witnesses has lied under oath you cant have it both ways and you cant put a liar on the stand so this is what were going to do you are going to get your investigator off the stand mr haller is going to make a motion to strike what little testimony she has already given and i will agree to that motion then were going to lunch during that time you and your client can get together and decide what to do next but its looking to me like your options got really limited in the last half hour thats all she didnt wait for any of us to respond she simply rolled her chair away from the sidebar royce followed the judges advice and ended his questioning of revelle i moved to strike and that was that a half hour later i was sitting with maggie and sarah gleason at a table at the water grill the place where the case had started for me we had decided to go highend because we were celebrating what appeared to be the beginning of the end for jason jessups case and because the water grill was just across the street from sarahs hotel the only one missing at the table was bosch and he was on his way after dropping our silent witness sonia reyes at the drug rehab facility at countyusc medical center wow i said after the three of us were seated i dont think ive ever seen anything like that before in a courtroom me neither maggie said well ive been in a few courtrooms but i dont know enough to know what it all means said gleason it means the end is near maggie said it means the entire defense imploded i added see the defenses case was sort of simple stepfather killed the girl and the family concocted a coverup they came up with the story about hideandseek and the man on the lawn to throw the authorities off of stepdad then sisterthats youmade a false identification of jessup just sort of randomly set him up for a murder he did not commit but what about melissas hair in the tow truck gleason asked the defense claims it was planted i said either in conspiracy or independent of the familys coverup the police realized they didnt have much of a case they had a thirteenyearold girls id of a suspect and almost nothing else so they took hair from the body or a hairbrush and planted it in the tow truck after lunchif royce is foolish enough to continue thishe will present investigative chronology reports and time logs that will show detective kloster had enough access and time to make the plant in the tow truck before a search warrant was obtained and forensics opened the truck but thats crazy gleason said maybe so maggie said but that was their case and eddie roman was the linchpin because he was supposed to testify that you told him your stepfather did it he was supposed to plant the seed of doubt thats all it takes sarah one little doubt only he took one look at who was in the audiencenamely sonia reyesand thought he was in trouble you see eddie did the same thing with sonia as he did with you met her got close and turned her out to keep him in meth when he saw her in court he knew he was in trouble because he knew if sonia got on the stand and told the same story about him as you did then the jury would know what he wasa liar and predatorand wouldnt trust a single thing he said he also had no idea what sonia might have told us about crimes they committed together so he decided up there that his best out was the truth to screw the defense and make the prosecution happy he changed his story gleason nodded as she began to understand do you think mr royce really told him what to say and was going to pay him off for his lies of course maggie said i dont know i said quickly ive known clive a long time i dont think thats how he operates what maggie said you think eddie roman just made it all up on his own no but he spoke to the investigator before he ever got to clive plausible denial youre just being charitable haller they dont call him clever clive for no reason sarah seemed to sense that she had pushed us into a zone of contention that had existed long before this trial she tried to move us on do you really think its over she asked i thought for a moment about it and then nodded i think if i was clever clive id be thinking of whats best for my client and that would be not to let this go to a verdict id start thinking about a deal maybe hell even call during lunch i pulled my phone out and put it down on the table as if being ready for royces call would make it happen just as i did so bosch showed up and took the seat next to maggie i grabbed my water glass and raised it to him cheers harry smooth move today i think jessups house of cards is falling down bosch raised a water glass and clinked it off mine royce was right you know he said it was a gangster move saw it in one of the godfather movies way back he then held his water glass up to the two women anyway cheers he said you two are the real stars great work yesterday and today we all clinked glasses but sarah hesitated whats wrong sarah i asked dont tell me youre afraid of clinking glass i smiled proud of my own humor its nothing she said i think its supposed to be bad luck to toast with water well i said quickly recovering its going to take more than bad luck to change things now bosch switched subjects what happens next he asked i was just telling sarah that i dont think this will go to a jury clive has to be thinking disposition they really dont have any other choice bosch turned serious i know theres money on the line and your boss probably thinks thats the priority he said but this guy has got to go back to prison absolutely maggie said of course i added and after what happened this morning we have all the leverage jessup has to take what we offer or we my phone started to buzz the id screen said unknown speak of the devil maggie said i looked at sarah you might be on that plane home tonight after all i opened the phone and said my name mickey district attorney williams here how are you i shook my head at the others it wasnt royce im doing fine gabe how are you my informality didnt seem to faze him im hearing good things out of court this morning his statement confirmed what i had thought all along while williams had never once showed his face in the courtroom he had a plant in the gallery watching well i hope so i think well know more about which way this will go after lunch are you considering a disposition well not yet i havent heard from opposing counsel but i assume that we may soon enter into discussions hes probably talking to his client about it right now i would be if i were him well keep me in the loop on that before you sign off on anything i paused as i weighed this last statement i saw bosch put his hand inside his jacket and pull out his own phone to take a call tell you what gabe as independent counsel i prefer to stay independent ill inform you of a disposition if and when i have an agreement i want to be part of that conversation williams insisted i saw some sort of darkness move into boschs eyes instinctively i knew it was time to get off my call ill get back to you on that mr district attorney ive got another call coming in here it could be clive royce i closed the phone just as bosch closed his and started to stand up what is it maggie asked boschs face looked ashen theres been a shooting over at royces office theres four on the floor over there is jessup one of them i asked no jessups gone thursday april pm bosch drove and mcpherson insisted on riding with him haller had split off with gleason to head back to court bosch pulled a card out of his wallet and got lieutenant stephen wrights number off it he handed the card and his phone to mcpherson and told her to punch in the number its ringing she said he took the phone and got it to his ear just as wright answered its bosch tell me your people are on jessup i wish damn it what the hell happened why wasnt sis on him hold your horses bosch we were on him thats one of my people on the floor in royces office that hit like a punch bosch hadnt realized a cop was one of the victims where are you he asked wright on my way there im three minutes out what do you know so far not a hell of a lot we had a light tail on him during court hours you knew that one team during court and full coverage before and after today they followed him from the courthouse to royces office at lunchtime jessup and royces team walked over after they were in there a few minutes my guys heard gunshots they called it in and then went in one was knocked down the other pinned down jessup went out the back and my guy stayed to try cpr on his partner he had to let jessup go bosch shook his head the thought of his daughter pushed through everything she was at school for the next ninety minutes he felt that she would be safe for now who else was hit he asked as far as i know wright said it was royce and his investigator and then another lawyer a female they were lucky it was lunchtime everybody else in the office was gone bosch didnt see much that was lucky about a quadruple murder and jessup out there somewhere with a gun wright kept talking im not going to shed a tear over a couple of defense lawyers but my guy on the floor in theres got two little kids at home bosch this is not a good goddamn thing at all bosch turned onto first and up ahead he could see the flashing lights royces office was in a storefront on a deadend street that ran behind the kyoto grand hotel on the edge of japantown easy walking distance to the courthouse did you get jessups car out on a broadcast yes everybody has it somebody will see it wheres the rest of your crew everybodys heading to the scene no send them out looking for jessup at all the places hes been the parks everywhere even my house theres no use for them at the scene well meet there and ill send them out youre wasting time lieutenant you think i can stop them from coming to the scene first bosch understood the impossibility of wrights situation im pulling up now he said ill see you when you get here two minutes bosch closed the phone mcpherson asked him what wright had said and he quickly filled her in as he pulled the car to a stop behind a patrol car bosch badged his way under the yellow tape and mcpherson did the same because the shooting had occurred only twentyfive minutes earlier the crime scene was largely inhabited by uniformed officersthe first respondersand was chaotic bosch found a patrol sergeant issuing orders regarding crime scene protection and went to him sergeant harry bosch rhd who is taking this investigation isnt it you no im on a related case but this one wont be mine then i dont know bosch i was told rhd will handle okay then theyre still on their way whos inside couple guys from central division roche and stout babysitters bosch thought as soon as rhd moved in they would be moved out he pulled his phone and called his lieutenant gandle lieutenant whos taking the four on the floor by the kyoto bosch where are you at the scene it was my guy from the trial jessup shit what went wrong i dont know who are you sending and where the hell are they im sending four penzler kirshbaum krikorian and russell but they were all at lunch up at birds im coming over too but you dont have to be there harry i know im not staying long bosch closed the phone and looked around for mcpherson he had lost her in the confusion of the crime scene he spotted her crouching down next to a man sitting on the sidewalk curb in front of the bailbonds shop next door to royces office bosch recognized him from the night he and mcpherson rode on the surveillance of jessup there was blood on his hands and shirt from his efforts to save his partner bosch went to them he went to his car when they got back here for just a minute got in and then got out he then went into the office right away we heard shots we moved and manny got hit as soon as we opened the door i got off a couple rounds but i had to try to help manny so jessup mustve gotten the gun from his car right mustve theyve got the metal detectors at the courthouse he didnt have it in court today but you never saw it no never saw the weapon if we had seen it we wouldve done something bosch left them there and went to the door of royce and associates he got there just as lieutenant wright did together they entered oh my god wright said when he saw his man on the floor just inside the front door what was his name bosch asked manuel branson hes got two kids and i have to go tell his wife branson was on his back he had bullet entry wounds on the left side of his neck and upper left cheek there had been a lot of blood the neck shot appeared to have sliced through the carotid artery bosch left wright there and moved past a reception desk and down a hallway on the right side there was a wall of glass that looked into a boardroom with doors on both ends the rest of the victims were in here along with two detectives who wore gloves and booties and were taking notes on clipboards roche and stout bosch stood in the first doorway of the room but did not enter the two detectives looked at him who are you one asked bosch rhd you taking this not exactly im on something related the others are coming christ were only two blocks from the pab they werent there they were at lunch up in hollywood but dont worry theyll get here its not like these people are going anywhere bosch looked at the bodies clive royce sat dead in a chair at the head of a long board table his head was snapped back as if he were looking at the ceiling there was a bloodless bullet hole in the center of his forehead blood from the exit wound at the back of his head had poured down the back of his jacket and chair the investigator karen revelle was on the floor on the other side of the room near the other door it appeared that she had tried to make a run for it before being hit by gunfire she was facedown and bosch could not see where or how many times she had been hit royces pretty associate counsel whose name bosch could not remember was no longer pretty her body was in a seat diagonal to royce her upper body down on the table an entry wound at the back of her head the bullet had exited below her right eye and destroyed her face there was always more damage coming out than going in what do you think asked one of the central guys looks like he came in shooting hit these two first and then tagged the other as she made a run for the door then backed into the hall and opened up on the sis guys as they came in yeah looks that way im going to check the rest of the place out bosch continued down the hall and looked through open doors into empty offices there were nameplates on the wall outside the doors and he was reminded that royces associate was named denise graydon the hallway ended at a break room where there was a kitchenette with a refrigerator and a microwave there was another communal table here and an exit door that was three inches ajar bosch used his elbow to push the door open he stepped into an alley lined with trash bins he looked both ways and saw a pay parking lot a half block down to his right he assumed it was the lot where jessup had parked his car and had gone to retrieve the gun he went back inside and this time took a longer look in each of the offices he knew from experience that he was treading in a gray area here this was a law office and whether the lawyers were dead or not their clients were still entitled to privacy and attorneyclient privilege bosch touched nothing and opened no drawer or file he simply moved his eyes over the surface of things seeing and reading what was in plain sight when he was in revelles office he was joined by mcpherson what are you doing just looking we might have a problem going into any of their offices as an officer of the court i cant then wait outside like i said im just looking i am making sure the premises are secure whatever ill be out front the medias all over the place out there now its a circus bosch was leaning over revelles desk he didnt look up good for them mcpherson left the room at the same moment bosch read something off a legal pad that was on top of a stack of files on the side of the desk near the phone maggie come back here she returned take a look at this mcpherson came around the desk and bent over to read the notes on the top page of the pad the page was covered with what looked like random notes phone numbers and names some were circled others scratched out it looked like a pad revelle jotted on while on the phone what mcpherson asked without touching the pad bosch pointed to a notation in the bottom right corner all it said was checkers but that was enough shit mcpherson said sarah isnt even registered under her name how did revelle get this she mustve followed us back after court paid somebody for the room number we have to assume that jessup has this information bosch pulled his phone and called mickey haller on speed dial its bosch you still have sarah with you yes shes here in court were waiting for the judge look dont scare her but she cant go back to the hotel all right how come because theres an indication here that jessup has that location well be setting up on it what do i do then ill be sending a protection team to the courtfor both of you theyll know what to do they can cover her i dont need it thatll be your choice my advice is you take it he closed the phone and looked at mcpherson i gotta get a protection team over there i want you to take my car and get my daughter and your daughter and go somewhere safe you call me then and ill send a team to you too my cars two blocks from here i can just thatll waste too much time take mine and go now ill call the school and tell them youre coming for maddie okay thank you call me when you have they heard shouting from the front of the office suite angry male voices bosch knew they came from the friends of manny branson they were seeing their fallen comrade on the floor and getting fueled with outrage and the scent of blood for the hunt lets go he said they moved back through the suite to the front bosch saw wright standing just outside the front door consoling two sis men with angry tearstreaked faces bosch made his way around bransons body and out the door he tapped wright on the elbow i need a moment lieutenant wright broke away from his two men and followed bosch walked a few yards to where they could speak privately but he need not have worried about being overheard in the sky above there were at least four media choppers circling over the crime scene and laying down a layer of camouflage sound that would make any conversation on the block private i need two of your best men bosch said leaning toward wrights ear okay what do you have going theres a note on the desk of one of the victims its the hotel and room number of our prime witness we have to assume our shooter has that information the slaughter inside there indicates hes taking out the people associated with the trial the people he thinks did him wrong thats a long list but i think our witness would be at the top of it got it you want to set up at the hotel bosch nodded yeah one man outside one inside and me in the room we wait and see if he shows wright shook his head we use four two inside and two outside but forget waiting in the room because jessup will never get by the surveillance instead you and i find a viewpoint up high and set up the command post thats the right way to do it bosch nodded okay lets go except theres one thing whats that if i bring you in on this then you stay back my people take him down bosch studied him for a moment trying to read everything hidden in what he was saying there are questions bosch said about franklin canyon and the other places i need to talk to jessup wright looked over boschs shoulder and back toward the front door of royce and associates detective one of my best people is dead on the floor in there im not guaranteeing you anything you understand bosch paused and then nodded i understand thursday april pm there was more media in the courtroom than there had been at any other point of the trial the first two rows of the gallery were shouldertoshoulder with reporters and cameramen the rest of the rows were filled with courthouse personnel and lawyers who had heard what had happened to clive royce sarah gleason sat in a row by the courtroom deputys desk it was marked as reserved for law enforcement officers but the deputy put her there so the reporters couldnt get to her meantime i sat at the prosecution table waiting for the judge like a man on a desert island no maggie no bosch nobody at the defense table i was alone mickey someone whispered from behind me i turned to see kate salters from the times leaning across the railing i cant talk now i have to figure out what to say here but do you think your total destruction of this mornings witness is what could have i was saved by the judge breitman entered the courtroom and bounded up to the bench and took her seat salters took hers and the question i wanted to avoid for the rest of my life remained unaskedat least for the moment we are back on the record in california versus jessup michael haller is present for the people but the jury is not present nor is defense counsel or the defendant i am aware through unconfirmed media reports of what has transpired in the last ninety minutes at mr royces office can you add anything to what i have seen and heard on television mr haller i stood up to address the court your honor i dont know what they are putting out to the media at the moment but i can confirm that mr royce and his cocounsel on this case ms graydon were shot and killed in their offices at lunchtime karen revelle is also dead as well as a police officer who responded to the shooting the suspect in the shooting has been identified as jason jessup he remains at large judging by the murmur from the gallery behind me those basic facts had probably been speculated upon but not yet confirmed to the media this is indeed very sad news breitman said yes your honor i said very sad but i think at this moment we need to put aside our emotions and act carefully here the issue is how do we proceed with this case i am pretty sure i know the answer to that question but am willing to listen to counsel before ruling do you wish to be heard mr haller yes i do judge i ask the court to recess the trial for the remainder of the day and sequester the jury while we await further information i also ask that you revoke mr jessups pretrial release and issue a capias for his arrest the judge considered these requests for a long moment before responding i will grant the motion revoking the defendants release and issue the capias but i dont see the need to sequester the jury regrettably i see no alternative to a mistrial here mr haller i knew that would be her first thought i had been considering my response since the moment i had returned to the courthouse the people object to a mistrial judge the law is clear that mr jessup waives his right to be present at these proceedings by voluntarily absenting himself from them according to what the defense represented earlier he was scheduled to be the last witness today but he has obviously decided not to testify so taking all of this into mr haller i am going to have to stop you right there i think you are missing one part of the equation and i am afraid the horse is already out of the barn you may recall that deputy solantz was assigned lunch duty with our jurors after we had the issue of tardiness on monday yes well lunch for eighteen in downtown los angeles is a tall order deputy solantz arranged for the group to travel by bus together and eat each day at cliftons cafeteria there are tvs in the restaurant but deputy solantz always keeps them off the local channels unfortunately one tv was on cnn today when the network chose to go live with what was occurring at mr royces office several jurors saw the live report and got the gist of what was happening before deputy solantz managed to kill the feed as you can imagine deputy solantz is not very happy with himself at the moment and neither am i i turned and looked over at the courtroom deputys desk solantz had his eyes down in humiliation i looked back at the judge and i knew i was dead in the water needless to say your suggestion of sequestering the jury was a good one just a little late therefore and after taking all things into consideration i find that the jury in this trial has been prejudiced by events which have occurred outside of the court i intend to declare a mistrial and continue this case until such time as mr jessup has been brought again before this court she paused for a moment to see if i had an objection but i had nothing i knew what she was doing was right and inevitable lets bring in the jury now she said soon the jurors were filing into the box many of them glancing over at the empty defense table when everyone was in place the judge went on the record and turned her chair directly to the jurors in a subdued tone she addressed them ladies and gentlemen of the jury i must inform you that because of factors that are not fully clear to you but will soon become so i have declared a mistrial in the case of california versus jason jessup i do this with great regret because all of us here have invested a great deal of time and effort in these proceedings she paused and studied the confused faces in front of her no one likes to invest so much time without seeing the case through to a result i am sorry for this but i do thank you for your duty you were all dependable and for the most part on time every day i also watched you closely during the testimony and you were all attentive the court cannot thank you enough you are dismissed now from this courtroom and discharged from jury duty you may all go home the jurors slowly filed back into the jury room many taking a last look back at the courtroom once they were gone the judge turned back to me mr haller for what its worth i thought you acquitted yourself quite well as a prosecutor i am sorry it ended this way but you are welcome back to this court anytime and on either side of the aisle thank you judge i appreciate that i had a lot of help then i commend your whole team as well with that the judge stood and left the bench i sat there for a long time listening to the gallery clear out behind me and thinking about what breitman had said at the end i wondered how and why such a good job in court had resulted in such a horrible thing happening in clive royces office mr haller i turned expecting it to be a reporter but it was two uniformed police officers detective bosch sent us we are here to take you and ms gleason into protective custody only ms gleason and shes right here sarah was waiting on the bench next to deputy solantzs desk sarah these officers are going to take care of you until jason jessup is in custody or i didnt need to finish sarah got up and walked over to us so theres no more trial she asked right the judge declared a mistrial that means if jessup is caught we would have to start over with a new jury she nodded and looked a little dumbfounded i had seen the look on the faces of many people who venture naively into the justice system they leave the courthouse wondering what just happened sarah gleason would be no different you should go with these men now sarah well be in touch as soon as we know what happens next she just nodded and they headed for the door i waited a while alone in the courtroom and then headed out to the hallway myself i saw several of the jurors being interviewed by the reporters i couldve watched but at the moment i wasnt interested in what anybody had to say about the case not anymore kate salters saw me and broke away from one of the clusters mickey can we talk now i dont feel like talking call me tomorrow the storys today mick i dont care i pushed by her in the direction of the elevators where are you going i didnt answer i got to the elevators and jumped through the open doors of a waiting car i moved into the rear corner and saw a woman standing by the panel she asked me the same question as salters where are you going home i said she pushed the button marked g and we went down thursday april pm bosch was stationed with wright in a borrowed office across the street from the checkers hotel it was the command post and although no one thought jessup would be stupid enough to walk in the front door of the hotel the position gave them a good view of the entire property as well as two of the other surveillance positions i dont know wright said staring out the window this guy is smart right i guess so bosch said then i dont see him making this move you know hed have already been here if he was hes probably halfway to mexico by now and were sitting here watching a hotel maybe if i were him id get down there and lie low try to spend as many days on the beach as i could before they found me and put me back in the q boschs phone began to buzz and he saw that it was his daughter im going to step out to take this he said to wright you got it covered here ive got it bosch answered the phone as he left the office for the hallway hey mads everything all right theres a police car outside now yeah i know i sent it there just an added precaution they had talked an hour earlier after maggie mcpherson had gotten them safely to a friends home in porter ranch he had told his daughter about jessup being out there and what had happened at royces office she didnt know about jessups nocturnal visit to their house two weeks earlier so they didnt catch that guy yet were working on it and im in the middle of stuff here stay close to aunt maggie and stay safe ill come get you as soon as this is over okay here aunt maggie wants to talk to you mcpherson took the phone harry whats the latest same as before were out looking for him and sitting on all the known locations im with wright at sarahs hotel be careful speaking of that wheres mickey he turned down protection hes at home right now but said hes coming up here okay sounds good ill talk to you later keep us posted i will bosch closed the phone and went back into the office wright was still at the window i think were wasting our time and should shut this down he said why whats going on just came over the radio they found the car jessup was using in venice hes nowhere near here bosch bosch knew that dumping the car in venice could merely be a misdirection drive out to the beach leave the car and then double back in a cab to downtown nonetheless he found himself reluctantly agreeing with wright they were spinning their wheels here damn it he said dont worry well get him im keeping one team here and one on your house everybody else im moving down into venice and the santa monica pier already covered got a couple teams on the beach and nobodys gone in or out of that location wright went on the sis band on the radio and started redeploying his men as bosch listened he paced the room trying to figure jessup out after a while he stepped back out to the hallway so as not to disturb wrights radio choreography and called larry gandle his boss at rhd its bosch just checking in you still at the hotel yeah but were about to clear and head to the beach i guess you heard they found the car yeah i was just there bosch was surprised with four victims at royces office he thought gandle would still be at the murder scene the cars clean gandle said jessup still has the weapon where are you now bosch asked on speedway gandle said we just hit the room jessup was using took a while to get the search warrant anything there not so far this fucking guy you see him in court wearing a suit and you think i dont know what you think but the reality was he was living like an animal what do you mean there are empty cans all over the place food still rotting in them food rotting on the counter trash everywhere he hung blankets over the windows to black it out like a cave he made it like a prison cell he was even writing on the walls all at once it hit him bosch knew who jessup had prepared the dungeon under the pier for what kind of food he asked what gandle asked the canned food what kind of food i dont know fruits and peachesall kinds of stuff you can get fresh in any store you walk into but he had it in cans like prison thanks lieutenant bosch closed the phone and walked quickly back into the office wright was off the radio now did your people go under the pier and check the storage room or just set up surveillance its a loose surveillance meaning they didnt check it out they checked the perimeter there was no sign that anybody went under the wall so they backed out and set up jessups there they missed him how do you know i just know lets go thursday april pm i stood at the picture window at the end of my living room and looked out at the city with the sun dropping behind it jessup was out there someplace like a rabid animal he would be hunted cornered and i had no doubt put down it was the inevitable conclusion to his play jessup was legally to blame but i couldnt help but think about my own culpability in these dark matters not in any legal sense but in a private internal sense i had to question whether consciously or not i had set all of this in motion on the day i sat with gabriel williams and agreed to cross a line in the courtroom as well as within myself maybe by allowing jessup his freedom i had determined his fate as well as that of royce and the others i was a defense attorney not a prosecutor i stood for the underdog not for the state maybe i had taken the steps and made the maneuvers so that there would never be a verdict and i would not have to live with it on my record and conscience such were the musings of a guilty man but they didnt last long my phone buzzed and i pulled it from my pocket without looking away from my view of the city haller its me i thought you were coming up here maggie mcfierce soon im just finishing up here everything all right for me yes but probably not for jessup are you watching the tv news no what are they showing theyve evacuated the santa monica pier channel five has a chopper over it theyre not confirming that its related to jessup but they said that lapds sis unit sought an okay from smpd to conduct a fugitive apprehension theyre on the beach moving in the dungeon did jessup grab somebody if he did theyre not saying did you call harry i just tried but he didnt pick up i think hes probably down there on the beach i broke away from the window and grabbed the television remote off the coffee table i snapped on the tv and punched in channel i have it on here i told maggie on the screen was an aerial view of the pier and the surrounding beach it looked like there were men on the beach and they were advancing on the piers underside from both the north and south i think youre right i said its gotta be him the dungeon he made down there was actually for himself like a safe house he could run to like the prison cell he was used to i wonder if he knows theyre coming in on him maybe he hears the helicopters harry said the waves under there are so loud you couldnt even hear a gunshot well we might be about to find that out we watched in silence for a few moments before i spoke maggie are the girls watching this god no theyre playing video games in the other room good they watched in silence the newscasters voice echoing over the line as he inanely described what was on the screen after a while maggie asked the question that had probably been on her mind all afternoon did you think it would come to this haller no did you no never i guess i thought everything would sort of be contained in the courtroom like it always is yeah at least jessup saved us the indignity of the verdict what do you mean we had him and he knew it you didnt watch any of the juror interviews did you what on tv yeah juror number ten is on every channel saying he wouldve voted not guilty you mean kirns yeah the alternate that got moved into the box everybody else interviewed said guilty guilty guilty but kirns said not guilty that we hadnt convinced him he wouldve hung the jury haller and you know williams wouldnt have signed on for round two jessup wouldve walked i considered this and could only shake my head everything was for nothing all it took was one juror with a grudge against society and jessup wouldve walked i looked up from the tv screen and out toward the western horizon to the distance where i knew santa monica hugged the edge of the pacific i thought i could see the media choppers circling i wonder if jessup will ever know that i said thursday april pm the sun was dropping low over the pacific and burning a brilliant green path across the surface bosch stood close to wright on the beach a hundred yards south of the pier they were both looking down at the video screen contained in a front pack strapped to wrights chest he was commanding the sis takedown of jason jessup on the screen was a murky image of the dimly lit storage facility under the pier bosch had been given ears but no mike he could hear the operations communications but could not contribute to them anything he had to say would have to go through wright the voices over the com were hard to hear because of the background sound of waves crashing beneath the pier this is five were in steady the visual wright commanded the focus on the video tightened and bosch could see that the camera was aimed at the individual storage rooms at the rear of the pier facility this one he pointed to the door he had seen jessup go through okay wright said our target is the second door from the right repeat second door from the right move in and take positions the video moved in a herkyjerky fashion to a new position now the camera was even closer three and four are the rest was wiped out by the sound of a crashing wave three and four say again wright said three four in position hold until my go topside you ready topside ready on the upper level of the evacuated pier there was another team which had placed small explosives at the corners of the trapdoor above the storage corral where they believed jessup was holed up on wrights command the sis teams would blow the trapdoor and move in from above and below wright wrapped his hand around the mike that ran along his jawline and looked at bosch you ready for this ready wright released his grip and gave the command to his teams okay lets give him a chance he said three you have the speaker up thats a go on the speaker youre hot in three two one wright spoke trying to convince a man hidden in a dark room a hundred yards away to give himself up jason jessup this is lieutenant stephen wright of the los angeles police department your position is surrounded top and bottom step out with your hands behind your head fingers laced move forward to the waiting officers if you deviate from this order you will be shot bosch pulled his earplugs out and listened he could hear the muffled sound of wrights words coming from under the pier there was no doubt that jessup could hear the order if he was under there you have one minute wright said as his final communication to jessup the lieutenant checked his watch and they waited at the thirtysecond mark wright checked with his men under the pier anything this is three i got nothing four clear wright gave bosch a wishful look like he had hoped it wouldnt come to this okay on my mark we go keep tight and no crossfire topside if you shoot you make sure you know who you there was movement on the video screen a door to one of the storage corrals flung open but not the door they were focused on the camera made a jerking motion left as it redirected its aim bosch saw jessup emerge from the darkness behind the open door his arms came up and together as he dropped into a combat pose gun wright yelled the barrage of gunfire that followed lasted no more than ten seconds but in that time at least four officers under the pier emptied their weapons the crescendo was punctuated by the unneeded detonation from the topside by then bosch had already seen jessup go down in the gunfire like a man in front of a firing squad his body seemed at first to be held upright by the force of multiple impacts from multiple angles then gravity set in and he fell to the sand after a few moments of silence wright was back on the com everybody safe count off all officers under and on top of the pier reported in safe check the suspect in the video bosch saw two officers approach jessups body one checked for a pulse while the other held his aim on the dead man hes tenseven secure the weapon got it wright killed the video and looked at bosch and thats that he said yeah im sorry you didnt get your answers me too they started walking up the beach to the pier wright checked his watch and went on the com announcing the official time of the shooting as pm bosch looked off across the ocean to his left the sun was now gone friday april pm harry bosch and i sat on opposite sides of a picnic table watching the mes disinterment team dig they were on the third excavation working beneath the tree where jason jessup had lit a candle in franklin canyon i didnt have to be there but wanted to be i was hoping for further evidence of jason jessups villainy as though that might make it easier to accept what had happened but so far in three excavations they had found nothing the team moved slowly stripping away the dirt one inch at a time and sifting and analyzing every ounce of soil they removed we had been here all morning and my hope had waned into a cold cynicism about what jessup had been doing up here on the nights he was followed a white canvas sheet had been strung from the tree to two poles planted outside the search zone this shielded the diggers from the sun as well as from the view of the media helicopters above someone had leaked word of the search bosch had the stack of files from the missing persons cases on the table he was ready to go with records and descriptors of the missing girls should any human remains be found i had simply come armed with the mornings newspaper and i read the frontpage story now for a second time the report on the events of the day before was the lead story in the times and was accompanied by a color photo of two sis officers pointing their weapons into the open trapdoor on the santa monica pier the story was also accompanied by a frontpage sidebar story on the sis headline another case another shooting siss bloody history i had the feeling this would be a story with legs so far no one in the media had found out that the sis knew jessup had obtained a gun when that got outand i was sure it wouldthere would no doubt be a firestorm of controversy further investigations and police commission inquiries the chief question being once it was established that it was likely that this man had a weapon why was he allowed to remain free it all made me glad i was no longer even temporarily in the employ of the state in the bureaucratic arena those kinds of questions and their answers have the tendency to separate people from their jobs i needed not worry about the outcome of such inquiries for my livelihood i would be returning to my officethe backseat of my lincoln town car i was going back to being private counsel for the defense the lines were cleaner there the mission clearer is maggie mcfierce coming bosch asked i put the paper down on the table no williams sent her back to van nuys her part in the case is over why isnt williams moving her downtown the deal was that we had to get a conviction for her to get downtown we didnt i gestured to the newspaper and we werent going to get one this one holdout juror is telling anybody wholl listen that he wouldve voted not guilty so i guess you can say gabriel williams is a man who keeps his word maggies going nowhere fast thats how it worked in the nexus of politics and jurisprudence and thats why i couldnt wait to go back to defending the damned we sat in silence for a while after that and i thought about my exwife and how my efforts to help her and promote her had failed so miserably i wondered if she would begrudge me the effort i surely hoped not it would be hard for me to live in a world where maggie mcfierce despised me they found something bosch said i looked up from my thoughts and focused one of the diggers was using a pair of tweezers to put something from the dirt into a plastic evidence bag soon she stood up and headed toward us with the bag she was kathy kohl the mes forensic archaeologist she handed bosch the bag and he held it up to look i could see that it contained a silver bracelet no bones kohl said just that were at thirtytwo inches down and its rare that you find a murder interment much further down than that so this ones looking like the other two you want us to keep digging bosch glanced at the bracelet in the bag and looked up at kohl how about another foot that going to be a problem a day in the field beats a day in the lab anytime you want us to keep digging well keep digging thanks doc you got it she went back to the excavation pit and bosch handed the evidence bag to me to examine it contained a charm bracelet there were clots of dirt in the links and its charms i could make out a tennis racket and an airplane do you recognize it i asked from one of the missing girls he gestured to the stack of files on the table no i dont remember anything about a charm bracelet in the lists it couldve just been lost up here by somebody thirtytwo inches down in the dirt so you think jessup buried it then maybe id hate to come away from this emptyhanded the guy had to have come up here for a reason if he didnt bury them here then maybe this was the kill spot i dont know i handed the bag back to him i think youre being too optimistic harry thats not like you well then what the hell do you think jessup was doing up here all those nights i think he and royce were playing us royce what are you talking about we were had harry face it bosch held the evidence bag up again and shook it to loosen the dirt it was a classic misdirection i said the first rule of a good defense is a good offense you attack your own case before you ever get to court you find its weaknesses and if you cant fix them then you find ways of deflecting attention away from them okay the biggest weakness to the defenses case was eddie roman royce was going to put a liar and a drug addict on the stand he knew that given enough time you would either find roman or find out things about him or both he needed to deflect keep you occupied with things outside the case at hand youre saying he knew we were following jessup he couldve easily guessed it i put up no real opposition to his request for an or release that was unusual and probably got royce thinking so he sent jessup out at night to see if there was a tail as we already considered before he probably even sent jessup to your house to see if he would engage a response and confirm surveillance when it didnt when it got no response royce probably thought he was wrong and dropped it after that jessup stopped coming up here at night and he probably thought he was in the clear to go build his dungeon under the pier it makes sense doesnt it bosch took a long time to answer he put his hand on top of the stack of files so what about all these missing girls he asked its all just coincidence i dont know i said we may never know now all we know is that theyre still missing and if jessup was involved then that secret probably died with him yesterday bosch stood up a troubled look on his face he was still holding the evidence bag im sorry harry yeah me too where do you go from here bosch shrugged the next case my name goes back into the rotation what about you i splayed my hands and smiled you know what i do you sure about that you made a damn good prosecutor yeah well thanks for that but you gotta do what you gotta do besides theyd never let me back on that side of the aisle not after this what do you mean theyre going to need somebody to blame for all of this and its going to be me i was the one who let jessup out you watch the cops the times even gabriel williams will eventually bring it around to me but thats okay as long as they leave maggie alone i know my place in the world and im going to go back to it bosch nodded because there was nothing else to say he shook the bag with the charm bracelet again and worked it with his fingers removing more dirt from its surfaces he then held it up to study closely and i could tell he saw something what is it his face changed he was keying on one of the charms rubbing dirt off it through the plastic bag he then handed it to me take a look what is that the charm was still tarnished and dirty it was a square piece of silver less than a half inch wide on one side there was a tiny swivel at center and on the other what looked like a bowl or a cup looks like a teacup on a square plate i suggested i dont know no turn it over thats the bottom i did and i saw what he saw its one of those a mortarboard a graduation cap and this swivel on the top was for the tassel yeah the tassels missing probably still in the dirt okay so whats it mean bosch sat back down and quickly started looking through the files you dont remember the first girl i showed you and maggie valerie schlicter she disappeared a month after graduating from riverside high okay so you think bosch found the file and opened it it was thin there were three photos of valerie schlicter including one of her in her graduation cap and gown he quickly scanned the few documents that were in the file nothing here about a charm bracelet he said because it probably wasnt hers i said this is a long shot dont you think he acted as though i had said nothing his mind shutting out any opposing response im going to have to go out there she had a mother and a brother see whos still around and can look at this thing harry you sure you you think i have a choice he stood back up took the evidence bag back from me and gathered up the files i could almost hear the adrenaline buzzing through his veins a dog with a bone it was time for bosch to go he had a long shot in his hand but it was better than no shot it would keep him moving i got up too and followed him to the excavation he told kohl that he had to go check out the bracelet he told her to call him if anything else was found in the hole we moved to the gravel parking lot bosch walking quickly and not looking back to see if i was still with him we had driven separately to the dig hey i called to him wait up he stopped in the middle of the lot what technically im still the prosecutor assigned to jessup so before you go rushing off tell me what the thinking is here he buried the bracelet here but not her does that even make sense nothing makes sense until i id the bracelet if somebody tells me it was hers then we try to figure it out remember when jessup was up here we couldnt get close to him it was too risky so we dont know exactly what he was doing he couldve been looking for this okay i can maybe see that i gotta go he continued on to his car it was parked next to my lincoln i called after him let me know okay he looked back at me when he got to his car yeah he said i will he then dropped into the car and i heard it roar to life bosch drove like he walked pulling out quickly and throwing dust and gravel into the air a man on a mission i got in the lincoln and followed him out of the park and up to mulholland drive after that i lost him on the curving road ahead the author wishes to thank several people for their help in the research and writing of this book they include asya muchnick michael pietsch
