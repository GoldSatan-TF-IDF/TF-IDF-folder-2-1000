jonathan kellerman the clinic book in the alex delaware series to beverly lewis few murder streets are lovely this one was elmshaded a softly curving stroll to the university lined with generous haciendas and california colonials above lawns as unblemished as fresh billiard felt giant elms hope devane had bled to death under one of them a block from her home on the southwest corner i looked at the spot again barely exposed by a reluctant moon the nightquiet was broken only by crickets and the occasional latemodel welltuned car locals returning home months past the curiousonlooker stage milo lit up a cigarillo and blew smoke out the window cranking my window down i continued to stare at the elm a twisting trunk as thick as a freeway pylon supported sixty feet of opaque foliage stout grasping branches appeared frosted in the moonlight some so laden they brushed the ground five years since the city had last pruned street trees propertytax shortfall the theory was that the killer had hidden under the canopy though no hint of presence other than bicycle tracks a few feet away was ever found three months later theory was all that remained and not much of that milo s unmarked ford shared the block with two other cars both mercedeses both with parking permits on their windshields after the murder the city had promised to trim the elms no followthrough yet milo had told me about it with some bitterness cursing politicians but really damning the cold case a couple of news stories then nada current events as fast food id said quick greasy forgettable arent we the cynic professional training aiming for rapport with the patient that had gotten a laugh out of him now he frowned brushed hair off his forehead and blew wobbly smoke rings edging the car up the block he parked again thats her house he pointed to one of the colonials smallish but wellkept white board front four columns dark shutters shiny fittings on a shiny door three steps up from the sidewalk a flagstone path cut through the lawn a picket gate blocked the driveway two upstairs windows were amber behind pale curtains someone home i said thats his volvo in the driveway lightcolored station wagon hes always home said milo once he gets in he never leaves still mourning he shrugged she drove a little red mustang she was a lot younger than him how much younger fifteen years what about him interests you the way he acts when i talk to him nervous unhelpful paz and fellows thought so too for what thats worth he didnt think much of the first detectives on the case and the common ground probably bothered him as much as anything well i said isnt the husband always the first suspect though stabbing her out on the street doesnt sound typical true he rubbed his eyes braining her in the bedroom would have been more marital but it happens twirling the cigar live long enough everything happens where exactly were the bicycle tracks just north of the body but i wouldnt make much of those lab guys say they could have been anywhere from one to ten days old a neighbor kid a student a fitness freak anyone and no one i talked to when i did the doortodoor noticed an unusual biker that whole week whats an unusual biker someone who didnt fit in someone nonwhite whatever works quiet neighborhood like this i said its surprising no one saw or heard anything at eleven pm coroner said its possible she didnt scream no defense wounds no tentatives so she probably didnt struggle much true id read the autopsy findings read the entire file starting with paz and fellowss initial report and ending with the pathologists dictated drone and the packet of postmortem photos how many such pictures had i seen over the years it never got easier no scream i said because of the heart wound coroner said it could have collapsed the heart put her into instant shock he snapped thick fingers softly then ran his hand over his face as if washing without water what i could see of his profile was heavy as a walruss pocked and fatigued he smoked some more i thought again of the preautopsy photos hope devanes body icewhite under the coroners lights three deep purple stab wounds in closeup chest crotch just above the left kidney the forensic scenario was that shed been taken by surprise and dispatched quickly by the blow that exploded her heart then slashed a second time above the vagina and finally laid facedown on the sidewalk and stabbed in the back a husband doing that i said i know youve seen worse but it seems so calculated this husbands an intellectual right a thinker smoke escaped the car in wisps decaying instantly at the touch of night air truth is alex i want it to be seacrest for selfish reasons cause if its not him its a goddamn logistical nightmare too many suspects oh yeah he said almost singing it lots of people who couldve hated her a selfhelp book changed hope devanes life wolves and sheep wasnt the first thing she published a psychology monograph and three dozen journal articles had earned her a full professorship at thirtyeight two years before her death tenure had given her job security and the freedom to enter the public eye with a book the tenure committee wouldnt have liked wolves made the bestseller lists for a month earning her center ring in the media circus and more money than she could have accumulated in ten years as a professor she was suited to the public eye blessed with the kind of refined blond good looks that played well on the small screen that and a soft modulated voice that came across confident and reasonable over the radio meant she had no trouble getting publicity bookings and she made the most of each one for despite wolvess subtitle why men inevitably hurt women and what women can do to avoid it and its indicting tone her public persona was that of an intelligent articulate thoughtful pleasant woman entering the public arena with reluctance but performing graciously i knew all that but had little understanding of the person shed been milo had left me three lapd evidence boxes to review her resume audio and videotapes some newspaper coverage the book all passed along by paz and fellows theyd never studied any of it hed told me about inheriting the case the night before sitting across the table from robin and me at a seafood place in santa monica the bar was crowded but half the booths were empty and we sat in a corner away from sports on bigscreen and frightened people trying to connect with strangers midway through the meal robin left for the ladies room and milo said guess what i got for christmas christmas is months away maybe thats why this is no gift cold case three months cold hope devane why now cause its dead the new lieutenant he dipped a shrimp in sauce and put the whole thing in his mouth as he chewed his jaw bunched he kept looking around the room even though there was nothing to see new lieutenant same old pattern he was the only acknowledged gay detective in the lapd would never be fully accepted his twentyyear climb to detective iii had been marked by humiliation sabotage periods of benign neglect nearviolence his solve record was excellent and sometimes that helped keep the hostility under the surface his quality of life depended upon the attitude of the superiorofthemoment the new one was baffled and nervous but too preoccupied with a dispirited postriot department to pay too much attention to milo he gave it to you because he thinks its a lowprobability solve he smiled as if savoring a private joke also he said he figures devane might have been a lesbian should be right up your ahem ahem alley sturgis another shrimp disappeared his lumpy face remained static and he folded his napkin double then unfolded it his necktie was a horrid brownandochre paisley fighting a duel with his gray houndstooth jacket his black hair now flecked with white had been chopped nearly to the skin at the sides but the top had been left long and the sideburns were still long and completely snowy is there any indication she was gay i said nope but she had tough things to say about men so ergo ipso facto robin returned shed reapplied her lipstick and had fluffed her hair the royalblue dress intensified the auburn the silk accentuated every movement wed spent some time on a pacific island and her olive skin had held on to the tan id killed a man there clear selfdefense saving robins life as well as mine sometimes i still had nightmares you two look serious she said slipping into the booth our knees touched doing my homework said milo i know how much this guy enjoyed school so i thought id share it he just got the hope devane murder i said i thought theyd given up on that they have what a terrifying thing something in her voice made me look at her more terrifying i said than any other murder in some ways alex good neighborhood like that you go for a walk right outside your house and someone jumps out and cuts you i placed my hand on top of hers she didnt seem to notice the first thing i thought of she said was she was killed because of her views and that would make it terrorism but even if it was just some nut picking her at random its still terrorism in a sense personal freedom in this city kicked another notch lower our knees moved apart her fingers were delicate icicles well she said at least youre on it milo anything so far not yet he said situation like this what you do is start fresh lets hope for the best in the kindest of times optimism was a strain for him the words sounded so outofcharacter he could have been auditioning for summer stock also he said i thought alex might be able to help me dr devane being a psychologist did you know her alex i shook my head the waiter came over more wine yes i said another bottle the next morning milo brought me the boxes and left on top was the academic resume her full name was hope alice devane father andre mother charlotte both deceased under marital status shed typed married but she hadnt listed philip seacrests name children none shed been born in california in a town id never heard of called higginsville probably somewhere in the center of the state because shed graduated from bakersfield high school as class valedictorian and a national merit scholar before enrolling at uc berkeley as a regents scholar deans list every quarter phi beta kappa graduation with a summa cum laude degree in psychology then continuation at berkeley for her phd shed published her first two papers as a graduate student and moved to la for clinical training internship and postdoctoral fellowship crosstown in the psychiatry department at county general hospital then an appointment as a lecturer in womens studies at the university and a transfer the following year to the psychology department as an assistant professor next came ten pages of society memberships scholarly publications abstracts papers delivered at conferences her first research topic had been differential achievement in girls and boys on mathematics tests then shed shifted gears to sex roles and childrearing methods and once again to sex roles as they affected selfcontrol an average of five articles a year in solid journals premium gas for a ferrari on the tenure fast track it could have been any cv until i came to the tail end of the bibliography section where a subheading entitled nonpeer review publication and media work gave an inkling of the turn shed taken during the year before her death wolves and sheep along with its foreign editions followed by scores of radio and tv and print interviews appearances on afternoon talk shows shows with titles like fight back dogging the predator the new slaves the testosterone conspiracy the final section was departmental and campus activities and it brought things back to dusty academia as an assistant professor shed sat on four committees scheduling and room allocation graduate student orientation animalsubject safety the kind of drudgery i knew well then six months before her death shed chaired something called interpersonal conduct that id never heard of something to do with sexual harassment exploitation of students by faculty that was something with hostility potential i placed a check next to the notation and moved on to wolves and sheep the book jacket was matte red with embossed gold letters and a small black graphic between author and title silhouettes of the eponymous animals the wolfs mouth was crammed with fangs and its claws reached out for the undersized sheep on the back was hope devanes color photo she had an oval face and sweet features wore a beige cashmere suit and pearls and sat very straight in a brown suede chair backed by shelves of books in soft focus montblanc pen in hand sterling inkwell within reach long fingers pinkpolished nails honeyblond hair swept back from fine bones the cheeks accentuated by blush light brown eyes clear and wide and direct soft without being weak a confident possibly ironic smile on nacreous lips the pages were dogeared and milo s yellow underlining and pen scrawl were all over the margins i read the book drove two miles down beverly glen and over to the university where i played with the biomed library computers for a while interesting results i returned home watched the talkshow tapes four shows four sets of noisy giddy audiences a quartet of smarmy pseudosensitive and altogether interchangeable hosts the yolanda michaels show what makes a real woman hope devane tolerating the metalgrind rhetoric of an antifeminist woman who preached the virtues of bible study cosmetics and greeting ones husband at the door in a seethrough raincoat over nothing else sid live prisoners of sex hope devane engaged in debate with a male anthropologistant specialist who believed all sex differences were inborn and unchangeable and that men and women should simply learn to live with one another hope trying to be reasonable but the end result falling just short of shallow the gina sydney jerome show hope devane in a roundtable discussion with three other authors a woman linguist who poohpoohed psychology and recommended that men and women learn to interpret language correctly a new yorkbased syndicated columnist on womens issues who had nothing to say but said it polysyllabically and a depressedlooking man who claimed to have been a battered husband and had stretched the account of his torment to three hundred pages same old noise live with morry mayhew whos really the weaker sex hope devane debating the selfstyled head of a mensrights organization id never heard of who went after her with misogynistic lust this one different the hostility level ratcheted up several notches i rewound and watched it again the misogynist was named karl neese thirty or so lean and outwardly hip in all black and a stylish haircut but neanderthal in his point of view hogging the airtime and layering insults relentlessly psychodrama parmigiana his target never fought back never interrupted never raised her voice even when neeses comments drew applause from louts in the audience mayhew okay mr neese now lets ask the doctor neese doctor i dont see any stethoscope mayhew she happens to be a phd neese am i supposed to be impressed by that what does phd mean anyway piled higher and deeper papa has dough mayhew suppressing smile okay dr devane now if you could please tell us neese tell us why feminists keep harping on about their problems nag nag nag but its okay to abort on demand because babies are inconvenient mayhew your theory of why women fall prey so often to unscrupulous neese because they want unscrupulous bad guys danger excitement and they keep coming back for more they say they want nice but just try to pick up a woman using nice nice means weak and weak means geek and geek gets no peek laughter applause hope devane you may actually have something there neese oh i do baby i do leering devane sometimes we do fall into dangerous patterns the crux i believe is in the lessons we learn as children neese show me yours ill show you mine mayhew smiling cmon karl what kinds of lessons doctor devane the role models we learn from the behaviors were taught to emulate twenty more minutes of his double entendres and her reasoned statements each time he got the crowd hooting she waited until things quieted before offering brief precise replies that had nothing to do with him sticking to her own agenda by the end of the show people were listening and neese was looking offbalance i watched it again concentrating on hope and what made her effective she made eye contact in a fearless way that established intimacy projected an unflappability that made the obvious seem profound charisma calm charisma if the medium was the message she was a brilliant courier and i couldnt help thinking of what she might have accomplished had she lived when the segment ended the camera caught a closeup of neeses face no more wiseguy grin serious angry it was a crazy idea but could he have held on to the anger why not the case was cold and milo had asked me to hypothesize away i wrote down neeses name and reached for the homicide file words pictures always pictures it was close to five when i called milo at west la detectives and told him id finished everything including the book that was fast easy read she had a good style conversational as if shes sitting in your living room sharing her knowledge whatd you think of the contents a lot of whats in there is hard to argue with stick up for your rights take care of yourself choose your goals realistically so you can succeed and enhance your selfesteem but when it comes to the more radical stuff she doesnt present facts to back it up the part about testosterone and sadistic psychopathy is a pretty big stretch all men are sex killers all men have the potential to be sex killers and even consensual sex is partial rape because the penis is constructed as a weapon and penetration means invasion and loss of womens control shes big on control isnt she its her main theme i went to the library and checked out the studies she quoted they dont say what she claims they do she took facts out of context reported selectively played fast and loose but unless you took the time to carefully examine each source it wouldnt be obvious and apart from her writing skill i can see why the book sold so well she had a natural constituency because women almost always are the victims you heard robin last night when we got home she told me the murder had kept her up nights because she found herself identifying with hope i never knew shed given it a moments thought what about the tv tapes she was good at that too unflappable even when they put that moron against her on mayhew she never lost her cool remember him skinny idiot in black he really dumped on her didnt he but she handled him beautifully never let him get to her to me she came out the clear winner and he looked mad what if he held a grudge silence youve got to be kidding you said be creative those shows are powder kegs dealing with sensitive issues exploiting people on the edge exactly what i was trained not to do as a therapist ive always thought it was only a matter of time before things got violent hmm he said okay ill look into him what was his name karl neese he repeated it wouldnt that be something okay any other thoughts about hope thats it so far how about you nothing i get a feeling hubbys holding something back and your buddies at the u are no help quoting me statistics about how if it takes too long to solve a case forget it also they treat me like joe cretin talking real sloow class snobbery maybe coming in rubbing my knuckles on the ground while scarfing a banana was the wrong approach i laughed you should have dropped your masters degree into the conversation oh sure that would really impress a bunch of phds so what do you think of the wounds does that groin stab make it sexual if it was intentional it would show definite sexual hostility oh it was intentional all right three clean cuts no error wounds no hacking around he got her exactly where he wanted heart groin back when you put it that way it sounds orchestrated i said a definite sequence how so stabbing her in the heart first could be romantic in a sick sense breaking someones heart maybe some kind of revenge though i guess he could have chosen the heart in order to kill her quickly but wouldnt a throat slash have been a better bet for that definitely the hearts not that easy to hit you can nick ribs miss completely most quickkill knife jobs are throat slashes what about the other wounds the groin i said thinking of hopes composure and impeccable clothes every hair in place left bleeding on the street the groin could be an extension of the heart wound love gone wrong the sexual element if so the back would be the coup de grâce back stabbing the symbol of betrayal to stab her in the back he said he had to take the time to flip her over and place her on her stomach thats why i got interested when you said orchestrated think of it youre standing there on the street just killed someone you take the time to do something like that to me it says crime of passion but carried out in a calculated manner cold rage i said criminal intimacy someone she knew which is exactly why im interested in hubby but for someone like her intimacy could mean something totally different her book tour took her out in front of millions of people she could have triggered rage in any of them even a delusional rage someone who didnt like the way she signed a book someone who watched her on tv and related to it pathologically fames like stripping in a dark theater milo you never know whos out there he was silent for a few moments gee thanks for expanding my suspect list to infinity heres something that never made it into the papers her routine was to take a halfhour to onehour walk every night around the same time tenthirty eleven usually she walked with her dog a rottweiler but that day it came down with serious stomach problems and spent the night at the vets convenient huh poisoned i called the vet this morning and he said he never worked the dog up cause it got better by morning but the symptoms could have been consistent with eating something nasty on the other hand he said dogs eat garbage all the time did this one not that he knew and its too late now to run tests something else paz and fellows never thought to ask about poisoning the dog i said someone watching her for a while learning her habits or someone who already knew them wouldnt a husband fit perfectly into this lovesexrevenge orchestration thing someone whod been cuckolded had this husband been cuckolded dont know but assume yes and if seacrest was smarter than the average betrayed husband colder what better way to deflect suspicion than make it look like a street crime but were talking a middleaged history professor with no record of domestic violence no violence period theres always a first time he said any idea how he dealt with her fame no like i said hes not helpful it could have been a rough spot in their relationship he was older possibly more prominent academically til she wrote the book and maybe he didnt take well to being discussed on tv though on the tapes i saw she talked about him fondly yeah he said philips attuned to a womans needs but hes the rare exception a little patronizing maybe another thing i said i never heard any feminist outcry about her death or the fact that it hadnt been solved maybe because she wasnt affiliated with any feminist groups at least i didnt see any listed in her resume true he said a loner she did the usual committee things joined academic societies but nothing political despite the tone of the book and speaking of the resume one thing caught my eye she chaired something called the interpersonal conduct committee it sounds like it might have something to do with sexual harassment maybe handling complaints by students against faculty which could have been another source of controversy what if she put someones career in jeopardy interpersonal conduct i never noticed that it was just a notation at the end thanks for paying attention yeah that sounds interesting want to do me a favor and check it out on campus the department head hasnt returned my calls since the first time i spoke to him ed gabelle yeah whats he like a politician i said sure ill ask thanks now let me tell you what gets me about professor devane the discrepancy between what she wrote and the way she acted on tv in the book she basically tagged all men as scum youd think she was a majorleague manhater but on the tapes she comes across as a woman who likes guys sure she thinks weve got some things to work out maybe she even pities us a little but the overall attitude is friendliness alex she seemed comfortable with men more than that i guess to me she came across as the kind of gal you could have a couple of beers with more like champagne cocktails i said okay granted and not at the dewdrop inn paneled lounge at the bel air hotel but the contrast is still dramatic at least to me you know i said you could say the same thing about the resume the first half was all bythebook academic the second was media star almost as if she were two separate people and another thing maybe im not the best judge but to me she was sexy on the tube seductive the way she made eye contact with the camera gave that little smile crossed her legs showing a little thigh the way she said plenty by not saying anything those could have been shrinks pauses we learn to use silence to get others to open up then she sure learned well okay what if she was sexy im wondering if she was the type to get involved in something dangerous am i poppsyching myself into a corner maybe what youre really talking about is compartmentalization separating aspects of her life putting them in little boxes maybe little secret boxes he said and secrets can get dangerous on the other hand could be weve got something stupid a stone nutso who saw her on the tube and god told him to kill her or a psychopath out stalking blonds on the westside and she just happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time god forbid okay i appreciate the time alex gonna be working late right here if you think of anything else ill try ed gabelle on that conduct committee call you if it gets interesting its already interesting he said then he cursed ed gabelle was an aggressively casual physiological psychologist with a thick thatch of gray hair a tiny mouth and a whiny singsong voice that sometimes veered toward an english accent his specialty was creating lesions in cockroach neurons and observing the results lately id heard hed been trying to get grant money to study drug abuse it was just after lunchtime and i found him leaving the faculty club wearing blue jeans a denim shirt and an outspoken yellow paisley tie his obligatory greeting faded fast when i told him what i wanted the police alex he said pityingly why ive worked with them before have you well im afraid i cant help you on this it wasnt a departmental issue whose was it it was lets just say hope was somewhat of an individualist you know what i mean that book of hers not wellreceived in the department no no thats not what im getting at she was brilliant im sure the book made her money but she wasnt much for affiliation no time for colleagues exactly what about students students as if it were a foreign word i assume she had some well nice seeing you alex the committee i said youre telling me it was solely her project he licked his lips what was it all about ed i really cant get into that its a closed issue anyway not anymore murder changes everything does it he began walking at least tell me all ill tell you he said stretching the whine is that i cant tell you anything take it up with a higher power such as the dean of students when i told the deans secretary what i was after her voice closed up like a fatladen artery and she said shed get back to me hanging up without getting my number i phoned milo again he said asscovering i like it okay ill take on the dean myself thanks for reading that resume so carefully thats what you pay me for he laughed then turned serious so obviously hope ruffled someones feathers with this committee and speaking of ruffling ive got a number for the assistant producer of the mayhew show want to follow through for me so i can concentrate on persecuting academics sure i said suzette band he said reading off a hollywood exchange she probably wont call back without a hassle so feel free to be extremely annoying it took five times to reach suzette band but when she finally came on her voice was pleasant and amused the police one adam twelve one adam twelve committing felony impersonation of a police officer seemed easier than explaining my precise role so i said do you remember a guest you had on last year professor hope devane oh yes of course that was terrible has her murderer been caught no well please tell us when he is wed love to do a followup im serious bet you are ill do my best ms band in the meantime maybe you can help us there was another guest on with professor devane a man named karl neese what about him wed like to speak to him why oh no you cant be serious she laughed thats a scream no i can see why youd but dont waste your time with karl why not long pause is this on tape or something no silence ms band youre sure this isnt being taped positive whats the problem well the person you really want to speak to is eileen pietsch the producer but shes traveling ill have her office call you when why waste time if karls someone we shouldnt worry about he really isnt its just that we our show karls a professional guest i didnt say that then why shouldnt we worry about him listen i shouldnt be talking to you at all but i dont want you making a big deal about this and getting the show bad exposure lord knows weve had plenty of that with all the bluenoses in washington hunting for scapegoats we feel we provide a bona fide public service and karl was part of that i heard a sigh on the other end okay i said so he was paid to come on and be the professors foil i wouldnt put it that way but hes an actor right if i go through the sag book or the agent rosters i can probably find him look she said louder then she sighed again yes hes an actor but for all i know he really does hold those views then why shouldnt i worry about him things got pretty nasty between him and professor devane but that was boy you dont let up okay to be perfectly honest karl is a pro but hes a really nice guy weve used him before and so have other shows we bring guys like him on to spice things up especially with professors because those types can be dry all the shows do it some of the others even salt the audience we never do that so youre saying he wasnt really hostile toward professor devane of course not hes mellow in fact i think we had him on our nice guy show a year ago you know finishing last and all that hes quite good adaptable one of those faces you forget so no one remembers theyve seen him before we stick a beard on them or a wig people arent that observant anyway id still like to speak to him do you have a number handy another pause tell you what ill make you a deal do i get to choose between the money and whats behind curtain number three very funny she said but the friendliness was back in her voice heres the deal call me as soon as you get a solve on the murder so we can have first dibs on a followup show and ill give you karl okay i pretended to deliberate okay excellent hey maybe you can come on too ace detective and all that do you photograph well camera lights turn my eyes red but my fangs stay white ha ha very funny youd probably do real well weve had cops on before but most of them are pretty wooden like professors like professors most people are wooden without help or some big story to tell i watched professor devanes tape i said she seemed pretty good you know she was class act really knew how to work the audience its really terrible about what happened to her she could have become a regular karl neeses number was out in the valley but his machine said to reach him at work if it was about a part bo bancrofts mens fashions on robertson boulevard i looked up the address between beverly and third right off designer row at this hour a twentyminute drive the store was closetsized full of mirrors weathered brazilian antiques painted with roses and religious icons and racks of threethousanddollar suits discoremixed easy listening on the sound system two people working both in black a blond girl with bored eyes behind the register and neese folding cashmere sweaters since the show the actor had let his hair grow to his shoulders and raised a prickly beard in person he looked younger pale and hungrylooking very long very white fingers i introduced myself and told him why i was there he finished folding and turned around slowly youre kidding wish i was mr neese you know right after it happened i wondered if someone would call me whys that because the show got nasty nastier than it was supposed to get no they paid me for nasty go out and be an asshole he laughed hows that for artistic direction what else did they tell you they gave me her book told me to read it so id know what she was about then come on like a schmuck get on her case to the max not a bad gig actually six months ago i was on xavier as an incestuous father with no remorse cheap beard and sunglasses and a shirt i wouldnt be caught dead in but even with that i kept worrying some idiot would see me on the street and take a punch you do a lot of this not as much as id like to it pays five six hundred a throw but therere only so many openings a year anyway im not saying its weird for you to come by see if im the big bad wolf but im not the night she was killed i was doing dinner theater out in costa mesa man of la mancha four hundred senior citizens saw me he smiled at least fuzzily hell some of them might even have been sober heres the producers number he read off a exchange then said too bad about what her being killed i didnt like her but she was sharp really handled my bullshit beautifully youd be amazed how many cant cope even when they know whats going down so she knew of course we never had a formal rehearsal but they did get us together before the show in the greenroom i told her id be coming on like frankenstein with a militia card she said fine so why didnt you like her because she tried to psych me out right before we went on acted friendly to me when the producer was there all through makeup but the minute we were alone she sidled in close to me talking in my ear almost seductively telling me shed met plenty of actors and every one of them was screwed up psychologically uncomfortable with their identities is the way she put it playing roles to feel in control he chuckled which is true but who the hell wants to hear it think she was trying to intimidate you she was definitely trying to intimidate me and what was the point it was all phony bullshit like tv wrestling i was the bad guy she was the good guy we both knew shed be tossing my ass on the mat so why gild the lily playing roles to feel in control little boxes maybe hope had seen herself as an actress returning home i called the producer of the costa mesa production his assistant checked her logs and verified that karl neese had indeed been onstage the night of the murder yeah that was one of our better ones she said good ticket sales still on hardly nothing lasts long in california milo checked in at ten to five any protein in the house im sure i can find something start looking the thrill of the hunt is ripe in my nostrils and i am hungry he sounded exhilarated the visit to the dean was productive i said feed me and ill tell you ill be over in half an hour no shortage of protein robin and i had just shopped and the new refrigerator was double the capacity of the old one i made him a roast beef sandwich the white kitchen seemed vast too big too white i was still getting used to the new house the old one had been eighteen hundred square feet of silvered redwood weathered shingles tinted glass and halfmad angles built from antique materials and recycled wood by a hungarian artist whod gone broke in la and returned to budapest to sell russian cars id bought it years ago seduced by the site deep in the foothills north of beverly glen and separated from neighbors by a wide patch of thickly wooded hightable public land it afforded a privacy that had me encountering more coyotes than people the seclusion had proved perfect for the psychopath who burned the house down one dry summer night tinder on a foundation the fire marshal had called it robin and i decided to rebuild after a couple of false starts with miscreant contractors she began supervising the construction herself we ended up with twentysix hundred square feet of white stucco and gray ceramic roof whitewashed wood floors and stairs brass railings skylights and as many windows as the energyconservation regulations would allow at the rear of the property was the workshop where robin went happily each morning accompanied by spike our french bulldog several old trees had been immolated but we craned in boxed eucalyptus and canary island pines and coast redwoods dug a new japanese garden and a pond full of young koi robin loved it the few people wed had over said it had come out great milos appraisal was tray chick but i like it anyway i nodded and smiled and remembered the slightly moldy smell of old wood in the morning arthritic casement windows the creak of footpolished pine floorboards adding a pickle to milos sandwich i put the plate back in the giant fridge brewed some coffee and reviewed the notes on my most recent custody consultation to family court both parents engineers two adopted sons ages three and five the mother had fled to a dude ranch in idaho the father was furious and illequipped for child care the boys were painfully polite but their drawings said they had a good fix on the situation the judge whod referred the case was a capable man but the dolt to whom it had been transferred rarely read reports lawyers on both sides were miffed that i didnt agree with their respective party lines lately robin and i had started talking about having children of our own i was working on a final draft of the report when the bell rang i went to the front looked through the peephole saw milos big face and opened the door his unmarked was parked crookedly behind robins pickup from the rear came the buzz of a power saw then spikes helpimchoking bark yo pooch he looked at his timex hows that for time five minutes from campus you really should set a better example grinning he wiped his feet on the mat and stomped in the new persian rug was soft with a silky sheen and i supposed i liked it just fine none of my art had come through the fire and the walls were bare as fresh notepaper old house or new the kitchen remained milos magnet as he continued toward it light shot in from above and bleached him giant snowman by the time i got there he had the sandwich out with a carton of milk and was sitting at the table he ate it in three bites want another no thanks yeah why not raising the carton to his lips he drained it then patted his gut this month he was cutting back on alcohol and his weight had dropped a bit maybe to most of it saddled his middle and swelled his face the long legs that stretched him to sixthree werent particularly thin but the contrast made them seem that way he wore a pale green blazer over a white shirt and black tie brown pants and tan suede desert boots hed shaved closely except for a small gray patch behind his left ear and the lumps on his face stood out like unfinished clay modeling static made his hair dance as i prepared a second sandwich he began pulling papers out of his briefcase spoils of the hunt potential enemies list he wiped his lips with the back of his hand nixon had nothing over professor devane i brought him the food delicious he said chomping where do you get the meat at the supermarket you do the shopping now hey you can run for president or do you and the little lady take turns the little lady i said care to call her that to her face he laughed actually this case has gotten me thinking used to consider myself excluded from the whole genderbender thing but the truth is all of us with y chromosomes were brought up as little savages werent we anyway the dean turned out to be fun nice and squirrelly when i finally got in to see him which wasnt easy til i started flashing the badge and talking media exposure of the conduct committee then all of a sudden im ushered into the sanctum sanctorum and hes offering me coffee shaking my hand telling me theres no reason to bring up the committee it was inconsequential not to mention provisional and of short duration the whole thing was disbanded because of constitutional and freespeech concerns he pulled a folder out of his briefcase luckily hes assuming i know more than i did so i bluff say ive heard differently around campus he says no way its a dead issue i say professor devanes dead too why dont you just start from the beginning sir which he does he shook the carton any more milk i got him some and he gulped and wiped his lip you were right about it being a sexualharassment thing but not between students and faculty between students and students professor devanes idea they heard three cases all girls whod taken her class on sexroles and complained to her devane didnt go through official channels just winged it notifying the complainants and the accused setting up a little tribunal the students had no idea it was unofficial no says the dean really ethical huh oh boy i said constitutional and freespeech concerns more like financial concerns as in lawsuit he wouldnt admit that but thats the picture i got then he tells me the committee couldnt have had anything to do with the murder but when i asked him why not he didnt have an answer then he says it would be a grave error to go public one that could cause problems for the police department because all the participants accusers and defendants had demanded strict confidentiality and they might sue us when i didnt answer he threatened to call the police chief i sat there and smiled he picked up the phone put it down started begging i said i understand your position and i dont want to make problems so give me all your written records without a hassle and ill exercise maximum discretion he waved the folder transcripts of the three sessions hope taped them why who knows maybe she was planning another book incidentally the dean said she put up a fuss about having the committee kiboshed academic freedom and all that then wolves and sheep came out and she lost interest maybe she intended to use it as material for the publicity tour the dean suspected that too he said he warned her that shed be putting herself in a dangerous position legally that according to the university lawyers since she hadnt gotten official approval shed been functioning as an independent psychologist when she chaired the committee not as a faculty member so if she divulged information shed be violating patient confidentiality and putting her license in jeopardy she took issue with that and threatened to hire her own lawyer but apparently changed her mind because that was the end of it its amazing none of this ever came out after the murder everyone had a vested interest in keeping it quiet administration students especially the students he gave me the file read it when you have a chance let me know what you think i cant close my eyes to this even though i still like hubby even better now because i just got a look at her tax returns the book made her rich he nodded but even before then she had some interesting extracurricular activities ever hear of robert barone i shook my head bigshot lawyer does criminal defense porn and censorship some racketeering cases some entertainment work same thing right last year he paid her forty grand in consulting fees year before that twentyeight diminishedcapacity reports probably something like that barone has offices here in century city and up in san francisco he isnt returning my calls drinking more milk he said her other consulting client is a beverly hills doctor named milan cruvic hes listed in the directory as an obgyn and fertility expert any idea why a fertility expert would pay a psychologist thirtysix grand a year two years in a row maybe she screened candidates for fertility treatment is that standard op the procedures can be grueling a thoughtful doctor might want to see which patients could handle them or provide counseling for those who couldnt so why not just refer to her why pay her directly out of his pocket good question when i called cruvics office his nurse said he was doing public service at some womens clinic which could mean abortions another potential point of hostility if hope got involved in that too abortion violence hasnt come bigtime to la but we get everything eventually and that creep on tv neese threw the issue around pegged her as ms slicethefetus radical feminist who knows maybe some nut got mad not neese himself i said i told him about confirming the alibi one down he said he thought she was psyching him out neeses term trying to control him so maybe she tried to psych out the wrong person you think the abortion angles worth pursuing not really i said hope was no standardbearer for the cause and a political killer would have gone public in order to make some kind of statement yeah but i do want to know what she did for cruvic and barone were talking over a hundred grand in two years though after the book she didnt need it he pulled photocopied tax returns out of his briefcase her last filing gross income of six hundred eighty thousand dollars the bulk of it from advances and royalties and public speaking the aftertax came out to almost half a mil and its sitting in a moneymarket account at merrill lynch jointly registered to her and seacrest no real debts she had the mustang before and seacrest inherited the house from his parents another half a mil not a bad investment to cash in on especially if the marriage is sour how long were they married ten years howd they meet seacrest says at the university rec center swimming was he married before nope he told paz and fellows hed been one of those stodgy confirmed bachelors unquote in addition to the five hundred grand theres more coming to him her literary agent wouldnt give me numbers but she did say substantial royalties were likely to come in over the next year or so book sales were brisk before the murder the publisher was about to offer her a deal on a sequel hope and seacrest did estate planning a few years ago established a marital trust to avoid estate taxes so seacrest gets to keep all of it his income last year was sixtyfour gees all from his university salary his volvos eight years old and hes managed to put away some cash in his faculty pension plan plus theres the house hes written some books too but they dont pay royalties guess romantic elements of the medieval age cant compete with penisaslethalweapon tentoone income ratio i said another kind of jealousy angle what if she was going to leave him just as she struck it big for another guy your lovesexbetrayal thing plus all that money sitting there a temptation right and whod be in a better position to know her habits to poison the dog hope did have one thing right more women are killed by socalled loved ones than by all the scumbags combined seacrest went all these years without big bucks i said has he turned into a high liver recently no on the contrary nothings changed about his life he goes to work each day and comes home weekends he stays home says he reads and watches tv doesnt even rent videos but if she was cheating on him no telling what that could do to an oldfashioned confirmed bachelor someone who studies romance dont forget that stab in the heart the guys fiftyfive alex maybe he had a midlife crisis and like i said i keep thinking hes hiding something why nothing i can put my finger on thats the problem he answers questions but volunteers no info he never called fellows and paz once to find out how their investigation was going when i got assigned i phoned him right away and got the feeling i was taking up his precious time like he was off somewhere else maybe hes still in shock no this was more like he had better things to do if someone you loved got sliced up how would you react tell you what how about i give you a firsthand look im planning to drop in on him tonight late not that im out to exploit a pal if youve got some serious time to invest on the case i can actually he pantedpay you he drew a folded form out of his jacket pocket surprise from uncle milo police id badge and a consultant contract in triplicate my name typed on the dotted line the department was willing to engage me for no more than fifty hours at less than a quarter of my private hourly fee small print limited lapds liability if i tripped on a banana peel or got shot theyd be sympathetic but stingy it aint filthy lucre he said but by department standards its supermarket sweep howd you pull this off lied and told the loo id heard radicalfeministbutchlesbian grumblings about the slow progress of the case if we didnt make it look like we were doing all we could we might end up being called before the police commission told him radicalfembutchlesbo types liked shrinks would take your involvement as proof of expanded sensitivity very creative i asked him for a new computer too but you were cheaper you on fifty hours i said does that include feeding you what do you think returning to the fridge he came back with a slab of brownie despite your suspicions of seacrest i said i still think you have to seriously consider a delusional stranger why theres a cold craziness to that wound pattern someone with a deep hatred for women and we know from the way she set up the committee that hope could be heavyhanded so who knows who she offended in real life or on the screen have you checked for murders with similar wound patterns ive gone through three years of westside cuttings and nothing matches tomorrow i try wilshire division and whoever else i can finagle into remembering i also sent out teletypes to other jurisdictions but so did paz and fellows and that brought in nothing so are you up for meeting seacrest tonight that is if you and the little woman dont have plans speaking of which let me pop back and say hi to her and the pooch i am neither sexist nor speciesist as we walked through the garden to the shop milo stopped to look at the fish in the pond then trudged on his back was bowed and his arms dangled heavily i wondered when hed last slept well robin was at her bench shaping the rosewood sides of a flattop guitar the new maple floors were spotless except for a pile of shavings swept into one corner spike had been sleeping at her feet and he looked up and cocked his broad flat head milo gave him a mockhostile look spike came over for a rub robin held up a finger and continued clamping the sides to a mold a dozen other instruments in various stages of repair were arranged around the room but the project she was working on had nothing to do with business the fire had destroyed my old martin dreadnought along with a beautiful parlor guitar shed built for me years ago i bought another martin from mandolin brothers in staten island replicating robins was her new years resolution one last clamp and she was done wiping her hands she stood on her tiptoes and kissed milos cheek then mine under her apron she wore a black tshirt and jeans and her hair was wrapped in a red bandanna safety goggles and a mask dangled from her neck both coated with dust spike started baying like a hound and rolled over i kneeled and scratched his tummy and he snorted in entitlement french bulldogs are miniature versions of the english variety but with upright bat ears a more athletic disposition and delusions of bigdog grandeur the best way to describe spike physically is a boston terrier on steroids but his personalitys more chimp than dog he waddled into our lives one day and stayed deciding quickly that robin was worth knowing and i was expendable when hes unhappy about something he pretends to choke milo pretends to despise him and always brings treats now he fished a sandwich bag out of his sportcoat dried liver canapé time pancakeface spike sat motionless milo tossed a nugget and the dog caught it midair chewed and swallowed the two of them glared at each other milo rubbed his face spike barked milo muttered and gave him more liver go away and digest spike headbutted milos foot rolling his eyes and grumbling milo bent and petted him more barking and butting and feeding finally milo showed him the empty bag spike jumped for it shook his head and scattered drool enough said robin youre increasing the humidity spike gazed up at her with big brown eyes the orson welles look genius disturbed stay she commanded quietly the dog obeyed and she added darling slipping her arm around my waist she said so whats new milo more than just good manners wed talked more about the murder last night plodding along he said thought id borrow alex tonight if you dont need him i always need him just make sure you return him in one piece one piece fueled washed and waxed after he was gone i turned to the transcripts of the conduct committee the documents were redstamped confidential on each page and preceded by the universitys lawyers warning that publicizing the contents could bring civil prosecution next came the lawyers assessment of blame sole credit professor hope devane but two other people had sat as judges along with her an associate professor of chemistry named julia steinberger and a psychology graduate student named casey locking i turned the page the format surprised me facetoface confrontations between accuser and accused hopes academic version of a talk show case deborah brittain a nineteenyearold sophomore french major accused patrick allan huang an eighteenyearold sophomore engineering major of following her around in the college library and making lascivious and suggestive expressions huang denied any sexual interest in brittain and said shed come on to him by requesting help operating the librarys search computers and repeatedly telling him how brilliant he was brittain said she had indeed asked for help from huang because he looked like the kind of guy whod know about computers and had complimented his proficiency because that was good manners why cant a woman be nice without getting harassed prof devane any answer to that mr huang mr huang my answer is shes a racist figuring an asian guy would be a technogeek and then taking advantage of me she bugged me not the opposite coming on all friendly so yeah i asked her out then she shuts me down and when i dont want to be her data slave anymore she gets pissed and files on me what a hassle and a half i didnt come to college for this prof devane what did you go to college for mr huang to study engineering prof devane theres more to learning than what goes on in the classroom mr huang all i want to do is study and mind my own business okay what this is about is shes a racist ms brittain he is lying he offered to help all i needed was a start i didnt know the program i was fine after that but every time he saw me hed slither over then he asked me out and wouldnt take no for an answer several times im empowered to say no right why should i have to put up with that it got to a point where i didnt even want to go to the library but i had a paper to write on molière whats he doing there anyway engineering books are in the engineering library he obviously hangs around to hit on women more hesaid shesaid no witnesses devane asking all the questions devane summing up pointing out that deborah brittain had come to her suffering from extreme stress she affirmed brittains right to study anywhere she pleased free of harassment advised her gently to be aware of racial stereotypes that might elicit miscommunication though im not saying thats what happened here ms brittain then she lectured patrick huang about respecting womens rights huang said he knew all that devane suggested he think about it anyway and warned him that hed face suspension and possible expulsion if anyone else complained about him no disciplinary actions taken case a freshman english major named cynthia vespucci had attended a prechristmasbreak party at the chi pi omega fraternity house where she encountered a freshman business major named kenneth storm jr recognizing him from high school she danced with him because even though most of the other guys were getting drunk and freaking out he was a total gentleman that night vespucci and storm began dating nothing sexual occurred until their fourth date when vespucci claimed storm drove her to a remote spot in bel air three miles above campus and demanded intercourse when she refused storm grabbed her arm she smelled liquor on his breath managed to pull away and told him to let her drive he then kicked her out of his car and threw her purse out breaking the strap and scattering the contents some of which including her spare change rolled into a storm drain driving off he left her stranded she tried gaining entrance to a residence but all the houses were fenced and gated and no one answered her rings she was forced to walk home to her sorority ruining a pair of shoes and causing me incredible fear when asked to respond kenneth storm refused stating this is bullshit further prodding from professor devane produced what the hell do you expect me to say at that point the graduate student casey locking entered the dialogue look guy im a man but i dont have any sympathy for men who rough up women if what she says is true youve got a lesson to learn and youre lucky to be learning it young if you disagree speak up but if you choose not to defend yourself dont complain later storm responded with a train of expletives then surprisingly cynthia vespucci seemed to have a change of heart okay okay lets just have nothing to do with each other lets just end this crying prof devane heres a tissue ms vespucci ms vespucci im okay lets just forget it prof devane are you sure ms vespucci ms vespucci i dont know prof devane when you came to me you were very upset ms vespucci i know starting to cry but i now i want to stop it

garbage im phoning my dad hes in real estate knows lots of lawyers hes going to have your asses for breakfast exits a note by the university lawyers indicated that kenneth storm sr an alumnus and member of the chancellors associates had indeed contacted an attorney pierre bateman who four weeks later drafted a letter of complaint to the university demanding immediate dissolution of the conduct committee a written apology and one hundred thousand dollars for kenneth storm jr the young man had dropped out of the university and applied for transfer to the college of the palms in redlands the university lawyers noted that his firstquarter grade point average had been and that hed been on academic probation his secondquarter marks were no better and he was on the verge of flunking out nevertheless it was deemed advisable to settle and a deal was worked out the storm family agreed to drop the matter in return for payment of kenneth jrs tuition for three and a half years at the college of the palms additionally it was recommended that the committee be dissolved bad feelings in both cases but the rage level of the second nearly scorched the paper kenneth storm jr had a bad temper even taking into account his being hauled up during an especially hard time in his college career had the deal failed to appease him paz and fellows had never known about the committee i assumed milo had at least skimmed the transcripts but he still preferred philip seacrest as prime suspect because of the money and the way seacrest twanged his antennae but storm had obviously hated hope a nineteenyearold carrying a grudge that far bicycle tracks on the sidewalk students rode bikes to campus i wrote down k storm jr and turned to the third transcript dated one week after the vespuccistorm debacle and three weeks before kenneth storms lawyer wrote the letter that killed the committee only devane and casey locking sat in judgment now had professor steinberger lost her taste for inquisition as i read it became clear that this was the most serious of the three complaints a sophomore psychology major named tessa ann bowlby accused a graduate student in theater arts named reed muscadine of date rape the two of them agreed on several initial points theyd met in the student union during lunch and had gone out on a single date that night viewing the movie speed at the village theater followed by dinner at pinocchio an italian restaurant in westwood village then theyd returned to muscadines apartment in the midwilshire district to drink wine and listen to music heavy petting and partial disrobing commenced here their stories diverged bowlby claimed she wanted things to go no further but muscadine got on top of her and entered her by force muscadine said intercourse had been consensual ms bowlby crying shaking i prof devane what dear ms bowlby hugs self shakes head prof devane do you have any further comment mr muscadine mr muscadine just that this is rather kafkaesque prof devane in what way sir mr muscadine in the sense of being cast under suspicion with no justification and no warning tessa if what happened somehow hurt you im truly sorry but youre dealing with your feelings the wrong way you may have changed your mind now but what happened then was clearly what we both wanted you never indicated otherwise ms bowlby i asked you to stop mr muscadine no you really didnt tessa ms bowlby i asked you i asked you mr muscadine weve already been back and forth on this tessa you feel you objected i know i heard nothing that was even close to objection if i had obviously i would have stopped prof devane why is it obvious mr muscadine because i dont force women to be with me apart from being repugnant its unnecessary prof devane whys that mr muscadine because im able to get women without forcing them prof devane get women mr muscadine pardon the clumsy usage im a little shaken up by all this women and i relate well im able to obtain companionship without the use of coercion thats why this whole thing is mr locking youre a theater arts major right mr muscadine yes mr locking what speciality mr muscadine acting mr locking so youre pretty good at disguising your feelings mr muscadine whats that supposed to mean mr locking what does it mean to you mr muscadine you know i came in here determined to be calm and rational but im finding it a bit difficult with things getting this personal prof devane this is a personal issue mr muscadine i know but i already told you mr locking do you have a tempercontrol problem mr muscadine no never why mr locking you sound angry mr muscadine laughs no im fine maybe a little baffled mr locking by what mr muscadine this process being here am i a little angry sure wouldnt you be and thats really all i have to say prof devane the intercourse did it proceed to climax mr muscadine it did for me and i thought you enjoyed it too tessa ms bowlby crying mr muscadine obviously i was wrong prof devane did you wear a condom sir mr muscadine no it was kind of the whole thing was spontaneous impetuous we really hit it off or at least i thought we had nothing was planned it just happened prof devane have you ever been tested for hiv mr muscadine no but im sure im prof devane would you be willing to be tested mr muscadine why prof devane for tessas peace of mind and yours mr muscadine oh cmon prof devane you relate well to women youve gotten many many women mr muscadine thats not the point prof devane what is sir mr muscadine its intrusive prof devane so is rape mr muscadine i never raped anyone prof devane then why all of the anxiety about a simple blood test mr muscadine i id have to think about it prof devane is there some fundamental problem with it sir mr muscadine no but prof devane but what sir mr muscadine i dont know prof devane these are the facts you had unprotected sex with a woman who claims you raped her the very least you can do is to mr muscadine it just seems kind of drastic have sex and prove yourself healthy ive slept with lots of other women and it never came up prof devane thats the point sir in effect ms bowlby has now slept with every one of those other women the precise details of what occurred that night may never be proven but its obvious that ms bowlby is experiencing some real trauma mr muscadine not because of me ms bowlby you raped me mr muscadine tessa i didnt im sorry youve twisted this ms bowlby stop please cries mr muscadine tessa if there was some way to undo it believe me i would we didnt need to make love we could have just prof devane please stop sir thank you are you all right tessa casey get her a fresh tissue thanks as i was saying mr muscadine the precise details may never be known because there were no witnesses but ms bowlby is clearly traumatized and shes entitled to some kind of closure given your sexual history shed feel a lot better if you were tested and shown to be hivnegative and so would this committee mr muscadine is that true tessa tessa ms bowlby you just said you sleep around mr muscadine wow from kafka to dracula give up my body fluids okay i have nothing to hide do i have to pay for it prof devane the testing can be done at student health with no charge ive got an authorization form right here that will release all results mr muscadine oh boy okay fine ive got nothing to hide but she should get tested as well ms bowlby i already did right after so far im negative mr muscadine youll stay negative at least from me listen tessa im really sorry this whole thing has gotten to you but i forget it sure fine ill get tested tomorrow hows that if thats all i have to do prof devane you should also give some serious thought to the issue of rape mr muscadine i dont need to prof devane sometimes were not aware of mr muscadine im telling you okay fine ill think about it now can i go prof devane sign these release forms go to student health and get tested within twentyfour hours mr muscadine fine fine what an experience thank god im an actor prof devane whys that sir mr muscadine to an actor everythings material maybe i can put this to use someday prof devane i trust not sir as we told you at the outset everything that goes on here is confidential mr muscadine oh yes sure it had better be for my sake too prof devane what im saying is youre enjoined against using it thats part of the agreement mr muscadine i didnt mean use it directly i meant subconsciously never mind bye tessa lets keep our distance from each other lets stay a planet away from each other that night as milo and i drove over to visit philip seacrest i said kenneth storm thought you might like him ugly scene huh do you know if storm actually transferred to the college of the palms no why what if they didnt accept him or he enrolled and flunked out hed be left with nothing but bad memories and the committee to blame for it that would put the other two committee members at risk too although going for all the members might make the motive too obvious if i needed one victim for satisfaction it would be the leader he nodded which hope sure was and secondincommand was that grad student locking he was really in step with her the third one professor steinberger didnt say much and she wasnt there for the third case maybe she got disillusioned i said casey locking might not have had the luxury hes studying psychology and i wouldnt be surprised if hope was his supervisor or in some other position of power the third session was the only one where the girl actually claimed rape what do you think of hope asking that acting student muscadine to take an aids test maybe she was convinced hed raped her knew there was no evidence for criminal prosecution and decided to do what she could for the victim the girl tessa got tested too so she was obviously worried weird he said what a scene and it never hit the papers he stopped at the red light at sunset and surveyed the cross traffic but you still like seacrest better than kenneth storm im openminded but yeah half a millions one hell of a motive and seacrest has the sophistication and the opportunity to set it up the poisoned dog granted of the three students storms our best bet but hes only nineteen and from his academic record no genius does that orchestrated wound pattern seem like the work of a kid with a short fuse and a dirty mouth fifty wounds would fit that better or bashing her head in plus storm went through channels to vent his spleen got his revenge through daddys lawyer thats why i asked if hes still in school maybe going through channels didnt prove satisfying and dont forget the bike tire marks boy on a tenspeed the light changed and he turned east drove slowly til the traffic thinned then made a quick right south of the boulevard we were close to the murder street by la terms hope had been my neighbor robin had probably been thinking about that we sailed through the cold black privacy of holmby hills past high walls and old trees small hostile signs reminding us of the presence of an armed patrol milo rolled through a boulevard stop and continued south the estates gave way to houses as we entered residential westwood ill follow up on storm junior he said on all three of them going to be making a lot of people who thought theyd put the committee behind them very unhappy we sat parked near the big elm for a while talking about the murder and other things before sinking into an aspic of silence no movement behind the amberlit curtains no signs of life ready to meet him thrilled yeah hes a thrilling guy just as we were about to get out headlights came at us and a car stopped in front of the devaneseacrest house turned up the driveway and parked behind the volvo red mustang there you go i said he does go out took a spin in the sports car her sports car milo stared mouth tight eyes tuned the headlights shut off and a man got out of the red car and walked up to the front door thats not seacrest seacrest is taller the man rang the bell it was too dark to make out details but he was short maybe five seven and wore a long coat hands in pockets his back to us a house light went on downstairs and the door opened partially the man slipped inside a pal i said someone seacrest lent the car to long as hes being hospitable lets partake it took a lot longer for our ring to be answered finally from behind the door came a yes its detective sturgis professor another partial opening philip seacrest was indeed taller than the man in the coat close to milos sixthree but sixty pounds lighter with narrow shoulders and a drawn squarish face turned grubby by a poorly trimmed gray beard his nose was small and wide and might have been broken once his hair was gray and unruly puffing over his ears but skimpy on top he wore a grayandgreen plaid shirt gray twill slacks that had once been expensive but were shiny at the knees felt bedroom slippers the shirt was rolled to his elbows exposing hairless softlooking arms one incongruity a small anchor tattoo on his left forearm pale blue crudely done probably a navy souvenir i knew he was fiftyfive but he looked older maybe it was grief or bad genes or going to work every day and doing the same thing over and over without distinction detective he took hold of the doorpost quiet voice just above a mumble if he lectured that way the back rows wouldnt hear him behind him i could see old clumsy furniture floral wallpaper a grandfather clock in the crook of a narrow staircase small brass chandelier i smelled the notquitecooked odor of microwaved food on the far wall of the entry a colonial eagle mirrors convex lens stared back like a giant eye no sight of the mustang driver professor said milo seacrests eyes were big brown two shades darker than those of his dead wife soft as a childs what can i do for you mr sturgis are we interrupting something sir the we made him notice me but not for long no may we come in seacrest hesitated for a second all right saying it louder warning the other man he stayed in the doorway then stepped aside no eye contact i was already picking up the evasiveness that had alerted milo then he did look at us but not with affection sometimes cops and victims families bond but there was none of that here quite the opposite a coldness maybe it was because he didnt like being dropped in on or because hed been treated as a suspect from the beginning maybe he deserved that he remained in the entry hall licking his lips and touching his adams apple then he looked over his shoulder at the staircase the shorter man up there milo stepped closer and seacrest retreated a step it took him nearer the convex mirror and he became a gray smear in the silvered glass so he repeated what can i do for you just checking in said milo no progress im afraid not sir seacrest nodded as if bad news were to be expected i took in the house center hall plan the entry modest floored in vinyl tiles that simulated white marble the staircase carpeted in faded green living room to the right dining room to the left more fusty furniture not quite old enough to be antique hed inherited the house from his parents probably the stuff hed grown up with disparate throw rugs spread limply over brown walltowall plush beyond the stairs was a small pinepaneled room lined with books books on the floor too a plaid couch the grandfather clock hadnt been set and its pendulum hung inertly footsteps thumped from the second floor one of hopes students seacrest said fingering his beard retrieving some research material hope left behind i finally had the gumption to go through hopes things after the police took everything apart and repack them those first two detectives just threw everything around one second he climbed halfway up the stairs almost through he called the police are here a voice from above said something seacrest came back down slowly like an unwilling bride research material said milo it belongs to the student they were working together its the norm at the doctoral level i said how many students did she have i dont believe many because of the book said milo pardon the time demands yes i suppose so but also because hope was particular seacrest glanced toward the stairs its still a mess hopes approach to things was she wasnt overly compulsive which is not to say her mind wasnt organized it was exceptionally so one of her many talents perhaps that was the point what was professor seacrest pointed up the stairs as if at a chalkboard what i mean to say is i always wondered if the reason she could afford to work in disorder was because she was so internally tidy so beautifully schematized that she had no need for external order even as a graduate student shed study with the radio on the television i found that unbelievable i need absolute solitude he sniffed she was much smarter than i his eyes got wet youre not getting much solitude tonight said milo seacrest tried to smile his mouth wouldnt go along and it came out a pigstail of ambivalence so no new ideas he said i wish i had some of my own but madness is just madness so banal coming down said a voice from the stairs the shorter man descended a cardboard box in both hands he was in his twenties with long dark straight hair slicked back from a face so angular it made james deans look pudgy he had full dark lips hollow cheeks smooth skin and heavy black eyebrows the long coat was a scuffed black leather trench and under the hem was an inch of blue denim cuff black boots with thick soles and heavy chrome buckles he blinked long curving lashes over dark blue eyes upstairs where the bedrooms were i thought about seacrests possible warning and wondered about whether hed come for something other than data driving hopes car quite a privilege for someone elses student but for a new friend i glanced over at milo he hadnt budged the young man reached the bottom holding the box out in front of him like an offering neat writing in black marker on the side said selfcontrol study batch prelim he put it down halfopen flaps revealed computer printouts he had long slender hands on the right index finger was a big silver skull ring red glass for the skulls eyes the kind of thing you get in a hollywood boulevard schlock shop hi im casey locking his voice was deep and liquid relaxed like that of an allnight dj milo identified himself locking said i spoke to two other detectives right after it happened milos jaw twitched nothing about the interview in paz and fellowss files have you learned anything yet said locking not yet she was a great teacher and a fantastic person seacrest sighed sorry professor said locking your name rings a bell said milo got it you sat on the conduct committee right lockings black eyebrows became tiny croquet wickets yes i did seacrest turned toward the conversation with sudden interest locking touched a leather lapel and a crescent of white tshirt became visible youre not thinking the committee had something to do with what happened you dont think thats possible locking rolled his fingers god i never really considered that why not it just didnt seem i guess to me all those guys seemed like cowards id say professor devane was killed in a cowardly manner i tried to observe seacrest without being obvious still looking at the floor arms loose and limp i guess so said locking youre the detective but did you know that the dean sent down a directive everything associated with the committee is confidential so i cant talk about it things have changed said milo yes i guess they have but thats really all i have to say locking picked up the box good luck milo edged closer to him milos height and bulk often cause people to retreat locking didnt so you did research with professor devane she was my dissertation advisor we did some work together have you found a new advisor yet not yet how many other students was she supervising just me and one other whats the others name mary ann gonsalvez shes been in england for a year locking turned to seacrest the cars fine professor seacrest just needed an oil change and a new air filter i left the keys upstairs thank you casey locking walked to the door freed one hand to open it while keeping the box up against his chest nice ring said milo locking stopped gave a slow abdominal laugh oh that tacky isnt it someone gave it to me i guess i should get rid of it milo closed the door after him nice of him to get your car fixed professor a barter said seacrest i searched for his data and he took care of the car is there anything else mr sturgis no just checking to see if youve thought of anything and i wanted to introduce you to dr delaware hes our consulting psychologist the soft eyes squinted oh given your wifes background i thought dr delaware might be able to help us yes i suppose thats a good idea by the way wheres the dog pardon your rottweiler hilde i gave her away she was hopes dog not a dog person yourself seacrest hadnt stopped staring at me the truth is im tired cant seem to get my energy back cant give hilde the attention she deserves and i dont need yet another reminder of the way things used to be whod you give her to an organization called rottweiler rescue what kind of dog was hilde nice a bit rambunctious was she protective seemed to be though thats not why hope bought her she wanted companionship when she walked seacrest wiped his eyes did the two of you never walk together said milo no im not one for exercise hope loved physical activity and hilde was an active dog always had her eyes on hope thats why it was terribly ironic hilde not being there he scratched his beard the eyes were wide again very bright as if backlit by hot white metal after hopes death the dog was miserable he said i was depressed not equipped who took care of hilde during professor devanes book tour oh i did but hope never stayed away long two three days on the road back for two or three then out again did hilde have a history of stomach problems no seacrests eyes left mine reluctantly the first two detectives wondered if shed been poisoned by the murderer had i thought of that i would have had her tested not that it would tell much i suppose why not lets say she was given something wed still have no idea by whom seacrest looked at me again a police psychologist thats a job hope would never have taken why not said milo she distrusted authority im from a different generation she didnt like the police said milo she felt all organizations were inherently inefficient and you disagreed i have a certain armslength respect for law enforcement he said perhaps because im an historian have you studied crime history not per se my chief interest is the medieval period but im also interested in elizabethan history and one account of that age sticks in my mind during the elizabethan age capital punishment was meted out for a wide variety of crimes even pickpockets were hanged then kindler gentler souls had their way and the noose was eliminated for less serious offenses care to surmise what happened more crime said milo you get an a detective do you advocate capital punishment professor seacrest touched his beard i dont know what i advocate anymore losing my wife has shaken up all my preconceptions what exactly will you be doing to help find hopes killer dr delaware analyzing the file i said perhaps talking to some of your wifes colleagues anyone in particular i should start with he shook his head hope and i kept our professional lives separate you dont know anyone she associated with no not professionally what about friends we really didnt have any i know thats hard to believe but we both led very insular lives work writing hilde trying to steal bits of privacy must have been harder after the book came out for hope it was she kept me out of the limelight insular little boxes professor said milo is the name robert barone familiar slow headshake what about milan cruvic no who are they people your wife worked with well there you go i wouldnt know about that totally separate huh said milo it worked best for us seacrest turned to me when you do speak to hopes colleagues im willing to bet what they tell you whats that professor that she was brilliant but a loner a firstrate scholar and teacher his hands balled gentlemen pardon me for saying so but i dont believe this approach will prove useful what approach is that sir said milo examining hopes academic career thats not what killed her it was that book getting out into whats known laughably as the real world she had the courage to be controversial and that controversy inspired some schizophrenic fiend or whatever dear god rubbing his forehead he stared at the floor give me the ivory tower any day detective spare me reality milo asked if we could see hopes study as you like do you mind if i stay down here and have some tea not at all up the stairs and take the first room to your left look anywhere else you please at the top were three smallish bedrooms and a bath off a central landing the room to the left was walled with budget swedishmodern cases jammed top to bottom with journals and books the shelves bowing under the weight venetian blinds shielded two windows the furniture looked strewn rather than placed two mismatched chairs a desk and a workstand with pc printer modem software manuals the american psychological associations style guide dictionary thesaurus next to the computer were several copies of an article hope devane had authored last year in the journal of personality and social psychology coauthor casey locking selfcontrol as a function of gender identity i read the abstract no significant differences between men and women in the ability to control nailbiting using a behavioral technique no relationship between success and subjects views on sexrole behavior and equality in wolves and sheep hope claimed women were superior to men in breaking bad habits because estrogen had an impulsesuppressing role the sole exception compulsive overeating because societal pressure created bodyimage conflict in women the article said just the opposite i turned to the discussion section at the back hope and locking hedged their results by stating that their sample was too small as milo opened drawers and read the spines of shelved books i inspected the rest of the room loose journals and books covered half the floorspace a red wool throw was tossed carelessly over a box just like the carton locking had carried out the same neat black lettering five sealed cartons from hope devanes publisher stamped wolves and sheep comp copies were shoved into a corner unopened reams of computer paper the lettered box contained more of hopes published papers locking the coauthor on two of them no authorship for the other student mary ann gonsalvez teachers pet judging from the conductcommittee transcripts locking had been a kindred spirit more than that he was young bright goodlooking if you like the brooding underwearad type younger man older woman first id wondered about locking and seacrest now i was speculating about a heterosexual affair sin on the brain delaware but the wound pattern connoted sin someones idea of transgression made good heart vagina stabbing in the back the heat of passion buttressed by cold planning seacrest seemed the bloodless type had he shed blood milo fished some more then said anything i told him about the discrepancy between the selfcontrol article and the book like you said she fudged he looked through the office door across the landing and cocked his head i followed him out to seacrests office also booklined and furnished with aesthetic apathy but pinneat next seacrests bedroom now that he had it all to himself the historian kept his sleeping space tidy queensized brass bed floral coverlet tucked so tight it looked painted on the mattress we went downstairs seacrest was nowhere in sight milo said professor and seacrest came into the dining room from the kitchen mug in hand the tag and string of a tea bag dangled over the side university mascot on the mug anything else youd like to see where are dr devanes professional records patient files things like that anything not here would be in her campus office ive been through that and there are no patient files then i dont know what to tell you did she have a private office no did she see patients here no did she see patients at all she never discussed her work im not talking specifics professor seacrest just if she saw any patients if she did she never mentioned it we didnt talk about our jobs only scholarly issues seacrest touched his tattoo navy said milo coast guard seacrest smiled a moment of poor judgment whered you serve off catalina island more of a vacation im forced to admit so youre from california grew up right here in this house campus brat my father was a chemistry professor and hopes hopes parents are both deceased as are mine neither of us had siblings i suppose im all thats left of both families i knew what milo was thinking sole heir what did her father do he said he was a sailor merchant marine he died when hope was very young she didnt talk much about him and her mother her mother worked in a restaurant seacrest headed for the door as i told the first detectives shes also deceased and hope had no other family milo said quite a skill what is keeping your professional lives separate keeping things separate in general seacrest licked his lips not at all quite the opposite actually it was easy certainly because we respected each other opening the door he extended an arm outside warm night he said the night it happened was much cooler milo drove wilshire boulevard through the corridor of highrise condos that made up las nod to park avenue diagnosis he said hes not mr warmth but hes got reason to be depressed he could be hiding something or really not know much bottom line nothing earthshattering and mr locking the skull ring was cute first i found myself wondering about a relationship between him and seacrest then between him and hope him and seacrest why locking driving that car seemed awfully personal though seacrests barter explanation could cover that also seacrest seemed to be delaying letting us in and once he did he called upstairs to say the police were there which could have been his way of warning locking giving him time to get his clothes on all of which is pure supposition okay why locking and hope youve wondered all along about her having an affair most affairs begin at work and locking was the guy she worked with and after marriage to someone like seacrest she might have been ready for a little excitement black leather and a skull ring he said drumming the steering wheel and heading into westwood village like so much else in la the district had been intellectually downscaled the bookstores of my college days surrendering to games arcades gyro shacks and instalatte assemblyline franchises what i found interesting he said was the way seacrest suggested the murder could be blamed on the book insisting it had nothing to do with her academic life which distances it from him ive seen killers who think theyre smart do that give out alternative scenarios that way they can look helpful while thinking theyre steering us away from them and that dog who better to slip her a nice big steak laced with godknowswhat and now hes given her away getting rid of the reminders he made an ugly sound and loosened his tie locking and hope locking and seacrest guess ill make use of some of my homosexual contacts maybe the lieutenant was right and i am the perfect guy for the case i wonder i said why it took so long for locking to come get his data hopes been dead three months thats a lot of time when youre working on your dissertation then again locking hasnt found a new advisor so maybe hes having trouble adjusting to hopes death maybe because they had more going than a studentteacher thing or hes just a hangloose guy in no great hurry to finish you see that in grad school though his goround with kenneth storm was anything but mellow what do you think of hope appointing her own prize student to the committee packing the jury she could have justified it in the name of efficiency seacrest said she distrusted organizations and everything else tells us she wasnt much of a team player thats why im interested in meeting people she did work with lawyer barones still ignoring me but dr cruvic left a message saying hell see me briefly at tenthirty tomorrow morning care to come psych him out sure not a team player he said cowgirl with a phd sometimes cowgirls get thrown the following day i met milo for breakfast at nate n als on beverly then we drove to dr cruvics office on civic center drive interesting location for a private practitioner most of beverly hillss medical suites are housed in the stylish neofederal buildings that line north bedford roxbury and camden and in the big reflective towers on wilshire civic center was the northern edge of the citys meager industrial district a few nondescript blocks that paralleled santa monica boulevard but were blocked from motorists view by tall hedges and eucalyptus unused railroad tracks cut diagonally through the street past the tracks were a pink granite office complex the frostedglass headquarters of a record company and the neoretropostwhateverrevival municipal center that contained beverly hillss city hall library police and fire departments development hadnt come yet to the other side of the tracks where cruvics pink stucco spanish building shared space with an assortment of narrow shabbycute single and doublestory structures dating from world war i and earlier the doctors immediate neighbors were a beauty parlor a telephone answering service and an unmarked building with a loading dock the pink building had no front windows just a massive woodandiron door like those you see in spain and italy and greece leading to courtyards a ringin buzzer was topped by a tarnished bronze sign so small it seemed intent on avoiding discovery m cruvic md etched shallowly milo punched the buzzer and we waited but for the hum of the cars on santa monica the street was sleepy geraniums grew out of boxes in the beauticians window in all my years in la id never had a reason to be here milo knew what i was thinking looks like someone else likes privacy rubbing his lip with his lower teeth he pushed the buzzer again electric beebuzz response the click of release he shoved at the heavy wood and we stepped in on the other side was a courtyard flagstonefloored open to the sky set up with potted bananas flax plants azaleas a small iron table and two chairs ashtray on the table two lipsticked butts the interior building was two stories with barred windows and handwrought balconies two doors the right one opened and a woman in a light blue uniform came out right here throaty voice she pointed to the left she was around fifty trim and brunette with a very large bust a tight shiny tan face and dancers calves detective sturgis im anna come on in she gave a onesecond smile led us to the left and opened the door dr cruvic will be right with you can i get you some coffee we have an espresso machine no thanks shed taken us into a short bright hallway dark wood doors all closed and dense tan carpeting that smothered our footsteps the walls were white and looked freshly painted she opened the fourth door and stepped aside the room was small with a low ceiling two beige cotton armchairs and a matching love seat sat on a black area rug a chromeandglass coffee table separated them a pair of high windows exposed the brick wall of the beautyparlor building no desk no books no phone dr cruvics offices are on the other side but hed like you to remain here so as not to upset the patients youre sure you dont want coffee or tea milo declined again and smiled okay then make yourselves comfortable he should be right in nice old building said milo must be good to have this kind of space in beverly hills oh it is neat she said i think it used to be some kind of stable they ran horses around here back in the old days i think mary pickford kept her horses here or maybe it was another of those oldtime stars i said does dr cruvic do his operating right here or does he go over to cedars or century city her taut face turned glassy mostly we do outpatient procedures nice to meet you she left closing the door milo waited several moments then opened it and looked out four long strides took him to the end of the corridor and a door marked to west wing he tried the knob locked on his way back he jiggled others all bolted is my paranoia kicking in cause i dont like doctors offices or did she not like your question about where he operates it did seem to throw her i said sorry to put a stress on her facelift yeah she is glossy i thought she might have been recuperating from a sunburn but with that chest youre probably right did you want coffee far be it for me to speak for the entire class no this room is stimulating enough he laughed warm and cozy huh could you do therapy here i can do therapy anywhere but id prefer something a little less stark maybe this was hopes therapy room why do you say that because its separate from the west wing no upsetting the patients assuming she worked here which isnt that big of a stretch he paid her almost forty grand we havent found patient files anywhere else the door opened and a very broadshouldered man about fivenine gusted in wearing a very wide frown he was around forty with thick gray hair styled in a long spiky crew cut the sideburns clipped high above small closeset ears dark extremely alert eyes studied us slanted five degrees short of an asian tilt his face was round with pronounced rosy cheekbones a straight nose with flared nostrils and a strong chin already shadowed with morning growth he wore a tailored white doublebreasted jacket over a spreadcollar blue shirt and a black silk crepe tie handpainted with crimson and gold swirls black slacks broke perfectly over twotone blackleatherandgraysuede wing tips he stuck out his hand and revealed a french cuff held together by a goldbarrel link his wrist was thick and coated with straight black hair mike cruvic nodding as if wed just come to a consensus even when he stood still he seemed to bounce doctor said milo they shook then i got cruvics hand muscular grip but soft palm buffed nails thanks for taking the time sir happy to though i really dont know how i can help you find hopes killer he shook his head lets sit okay got myself a heel spur from running in old shoes youd think id know better he knuckled his forehead three times and sank into the love seat you know what they say said milo the doctors kids go barefoot cruvic smiled and stretched his arms in this case the doctor gets sore feet i never thought id be talking to the police about murder let alone hopes tucking his finger into a wing tip he rubbed the side of his foot and winced creak creak he said rolling his shoulders their bulk wasnt due to padding his posture was perfect his belly boardflat i pictured him in his home gym at daybreak bouncing and pedaling and pumping one of those early risers just waiting to take on the day and knock it out in two rounds so he said finally sitting still what would you like to know we have on record that you paid dr devane thirtysix thousand dollars last year said milo did she work for you cruvic floated a palm over the spikes of his crew cut i never tallied it up but that sounds right she consulted to the practice in what capacity doctor cruvic touched a finger to a broad pale lip lets see how can i be forthcoming without compromising my patients are you aware of what we do here obstetricsgynecology and fertility cruvic produced a business card from an inner pocket of the white jacket milo read it then handed it to me milan a cruvic md facogpractice limited to problems of fertility i used to do obgyn but for the last few years ive been doing just fertility the hours said milo pardon delivering babies the hours can be rough cruvic laughed no that never bothered me i dont need much sleep i just like doing fertility people come in sometimes theres absolutely no medical reason they cant conceive it tears them apart you analyze it come up with a solution he grinned i guess i fancy myself a detective of sorts he looked at his watch what was professor devanes role in all of that sir i called hope in when i had doubts about what patients psychological preparedness cruvics brow creased and the gray spikes tilted down fertility enhancements an exhausting process physically and psychologically and sometimes nothing we do works i warn patients beforehand but not everyone can handle it when they cant its best not to start sometimes i can judge whos likely to have problems if i cant i call in experts do you use other psychologists besides professor devane i have in the past and some patients have their own therapists but after i met hope she became my preferred choice he put both hands on his knees she was terrific very insightful a great judge of people and excellent with the patients because unlike other psychologists and psychiatrists she had no stake in sucking people into longterm treatment whys that she was busy enough with her book her book teaching he clapped his hands quick to the point the least amount of treatment necessary i guess that appealed to the surgeon in me his ruddy cheeks were almost scarlet and his eyes had turned distant rubbing his foot some more he leaned forward i the practice misses her some of these shrinks are weirder than the patients hope talked plain english she was fantastic how many cases did you refer to her i never counted were there any patients who werent happy with her not a one oh come on you cant be serious no no detective not a chance i deal with civilized people not nutcases milo shrugged and smiled gotta ask is it my imagination doctor or is there more infertility nowadays its not your imagination at all some of its probably due to people waiting longer to start the ideal conception age for a woman is early to midtwenties tack on ten fifteen years and youve got an aging uterus and diminished probability he put a hand on each knee and his slacks stretched over thick muscular thighs id never say this to a patient because theyve got enough guilt but some of its also due to all the messing around people did in the seventies promiscuity repetitive subclinical infections endometriosis thats internal scarring thats also part of what i used hope for the guilt whyd you pay her directly instead of having her do her own billing cruvics head moved back the hands came off the knees and pressed down hard on the loveseat cushion insurance said cruvic we tried it the other way and found out it was easier to recover payment for a gynecologicbehavioral consult than for psychotherapy another stroke of the crew cut my cpa assures me its all on the upandup now if thats all did she work well with the husbands too i said why wouldnt she her opinions about men were controversial in what sense her book oh that well she was never controversial here everyone was very satisfied with her work not that its my place to tell you how to do your job but it seems to me youre barking up a completely wrong tree hopes murder had nothing to do with her work for me im sure youre right said milo whered you meet her at another health facility where a charity clinic in santa monica name the womens health center ive been active there for a while once a year they throw a fundraiser hope and i sat next to each other on the dais and we began talking he stood his tie had ridden up and he pulled it down if youll excuse me ive got some ladies out there who want to be mommies sure thanks doctor milo stood too blocking the door one more thing did professor devane keep her patient files here she had no files of her own made notes in mine that way we could communicate easily my files are kept strictly confidential so it wasnt a problem but she did see patients here yes in this room by any chance you know said cruvic i believe she may have i dont assign rooms the staff does but she stayed in this wing said milo the privacy issue exactly nice setup for privacy locationwise i mean off the beaten path cruvics bulky shoulders rose then fell we like it he tried to sight around milo milo seemed to move aside then his notepad came out this womens center you do fertility work there cruvic inhaled forced a smile fertility is rarely an issue for the poor at the center i donate my time to general womens health care does that include abortions with all due respect i dont see that thats relevant milo smiled it probably isnt im sure you know im not free to discuss any of my cases even poor women have a right to confid sorry doc i wasnt asking about specific cases just a general question about what you do there why raise the abortion issue at all whats the point detective abortions legal but its still controversial and some people express their opposition to it violently so if you do perform abortions and professor devane was involved in that as well it might give us another angle oh for gods sake said cruvic i support a womans right to choose and so did hope but if anyone would be targeted it would be the person actually performing the procedure he tapped his chest and im obviously here obviously said milo once again i have to ask doc i understand said cruvic but he didnt look mollified im sure my opinion doesnt mean much but i think hope was murdered by some psychotic who hates women and chose her because shed achieved fame a nut not a patient here or at the womens center on the contrary doctor your opinion does matter thats exactly what we need opinions of people who knew her cruvic colored and he touched his tie i only knew her professionally but i think her death represents so much thats wrong with our society how so sir success and the malignant jealousy it evokes we adulate talented people put them on a pedestal then enjoy knocking them off why because their success threatens us the cheeks bright red now he walked around milo stopped at the door and looked back at us the losers punish the winners gentlemen if it keeps going that way we all lose good luck milo said if you think of anything doc and gave him a business card the straight version not the one the detectives pass among themselves that reads robberyhomicide our day begins when yours ends cruvic pocketed it charging into the hallway he unlocked the door to the west wing and was gone any hypotheses said milo well i said he blushed when he said he only knew her professionally so maybe it was more and he got a little antsy talking about his billing so there could have been something funny about that taking a cut of her fee kickbacks for referrals billing for gynecology instead of psychology to up the reimbursement whatever the abortion question got his dander up a bit meaning he probably does them at the center maybe here too for the highpriced crowd if so he wouldnt want it publicized apart from the controversy because a prochoice fertility patient might find it difficult to submit to the care of someone who also destroys fetuses but he made a good point about his being the target and i stick with what i said about a political murderer going public when we got to the exit door he said if he was sleeping with her the consultant thing could have been a way of shunting money to a girlfriend she didnt need his forty she made six hundred grand last year he knew her before the book maybe its been going on for years and seacrest found out i know im reaching but we keep talking about that heartgenitalsback thing revenge some kind of betrayal cruvic did get a little passionate talking about her wouldnt you say he did maybe hes just a passionate guy dr heelspur saying the same thing seacrest did it had nothing to do with me no one wants to be close to murder i said he frowned and pushed the door to the courtyard tightfaced nurse anna was at the courtyard table smoking and reading the paper she looked up and gave a small wave milo gave her a card too she shook her head i only saw dr devane when she came to work how often was that it wasnt regular every so often did she have her own key yes and she always worked out of that room we were just in nod nice lady said milo splitsecond pause yes anything you want to tell us about her no she said what could there be milo shrugged returning the gesture she stubbed out the cigarette collected her paper and stood up breaks over better be getting back have a nice day she headed back to the building as we crossed the flagstone as we opened the big door to the street she was still watching us milo put the key in the ignition but didnt turn it what i said something about cruvic he started the car maybe ive been on the job too long know what came into the station this morning newborn baby mauled to death by some dogs seventeenyearold unwed momma weeping tragic accident right then the detectives find out the dogs were in the nextdoor neighbors yard separated by an eightfoot fence turns out momma killed the kid tossed it over to destroy the evidence jesus no doubt shell be claiming she was the victim going on tv writing a book he gave a terrible smile so am i excused for negative thinking reaching under the seat he pulled out a portable cellular phone and punched numbers sturgis anything yeah ill wait mr information highway i said struggling to erase the image of the savaged infant since when does the department issue cell phones oh sure departments idea of the information highway is two extralarge tin cans and heavy twine this here is a handmedown from rick hes got a new one does all sorts of paging tricks i dont like going through the department radio without a tactical band and pay phones are a hassle but so is applying for reimbursement so i write off the calls to blue blue investigations was his evening moonlight afterhours surveillance jobs mostly nailing insurance scammers mostly he hated it lately hed been turning down referrals if its reimbursement youre after maybe you should bill it as gynecology i said he cracked up uhhuh he said into the phone yeah yeah where okay got it thanks backing out onto civic center he drove west cindy vespucci the girl kenny storm threw out of the car just returned my message shell be lunching at the ready burger in westwood in a quarter hour willing to talk if we show up before her next class the restaurant was on broxton on the west edge of the village where the streets knot up and walking can be faster than driving plastic yellow sign sweating glass window two rickety tables on the sidewalk one occupied by two girls drinking cokes with straws neither acknowledged us and we went inside three more tables yellow tile walls also sweating lettuce shreds and straw wrappers flecked the redbrick floor the smell of frying meat was everywhere a quartet of asian countermen with ferrari hands chopped flipped wrapped and played cashregister arpeggios a numblooking queue mostly students curved from the door to the counter milo studied the interior tables the lunchers who noticed him didnt do so for long same for the kids in line we went back outside and he checked his watch one of the girls put her drink down and said officer sturgis yes maam im cindy she was a college freshman but looked like a highschool sophomore barely five feet tall maybe ninetyfive pounds borderline beautiful in an elfin way with long straight blond hair the expected wide skyblue eyes an upturned nose and a cupids bow mouth i felt immediately protective and wondered if id ever have a daughter she wore a gray university sweatshirt over tight black leggings and white running shoes book bag by her chair the nails at the end of her fingers were gnawed the girl with her was also pretty and blond a bit chubby the table was littered with greasy paper and miniature foil packets of ketchup and mustard milo held out his hand cindy swallowed and proffered hers as she looked up at him her mouth lost resolve he hunched a bit and made his voice gentle good to meet you cindy we really appreciate your talking to us oh sure she looked back at her friend and nodded the chubby girl stared at us then got up slinging her bag over her shoulder cin im okay deb see you at two deb nodded and walked up the street peering over her shoulder a couple of times before crossing and entering a record store cindy said do you should we just talk here whatever you like um im sure someone will want to use the table can we walk sure she retrieved her book bag tossed back her hair and gave a smile so effortful it must have burned calories milo smiled back cindy turned away from him and saw me this is alex delaware hi she flinched and shot out her hand i took it and received a sudden hard squeeze from cold childsized fingers the three of us headed west to the end of the block across the street was a vast stretch of asphalt one of the universitys offcampus parking lots serviced by shuttles an idle blue bus was stationed near the entrance thousands of spaces every one filled milo said how about we walk through here should be pretty private cindy thought gave three rapid nods her mouth had set grimly and her hands were closed tight as we entered the lot she said when i was a little kid a policeman came to our school and warned us about darting out in front of parked cars good advice said milo well be sure to look both ways the girls laugh was constricted we strolled a bit before milo said im sure you know why we want to talk to you cindy of course professor devane she was im really sorry what happened to her but it had nothing to do with kenny and me im sure it didnt but we have to check out everything suddenly the girls eyes grew merry that sounds just like on tv then its got to be real right she gazed up at milo then back at me ive never met an actual detective oh its a real big deal somewhere between the pulitzer and the nobel the girl squinted at him youre funny what do you want me to tell you about professor devane your experience with the interpersonal conduct committee the narrow mouth twisted milo said i know its hard to talk about but no its not really hard not anymore cause its over kenny and i have resolved things we kept walking a few steps later she said actually were dating milo made a noncommittal sound no doubt it sounds bizarre to you but its working for us i guess there was some chemistry between us maybe thats what caused all the initial conflict anyway its all worked out so kenny knows youre talking to us sure actually he she stopped herself he asked you to talk to us no no its just that im here in town and hes down in san diego so we thought i could clear things up for both of us okay said milo whats to clear she shifted her book bag to another shoulder nothing really her voice had risen in pitch it was a mistake filing a complaint i should never have made such a big deal but there were complications between kenny and me its a long story not really relevant your mom and his dad i said she looked at me so that came out too there are transcripts of the sessions said milo oh great she looked ready to cry i thought everything was supposed to be kept confidential murder changes the rules cindy but were doing all we can to keep it quiet she exhaled and shook her head how blownup is this going to get if it had nothing to do with dr devanes death hopefully not at all it didnt at least kennys and my thing didnt she punched her chest god i was an idiot for going along with it i said someone reading the transcript could get the impression you had a valid claim against kenny well i didnt i told you it was complicated yes because of our parents not that mom asked me to be her defender i just i misread some cues thats all kenny didnt behave himself perfectly but hes no animal we could have worked things out proof is we have she shifted the bag again milo said id offer to carry that for you but its probably not pc she started to say something then shot him an amused look and handed over the bag in his hands it looked like a lunch sack rolling her shoulders she glanced back at the village as we continued to stroll between the parked cars is this going to take much longer not much your mom and kennys dad how are they getting along fine dating again no theyre just friends thank god that would be incestuous that was a big part of the initial problem kenny and i didnt realize the extent of the baggage plus his mother died a year ago hes still hurting what about his kicking you out of the car cindy stopped please detective id know if i was a victim milo didnt answer she said that night he it was stupid i demanded to get out he opened the door for me and i tripped she laughed but she looked as if someone had died i felt like such a spaz we needed to work on our communication thats all the proof is empirical were fine youre a good student arent you cindy the girl blushed i work hard straight as so far but its just two quarters kennys not much of a student is he hes very bright its just that he has to find something that inspires him licking her lips some focus motivation exactly people move at different paces ive always known what i want to be whats that a psychologist or an attorney i want to work for childrens rights well said milo we can sure use people doing that we walked past three more aisles a car pulled out the driver a girl no older than cindy we waited til it sped away so kennys in san diego said milo thought he was at the college of the palms in redlands she shook her head he decided not to go why he needed to get his head straight so hes not in school in san diego not yet hes interning at a realestate office in la jolla friend of his dads so far he likes it a lot hes good at selling things ill bet cindy stopped again and snapped her head up at him he didnt sell anything to me if thats what youre implying im not some gullible jerk and i wouldnt settle for a relationship without equity what do you mean by equity cindy balance emotional fairness okay sorry if i offended you he scratched his chin and we reached the rear of the lot the fence was backed by tall trees and a soft breeze blew through them cindy said i feel good about kenny and me the whole reason i agreed to talk to you is because i wanted to do the right thing professor devanes murder was horrible but youre really wasting your time with me she wasnt a significant part of my life or kennys he only met her that one time and i just sat in on her class a couple of times before we talked about filing a complaint she was nice but even then i was ambivalent the moment i got in there i knew it was a mistake why the atmosphere the three of them sitting there at a long table tape recorder and pens and paper the whole thing was inquisitional not at all what professor devane led me to believe look im sorry shes dead and i admired her a lot but i have to say she was misleading how so she made it sound like it would be a counseling session everyone communicating their feelings trying to reach a resolution more like a discussion group the moment i saw that table i knew that was wrong kenny said there should have been black candles and he was right they were clearly out to judge men which of professor devanes classes did you sit in on sexroles and development i wasnt even enrolled but some of my friends were taking it they kept coming back to the house the sorority and telling everyone how great it was how they were learning all about gender and human behavior all about men i had a free period on tuesday so i figured why not was professor devane a good teacher she was a fantastic teacher riveting the lecture was in morton hall thats a huge room six hundred seats but she made you feel she was talking right to you which believe me is rare especially when it comes to freshman classes some of the faculty just go through the motions she had a way of personalizing things i said just as she did on tv exactly and she knew her stuff really a great lecturer and you sat in two three times said milo yes howd you come to complain about kenny the what happened the incident was on a monday night and i was still very upset on tuesday when i went to class she wet her lips with her tongue professor devane was lecturing on domestic violence and i started to feel like a victim it was one of those stupid impulsive things you do when youre stressedout i went up to her after class said i had a problem she took me to her office and just listened made some tea for me i cried a little and she gave me a tissue then when i calmed down she told me she might have a solution for me thats when she described the committee whatd she say about it that it was brandnew important in terms of womens rights on campus she said i could play a significant role in countering womens helplessness she looked at the book bag i had doubts but she seemed so caring i can take the bag now dont worry about it said milo so you feel she deceived you not i cant call it deliberate deception maybe i just heard what i wanted to because i was upset sounds like you had good reason to be upset cindy i said walking back to campus alone at night must have been scary very you hear all sorts of stories about crime she nodded weirdos stalking the hills look what happened to professor devane milo said you think a weirdo killed her i dont know but a woman in my sorority works on the student paper and she was doing some research over at the campus police station they told her there are lots of rapes and attempted rapes that never make the news and there i was it was pitchblack i had to find my way back not fun not much suddenly she was crying hands snapping across her face milo shifted the bag from hand to hand several times hefting it as if it were a ball wiping her eyes with her fingers she said sorry nothing to be sorry for he said believe me im sorry about plenty maybe even about talking to you cause whats the point college is rough enough without this kind of shi mess she wiped her eyes again excuse my language i just never thought id know anyone who was murdered milo pulled a small plasticwrapped package from a pocket and gave her a tissue had he come prepared for tears she took it and dabbed looked around the parking lot can i go please i have a twooclock all the way on north campus and my bikes parked over on gayley sure just a couple more questions whatd you think of the other members of the committee what do you mean were they inquisitional too he was the guy the grad student i forget his name casey locking i guess so he had a real attitude clear agenda which was being mr feminist probably kissing up to professor devane he impressed me as one of those guys who tries to prove how unsexist he is by dumping on other guys she smiled what cindy the funny thing is when he and kenny started sounding off against each other it was typical male stuff no offense locking was trying to be mr nonsexist but his style was still male hostile aggressive competitive maybe some things are unchangeable maybe we should just learn to live with each other as long as the strong dont pummel the weak said milo yes of course no one should stand for being victimized professor devane was victimized she stared at him a moist streak remained under one eye i know its terrible but what can i do just what youre doing cindy what about the other woman on the committee professor steinberger she was okay she really didnt say much it was clearly professor devanes show i got the feeling she had a personal stake in it whys that because afterward when i said i wanted to forget the whole thing she told me i shouldnt retreat from my position she would support me all the way and when i said no she got a little chilly distant as if id let her down i felt rotten on so many levels just wanted to get out of there and be by myself did you and she have any contact after that she called me once at the theta house nice again just wanting to know how i was doing she also offered to send me a reading list of books that might help me feminist books i guess so i wasnt really listening i kind of cut her off because you didnt trust her she was using all the right words but id had enough what about kenny what about him did she call him too not that i know no im sure she didnt because he would have told me he she stopped herself he what cindy nothing what were you going to say nothing just that he didnt mention her calling were you going to say kenny hated her she looked away if youve read the transcripts i guess thats no big shock no he didnt like her one bit he said she was a she was manipulative and a radical feminist kennys kind of conservative politically and i cant blame him for feeling railroaded he was already having a hard time at the u thinking about transferring out the committee was the final straw did he blame dr devane for having to transfer no he was just generally down on everything life in general i said or something specific she looked up with alarm i know what youre getting at but its ridiculous hed never touch her thats not kenny and he wasnt even in la the night she was killed hes in san diego except on weekends when he drives in to see me hes working hard to get his life together hes only nineteen he comes in every weekend said milo not every most and she was killed on a monday hes never in town on monday milo looked down at her and smiled sounds like youve been thinking about his schedule only after you called we were really surprised then we figured youd learned about the committee and we said oh my god unreal because you know the system you can get caught up in it people get abused i mean its so absurd that anyone would connect us to what happened were kids basically the last time i had anything to do with the police was when that guy came to class and told us about parked cars she smiled he had a parrot that policeman a trained parrot that could talk like stop youre under arrest and you have the right to remain silent i think he called him officer squawk or something whatever i really can take that bag milo handed it to her i really need to forget all this detective sturgis i have to concentrate on my grades because my mom makes sacrifices for me thats why i didnt go to private college so please sure cindy thanks for your time he gave her a card robberyhomicide she said shivering whats this for in case you think of something i wont believe me her small face puckered and i thought shed cry again then she said thanks and walked away cutie pie said milo i just want to give her milk and cookies tell her prince charming is coming soon and he doesnt have a rap sheet she feels shes found him already he shook his head shes a little intrapunitive wouldnt you say very blaming herself for what happened between her and kenny storm then for complaining storm he said smart kid like her hooking up with a dumb guy what is it low selfesteem more interested in storm now why his academic career hasnt gone well meaning he never got to receive the us concession money meaning he could still be angry and unresolved and maybe shes willing to lie for him maybe despite what she said he stayed over one weekend he could have borrowed cindys bike i said or he has one of his own neither he nor his daddy have returned calls selling real estate in la jolla should be easy enough to find out which company see if the alibi checks out his eyes drifted upward little cindy she looks like a fourteenyearold but talks like an adult then again the sweetheart who threw her baby to the dogs was pretty adorable too we drove out of the village hugging the eastern edge of the campus and cutting past sorority row students jogged and strolled and jaywalked with abandon the spiked tops of the cactus in the botanical garden stuck over the iron fence like supplementary security i said a picture of hope seems to be taking shape brilliant charismatic good with people but able to bend the rules when it suits her and from what cindy said to change faces pretty quickly consistent with the little boxes a laughing couple around kenny and cindys age darted across the street holding hands wrapped up in each other milo had to brake hard they kept going unaware ah love i said or too many years on walkmans and video games okay ill drop you at home why dont you let me off here and ill try to see professor steinberger the quiet one sometimes the quiet ones have the most to say okay he pulled over next to a bus bench two hispanic women in domestics uniforms were sitting there and they stared at us before looking away gonna walk home after that sure its only a couple of miles what an aerobicon listen if you have time and inclination i dont mind you talking to the other students involved in the committee too maybe you wont scare them as much as i scared cindy i thought you did fine with her he frowned maybe i shoulda brought a parrot you up for student interviews how do i locate them reaching over to the backseat he grabbed his briefcase and swung it onto his lap took out a sheet of paper and gave it to me xeroxed photoid student cards and class schedules the reproductions were dark and blurred turning cindy vespucci into a brunette kenneth storm had a full face short hair and a sad mouth but thats about all you could say about him i folded and pocketed it any rules about how i present myself he thought guess the truth would be fine anything that encourages them to talk theyll probably relate to you better professorial demeanor and all that maybe not i said professors are the ones who fail them the tall white psychology tower was on the outer edge of the science quad maybe more than architectural accident and the brick cube that housed chemistry was its nextdoor neighbor it had been a long time since id been inside the chem building and then only to take an advanced psychopathology course in borrowed classroom space back when id been a grad student psychology had been the us most popular major and the lecture halls had overflowed with those seeking selfunderstanding twenty years later fear of the future was the dominant motive and business administration was king chemistrys halls still oozed the vinegary reek of acetic acid and the walls were toothpastegreen maybe a bit grimier no one was in sight but i could hear clinking and splashing behind doors marked laboratory the directory listed two steinbergers gerald and julia both with offices on the third floor i took the stairs and found julias the door was open she was at her desk grading exams with radio softrock in the background a nicelooking woman around thirty wearing a black scoopnecked sweater over a white blouse and gray wool slacks an amberandoldsilver necklace that looked middle eastern rested on her chest she had square shoulders an earnest face that surprised itself by bottoming out in a pointed chin a serene mouth glossed pink and shiny brown hair ending at her shoulders the bangs clipped just above graceful eyebrows her eyes were gray clear and unbothered as they looked up beautiful really they made her beautiful she marked a paper and put it aside yes i told her who i was trying without success to make it sound logical and that id come to discuss hope devane oh puzzled might i see some identification pleasant voice chicago accent i showed her the badge she studied my name for a long time please she said handing it back and pointing to a chair the office was cramped but freshsmelling graymetal university issue brightened by batik wall hangings and folkart dolls positioned among the books on the shelves the radio rested on a windowsill behind her next to a potted coleus someone singing about the freedom that love brought the exams were stacked high the one shed put aside was filled with computations and red question marks shed given it a bnus when she saw me looking at it she covered it with a notebook and turned the stack over just as the phone rang hi she said actually not right now looking at me maybe in fifteen ill come to you pretty smile blush me too hanging up she pushed away from the desk and rested her hands on her lap my husbands down the hall we usually have lunch together if its a bad time no hes got things to do and this shouldnt take long so run that by me again im still intrigued youre on the faculty but youre working with the police department on hopes murder im on the faculty crosstown at the med school ive done forensic work and occasionally the police ask me to consult hope devanes murder is what they call a cold case no leads a new detective starting from scratch frankly im a member of the court of last resort crosstown she smiled the enemy i got my doctorate here so its more of a case of split allegiance how do you cope at football games i ignore them she laughed me too gerry my husband has become a football fanatic since we arrived we used to be at the university of chicago which believe me is no great seat of athletic achievement anyway im glad the police are still looking into hopes murder id assumed theyd given up whys that because after the first week or so there was nothing in the news isnt it true that the longer a case goes unsolved the less chance there is of success generally whats the name of the new detective i told her and she wrote it down does the fact that hes chosen not to come himself mean anything its a combination of time pressure and strategy i said hes working the case alone and he hasnt fared well with the faculty people hes interviewed so far in what way they treat him as if hes a neanderthal is he not at all well she said i suppose as a group we tend to be intolerant not that were really a group most of us have nothing in common beyond the patience to endure twentyplus years of schooling hope and i are prime examples of that so i dont think ill be of much help she knew you well enough to ask you to be on the interpersonal conduct committee she placed her pen on the desk the committee i figured it had to be that in terms of our relationship wed spoken a few times before she asked me to serve but we were far from friends how much do the police know about the committee they know its history and the fact that it was disbanded there are also transcripts of the three cases that were heard i noticed you didnt participate in the third thats because i resigned she said its obvious now that the whole thing was a mistake but it took me a while to realize it mistake in what way i think hopes motives were pure but they led her somewhat far afield i thought it would be an attempt to heal not create more conflict did you voice your concerns to her she tightened her lips and gazed up at the ceiling no hope was a complex person she wouldnt have listened i dont really know it was just i dont want to demean the dead lets just say she was strongwilled obsessive about the mistreatment of women definitely which is fine with me lifting the pen she tapped one knee sometimes passion blocks out contradictory information so much so and this is more your area than mine that i found myself wondering if she had a personal history of abuse that directed her scholarship the quiet one because of the extent of her passion i said she shifted in her chair bit her lip and nodded placed an index finger alongside one smooth cheek i must say i feel uncomfortable suggesting that because i dont want to trivialize hopes commitment to bring it down to the level of personal vindication im a physical chemist which is about as far as you get from psychoanalysis she wheeled back so her head was inches from the bookshelves a brownish rag dolls legs extended past her right ear she pulled it down sat it in her lap and played with its black string hair i want you to know that i thought highly of her she was brilliant and committed to her ideals which is rarer than it should be maybe i should explain how i got involved with the committee because clearly its not going to just go away please i said id appreciate that taking a deep breath she stroked the doll i began college as a premed and in my sophomore year i volunteered at a batteredwomens shelter on the south side of chicago to get brownie points for med school and because both my parents are physicians and oldstyle liberals and they taught me it was noble to help people i thought id heard everything around the dinner table but the shelter opened my eyes to a whole new terrible world putting it simply i was terrified it was one of the reasons i changed my mind about medicine her fingers parted the dolls hair the women i worked with the ones whod gotten past the fear and the denial and were in touch with what was being done to them had the same look i sometimes saw in hopes eyes part injury part rage i can only call it ferocious in hopes case it was strikingly discrepant from her usual manner which was cool and collected very cool and collected in control very much so she was a leader had tremendous force of personality but when we discussed abuse i saw that look in her eyes not always but frequently enough to remind me of the women at the shelter she gave a shy smile no doubt im overinterpreting did she ask you to serve because of your experience at the shelter she nodded we first met at a faculty tea one of those dreadful things at the beginning of the academic year where everyone pretends to get acquainted gerry had gone off to talk sports with some guys and hope came up to me she was also alone her husband wasnt there no she said he never came to parties she certainly didnt know me id just arrived i didnt know who she was but i had noticed her because of her clothes expensive designer suit good jewelry great makeup like some of the girls id known from lake forest heiresses you dont see much of that on campus we got to talking and i told her about the shelter she moved in a way that pinched the dolls soft torso and caused its head to pitch forward the funny thing is all those years i hadnt talked about it even to my husband smile and as you can tell i have no problem talking but there i was at a party with a virtual stranger getting into things id forgotten about horrendous things i actually had to go into a corner to dry my eyes looking back i think hope drew the memories out of me how by listening the right way dont you people call it active listening she smiled again just what youre doing right now i learned about that too at the shelter i suppose anyone can grasp the rudiments but there are few virtuosos like hope she laughed there just what youre doing bouncing things back it works even when you know whats going on doesnt it i smiled and stroked my chin and said sounds like you think its effective in a stagy voice she laughed again got up and closed the door she was shapely and taller than id thought fiveeight or nine a good deal of it legs yes she said sitting down again and crossing them she was a brilliant listener had a way of moving in not just emotionally actually getting close physically inching toward you but without seeming intrusive because she made you feel as if you were the most important person in the world charisma and passion yes like a good evangelist the legs uncrossed this must sound so strange first i tell you i didnt know her and then i go on as if i did but everything ive said is just an impression she and i never got close though at first i thought she wanted a friend whys that the day after the tea she called me saying shed really enjoyed meeting me would i like to have coffee in the faculty club i was ambivalent i liked her but i didnt want to talk about the shelter again even so i accepted determined to keep my mouth shut the doll bounced unbelievably i ended up talking again about the worst cases id seen women whod been brutalized beyond comprehension that was the first time i saw the ferociousness in her eyes she looked at the doll put it back on the shelf all this cant possibly help you it might how by illuminating her personality i said right now theres little else to go on that assumes her personality had something to do with her being murdered you dont think it did i have no idea when i found out shed been killed my first assumption was that her politics had angered some psychotic a stranger she stared at me youre not actually saying it had anything to do with the committee we dont have enough information to say anything but is it impossible highly improbable id say they were just kids things got pretty rough especially with the storm boy yes that one did have a temper and a foul mouth but the transcripts may be misleading make him out worse than he was in what way she thought he was he seemed to me more bark than bite one of those blustery kids who throws tantrums and then gets it off his chest and the accounts of the murder made it sound like a stalking i just cant see a kid doing that then again i dont have kids so what do i know when hope asked you to serve what specifics did she give you she reassured me it wouldnt take much time she said it was provisional but certain to be made permanent and that it had strong backing from the administration which of course wasnt true in fact she made it sound as if the administration had asked her to set it up she told me wed be focusing on offenses that didnt qualify for criminal prosecution and that our goal would be early detection what she called primary prevention catching problems early catching problems early in order to avoid the kinds of things id seen at the shelter shaking her head she knew what button to push so she misled you oh yes she said sadly i suppose she felt a straightforward approach wouldnt have worked and maybe it wouldnt have i certainly dont enjoy sitting in judgment of people from the transcripts the other member casey locking didnt mind judging yes he was quite enthusiastic doctrinaire really not that i fault him how sincere can any student be when collaborating with his faculty supervisor power is power did hope say why she appointed him no she did tell me one member would have to be a man to avoid the appearance of a war between the sexes how did she react when you resigned she didnt not at all not at all i called her office and left a message on her machine explaining that i just didnt feel comfortable continuing and thanking her for thinking of me she never returned the call we never spoke again i assumed she was angry and now were judging her that bothers me because no matter what she did i believe she had good intentions and what happened to her is an atrocity she got up and showed me the door im sorry i cant talk about this anymore her hand twisted the knob and the door opened the gray eyes had narrowed with strain thanks for your time i said and sorry to dredge up unpleasantness maybe it needed dredging the whole thing is sickening such a loss not that one persons life is worth more than anothers but hope was impressive she had spine especially impressive if im right that she had been abused because that would mean shed made it had summoned the strength to help others she bit her lip again she was strong the last person youd think of as a victim it was pm when i stepped outside i thought of the way hope had elicited julia steinbergers tears at the faculty tea by stoking old memories a good listener cindy vespucci said the same thing but she hadnt handled kenny storm or the other two male students very skillfully able to deal with women but not with men most probably a man had executed her i realized thats how i thought of the murder an execution which man longsuffering husband pushed to the brink a deranged stranger or someone midway between those two extremes on the intimacy scale crossing the quad i sat down at a stone table and checked the class schedules milo had given me unless they were playing hooky patrick huang was in the middle of a thermodynamics class deborah brittain was contending with math for humanities majors and reed muscadine the theaterarts grad student was participating in something called performance seminar b a halfmile away in macmanus hall on the north end of the campus but tessa bowlbys psychology of perception class would be letting out in fifteen minutes in the psych tower i studied the picture of the young woman who had accused reed muscadine of date rape very short dark hair and a thin slightly weakjawed face even allowing for the poor photocopy she looked discouraged the drooping eyes of someone much older but not because of the encounter with muscadine the picture had been taken at the beginning of the school year months prior i had a quick cup of vendingmachine coffee and returned to the psychology tower to see if life had knocked her even lower her class let out five minutes early and students gushed into the hall like dam water she wasnt hard to spot heading for the exit alone hauling a denim bag bulging with books she stopped short when i said ms bowlby her arm dropped and the bags weight yanked down her shoulder despite the tentative chin and a few pimples she was waifishly attractive with very white skin and enormous blue eyes her hair was dyed absolute black cut unevenly either carelessly or with great intention her nose was pink at the tip and nostrils a cold or allergies she wore a baggy black raglan sweater with one sleeve starting to unravel old black pipestem jeans torn at the knees and laceup leather boots with thick soles and toes scuffed fuzzy she backed up against the wall to let classmates pass i showed her my id and began my introduction no she said waving one narrow hand frantically please pleading in a hoarse voice her eyes darted to the exit sign ms bowlby no she said louder leave me alone i have nothing to say she shot for the exit i hung back for a moment then followed watching from a distance as she hurried out the main doors of the tower racing nearly tumbling down the front steps toward the inverted fountain that fronted the tower the fountain was dry and streams of students converged near the dirty black hole before spreading out and radiating across campus like a giant ant trail she ran clumsily struggling with the heavy bag a thin fragilelooking figure so emaciated her buttocks failed to fill out the narrow jeans and the denim flapped with each stride drugs stress anorexia illness as i wondered she slipped into the throng and became one of many her anxiety panic really made me want to talk to the man shed accused i recalled the details of the complaint movie and dinner heavy petting tessa claiming forced entry muscadine consensual sex the kind of thing that could never be proved either way aids testing for him shed already gotten tested negative so far but now she was ghostly pale thin fatigued the disease took time to incubate maybe her luck had changed that could account for the panic but she was still enrolled in classes maybe hope devane had been a source of support now with hope dead and her own health in question was she overwhelmed the testing had been done at the student health center getting records without legal grounds would be impossible having a look at muscadine seemed more important than ever but the acting seminar was one of those weekly things that lasted four hours and was only halfover in the meantime id try the others patrick huang would be free in thirty minutes deborah brittain soon after huangs class was nearby in the engineering building back to the science quad as i started to turn a deep voice behind me said sleuthing on campus detective casey locking stood several steps above me looking amused his long hair was freshly moussed and he wore the same long leather coat jeans and motorcycle boots black tshirt under the coat the skull ring was still there too despite his remark about getting rid of it glinting in the sunlight the deathshead grin wide almost alive in the ringed hand was a cigarette in the other an attaché case olive leather goldembossed cdl over the clasp the fingers sandwiching the cigarette twitched and smoke puffed and rose im not a detective i said that made him blink but nothing else on his face moved i climbed to his level and showed him my consultants badge his mouth pursed as he studied it so seacrest hadnt told him meaning they werent confidants phd in what psychology really he flicked ashes for the police sometimes i consult to the police what exactly do you do it varies from case to case crimescene analysis all kinds of things my ambiguity didnt seem to bother him interesting did they assign you to hopes murder because she was a psychologist or because the case is perceived as psychologically complex both police psychologist he took a long hard drag holding the smoke in the career opportunities they never tell you about in grad school how long have you been doing it a few years white vapors emerged from his nostrils around here all they talk about is pure academics they measure their success by the number of tenuretrack types they place all the tenuretrack jobs are disappearing but they groom us for them anyway so much for realitytesting but i guess the academic worlds never been noted for having a good grip on reality do you think hopes murder will ever be solved dont know how about you doesnt look promising he said which stinks is that big detective on the ball yes he smoked some more and scratched his upper lip police psychologist actually that appeals to me dealing with the big issues crime deviance the nature of evil since the murder ive thought a lot about evil come up with any insights he shook his head students arent permitted to have insights have you found a new advisor yet not yet i need someone who wont make me start all over or dump scut work on me hope was great that way if you did your job she treated you like an adult laissezfaire when it was deserved he ground out the cigarette she knew the difference between good and bad she was a fine human being and whoever destroyed her should experience an excruciatingly slow immensely bloody inconceivably painful death his lips turned upward but this time you couldnt call the end product a smile he put down his attaché case and reaching under the coat pulled out a hardpack of marlboros but thats unlikely to happen right because even if somehow they do catch him therell be legal loopholes procedural calisthenics probably some expert from our field claiming the prick suffered from psychosis or an impulsecontrol disorder no ones ever heard of before thats why i like the idea of what you do being on the right side my research areas selfcontrol petty stuff freefeeding in rats versus schedules of reinforcement but maybe one of these days ill be able to relate it to the real world selfcontrol and crime detection why not selfcontrols an integral part of civilization the integral component babies are born cute and cuddly and amoral and its certainly not hard to train them to be immoral is it he made a pistol with his free hand everyones making such a big deal about tenyearolds with uzis but its just fagin and the street rats with a little technology thrown in right lack of selfcontrol i said on a societal level take away external control mechanisms and the internalization process conscience development is immobilized and what you get are millions of savages running around giving free rein to their impulses like the piece of shit who killed hope so goddamn stupid he produced a lighter and ignited another cigarette slightly shaky hands he jammed them in the pockets of his coat i tell you id study real life if i could but id be in school for the rest of my life and thats a nobrainer hope steered me right said not to try for the nobel prize pick something doable get my union card and move on he sucked smoke finding another advisor wont be easy im considered the departmental fascist because i cant stand platitudes and i believe in the power of discipline and hope was okay with that hope was the ultimate scholarslashgoodmother tough honest secure enough to let you go your own way once you proved you werent full of shit she looked at everything with a fresh eye refused to do or be what was expected of her so they killed her they they he some drooling psychopathic totally fuckedup savage any theories about the specific motive he glanced back at the glass doors of the tower ive spent a long time thinking about it and all ive come up with are mental pretzels finally i realized its a waste of energy because i have no data just my feelings and my feelings were knocking me low thats really why it took so long to get back to my research thats why i couldnt even go near my data til last night but now its time to get back in gear hope would want that she had no patience for excuses whose idea was it to barter data for car care i said he stared at me i called phil up he said he was having trouble getting the car started so i offered to help so you knew him before just from working with hope basically phils asocial well good talking to you he picked up the attaché case and started up the stairs i said whats your view of the interpersonal conduct committee he stopped smiled that again my view i thought it was an excellent idea with insufficient enforcement power some people believe the committee was a mistake some people believe quality of life means anarchy so you think it should have been allowed to continue sure but what chance was there of that that rich snots father shut it down because this place operates on the same principles as any other political system money and power if the girl he harassed had been the one with the fatcat daddy you can believe the committee would be alive and healthy he smoked the cigarette down to the filter looked at it snapped it away the point is women will always be physically weaker than men and their safety cant be left up to the good graces of anyone with a penis the only way to simulate equity is through rules and consequences discipline better believe it he smoothed a leather lapel youre asking me about the committee because you think it had something to do with hopes death one of those chickenshit little weenies getting back at her but like i said they were all cowards cowards commit murder but i sat on the committee too and im obviously intact same logic cruvic had used talking about abortion protest let me ask you something else i said did hope ever mention being abused herself the lapel bunched as his hand closed tight around the leather no why sometimes peoples work is directed by personal experience the black brows dipped low and his eyes got cold you want to reduce her achievements to psychopathology i want to learn as much as i can about her did she ever talk about her past uncurling his fingers he let his arms drop very slowly then he raised them very quickly almost a martialarts move folding them across his chest as if warding off attack she talked about her work thats all whatever personal things i was able to infer came from that what did you infer that she was incredibly intelligent and focused and cared deeply about what she was doing thats why she took me on focus is my thing i get my teeth in and dont let go he smiled showing white enamel she appreciated the fact that i was willing to come out and say how i really felt that i believed people cant just follow their impulses around here thats still heresy what about her other student mary ann gonsalvez what about her is she also focused dont know we didnt see each other much good talking to you got to run an experiment if you ever do find the piece of shit convict him sentence him to die invite me to san quentin to jam the hypodermic into his veins giving a choppy salute he vaulted up the steps to the tower shoved at one of the heavy glass doors as it swung open i caught a momentary flash of reflection the delicate mouth curving but hard to read like cruvic hed talked about hope with passion wet eyes notwithstanding her husband hadnt leading her to turn elsewhere love sex stab in the back seacrest had no history of violence but men who killed their wives often didnt and like seacrest they tended to be middleaged as for the lover being left unharmed that was also typical jealous husbands targeting their wives sparing the lover unless he happened to get in the way but if locking had been hopes lover would seacrest have maintained any connection to him i thought about the interplay between the two men no signs of hostility but formal then a discrepancy hit me last night locking had called seacrest professor today it was phil did any of it matter i bought another cup of cardboardflavored coffee and drank it on my way over to the engineering building wondering what kind of surprises a chat with patrick huang would bring he was flustered when i showed up at his locker but offered no resistance when i suggested we talk we found a bench on the west end of the quad and i offered to get him coffee no thanks im caffeined enough nodoz exams he simulated a tremoring hand and frowned he was fiveten and heavyset with a smooth square face and shoulderlength hair parted in the middle his wrinkled tshirt said stone temple pilots and he wore it over paisley cutoffs and rubber beach thongs a couple of books were sandwiched under his arm both on thermodynamics thanks for talking to me patrick he looked down at the bench i figured somebody would finally get to me whys that after what happened to professor devane i figured the committee was bound to come up im surprised it took this long he fidgeted did they send a psychologist because they think im nuts no i do work for the police and they thought i could be helpful on this case he thought about that i think ill get a burger okay sure leaving his books behind he went to one of the snack bars and came back with a waxedpaper wad a box of crinkled fries buried under a blob of ketchup and a large orange soda i have an uncle whos a psychologist he said settling robert chan works for the prison system dont know him i said my dads a lawyer he unwrapped the wad the paper was translucent with grease and cheese dripped over the sides of the hamburger biting down hard he chewed fast and swallowed my dad was megapissed about the committee that i didnt tell him about it at the time i thought it was a bad joke why get into it but after i heard about professor devane i said uhoh im screwed he rolled his eyes trouble with your father hes traditional big shame on the family and all that he took a huge bite out of the burger and ate stoically while gazing across the quad not that i did anything wrong everything i said at the hearing was true that girls a stone racist i never hassled her she used me but dad he whistled and shook his head after he chewed me out and reduced my creditcard limit for six months he said i should expect trouble because the police were bound to look into professor devanes background when it didnt happen i thought whew lucky break looking around some more he dragged his eyes back to me wrong again anyway ive got no real problem because on the night she was killed i was at a big family gettogether grandparents fiftieth anniversary we all went out to lawrys on la cienega prime rib and all the trimmings i was there the whole time from eight to after eleventhirty sitting right next to dad numbah one son along with about a hundred relatives ive even got documented proof my cousin took pictures lots of pictures big surprise huh he shot me an angry smile placed his front teeth over his lower lip and wiggled an index finger ah so say cheese with wontons crick crick i didnt respond want some he said pointing to the fries no thanks he put his mouth to the straw and filled it with orange soda you want the pictures ill have my dad send them he actually put them in his office vault he laughed now can i go any thoughts about professor devane nope what about the committee i told you big joke how so hauling people in like some kind of kangaroo court one persons word against the others i dont know how many other guys got hassled but if their cases were as stupid as mine youve got plenty of pissedoff people maybe one of them offed professor devane but you have an alibi he lowered the drink to the bench it hit hard and some soda splashed onto the stone thank god i do because for weeks after the hearing i was pissed at her but you know us good little chinese boys play with computers never get violent i said nothing anyway im over the whole thing and to prove it i see that girl on campus all the time just walk by shine her on and thats the way i eventually felt about professor devane forget about her get on with things so you felt victimized i said yeah but it was partly my own fault i should have checked with dad first before showing up he told me she had no right to do that to me whyd you go a letter comes to you on official university stationery what would you do how many other guys were involved sorry i said im not talking to them about you either he blinked yeah okay better to forget the whole thing he picked up the books and stood thats all ive got to say im probably in trouble already for talking to you without checking with dad you want the photos contact him allan d huang curtis ballou semple and huang he shot off a downtown address on seventh street and a phone number and i copied them down anything else you want to tell me patrick about the committee the committee professor devane deborah brittain anything whats to tell devane was hard as nails good at twisting words and her agenda was clear all men are scum what about the other judges mostly they just sat there like dummies it was her show and thats what it was a show like one of those improv things where they call you up from the audience and make a fool out of you only this was real his free hand balled she actually asked me if id gone to college for the purpose of finding women to harass all because i helped that girl sucks huh well bye time to hitch up the ricksha deborah brittains math class was long over and her schedule said she had nothing more today she lived offcampus in sherman oaks so i hiked to north campus to find reed muscadine macmanus hall was an unobtrusive pink building with auditoriums on the ground floor performance seminar b now twothirds over was held in the wiley theater at the back the blond maple double doors were unlocked and i slipped through lights off maybe fifty rows of padded seats facing a bluelit stage as my eyes adjusted i made out a dozen or so people scattered around the room no one turned as i walked toward the front up on the stage were two people sitting on hard wooden chairs hands on knees staring into each others eyes i took an aisle seat in the third row and watched the couple onstage didnt budge the sparse audience remained inert and the theater was silent two more minutes of nothing five minutes six group hypnosis tough job market for actors so maybe the u was training them to be departmentstore mannequins five more minutes passed before a man in the front row stood up and snapped his fingers pudgy and bald tiny eyeglasses black turtleneck baggy green cords the couple got up and walked offstage in opposite directions another pair came on women they sat assumed the position more nothing my eyes were accustomed to the darkness and i scanned the audience trying to guess which young man was muscadine hopeless i looked at my watch over an hour to go and spending it in static heaven was threatening to put me to sleep i walked quietly to the front row and sat down next to the bald fingersnapper he gave me a sidelong look then ignored me up close i saw a little patch of hair under his lower lip what jazz musicians used to call a honey mop taking out my lapd badge i flexed it so the plastic coating caught stage light he turned again im looking for reed muscadine i whispered he returned his eyes to the stage where the two women continued to simulate paralysis i put the badge away and crossed my legs the bald man turned to me again glaring i smiled he hooked a thumb toward the rear of the theater and got up but instead of walking he stood there hands on hips staring down at me a few eyes from the audience drifted toward me too the turtlenecked man snapped his fingers and they sat straighter he hooked his thumb again i got up and left to my surprise he followed me catching up out in the hall im professor dirkhoff what the hells going on his chin hairs were ginger striped with white as were the few left on his head he scowled and the honey mop tilted forward like a collection of tiny bayonets im looking for i heard what you said why before i could answer he said well stretching the word theatrically its about professor hope devanes murd that what does reed have to do with that one hand flew up to his face and the knuckles rested under the chin socratically were talking to students who knew professor devane and hes one of them there must be hundreds he said what a waste of time and it doesnt permit you to barge in here unannounced sorry for interrupting ill wait til after class then youll be wasting your time reeds not here okay thanks i turned and walked away when id taken three steps he said i mean hes not here at all not in class or not in school both he dropped out a month ago im quite miffed more than miffed our acting program is extremely selective and we expect our students to finish no matter what the reason what was his reason he turned his back on me and headed back to the swinging doors placing one hand on blond wood he gave a pitying smile he got a job what kind of job long deep breath one of those soap operas a serious mistake on his part whys that the boy has talent but he needs seasoning soon hell be driving a porsche and wondering why he feels so empty like everyone else in this town back home a note on the fridge said how about we eat in went for provisions with handsome back by six at fivethirty milo called and i pulled out my notes and got ready to report on the days interviews but he broke in got a response to my teletype las vegas homicide has a cold case that matches twentythreeyearold call girl found on a dark side street near her apartment stabbed in the heart groin and back in that order under a tree no less a month before hope theyve been figuring it for a lustpsycho working girls get killed all the time there this girl danced in addition to hooking had been in a topless show at the palm princess casino last year but recently shed been working the pits as a freelance two three hundred a trick so why was she found on the street the theory was she hitched up with the wrong john and he killed her either on the way over to party at her place or afterward maybe she was walking him out to his car and he surprised her with the knife or maybe she hadnt made him happy enough or they couldnt agree on price and he left mad any physical resemblance to hope from the photo they faxed me no other than they were both goodlooking this girl mandy wrights her name looks gorgeous actually but darkhaired and twentythree makes her a lot younger than hope and clearly no professor but given the wound pattern we may have a traveling psycho so i think id better concentrate on finding out if any other homicides around the country match for all her controversy the good professor may very well have been the victim of a nutcase stranger im planning to fly out to vegas tonight play showmeyoursandillshowyoumine he coughed so what were you saying before i could tell him robin came through the door holding a grocery bag and spikes leash her color was high and she was smiling as she waved she put the bag down and kissed me i mouthed milo say hi she left to change i relayed the message then told him all of it the conversations with julia steinberger and casey locking tessa bowlbys panic patrick huangs anger and alleged alibi reed muscadine dropping out to take the acting job bottom line hope made a strong impression on everyone though if it is a traveling serial thats probably no longer relevant the bowlby girl was she really scared petrified pale and skinny and weaklooking too so i wondered if muscadines aids test might have come back positive and if he dropped out cause hes sick or maybe it was just because he got the acting job but whats the difference dont go around feeling useless yet mandy wright changes things but i cant afford to eliminate anyone or anything at this point just because it looks like a psycho doesnt mean it was a stranger maybe hope and mandy knew the same psycho a call girl and a professor this professor may turn out to be different he said so im still gonna talk to kenny storm and im sure as hell gonna verify the huang boys alibi and if you dont mind talking to the other two girls id appreciate it something else before vegas called i was looking into lawyer barones recent cases and hopes name doesnt come up in any of them so what did he pay hope for something she didnt want publicized thats the only thing i can think of now barone does lots of porno defense mostly out of his san francisco office and pornos something a call girl like mandy could get involved with but as to hopes role i just cant put it together barone could have been looking for academic and feminist credentials to shore up the defense i said then why no record of her on the cases maybe barone hired her to write a report but didnt like the end product its happened to me could be whatever im just about to put in my tenth call to the good barrister and id still like to learn more about dr cruvic the whole consulting thing is interesting all that money robin returned to the kitchen and began heating water i said in terms of cruvic i can check out the womens health center in santa monica got an address no sorry okay thanks alex off to burbank airport have a good trip maybe you can get in some gambling on the taxpayers time tsktsk anyway games of chance arent my thing randomness scares me when i put down the phone robin was slicing onions tomatoes and celery and a pot of spaghetti approached a boil on the stove gambling she said milos going to vegas he found a murder there that matches hopes i told her the details the knife stopped if its a nut she said there could be others hes checking around the country so ugly she said that womens health center you mentioned holly bondurant used to be involved in a place in santa monica i know because she did a benefit concert a few years ago and i set up her twelvestring whats the connection between the center and the murder probably nothing but milo got interested because hope met a beverly hills gynecologist named cruvic there she ended up consulting to cruvics private practice counseling patients undergoing fertility procedures we went over to see him this morning and milo wondered if there was something going on between him and hope why because he spoke of her with such passion and her marriage seems somewhat passionless so the obvious question came up you know how thorough milo is even with this new lead he wants to clear everything she put the knife down went to the phone and punched numbers holly its robin castagna hi yes it has been fine great and with you good hows joaquin he must be what fourteen youre kidding listen holly i dont know if you can help me but after she hung up she said shell meet you tomorrow at nine am cafe alligator thanks its the least i can do later during dinner she pushed food around her plate and her wineglass went untouched whats the matter i said i dont know all the things youve been involved in and this one seems to be getting to me there is a special cruelty to it someone that bright and talented cut off like that maybe thats it or maybe im just sick and tired of women being killed because theyre women she reached across the table grabbed my hand and squeezed it hard it wears on you alex looking over your shoulder being told its your responsibility to be vigilant i know men are the usual victims of violence but theyre almost always the victimizers i guess nowadays everyones at risk the world dividing up into predators and prey whats happening are we returning to the jungle im not sure we ever got out i said i worry about you all the time especially when youre out at night alone i never say anything because i figure you can handle yourself and i dont think you want to hear it she picked up her wineglass studied it drank i didnt tell holly what you were up to just that you were my guy a psychologist wanted to learn about the center shes a sixties type might have gotten scared away by the word police ill deal with it i touched her hand i like being your guy i like it too looking down at her untouched food she said ill refrigerate this maybe youll want a late snack i started to clear she put a hand on my shoulder if youre up for it why dont we take spike for a walk in the canyon its still light out cafe alligator was a storefront in an old building on broadway central santa monica ten blocks from the beach the bricks had been painted swampgreen and a stonedlooking saurian coiled above a black sign that said espensive espresso cheap eats inside were walls of the same algae tint four tables covered with yellow oilcloth a pastry casetakeout counter backed by shelves of coffee and tea for sale a fat man with a bulletskull roasted beans with the intensity of a concert pianist lowvolume reggae music came from ceiling speakers last night id played holly bondurants last lp polychrome fifteenyearold album but i recognized her right away in the jacket photo her hair had been strawberry blond waistlength halfconcealing a beautiful celtic face now it was short and blondgray and shed put on thirty pounds but her face was still smooth and youthful she wore a red velvet maxidress black vest laceup boots onyx necklace a floppy blackvelvet hat rested on an empty chair alex she smiled stayed seated gave me her hand and looked at a halffilled coffee mug pardon my starting without you but i need my fix care for a cup please she waved at the fat man he filled a cup and brought it over anything else holly something to eat alex great muffins a muffins fine whats good today jake cranberry said the fat man almost grudgingly orangeraisin and chocolatechocolatechip arent bad either bring an assortment please she faced me it was nice hearing from robin too after all these years she used to work on all my instruments her voice was melodious and her eyes crinkled when she smiled she talked with every muscle of her face that animated manner you see in actresses and others who live off public adulation she told me shes still doing luthiery right very actively jake brought my coffee and the pastry basket and slunk back to his beans she picked up a cranberry muffin and nibbled youre a psychologist i nodded the center can always use mentalhealth people times are rough financially and we get fewer and fewer volunteers its good of you to inquire actually i said thats not what i came to talk to you about oh she put the muffin down sometimes i consult to the police right now im working on a murder case hope devane she moved back her eyes lacked the capacity to harden but there was injury in them trust betrayed the police she said im sorry i said there was no intention to mislead but the case remains unsolved and ive been asked to learn anything i can about her we know she volunteered at the center she said nothing jake picked up the tension from across the room and stopped grinding did you ever meet her i said she studied the muffins goldenbrown surface turned it over smiled at jake and he resumed his work what do you know about the center she said not much it was established so poor women could have access to basic health care prenatal counseling nutrition breast exams and pap smears family planning it used to be part of the university med school rotation but that ended a long time ago and we had to depend upon volunteers i did a few concerts for them helped them get stuff supplies supplies donations they still think of me as someone with connections sometimes i can actually accomplish something last week i heard of an agent whos redoing his office and managed to get some of his old furniture she looked at the pastry case jake said copacetic she smiled again and turned back to me i met hope a couple of times but she really wasnt involved though we thought shed be the first time i saw her was at last years fundraiser we had a variety show at the aero theater and a buffet afterward at le surph she bought a fivehundreddollar ticket that entitled her to a whole table but she said she had no one to bring so we put her on the dais because of her credentials she sounded like someone we could have used and she impressed a lot of people with her intelligence and her personality very dynamic shortly after someone sponsored her for the board and we voted her in but she never ended up contributing much she fingercombed her hair and drummed the table i guess what im saying is what happened to her was a horror but she had very little to do with the center and im worried about getting bad pr no reason you should get any i said its just background stuff trying to understand her why didnt she contribute more she took a long time to answer she wasnt how can i say this at the fundraiser she had ideas talked about bringing in other psychologists grad students from the university developing a volunteer mentalhealth program her qualifications were fantastic and the person who sponsored her said she was dynamite she showed up for the next board meeting came around for a few weeks counseled a few patients then she just stopped her book was out and i guess she was too busy none of the programs got activated she ate more muffin chewing slowly without pleasure so she got too busy i said look she said i dont enjoy judging other people especially someone whos dead was the person who sponsored her dr cruvic you know mike i met him once yes it was him which was another reason she had credibility hes been one of our most active board members really gives his time so he and hope knew each other before the fundraiser sure he brought her robin said youre a guitarist i play a little she said you were very good shes biased she wiped her lips with her napkin i dont play much anymore after i gave birth nothing but my son seemed important these questions about mike cruvic do the police suspect him of something no i said there are no suspects at all is there something i should know about him hes been good to the center she said but her tone was flat and he brought her to the fundraiser are you asking if they had something going she said did they i wouldnt know and whats the difference hope was murdered because of her views wasnt she is that the assumption at the center thats my assumption why else she spoke out and was silenced she stared at me you really do suspect mike dont you no i said but anyone with a relationship to hope is being checked out checked out sounds like cia stuff basic police stuff i understand about cruvics value to the center but if theres something i should know she shook her head their relationship i feel like such a traitor but what happened to her she closed her eyes took several shallow breaths as if practicing yoga opened them and let her fingers graze the muffin then picked up her hat and traced the edge of the brim im telling you this because it feels like the right thing to do but it also feels wrong i nodded she breathed a few more times one time after the board meeting i saw them it was late at night i was measuring rooms for furniture thought everyone else had gone home but when i walked out to the parking lot mikes car was still there way at the far end its easy to spot he drives a bentley he and hope were standing next to it talking her car was next to his a little red thing they werent doing anything physical but they were standing close to each other very close facing each other as if ready to kiss or theyd already kissed they heard me and they both turned very quickly then she hurried to her car and drove away mike stayed there for a second one leg bent almost as if he wanted me to see he was relaxed then he waved and got into the bentley she winced not worth much is it and please if you question mike or anyone else dont mention my name okay okay i said after hope stopped coming round was there resentment of mike because he sponsored her if there was i didnt hear it as i said mikes our most reliable volunteer md how often does he see patients there i dont get involved in scheduling but i do know hes been coming for years doing obstetricsgynecology she tensed i assume abortions i said i dont know her voice had risen and if he does them so what because abortion sometimes inspires violence but mike wasnt murdered hope was i really dont want to get into any more of this she stood i really dont fair enough sorry to upset you its all right she said but please i beg you dont draw us into the abortion thing weve avoided problems so far but all we need is for this to hit the press promise i said she laughed boy you really got me into a fix when you called i thought you wanted to volunteer so i spoke to the director on your behalf set up an appointment for you in a half hour now ive got to call and tell her id still like to talk to her and i cant stop you can i im not the enemy holly she looked down on me hold on she walked to the back of the restaurant veered right and disappeared jake finished with the beans and concentrated on glaring at me til holly came back shes not happy but shell see you very briefly marge showalsky but dont expect to learn much about hope thanks i said and sorry forget it she said im sure youre not the enemy robins too smart for that the stretch of olympic that housed the womens health center was one of those clumsy la mixes factories junkyards storage barns a trendy prep school pretending it was somewhere else by erecting a border of potted ficus the clinic was a single story of charmless brown brick next to a parking lot rimmed with iron posts and heavy chains the front door was locked i rang the bell and gave my name a moment later i was clicked in three women sat in the waiting room and none of them looked up at the rear were swinging wooden doors with small windows the walls were covered with posters on aids awareness breast examination nutrition support groups for trauma a tv in the corner was tuned to the discovery channel animals chasing each other one door opened and a heavy bespectacled woman around sixty held it ajar and stuck her head out she had short gray curly hair and a round pink face that wasnt jolly her eyeglasses were steelrimmed and square she wore a dark green sweater blue jeans and sneakers dr delaware im marge she boomed im tied up gimme a minute as the door closed the women in the waiting room looked up closest to me was a black girl around eighteen with huge wounded eyes meticulous cornrows and tightly clenched lips she wore the uniform of a fastfood outlet and clutched a danielle steel paperback in both hands across from her were what looked to be a mother and daughter both blond daughter fifteen or sixteen mom an old forty with black roots pouchy eyes sunken body and spirit maybe daughter had something to do with that she looked me straight in the eye and winked then licked her lips she had an unusually narrow face offcenter nose lowset ears and a slightly webbed neck her hair color looked natural except for the hotpink highlights at the tips she wore it long and teased huge and flipped back her daisy duke cutoffs barely covered her skinny haunches and a black halter top exposed spaghetti arms a flat white midriff and minimal shoulders three earrings in one ear four in the other an iron nose ring the skin around the puncture still inflamed high black boots reached midway up her calves black hoop earrings were the size of drink coasters she winked again gleefully furtive crossing of legs her mother saw it and rattled her magazine the girl gave a wide naughty smile her teeth were blunt pegs one hand fingerwaved foreshortened thumbs it added up to some kind of genetic misalignment maybe nothing with an official name what used to be called syndromy back in my intern days her legs shifted again a hard nudge from her mother made her sit still and pout and look down at the floor the black girl had watched the whole thing now she returned to her book one hand rubbing her abdomen as if it ached the door opened again marge showalsky motioned me in and led me down a hall of examining rooms lucky for you its a quiet day her office was large but dim with moisture stains on the ceiling random furnishings and bookshelves that didnt look earthquakesafe halfopen blinds gave a striped view of the asphalt lot she settled behind a desk not much wider than her shoulders two folding chairs i took one used to be an electronics factory transistors or something thought wed never get rid of the metal smell two posters hung on the wall behind her gertrude stein and alice b toklas at a cafe table under the legend girltalk a georgia okeeffe skullinthedesert print so you work for the police doing what i told her keeping it general she righted her glasses and gave a bearish grin you give good bullshit best ive had this week well i cant tell you much either the women who come here have very little left except their privacy the only person im interested in is hope devane she smiled again you think i dont know who you are youre the shrink who works with sturgis anyway in answer to your anticipated questions yes we do terminations when we can find a doctor to perform them no i wont tell you which doctors do them and finally hope devane wasnt involved with us much so im sure her murder had nothing to do with us not involved much i said as opposed to dr cruvic her laugh could have corroded metal she opened a drawer pulled out a roughtextured briar pipe rubbed the mouthpiece mike cruvic is an md with excellent credentials willing to make a regular commitment to women in need want to guess how many other hippocratic types are standing in line to do that this place is run from month to month mostly its nurses on their offhours a machine answers our phone and we try to listen for emergencies maybe next month well get voice mail if you are dying press one she put the pipe in her mouth bit down so hard the bowl tilted upward money crunch i said strangulation time she raised a fist few years ago we had government grants staff on payroll a damn good immunizationandscreening program then the government started discussing healthcare reform morons came out from washington asking us about accountability and things got weird yanking out the pipe she pointed it like a periscope so whats it like working with milo sturgis only reason i agreed to meet with you was to ask you know him by reputation you too the straight shrink who hangs around with him hes legendary in the gay community no at the la country club what do you think her eyes twinkled you know some people think youre in the closet that if you were really a good shrink youd realize youre in love with him i smiled hey we got mona lisa she smiled back around the pipestem looking oddly enough like teddy roosevelt so tell me how come he never gets involved in what sexual politics putting his image to constructive use youd have to ask him that ho ho ive touched a nerve well he should gay cop breaking down barriers the way he went up against the department what was it five years ago broke that lieutenants jaw because he called him a fag she put the pipe back in chewed with satisfaction at certain bars people still talk about that interesting twist i said you know different he broke the lieutenants jaw because the lieutenant endangered his life well she said i guess thats a reason too so why no social conscience he never answers calls from fundraisers or march organizers never joins anything same with that doctor boyfriend studs like that they could do some good maybe he feels he already is she looked me up and down are you bisexual no so whats the connection were friends just friends huh she laughed like hope and cruvic her laughter died i understand your wanting privacy i said but in a case like this everything gets examined then get a court order look what if they were doing each other three times a day on top of his desk and im not saying they were who gives a shit mike didnt kill her who cares who screws who she got killed because she got famous and pissed off some pig to the extreme any idea who the pig could be too many out there to count i shall reiterate she was minimally involved here im sorry when any womans killed but theres nothing i can tell you about this woman rising with effort she made her way around the desk to the door say hi to mr legend tell him no matter what he does for his bosses hell never be anything to them but a queer back in the waiting room neither girl was there only the little blonds mother she looked up from her reading as i passed the magazine was prevention i was back at my seville when i saw her running toward me in a pinched trot short and slight she had a high waist and a hunched upper body her lower lip was thin its mate nonexistent she wore babyblue jeans a white blouse fleshcolored sneakers the nurse told me youre a psychiatrist psychologist i was just wondering i smiled yes she came closer but carefully the way you approach a strange dog im dr delaware i said extending a hand she looked back at the clinic a roar sounded overhead and she jumped a cessna flying low probably a takeoff from the private airport in santa monica she watched it head out over the ocean when the noise faded she said i was just are you by any chance gonna be working here no oh dejection okay sorry to bother you she turned to go is there some way i can help you i said she stopped one hand began twisting the other no forget it sorry are you sure i said touching her shoulder very lightly is something the matter i just thought maybe they were finally gonna get a psychologist here for your daughter her hands kept working teenage problems i said she nodded her names chenise she said tentatively as if prepared to spell it for some bureaucrat shes sixteen she patted her breast pocket quit smoking keep forgetting yeah teenage problems she drives me crazy always has i shes i been all over with her a million clinics all the way to the county hospital they always gimme some student and they cant never handle her last time she ended up in the guys lap and he didnt know what to do the schools wont do nothing shes been on all kinds of medication since shes little now its gotten dr cruvic hes the doctor here who operated on her said she should see a psychologist and he brought one over a lady real good she had chenises number right away smart so of course chenise didnt like talking to her but i made her go then lowering her voicesomething happened to her to the psychologist shaking her head you dont want to know anyway better be getting back shes probably almost through with her checkup the psychologist dr cruvic had her see was that dr devane yes she said breathlessly so you know what happened as a matter of fact thats why im here mrs farney mary farney her eyes opened wide same blue as her daughters pretty once she might have been too now she had the trampled look of someone forced to remember every mistake i dont understand she said im a psychologist and i sometimes work with the police mrs farney right now im working on dr devanes murder did you terror in the blue eyes they think it had something to do with this place no were just talking to everyone who knew dr devane well we didnt really know her like i said she only saw chenise a few times i liked her she took the time to listen to me understood chenises games but thats it i gotta get back what about dr cruvic what about him did he understand chenise sure hes great havent seen him since in a while since the operation no reason to shes fine whos checking chenise out today maribel the nurse gotta go would you mind giving me your address and phone number what for in case the police want to talk to you no way forget it i dont want to get involved i held out my card whats this for if you think of something i wont she said but she put the card in her purse thanks and if you need a referral for chenise i can find one nah whats the use she wraps people around her finger no one catches on i drove away surgery given chenise farneys promiscuity it wasnt hard to imagine what kind cruvic and hope working together on abortions cruvic calling for a psychological consult because he cared or another reason promiscuous teenager with low intelligence minor patient below the age of consent maybe too dull to give informed consent cruvic covering his rear cruvic and hope holly bondurant had assumed the two of them had something going and marge showalskys angry dismissal of the issue confirmed it i realized cruvic had lied to us implying hed met hope at the fundraiser when holly was certain theyd known each other previously milos hunch confirmed more than a business relationship but in light of mandy wrights murder so what the vegas case pointed to a stranger homicide a psychopath still out there stalking watching planning waiting to perform a knife sonata under the cover of big beautiful trees i was at overland when i spotted a coffee shop with a lunch counter and pulled over i bought a morning paper read it while i had a hickoryburger and a coke then pulled out the list of students involved in the sexualconduct board might as well finish up three who hadnt been interviewed yet four really because the encounter with panicked tessa bowlby didnt qualify i called the number for deborah brittain in sherman oaks a machine told me to wait for the beep i decided not to reed muscadine had dropped out of school so his class schedule was no longer relevant i called him his tape said hello this is reed im either not here or im working out and unwilling to interrupt the burn but i do want to talk to you especially if youre my golden opportunitypant pant so please please please leave your name and number starving actors need love too cheerful mellow modulated the kind of voice that knew it sounded good if he was hivpositive it hadnt dampened his spirit or his attempts to stay fit or he hadnt changed the tape starving actor even after getting the soapopera job had something gotten in the way of the job his address was on fourth street if i was lucky id catch him after the burn faded and learn about his health and his feelings about hope devane and the conduct committee if my luck really held perhaps i could find out what was scaring the hell out of tessa bowlby his address matched a white stucco cottage with castle pretensions two turrets one oversized over the front door the other a vestigial nipple atop the right corner an old woman wearing a wide straw hat stooped on the sidewalk removing weeds by hand by the time i cut the sevilles engine she was upright with her hands on her hips she wore brown canvas gardening pants with rubber kneepads and had sueded skin and judgmental eyes hi im looking for reed muscadine he lives in back then she stiffened as if regretting telling me that much whore you i got out of the car and showed her my police id phd im a psychologist i work with the police i looked down the driveway an apartment sat on top of the garage accessed by steep skinny front steps hes not in she said im mrs green i own the place whats going on were questioning him with regard to a crime not as a suspect just someone who knew the victim whos the victim a professor at the university and he knew her i nodded i lived here fortyfour years she said never knew a victim now you cant step outside without getting nervous a friend of mines nephews a policeman in glendale he tells her theres nothing the police can do til youre hurt or killed told her to buy a gun carry it around and if they catch you its like a traffic ticket so i did ive also got sammy she whistled twice i heard something slam shut and a big thickset fawncolored dog with a sad black face ambled around from the back of the house bullish face cousin to spike but this creature weighed at least one hundred pounds and its eyes were all business mrs green held out a palm and the dog stopped mastiff i said bullmastiff only breed ever designed specifically to bring down people they raised em in england to catch game poachers come here baby the dog sniffed lowered its head and walked over slowly shoulders rotating massive limbs moving in fluid concert drool dripped down its dewlaps its eyes were small nearly black and they hadnt left my face hey sammy i said samantha the females are the really protective ones cmere puddin the dog made its way over examined my knees looked at mrs green yeah okay kiss him she said a big mouth nuzzled my hand sweet i said if youre right she is if youre wrong well her laugh was as dry as her skin the dog rubbed against her thigh and she petted it any idea when reed will be back no hes an actor irregular hours right now its night hours hes waiting tables out in the valley from soap opera to that i said no luck in the acting department dont fault him she said its a tough business believe me i know i did some work back a ways mostly bit parts but i did have a walkon in night after nightthats a mae west film classic they made her out to be some wild hussy but she was smarter than all of them i shouldve bought real estate when she did instead i got married she brushed her pants and kneaded the dogs thick neck so some professor got killed and youre talking to all the students were trying to be as thorough as possible well like i said reeds an okay kid pays the rent pretty much on time and always lets me know if he cant i give him a break because hes big and strong and handy and fixes things real good with sammy too so when i go away to my sister in palm springs ive got someone to take care of her tell the truth he reminds me of my husband stan was a movie grip know what that is they move sets around they move everything around stan was all muscle did stunt work til he broke his collarbone working for keaton my daughters in the business too reads scripts for caa so i have a soft spot for anyone dreamy enough to still want to be part of it thats why i rented to reed with just a first month down usually i get first and last and hes been a good tenant even when he got laid up he didnt laze around too long laid up how few months ago he slipped a disc lifting those weights hes got well looky here you can talk to him yourself a battered yellow volkswagen pulled into the driveway rust fringed the wheel wells no porsche yet the man who got out was older than i expected thirty or so and huge sixfive tanned deeply with very pale gray eyes and long thick black hair brushed back and flowing over a yard of shoulder his features were strong square perfect for the camera the cleft in his chin was kirk douglascaliber he wore a heavy gray sweatshirt with the sleeves cut off to expose sideofbeef biceps very brief black shorts and sandals without socks i tried to picture him with tessa bowlby he shot me a quick look the gray eyes curious and intelligent tarzan with an iq a brown paper bag was in one hand handing it to mrs green he added a milkfed smile hows it going maidie hey sam stroking the bullmastiff he looked at me again the dogs neck bulged and furrowed as she tilted her head back at him her eyes had softened a big pink tongue bathed his fingers fine as rain said mrs green this fellows from the police reed but no cop a psychologist isnt that something hes here to talk to you about some murdered professor whatd you go and do now kid muscadines thick brows curved and he squinted my professor hope devane i said oh those are fresh today maidie from where that healthfood place where else organic she snorted did you ever figure maybe the reason i lived so long is all the preservatives i took pickled me like a deli cuke she looked inside the bag peaches out of season must have cost a fortune i only got two said muscadine the apples were actually cheap and look at that color he turned to me a psychologist i work with the police i dont understand im looking into professor devanes committee work oh sure want to come up devane said mrs green scratching her nose why is that name familiar she was murdered in westwood said muscadine what was it three months ago i nodded oh yeah the one who wrote a book said mrs green she was your professor reed she taught me said muscadine looking at me a professor she shook her head in a neighborhood like that what a world thanks for the fruit reed my pleasure maidie muscadine and i started up the driveway mrs green said but dont spend like that again not til you become a star as we reached the stairs he said guess how old she is eighty ninety next month maybe i should take preservatives he vaulted the steps three at a time and was unlocking the front door when i reached the top the apartment was a single front room with a closetsized kitchen and a rear bath two walls were mirrored the others were painted true white an enormous chrome weight machine took up the center flanked by a pressing bench a curlbar and against the wall a rack of dumbbells arranged by poundage iron discs for the benchbar were stacked like giant black checkers a double window bordered by ridiculously dainty gingham curtains looked down on blossoming orange trees facing the glass were a motorized treadmill a stairstepper a crosscountry ski machine an exercise bike and wedged in the corner a doublesized mattress and box spring and two pillows black bed linens i thought of tessa and muscadine grappling the only pieces of conventional furniture were a cheap wooden nightstand and dresser a wheeled aluminum rack was hung with colorcoordinated shirts slacks jeans and sportcoats not too much of each but the quality looked good on the floor beneath the clothes were two pairs of sneakers brown loafers black oxfords gray cowboy boots nothing on the cracked tile kitchen counter but a blender and a hot plate id seen bigger refrigerators in winnebagos a sign taped to the front said think postivebut lurn how to spel two steelandplastic stools were up against the counter muscadine pulled one out and said sorry i dont entertain much we both sat down thanks for not elaborating about the committee in front of maidie she gives me a break on the rent and right now i need it i looked over the exercise equipment nice setup i used to work at a health club that went under got it cheap were you a personal trainer more like impersonal one of those budget places basically a scam i know it looks weird having all this stuff in a place this size but it ended up being cheaper than paying my own gym fees and right now my bodys my commodity the room was hot but his skin was dry despite the heavy sweatshirt tossing his hair he laughed that didnt come out exactly right what im saying is no matter how intellectual you get about acting the industry runs on first impressions and when you hit a certain age youve got to work harder what age is that depends on the person im thirtyone so far so good first impressions i said the casting couch theres some of that still going around but what i mean is the way impulse rules i can practice stanislavsky acting methods from now til tomorrow but if the bod goes so does my marketability he hooked his thumb downward how long have you been working at it couple of years got a degree in business worked for an accounting firm for nine years finally i couldnt stand the sight of numbers and went back for a masters in fine arts can i get you something to drink no thanks well im going to opening the fridge he pulled a bottle of mineral water from a grouping of two dozen the only other thing inside was a grapefruit twisting the top with two fingers he took a long swallow whyd you drop out i said boy word gets around fast who told you professor dirkhoff good old professor dirkhoff the old queen on his throne hes quite miffed with me thinks i should spend two more years developing my underlying resources flexing one arm he rotated the hand maybe i should have brought dirkhoff up before the conduct committee that would have blown devanes mind whys that no woman victim because thats really what the committee was all about men against women from the minute i got in there she was on the attack shrugging he poured the rest of the water down his throat so youre talking to everyone involved with the committee yes they said all records would be kept confidential but after the murder i wondered but why a psychologist whats your name by the way i showed him my id he read it and looked up at me i still dont understand what your role is the police have asked me to talk to people who knew professor devane to do some victim analysis analyzing her thats interesting i always figured it was some nut maybe someone who read her book i heard it was pretty hostile toward men and she was hostile in person i said oh yeah it really freaked me out being accused of rape being summoned maybe in the end it worked out for the best because the experience brought my ambivalence about school to a head and led me to try other alternatives have you met the girl who accused me yet yesterday i said she seems terrified the gray eyes enlarged of what i was going to ask you that youre thinking oh no lord no ive kept my distance shes bad news i wish we lived on separate planets bad news serious problems she needs you one night with her was enough what kind of problems shes disturbed unpredictable he got another bottle the crazy thing is i keep thinking maybe that was what attracted me to her in the first place the unpredictability because shes not the type i usually go for what type is that normal and to be frank a lot better looking generally i like girls who take care of themselves athletes tessa doesnt you met her tessa is sad so you think her unpredictability attracted you that and i dont know a certain excitability like she might be interesting he shrugged the truth is hell if i know im still trying to understand it did she tell you how we met why dont you give me your version your basic casual campus pickup so normal at first we were in the student union studying eating our eyes met and boom she was intense hot eyes very soulful and on some level she is attractive whatever it was something clicked for both of us he shook his head and black hair streamed then fell back in place maybe it was purely biochemical ive read about certain chemicals that influence sexual attraction pheromones so maybe the two of us were in chemical harmony that day who knows whatever it was it was one thousand percent mutual every time i looked at her she was staring at me finally i went over and sat down next to her and she moved herself right up against me hiptohip two minutes later im asking her out and shes saying yes as if what took so long guy i picked her up at her dorm that night movie dinner more small talk but it was clear we were both just going through the motions to make it seem polite before getting into the inevitable and she was the one who suggested we come back here i wasnt too keen on it this place isnt exactly the playboy mansion but she said there was no privacy in the dorms i brought her back fixed her a drink went to the bathroom and when i came out she was right there he pointed to the mattress in the corner wearing one of those little black slips and her pantyhose were off balled up on the floor when she saw me she smiled and spread her legs before i knew it he clapped his big hands together like a collision and both of us came in fact she finished first then all of a sudden she rolls out from under me and starts to cry i try to hold her she shoves me away then the crying gets intense and takes on a sound that spooks me overtheedge hysterical and loud all i need is for mrs g to hear and come up maybe with sammy sammy doesnt like strangers so i put my hand over her mouth not hard just to calm her down and she tries to bite me at that point i stand up and back off it was disorienting one minute youre making love the next shes out to kill you im thinking you idiot muscadine going for the casual pickup and shes not letting up finally she makes this snarling sound gets on all fours scrambles for her pantyhose manages to put them on then runs out of the apartment and down the stairs i follow her trying to find out whats wrong but she wont talk keeps heading for the street and now sam is barking and mrs gs light goes on did mrs green come out no we were moving pretty fast once she was out on fourth she headed north i said cmon its late let me take you home she said fuck you ill walk which is crazy campus is five six miles away but every time i try to talk to her she threatens to scream so finally i let her he blew out air unreal for days after i kept trying to figure out what happened and the best i could come up with was maybe shed been raped or molested before and had a flashback then a month later i get the notice to show up for the committee it was like being hit right here he pressed his solar plexus later i found out i was never obligated to show up but the letter sure made it sound that way howd you feel about getting tested for hiv you know about that too there are transcripts of the committee sessions transcripts oh shit are they going to be made public not unless they turn out to be relevant to the murder he rubbed his forehead jesus theres a school of thought in the industry says theres no such thing as bad publicity just get your name out there but that only applies to people whove already made it im a peasant the last thing i need is for people to think im a rapist or infected so youre hivnegative of course i am do i look sick hows your back my back mrs green said youd been laid up oh that ruptured disc my own fault felt feisty one morning and decided to go for threetwenty on the bench press spasmed like a knife going right through me couldnt get up off the floor for an hour the pain laid me up for a month mrs g brought me groceries thats why i buy her stuff when i can even now i still get a twinge but other than that i feel great and im totally one hundred percent negative i repeated the question about being tested how did i feel intruded upon wouldnt you it was outrageous i think i said something at the hearing about it being kafkaesque did they make everyone at the hearings go through it im not at liberty to say he stared fair enough anyway thats my sum total contact with professor devane do you think any of this is going to hit the papers i guess that depends on who the killer turns out to be he turned contemplative you really think theres a chance the committee had something to do with her death would that surprise you absolutely the process was nasty but in the end it didnt amount to much i cant see murdering anyone over that then again i cant see murdering anyone over anything he grinned except maybe a juicy part just kidding he yawned scuse me if theres nothing else id like to catch a nap have to be at work by six wheres work delvecchios in tarzana he bowed and flourished and how would you like your steak done sir rare but whats my motivation professor dirkhoff said youd gotten an acting job the handsome face darkened ouch what hurts failure yes that was true hollywoodtrue when i told him i was dropping out but i would have left anyway the classes were too theoretical waste of tuition whats hollywoodtrue an air sandwich on imaginary bread the job fell through it never got far enough to fall through i allowed myself to be naively optimistic because my audition went great and my agent told me i was a shooin what happened someone else got the job and i didnt why hell if i know they never tell you what show was it some soap opera independent deal for cable did it go into production everything was really preliminary they didnt even have a name for it something about spies and diplomats foreign embassies the casting director told me i was up for the james bond part wear a patch on one eye and sweep ladies off their feet then she pinched my ass and said yum gradea prime where are those conduct committees when you need them milo came to the house from the airport arriving at seven and looking disheveled where are the white shoes i said he flexed a scuffed desert boot decided to go formal he sat down at the kitchen table and took an eight by twelveinch photo out of his briefcase torsolength color promo shot of a stunning young woman with long silky dark hair featherblushed cheekbones biteme lips slightly parted amazed oblong eyes the color of espresso she wore a whitesequined strapless dress and leaned forward offering full surging breasts split by deep cleavage a wide diamond choker circled her neck diamond clips on each ear too many carats to be real some sort of wind machine had been used to gently blow the hair back from her face her smile was inviting yet mocking at the bottom amanda wrightactress and dancerrepresented by onyx associates her agents i said vegas pd says theyre a defunct slicksleaze outfit used to do casino booking for topless acts mandy had no criminal record which isnt unusual for the highclass honeys who show up when the chips start piling and do the old thighrub other vital statistics she was single liked to party did grass pills coke her last boyfriend was a blackjack dealer named ted barnaby also a cokehead moved to reno soon after the murder vegas interviewed him the day after he was cooperative and had an alibi working all that night verified by the pit boss also he seemed genuinely torn up about her death but he moved it didnt set off any alarms because casino people are transient a detective took me over to the crime scene last night middleclass condos quiet not a lot of trees like hopes street but there was a huge eucalyptus growing right in front of mandys building and thats where he got her vegas and i have both been calling all over the country and no other matches have turned up yet but theres plenty to do any record of mandy living in la not so far shed been leasing the same apartment for almost three years grew up in hawaii no police record there either wouldnt surprise me if she came down to la at one time or another but her creditcard receipts dont show it and they do show other travel where reaching into the briefcase again he produced a thick black binder that he flipped open and placed next to the photo wetting his thumb he turned to a page that showed two years of visa and mastercard summaries reduced to tiny print three statements per page mandy wrights monthly bills ranged from five hundred dollars to four thousand plenty of overdue notices and interest charges a couple of defaults both times shed been cut off and switched companies i ran my finger down the itemized expenditures mostly clothes cosmetics jewelry and restaurants the travel information had been circled a dozen flights two each to aspen and park city utah six to honolulu one to new york one to new orleans welltraveled lady i said business trips hawaii might have been personal shes got a brother there but yeah the rest could be work the ski places for the winter working the lodges as a snow bunny new orleans was during mardi gras and thats a bigtime hooker scene new york could be anything any time of the year but no la i said isnt vegas to la a big hooker run dont you find it odd that she flew everywhere but here maybe she doesnt like smog he said maybe she drove down but youre right lots of girls do make the desert run regularly last year we had some married women from the westside picking up change by giving head in motels back home in time to serve dinner so maybe mandy had a regular client in la who didnt want records kept he tapped the photo a girl who looked like that you could see some rich guy paying her to come down regularly keep it from the wife he got a beer and i examined the rest of the folder starting with the summary of ted barnabys interview a single paragraph written by a detective a holzer whod spoken to the boyfriend before he left for reno barnaby had shown tears and other evidence of grief subject professes no knowledge of any motive for the homicide says he knew victim did some callgirl work thats why we didnt live together she needed her own place subject also says he didnt like the fact that victim engaged in prostitution and that he and victim had argued about this in the past but hed come to accept it youve got to accept people on their terms his alibi checks out verified by franklin a varese casino pit supervisor and fellow dealers sandra boething and luis maldonado next autopsy and lab reports the toxicology screen showed a moderate amount of cocaine in mandy wrights blood the night of the murder midnight murder hope had been stabbed just after pm i flipped a page the wound pattern described almost wordforword as in hopes file the initial blow to the heart had collapsed the organ death resulting from exsanguination and shock prior to that mandy wrights cardiovascular system had been in excellent condition the arteries clear and unobstructed no venereal disease including hiv no evidence of any outstanding illness or infection other than minor nasal erosion probably due to cocaine abuse the final paragraph cited significant expansion of the anal opening and fibroid scarring of the rectum indicating a history of anal sex but vaginal sexual intercourse had not taken place within the past twentyfour hours postmortem examination of the pelvic region revealed no tumors or other pathology however changes related to past pregnancy were noted that made me think as did the last line the fallopian tubes have been ligated from the degree of atrophy probably within a year or two sterilized any record of her having a child milo shook his head and shed been pregnant before i said meaning an abortion unless she miscarried either before the ligation or at the same time its a long shot but that kind of surgery is dr cruvics specialty what if he was her la connection he put the beer down there are lots of obstetricians thats some leap just throwing out ideas should i stop no go on cruvic has money i said drives a bentley those clothes we saw werent kmart not inconsistent with the kind of guy who might fly down a party girl and pay for her ticket in cash first hes her doctor now hes her party pal he could be both maybe thats why he performed the ligation rather than having a doctor in vegas do it hell maybe he was even the father of her child whod be in a better position to get himself out of a mess than an ob weve got him in at least one fib not knowing hope before the fundraiser why try to mislead us probably because your hunch was right their relationship had been more than friendship and ive got additional support for that i told him what holly bondurant had seen in the parking lot marge showalskys protesttoomuch denials then theres the matter of his direct billing for hopes services it just doesnt smell right plus i learned something today that tells me he may skirt other ethical boundaries i repeated my conversation with mary farney operating on a mentally deficient minor and knowing she probably couldnt give informed consent maybe he used hope for backup maybe they were involved in other iffy things like what who knows financial shenanigans or maybe they did something really ugly like take eggs out of one fertility patient and sell them to another so where would mandy fit in wild guess she could have been an egg donor young healthy girl and she learned something she wasnt supposed to or tried to blackmail cruvic or maybe cruvics just the kind of guy who loves em and kills em hell i can go on all day but the bottom line is my gut tells me dr cruvic is worth looking into despite the sexkiller scenario he got up and walked around we both noticed how hyper cruvic was bouncing all over the place he tried to tell us it was fitness but maybe it was coke and theres our link with mandy though hopes autopsy showed no dope in her system and nothing indicates she ever used bringing me full circle if she was cheating with cruvic or locking or anyone else seacrest could have found out and decided shed rubbed his face in it long enough but what connection would seacrest have to mandy wright he paced some more its not just flashy guys who fool with girlies a quiet middleaged professor might want a hot little playmate too and a quiet middleaged professor would have reason to pay cash to the playmate and if the playmate realized how vulnerable the professor was and decided to blackmail him the professor could decide to end his problems heart vagina back and after succeeding at that why not go after the wife whos become such a pain in the ass creative i said youre a good influence okay as long as were screenwriting how about this a threesome cruvic hope and mandy or seacrest hope and mandy or even an unknown guy flying down a call girl to spice up a tired relationship then for whatever reason the guy decides to call it quits permanently gets rid of mandy first because murdering a call girl three hundred miles away wont attract attention in la but hopes a different story shes prominent local smarter so he waits planning waiting for the right time then hope helps him by getting notorious with her book which sets up a perfect cover some nut acting out because of the controversy she generated he thought about that but if mandy and hope knew each other wouldnt mandys murder have alerted hope if theyd parted ways how would she know mandyd been killed did mandys murder get any media coverage he shook his head just one small blurb in the sun the same day still if hope had been engaged in a threeway with mandy wouldnt she be likely to find out okay i said lets say she knew mandyd been murdered but didnt connect it to herself like you said prostitutes get killed all the time he drank looked out the kitchen window the sun was small and pale silvering the tops of the pines turning them as shiny as mandy wrights dress great screenplays he finally said it would sure be nice to have some facts at least i said i can look into cruvics credentials see if anything funny shows up do that my next stops a chat with kenny storm i want to clear the whole committee angle ill also check with vegas to see if mandy had health insurance maybe her sterilization was documented and we can find out who did it the boyfriend barnaby might know about that so well put out the word for him too anything else occur while i was gone i found reed muscadine like kenny he dropped out of school but for another reason he was up for a soapopera part thought he had it but it fell through he denied raping tessa bowlby repeated the same story he told at the hearing credible no alarm bells went off but hes an actor take it for what its worth what do you think its worth i dont know tessa looked extremely traumatized id like to know whats eating at her maybe ill give her another try whats muscadine like physically very big and muscular goodlooking bodyconscious his place is basically a gym the kind of guy who could overpower a woman and hold her still in order to stab her in the heart easily he could have subdued her with two fingers but he seemed pretty calm about being questioned so either hes innocent or hes honed his craft and was prepared for me his landlady likes him says he never causes problems he claims hes hivnegative and if hes lying hes not showing the effects yet tessa on the other hand looks wornout but now that we know about mandy what connection could there be to the committee good question but i want to finish with it seen too many screwups that seemed perfectly logical at the time only one student left right deborah brittain ill try to get to her tomorrow thanks i really appreciate this alex he put the file back in the briefcase thanks for the theorizing too i mean it id rather have theories than nothing i walked him to the door where to now home for a shower and then talking to fellow gendarmes maybe i can turn up some other pretty ladies triplestabbed under big trees and retreat to the comfort of utter powerlessness cruvics lie about not knowing hope before the fundraiser stuck in my head and at pm with robin working in her shop i took a drive over to civic center hoping for what a glimpse of his bentley as he left the office some pretty face in the passenger window futile the pink buildings windowless facade gave no indication if anyone was in not exactly welcoming architecture the same question why set up practice here away from all the other beverly hills medicos privacy alone didnt answer it psychiatrists and psychologists managed to provide confidentiality in conventional office buildings something to hide beverly hills streets are accompanied by parallel back alleys part of a city plan that intended to keep garbage collection and deliveries out of sight hanging a uturn i drove back to the nearest intersection foothill drive where i turned right and into the asphalt strip running behind the buildings rear facades loading docks dumpsters finally a high pink wall three parking spots all of them empty the buildings back entrance was an oldfashioned wooden garage door dark and crisscrossed by beams heavy hasp secured by a large padlock more like storage space than a doctors private entry no cars said this doctor had left for the day maybe for his nighttime gig at the clinic i reversed direction again taking little santa monica to century city then avenue of the stars south to olympic boulevard west another twenty minutes and i was in santa monica and by that time the sky was black a few lights on at the womens health center a dozen or so cars parked in the sunken lot mostly compacts with the exception of a gleaming silver bentley turbo pulled up close to the clinics main door the chain across the driveway was fastened and locked and a uniformed guard patrolled slowly even in the dim light i made out the holster on his hip when he saw me he picked up his pace i sped away before we could read each others faces tying up loose ends the next morning i called the psychology office and got mary ann gonsalvezs number the time difference made it pm in london no answer no machine i made coffee and toast and ate without tasting thinking of the crowd at the womens clinic last night the armed guard the chain blocking the parking lot dr cruvic operating on patients like chenise farney fifteen cars even allowing for staff probably ten or more procedures and for all i knew hed been going for hours bringing them in in shifts idealism or profit motive the profit could be high if he was using the clinics facilities at no cost and billing the state the clinic happy to have someone volunteer services to its poor clientele poor women meant medical abortion funding was always subject to political fluctuations and i had no idea if medical paid i made a call to the la medical office was referred to an number in sacramento put on hold for ten minutes and cut off trying again i endured another hold got through and was transferred to another number more holds two shellshockedsounding clerks and finally someone coherent who admitted that medical did indeed reimburse for both terminations and tubal ligations but that i would need procedure codes too in order to obtain specific reimbursement allowances i phoned the med school crosstown and used my faculty status to get the business office at womens hospital the head clerk there referred me to the billing office which referred me to the direct medical billing office finally someone whose tone implied i should have known without asking informed me that abortions were indeed reimbursable by the state at nine hundred dollars per procedure not including hospital costs anesthesia and other incidentals i hung up nine hundred per procedure and if you were a canny biller as cruvic seemed to be you could throw in things like nursing charges operatingroom costs supplies anesthesia and jack up the reimbursement twenty abortions a week added up to just short of a sevenfigure income nice little supplement to the fertility practice implanting fetuses in the rich removing them from the poor there were risks of course an antiabortion fanatic lashing out violently and if the papers got hold of it bad press beverly hills fertility doctor runs nighttime abortion mill prolifers would excoriate cruvic for murdering babies and liberals would wax indignant over class inequality and whatever their political bent cruvics fertility patients would shrink from that kind of publicity and from the fact that their doctors activities werent limited to abetting pregnancy despite the claim on his business card but with that kind of money cruvic probably figured the risk was worth it offthepath medical building chains around the clinic parking lot armed guard had he been greedy and wanted even more bloated billing cooking the books hope going along with the fraud but cruvic had paid her only thirtysix thousand a year a very small chunk of a milliondollar business maybe the thirtysix represented only what shed reported on her tax returns and thered been other payments in cash or had hope not been a willing partner to fraud and learning the truth quit or threatened to expose cruvic and died because of it then what about mandy wright her only link to obstetrics so far was a terminated pregnancy and a tubal ligation farfetched delaware the most likely scenario was that she and hope had been murdered by a psychopathic stranger and cruvic however mercenary and ethically slippery had nothing to do with it still id promised milo to check out his credentials deborah brittain would be in class for the next few hours and the panicked tessa bowlby had a day off lots of days off as a matter of fact enrolled in only two classes both on tuesday and thursday reduced academic load trouble coping id give her another try too but first things first calling the state medical board i found out no malpractice complaints had been lodged against milan cruvic md nor was his license in jeopardy farther fetched i got dressed and drove to school at the biomed library i looked cruvic up in the directory of medical specialists ba berkeley hopes alma mater another possible link they were the same age too had graduated in the same class old friends i read on md uc san francisco once again studying in the same city as hope then shed come down to la for her clinical training and hed moved to seattle for a surgery internship at the university of washington by the book so far but then it got interesting he completed only one year of his surgery residency at u of w before taking a leave of absence and spending a year at the brookehastings institute in corte madera california then instead of returning to washington hed transferred specialties from surgery to obstetricsgynecology signing on as a firstyear resident at fidelity medical center in carson california where hed finished passed his boards and gotten his specialty certification in obgyn no listing of any postgraduate work in fertility that wasnt illegal an md and a state license allowed any physician to do just about anything medical but it was surprising even reckless because fertility techniques were highly specialized where had cruvic learned his craft the year at the brookehastings institute no because hed been just a firstyear resident at the time and no reputable institution would take someone for advanced training at that point selftaught cutting corners in a daring and dangerous way was that the real reason he practiced away from the other beverly hills doctors if so who sent him referrals people who also wanted to skirt the rules but maybe there was a simple solution hed undergone bona fide training but the fact had been accidentally left off his bio still youd think that was the kind of thing hed be careful to correct and the directory was updated each year freelance fertility cowboy cutting corners taking on cases no one else would go near something on the fringe perhaps a daring nature was what had attracted hope to cruvic so different from the stodgy routinebound seacrest old volvo versus shiny bentley something on the fringe something gone bad now hope was dead and cruvic as he himself had pointed out was alive busy bouncy doing god knew what but what of mandy wright what did a scholar and a call girl have in common but gruesome death nothing fit i stayed with it plugging cruvics name into every scientific and medical data bank the library offered no publications so his year at brookehastings probably hadnt been for research the institute wasnt listed anywhere either by the time i finished my gut was tight with suspicion but there was nothing more to do and it was time to find deborah brittain i spotted her leaving monroe hall and heading toward a bike rack the photo id had given no indication of her size six feet tall lean and bigboned with long dirtyblond hair and sharp cheekbones she wore a white polo shirt bearing the university seal navy shorts white socks and sneakers a red mountaineers backpack her racing bicycle was one of a dozen twowheelers hitched to a rack in back of the rubybrick structure i watched her slip an elastic sweatband over her forehead then remove the chain lock as she rolled the bike out i stepped up and introduced myself yes her blue eyes switched channels from preoccupied to alarmed i showed her my id professor devane she said in a husky voice it sure took a long time her hands tightened around the handlebars ive got volleyball practice in half an hour but i want to talk to you lets walk she guided the bicycle up the walkway fast enough to make me lengthen my stride i want to tell you she said that professor devane was a truly great woman a wonderful person the sicko who killed her should get the death penalty but of course he wont whys that even if you catch him and he gets convicted they never enforce the law fully she glanced at me without breaking step want to know about huang i want to know anything you can tell me are you thinking huang did it no were just talking to everyone associated with the conduct committee so you think the committee had something to do with it we dont know much period ms brittain well im sure people have been badmouthing the committee but i think it was a great idea it saved my life not literally but huang was making my life miserable until professor devane put an end to all that she stopped suddenly her eyes were wet and the sweatband had slipped down she shoved it higher and we started moving again he used to come up behind me in the library id turn to get a book and hed be there staring smiling suggestive smiles do you understand i nodded was this after he asked you out or before after the creep it was obviously his way of getting back at me three separate times he asked me three times i told him no three strikes and youre out right but he wouldnt accept it everywhere id go id turn around and hed be looking at me a creepy look it was really starting to get to me was this all over campus no only the library she said as if the library was his little den he probably stayed down there looking for women to spook because there was no other reason for him to be there hes an engineering major and engineering has its own library she wiped her forehead with the back of her hand im not paranoid ive always been able to take care of myself but this was horrible i couldnt concentrate schools tough enough without getting so distracted why should i have to deal with that too but i wouldnt have had the courage to do anything about it without professor devane she bit back tears its such an incredible loss so unfair she rolled the bike faster has huang stopped bothering you yes so god bless professor devane and to hell with the administration for caving in whod they cave in to what i heard was there was a rich alumnus who ordered them to shut it down she thrust her jaw out is huang dangerous not that weve learned so far her laugh was unsteady well thats really comforting so youre still worried about him i really wasnt we pass each other on campus sometimes and i feel empowered but then i start thinking about professor devanes murder could it have been something to do with the committee and i just get sick we walked a bit before she said when i start to get anxious i think back to something professor devane told me harassers are underassertive cowards thats why they sneak around the key is to face up to them show your inner strength which is what i do when i see huang but look what happened to her the bike came to a skidding halt so sudden she had to pull back to maintain balance the fact that she could become victimized enrages me ive got to find a way to make something good out of it is there any chance it could be huang he seems to have an excellent alibi so at least you took him seriously enough to investigate him good let him know what it feels like to be under scrutiny but if you dont suspect him why are you talking to me im after any information i can get about professor devane people she was close to her activities anyone she might have angered well we werent close we only spoke a couple of times before the hearing and after when she coached me on how to handle myself she was incredibly kind so understanding as if she really knew about harassment about what it felt like to be the victim did she talk about having been a victim no nothing like that just empathy genuine empathy not someone trying to fake it the blue eyes were unwavering she was an amazing woman ill never forget her tessa bowlbys dorm was one of several sixstory boxes propped at the northwest edge of the us sprawling acreage a big wooden sign on posts said student housing no unauthorized parking the landscaping was rolling lawn and bearded coco palms just down the road was the creamstuccoandsmokedglass recreation center where philip seacrest and hope devane had met years ago i parked in a loading zone at the side of the building entered the lobby and walked up to the front desk a black woman in her twenties sat underlining a book with a thick pink marker her lips were the same shade of pink behind her was a switchboard it blinked and beeped and as she turned to take the call she noticed me her book was full of fine print and pie graphs i read the title upside down fundamentals of economics plugging the board she faced me can i help you tessa bowlby please she slid over a sheaf of papers typed list of names the bs began on the second page and continued onto the third she checked twice before shaking her head sorry no one by that name tessa might be a nickname she inspected me and looked again no bowlbys at all try another dorm i checked all of them same results maybe tessa had moved offcampus students did it all the time but combined with the fear id seen in her eyes plus her reduced workload it added up to escape i used a pay phone in the last dorm to call milo wondering if he had her home address and wanting to tell him about the holes in cruvics training he was away and the cell phone didnt answer either maybe hed found another threestab murder or something else that would make my train of thought irrelevant driving away from the u i pulled into the first filling station i found in westwood village the phone booth was a tilting aluminum wreck but a westside directory dangled under the phone coverless and shredded lots of pages missing the page with all the bowlbys was there all two of them bowlby t j venice no address listed bowlby walter e mississippi avenue in west la las a random toss of residential pickup sticks and with a dozen directories covering the county the odds of either bowlby being related to tessa were low but i went with what i had starting with walter on mississippi because he was closer very close between santa monica boulevard and olympic just a mile or so south of the university in a district of small postwar homes and a few much larger fantasy projects garbage day in the neighborhood overflowing cans and corpulent lawn bags shouted out pride of consumption squirrels scavenged nervously at night their rat cousins would take over years ago the people of california had voted to reduce predatory propertytax rates and the politicians had meted out punishment by eliminating rodent control and other services like tree trimming money seemed to be available for other things though last year after a storm id watched a thirteenman city crew take four entire days to chop down and haul half a fallen pine walter bowlbys residence was a tan bungalow with a black shingle roof the lawn was shaved close as a marine recruit more gray than green a wide front porch played host to potted plants an aluminum chair and a small blue bike with training wheels an old brown ford galaxie sat in the driveway i walked up a strip of cement to the door an enamel plaque the kind you get at a carnival or an amusement park said the bowlbys no one answered the bell or my knock i was back in the seville and about to drive away when a blueandwhite van approached from olympic and pulled in behind the ford two bumper stickers go dodgers buy union it came to a smoking shuddering stop and the drivers door opened a darkmustachioed bowlegged man in his forties got out he wore a white nylon polo shirt with a horizontal green stripe that milo would have liked pleated offwhite pants and black work shoes his arms were thick and sunburned but his frame was narrow the beginnings of a gut swelled the green stripe and a cigarette pack pouched his shirt pocket twirling his car keys he stood there examining the lawn then he touched the cigarettes as if to make sure they were still there and turned as tessa bowlby came out of the front passenger door she looked to be wearing the same dark baggy sweater and pipestem jeans id seen her in at the psych tower and her complexion was even chalkier she kept her back to the mustachioed man and slid open the vans rear door allowing a pleasantlooking grayhaired woman in a red tank top and jeans to climb out the woman looked tired gray hair but a young face in her arms was a blackhaired boy around four the child appeared to be sleeping but suddenly he squirmed and kicked throwing the grayhaired woman offbalance tessa braced her and said something the mustachioed man had pulled out a cigarette and now he just stood there as the grayhaired woman handed the child to tessa tessa broke into a smile so sweet and sudden it chilled me painfully like ice cream eaten too fast she hugged the boy tight he was giggling and still squirming tessa looked too frail to handle him but she managed to hold on to him planting her feet tickling laughing his sneakered feet churned air and finally stopped she nuzzled him and cut across the grass carrying him to the porch all four of them went up the steps and the man put a key in the door the little boy started squirming again and tessa put him down he ran straight to the blue bike and tried to get on nearly falling tessa put him on the seat held him removed him he tried to climb atop the porch rail and began laughing as tessa rushed to hold his hand the man and the woman entered the house leaving the door open the boy was walking atop the rail holding tessas hand suddenly he jumped off she caught him he shimmied down her leg and he ran for the door as she turned she saw me that same look of panic she stared as the boy ran inside touched her cheek stood there for a second and ran in herself the mustachioed man had come out a second later reminding myself i was legit i stayed there he came toward me swinging thick arms when he was ten feet away he stopped and surveyed the seville from grille to taillight then he walked around the front of the car stepping out into the street and making his way to the drivers window im walt bowlby my daughter says youre the police no challenge in his voice just the weak hope that maybe it wasnt true up close his skin was leathery a thin gold chain circled his neck chest hairs sprouted around it i showed him my id im a police consultant mr bowlby a consultant is there a problem i came here to talk to tessa could you tell me about what sir there was a crime near campus involving a professor of tessas were talking to anyone who knew the victim his shoulders dropped the lady professor tessa really doesnt know nothing about that and shes pretty you know upset about the murder he touched the cigarette pocket again pulled out a softpack of salems then patted his pants for matches i found a book in the glove compartment and lit him up thanks not exactly about the professor she he looked back at the house mind if i get in your car sir not at all he walked around the back and took the passenger seat touching the leather nice shape always liked this model seventyeight nine he nodded and smoked blowing it out the window gm built it on a chevy two chassis which lots of people thought was a mistake but they hold up this belong to the city one of those impounds no its mine had it long a few years another nod he looked at the floorboards tessa had a problem do you know about that not knowing if tessa had told him about the rape i said a problem professor devane helped her with yeah she shes very bright tessa almost a genius iq when she wanted to drop out we asked why but she wouldnt tell us just said she wanted to move back home we were surprised my wife and me because shed been the one made such a fuss about living on her own finally she broke down and cried and told us about the you know the assault and how the professor hauled the guy up on charges and then she got murdered at first it sounded so wild we didnt know what to believe then we saw the news about the murder what was wild the murder or the rape he inhaled a lot of smoke and held on to it for a long time tell the truth sir all of it did you have doubts tessa had been attacked he stuck his arm out the car and flicked ashes how do i put this i love my daughter a lot but shes shes really smart always was right from a baby but different she gets in these low moods depression since shes been little always moody and then she goes into her own little world a real good imagination sometimes he shrugged and smoked the cigarette was nearly down to the filter her imagination can get wild he said has she accused others of raping her mr bowlby he sighed took another drag looked at the butt and squeezed it out between his fingers i slid open the ashtray and he dropped it in thanks mind if i light up another go ahead disgusting habit i quit every day he laughed i smiled and repeated my question he said we used to live out in temple city the police there probably still got records though maybe not cause the boy was a minor i heard they dont keep records on minors how long ago was this tessas almost twenty and she was twelve at the time so eight years the boy we knew his family i worked with his father at ford back when they had a plant in montebello the boy was a little older thirteen i think the families were close we were all camping at yosemite supposedly it happened in a tent the two of them stayed behind while the rest of us went to the dump looking for bears but the thing was tessa never said nothing til we got back home three or four days later the temple city police said it was really the park rangers jurisdiction but they brought the boy in anyway for questioning then they said they thought he was innocent but we could pursue it if we wanted they also said we should have a psychiatrist see tessa hollowing his cheeks he sucked hungrily on the second cigarette and let the smoke trail out of his mouth his teeth were brown widely spaced veins bulged in the heavy sunburned arms and the tips of his nails were coalblack shes the thing is sir tessas smart even with her problems she always did great in school straight as great imagination we were hoping id really prefer if you dont talk to her sir shes such a nice kid but delicate raising hers like walking a tightrope one of her doctors said that to us said shes fragile i cant see what good it would do to talk to her so you do have doubts about both stories he flinched i honestly dont know what to believe the boy denied it completely and he never got in any other trouble that i know of joined the navy last year doing beautifully got married had a kid he looked miserable i thought of reed muscadines assessment of tessa serious problems has tessa made other accusations mr bowlby another very long pause he picked something out of his teeth and flicked it out the window i guess youll find out anyways so i might as well tell you he started to smoke but instead made a gulping sound that caught me offguard a hand shot up and visored his eyes she accused me he said in a shaky voice two years later when she was fourteen we already had her to a psychiatrist because she was talking about hurting herself not eating you see how skinny she is she used to have that disease anorexia thinking she was fat doing jumping jacks all day she started that at around fourteen was down to fifty pounds the psychiatrist put her in a hospital and they fed her with an iv gave her some counselor to talk to and thats when she started claiming she remembered the hand pulled away his eyes were moist but he looked right at me she said it happened when she was little a baby two or three he shook his head its not true sir they believed me the hospital and the police and my wife the law said they had to investigate and i went through the whole thing it was pure hell temple city police again a detective gunderson nice guy maybe hes still there anyway the bottom line was that it was tessas imagination it just runs away with itself when she was a real little kid shed watch something on tv then wanna be it cartoon characters whatever you understand flying around being supergirl whatever so all i can figure is she musta saw some movie and started to believe something had happened to her he smoothed his mustache before i got married i was a rough kid spent a little time at the youth authority for burglary but then i accepted my responsibilities learned mechanics im telling you all this so you see im straight know what i mean yes the thing is with tessa you can never be sure what shes gonna do after the investigation she admitted she was wrong said she felt guilty and wanted to kill herself her mom and i told her that would be the worst thing and we still loved her to make matters worse the insurance money for the hospital ran out and we had to take her home just then when things were bad the hospital said watch her closely we didnt let her out of our sight then we did family counseling at a county clinic and she seemed to take to that we thought she was okay and to show you how smart she is she got good grades through all of it got accepted to the u we thought everything was okay then this year she announces shes coming home then she breaks down and tells us about the rape thing some guy on a date i told her i believed her but he stubbed the second butt out in the ashtray if i was sure it was true ida looked for the guy myself but i know she falsely accused me and that boy so what was i to think and she never complained right away not til she heard that professor lecturing then the professor gets murdered i heard that i got scared scared in what way guy like me highschool dropout i used to think college was safe then you hear about something like that did tessa tell you anything about professor devane just that she liked her for believing her she never thought anyone would believe her again then she got into what shed said about me and started crying real hard saying shes sorry doesnt want to be the girl who cried wolf i told her honey whats past is past you tell me this happened i believe you lets go to the police and nail the sucker but she got really scared about that said no no one would believe her it was a waste of time there was no evidence it was date rape anyway and no one took that seriously except professor devane except her yeah i think thats the only reason she brought it up to us the professor had been killed she was scared i said are you telling me you think the guy who assaulted you mighta killed her but she wouldnt answer that just kept saying the professor had believed her treated her good and now she was dead life sucked the good die young that kind of stuff then she said i changed my mind about coming home daddy im going back to the dorm and she left we let her go but we called her the next day and she didnt answer so we went over there and found her lying in bed staring at the ceiling all this food all around her trays of food but she hadnt eaten any of it she was just staring at the ceiling wed seen her that way before when she stopped taking her medicine what medicine is that used to be nardil then tofranil then prozac now shes on something else sinequan when she takes it she does pretty good even with all the problems shes still pulling bs which is amazing in my opinion if she didnt have problems shed be straight as shes a smart girl always was maybe too smart i dont know he held his hands out palms up so you found her in bed i said not eating we checked her out of the dorm and took her home she was only in two classes anyway cause her doctor didnt want her to be pressured we said why dont you drop out for a quarter you can always come back she said no she wanted to keep going and her doctor said that was a good sign her being motivated so we let her he turned to me shes enrolled but she doesnt do nothing no reading no homework does she still go to classes sometimes my wife drives her and picks her up sometimes she sleeps in and doesnt go we dont like it but what can we do you cant watch em twentyfour hours even the psychiatrist says so so shes still seeing a psychiatrist not regularly but we still call him because hes a nice guy kept seeing her even after the money ran out dr emerson out in glendale you want to talk to him be my guest albert emerson he recited a number that i copied did he ever give you a diagnosis depression he says she uses her imagination to protect herself he rubbed his eyes and sighed rough i said thems the breaks my little boys great how old is he be four next month big for his age any other children no just the two we werent sure we should have more cause of all the time we put into tess and she my wife has got a retarded brother lives in an institution so we didnt know if there was something inbred or anything he smiled then we got surprised nice surprise i said oh yeah robbies a great little guy throws a ball like you wouldnt believe being with hims about the only thing that makes tess happy i let her babysit but i keep an eye out for what her moods hes a happy kid and i want to keep it that way like when we were watching the news about that professor and tess started to scream it got robbie really upset thats how i calmed her down telling her honey get a grip look at robbie after that she was okay after that she didnt even want to talk about it shes calmed down so far so good but i keep my eye out i had him write me out permission to speak to dr albert emerson and drove home robins truck was gone and i found a note in the kitchen saying shed left to do some emergency repair work for a country singer out in simi valley and would be back by seven or eight i called the psychiatrist expecting a service or a receptionist but he answered his own phone in an expectant boyish voice someone ready for adventure i introduced myself delaware i know the name you were involved with the jones case right right i said surprised rich defendant and a plea bargain it had all been kept out of the papers the defense called me he said when they were figuring out which place to send the bastard wanted me to testify on his behalf get him a cushy bed i said wrong number counselor my wifes an assistant da and my sympathies tend to run in the other direction did they put him away for long hopefully i said yeah you never know when theres money involved so what can i do for you im working with the police on another case a psychology professor who was murdered a few months ago i remember it he said near the u you like criminal cases i like closure know what you mean so whats my connection tessa bowlby she knew the victim accused another student of date rape and brought him up before a sexualconduct committee chaired by professor devane were talking to all the students involved with the committee but tessa doesnt want to talk and her problems make me reluctant to push it sexualconduct committee he said his tone told me tessa had never mentioned it walter bowlby had said tessas involvement with emerson was sketchy i havent seen tessa in a while which is more than i should tell you in the first place ive got a signed release from her father tessas over eighteen so that doesnt mean much so whats the theory one of the guys called up before this committee got mad and acted out with no evidence theories abound i said the police are looking into every possible avenue a conduct committee he repeated and tessa actually brought charges yes wow it wasnt in the papers was it no did the process get hostile it wasnt pleasant i said but the committee didnt last long cause the u killed it and then someone killed professor devane weird sorry i cant help you but lets just say i dont have much to offer about tessa or her father both he said i wouldnt spend much time on that aspect now ive got a patient ringing in the waiting room so lets cut this short while our ethics remain intact so much for the conduct committee back to dr cruvic of the curious educational history that institute where hed spent a year after hed left washington brookehastings corte madera just outside san francisco returning to his northern california turf i called corte madera information for a number nothing nothing in san francisco or berkeley or oakland or palo alto or anywhere within a hundredmile radius next question mark the hospital where cruvic had resumed his training this time as an obgyn fidelity medical center in carson no listing there either could the guy be a total impostor but uc berkeley told me he was a member in good standing of the alumni association same with uc san francisco medical school so the funny stuff began after hed received his md as i was thinking about that milo called no other murders that match so far vegas is trying to get hold of ted barnaby mandys boyfriend to see if he can shed light on her medical history or anything else so far its nogo they got him traced as far as tahoe then nada the casino circuit i said yeah interestingly they know cruvic in vegas comes a few times a year somewhat of a high roller just the kind of guy mandy would gravitate toward no one remembers them together but i sent mandys picture to la vice to see if she had any kind of history here and im planning to visit a few clubs tonight places on the strip where the highpriced girls are known to party casinos clubs some lifestyle rust never sleeps why should i i also received a fedex this morning humongous packet of alibi material on patrick huang from his fathers law firm photos menus notarized affidavits from the maitre d waiters busboys family members nothing like a lawyer father i said well thats good cause deborah brittain still seems nervous about him why the experience unnerved her though she did admit he hasnt bothered her since she adored hope said hope really made a big difference in her life i also located tessa bowlby and learned something interesting i recounted the conversations with walter bowlby and dr emerson major psychological problems he said think the fathers being truthful about her accusing him falsely how can you ever know dr emerson implied to me there was little value looking into it he sounded sharp but tessa doesnt see him regularly hadnt told him about her connection to hope or the committee mr bowlby did seem forthcoming gave me the name of the temple city detective who investigated the accusation gunderson ill call he said false claims so muscadine could be telling the truth even if he isnt i cant see any link to mandy wright leaving only monsieur kenny storm junior whom im meeting tomorrow afternoon at his dads office want to come along check out his psyche sure i also learned a few more things about dr cruvic i started with the cars in the clinic lot late at night the armed guard multiple afterhours abortions at nine hundred dollars a throw somethings got to pay for the bentley he said wait theres more cruvics card says practice limited to fertility but he lacks formal training in fertility and there are other irregularities in his bio he left surgical residency at the university of washington after only one year took a leave of absence at a place called the brookehastings institute and switched to obgyn at a hospital in carson fidelity medical center i cant find either place a phony his ba and his md are real and there are no claims filed against him and its possible both brookehastings and fidelity closed down but going from a highprestige teaching hospital to an obscure private place isnt exactly a horizontal transfer so its possible he didnt leave because of a change in interest maybe he was kicked out for some sort of misconduct cooled his heels then applied for an inferior internship in a new area and maybe his conduct hasnt gotten any better since holding himself out as a fertility expert is certainly iffy interesting he said yes it does begin to take on a certain smell and hope was his consultant money games gone bad maybe thats what seacrest is being evasive about not infidelity something financial that would explain his making such a point about having kept his nose out of hopes professional activities distancing himself could be want me to have another go at him prof to prof sure be my guest dr heelspur hes the only one weve caught in a lie like him better as a suspect lets just say im developing an incipient borderline minorleague crush on him if i can tie him in with mandy in any way ill fall headoverfuckingheels in love with him it was and robin was still out emergency repairs could get complicated i phoned the country singers recording studio and she said sorry hon earthquake stuff this is going to take some time at least another couple of hours eat yet no i just want to finish up but dont go to any trouble ill probably just want something simple foie gras she laughed sure go catch a goose i sat there for a while drinking coffee and thinking pizza was simple and there was a great little place in beverly hills that still believed ducks belonged in the water not on thin crust on the way id make another stop at civic center drive this time i checked the alley first once again the three parking slots behind the pink building were empty once again no lights in front the street was still and dark except for widely spaced streetlamps and the occasional wash of headlight everyone was closed up for the night i pulled into a spot fifty yards from the pink buildings entrance kept myself alert by imagining the things an unethical doctor could do to a patient cruvics wing tips covered with blood hyperactive imagination when i was a kid it had vexed my teachers headlights up close beverly hills patrol car cruised by from the police station on the other side of the tracks beverly hills cops were edgy about people sitting in cars without a good excuse but the car drove on suddenly i felt foolish even if cruvic showed what would i say hi just a bit of followup what exactly is the brookehastings institute and what did you do there and by the way whats with the fertility bs i started the seville and was just about to switch the lights on when a grinding sound behind me drew my attention the corrugated door of the building next to cruvics was sliding upward a car with its lights already on not a bentley a small dark sedan it edged out then turned right two people inside the driver nurse anna of the tight face and lipsticked cigarettes next to her a male passenger so the neighboring building was part of cruvics setup too anna drove to foothill drive made an incomplete stop and turned right again i backed out and followed she made two more rights at burton way and rexford drive a long uturn that took her into the flats of north beverly hills with its sevenfigure teardowns up to sunset then across to the coldwater canyon intersection headed toward the valley maybe nothing more ominous than a working woman returning home with a spouse or boyfriend two cars got between us the commuter rush out of the city was over but traffic into the valley was still heavy enough to slow us to twenty miles an hour i managed to keep my sights on the small sedan and when it caught a red light at cherokee drive i shifted to the right to get a closer look the car was a toyota newish two heads inside neither of them moving then anna leaned to the right and an orange ember appeared inside the car like a circling firefly it flew to the left kept going as she dangled her left hand out the window and let the cigarette droop sparks flicked onto the road the man in the passenger seat still hadnt budged either he was sitting low or he wasnt tall cruvic was no giant catching a lift home from his nurse or was their relationship more than business affairs on the brain delaware and i didnt even watch soap operas the light turned green and the toyota shot forward adding more speed as it took on the santa monica mountains there were no more stops til mulholland drive where most of the traffic continued the southward descent to studio city but the toyota hooked east on mulholland and i found myself behind it i slowed down anna picked up speed taking turns with the confidence of someone who knew the route years ago mulholland had been undeveloped from woodland hills to hollywood miles of black ribbon affording a heartstopping view of the glitter below now roadside houses and landscaping blocked most of it out no one behind me i turned off my headlights mulholland got darker and narrower and quieter and the toyota whipped through the curves for another couple of miles before coming to a sudden stop i was a ways back but still had to stop short managing to avoid tiresqueal and skidding only slightly the toyota remained on the road brake lights on i pulled over to the right shoulder kept the seville in drive and watched a car was coming from the opposite direction when it passed the toyota crossed mulholland diagonally rolling up a driveway and coming to rest on a wide concrete pad in front of a high iron gate two faint lights fixtures on brick posts everything else was foliage and darkness the toyotas passenger door opened and the man got out briefly revealed by the dome light but his back was to me he walked up to one of the gateposts and touched it pushing a button as the gate started to slide open i edged back onto the road and drove forward a bit then the toyota backed out and straightened and i waited til it drove off the gate was open and the man was walking through with my lights still off i zoomed past just another bad driver the sound made the man turn as id hoped he would during the split second i studied him helped by the gatepost lights a face id seen before lean intelligent full lips long hair slicked back hollow cheeks arched eyebrows james dean with an attitude a short man but not cruvic casey locking hopes prize student he scratched his ear if i hadnt known about the skull ring i wouldnt have seen it glinting from his delicate white hand i sped back toward the mulholland intersection hope and cruvic hopes student with cruvics nurse did locking live behind the gates nice digs for a grad student welltodo parents or was it cruvics place and time for a conference stopping i did a threepoint turn and headed back toward the house pausing far enough from the gateposts to make sure no one was outside then rolling forward slowly the address was marked by small white numbers on the lefthand post and i memorized them what would a psych grad student have to do with fertility or abortions carrying on hopes consultation something corrupt in a big way a wide enough net to snare hope and mandy wright or something benign a shared academic project on unwanted pregnancies the psychological effects of infertility whatever but locking had never mentioned anything like that and hope hadnt published on those topics and scholarship didnt explain locking getting a lift from cruvics nurse none of it made sense when i pulled up in front of the house robin and spike were climbing the steps id forgotten about the pizza she waved and he whirled around and stacked himself head out feet planted as if competing at a dog show glaring til he heard my hi then he began straining at the leash and robin let him run down to greet me as i rubbed his head he bayed like a hound and butted finally he shook himself off and led me up to robin i pulled her up against me and kissed her deeply boy she said what perfume did i put on this morning forget perfume i said eternal love i kissed her again then she unlocked the door and let us in howd the emergency repair go i said she laughed and bent her head forward flexing her neck and shaking out her curls guitar i salvaged most of the instruments poor montana top of that ive got more work to do tonight promised to fix eno burkes doubleneck for a recording session tomorrow youre kidding wish i was at least theyre paying me triple i rubbed her shoulders allnighter hopefully not i need a nap first want me to make you some coffee no thanks ive been coffeeing all day sorry alex were you planning on some quality time im always openminded she pressed her back against my chest how about a nap together you can tell me bedtime stories later that night i sat in my robe in my office and went through the mail bills liars trying to sell me things and a longoverdue check from a lawyer who collected ferraris i couldnt stop thinking of locking and nurse anna selfcontrol id been unable to reach milo anywhere then i remembered he was visiting clubs on the strip tonight lumbering among the beautiful people that brought a smile to my lips i checked in with my service professor julia steinberger had called just after id left for beverly hills had she remembered something shed left a campus number and a hancock park exchange her husband answered at the second ring and said shes not home probably wont be back for a while why dont you try her tomorrow at her office friendly but tired i left my name put on sweats and a tshirt went over to spikes resting place in the kitchen and asked if he wanted to get a little exercise he ignored me but when i took out his leash he bounded to his stumpy feet and followed me to the door outside i could hear robin hammering spike and i took a long walk up the glen turned onto some dark side streets where the sweet smell of budding pittosporum trees was almost overpowering stopping from time to time as he paused looked around growled at unseen things at am i tried julia steinbergers office but she wasnt in and the chemistry department office said she was teaching a graduate seminar til noon i had other things to do on campus in the psychology office three secretaries sat at computer screens but the receptionists desk was empty mail was piled high on the counter and several students stood at the bulletin board reading employment ads i said excuse me and the nearest typist looked up young cute redheaded showing her my faculty card from the med school crosstown i said this probably makes me persona non grata but perhaps youll be kind enough to help me anyway ooh she said smiling still punching keys treason doctor well i dont care about football what can i do for you im looking for a grad student named casey locking hes got an office down in the basement but he isnt here too often mostly works out of his house she made a trip to the back came back emptyhanded thats funny his folders gone hold on she typed switched computer files brought up a list of names here we go room bfivethreethreeone you can use the phone at the end of the counter i did no answer i went downstairs anyway most of the basement rooms were labs lockings was marked by an index card no answer to my knock back upstairs i told the redhead not in too bad he applied for a job and i was going to set up an appointment would you like his home number i guess i could try it she wrote something down out in the lobby i read it a number with an prefix hollywood hills east of la cienega not the mulholland house so hed gone there to meet someone probably cruvic his folder gone i used a lobby pay phone and called the number lockings liquid voice said no one home speak or forget it hanging up i left the building time to visit the history department hays hall was one of the us oldest buildings just behind palmer library and like palmer yellowish limestone grimy with pollution seacrests office was on the top floor up three flights and at the end of an echoing musty hallway lined with carved mahogany doors his door was open but he wasnt inside it was a big chilly pale green room with a domed ceiling and leaded windows that needed washing brown velvet drapes tied back with brass rings builtin bookshelves a tatty persian rug once red now pink an ugly sevenfoot victorian desk on ball feet was backed by a black cloth orthopedic chair facing it were three cracked red leather club chairs one of them mended with duct tape the desk was as neat as his home office arranged on the surface were a precisely cornered stack of bluebook exams two neolithic urns and a royal manual typewriter half an eggsalad sandwich on waxed paper sat on a green blotter along with an unopened can of diet sprite not a stain not a crumb seacrest came in drying his hands with a paper towel he had on a gray vneck sweater over a brownchecked shirt and gray knit tie the sweaters cuffs were frayed and his eyes looked filmy walking around me he sat down behind the desk and looked at the sandwich morning i said he picked up the sandwich and took a bite what can i do for you if youve got time i have a few questions about your relationship with your wife he put the sandwich down he hadnt invited me to sit and i was still on my feet my relationship with my wife he repeated softly i dont want to intrude but you will anyway because the police are paying you he broke off a small piece of bread crust and chewed slowly good racket he said pardon why are you willing to intrude professor if this is a bad time oh spare me he tilted back in the chair you know it wasnt until that little nocturnal visit you and sturgis paid me that i realized i was actually a suspect what was the purpose of that anyway trying to catch me offguard hoping id somehow incriminate myself is it a bad time its always a bad time he shook his head this goddamn city everyone wants to write his own tawdry tabloid story tell sturgis hes been living in la too long should learn to do some real detecting his face had turned scarlet i suppose i shouldnt have been surprised no doubt theres some idiotic detective manual that says suspect the husband and those first two stooges were hostile from the beginning but why inject you into the process does he really think im going to be impressed by your psychological acuity shaking his head again he ate more of the sandwich striking at it with hard sharp movements as if it were dangerous but irresistible not that being under suspicion matters to me he said ive got nothing to hide so root around to your hearts content and as far as my relationship with my wife neither of us was easy to get along with so the fact that we stayed together should tell you something furthermore what reason would i have to harm her money yes she made a fortune last year but money means nothing to me when her estate clears i may damn well donate all of it to charity wait and see if you dont believe me so what other motive could there be he laughed no delaware my life hasnt improved since hope died even when she was alive i was a solitary person losing her has left me completely alone and i find i no longer want that now kindly let me eat my lunch in peace as i headed for the door he said its a pity sturgis is so uncreative following the manual will only reduce whatever small chance he has of learning the truth youre not optimistic have the police given me reason to be perhaps i should hire a private investigator though i wouldnt know where to turn he gave a low barking laugh i dont even have an attorney and not for lack of opportunity someone must have given my phone number to the sleazy lawyers club or perhaps the bastards just sniff out misery right after the murder i had several calls a day then it tapered off even now they occasionally try what do they want from you to sue the city for not trimming the trees he barked again as if landscaping were the issue what is the total breakdown of order too bad i cant work up a healthy lust for profit write a book that would sell wouldnt that be charming the grieving widower on the talkshow circuit following in hopes footsteps hope was pretty good at it hope was good at everything do you understand that the woman was exceptional i nodded actually he said she despised the publicity game but knew it was useful she told you that yes delaware she was my wife she confided in me popping the top of his soda can he peered into the opening oh christ why am i wasting my time with you can you even imagine what it was like sharing my roof with someone like that like living with a borrowed masterpiece a renoir or a degas one knows one can never own it or even fully understand it but one is grateful borrowed from whom i said god the fates choose your superstition he drank soda and put down the can so now he thinks was he jealous the answer is no i was in awe but a loving awe next question in his psychoanalytic mind what did she see in him and the answer is sometimes i wondered myself and now shes gone and your boob police friend thinks im the culprit have you studied much history dr delaware not formally since college but i try to learn from the past how admirable have you ever thought about what history really is an accounting of failure iniquity errors of judgment character flaws bloody cruelties obscene missteps human beings are such low things what greater support of atheism is there than the repulsive nature of those scraps of flesh and weakness allegedly created in gods image or perhaps there is a master deity and hes an incompetent boob like everyone else wouldnt that be a hoot now please leave me alone it was good to get back out in the sunlight pretending the warmth could melt the bitterness id absorbed up in his office real pain and anger or an act to prevent me from probing confronted with a question about his and hopes relationship hed never said it had been good only that theyd both been hard to live with and their endurance proved something then hed admitted he was jealous but turned it into worship living with a masterpiece that could wear thin i thought of the sudden way hed flushed short fuse people with severe tempercontrol problems often betray themselves physiologically root around to your hearts content secure in his innocence or a psychopaths catchmeifyoucan challenge the meeting at kenneth storm srs office in pasadena was at one julia steinberger would be finished teaching in twenty minutes i used a library phone and gave casey lockings home another try same tape late evening in england but still a civil hour to call hopes other student mary ann gonsalvez once again the phone just kept ringing back to the world of real science julia steinberger was heading for her office flanked by two male graduate students when she saw me she frowned and told them could you give me just a minute guys ill come by the lab they left and she unlocked the office she was wearing a kneelength black dress and black onyx necklace and looked troubled when the door closed behind us she remained standing i dont know if im doing the right thing she said but the first time you were here there was something i left out its probably not relevant i find the whole thing distasteful something about hope i said yes something remember how i told you id had an intuition about her possibly having been abused the fierce look that was true she said she had that look but i there was something else it was last year at the faculty club not the welcoming tea something else some guest lectureship who remembers walking to her desk she braced her palms on the top looked at the doll shed fondled the first time but made no move toward it we chatted a bit then hope moved on to circulate and gerry and i found someone else to talk to then maybe an hour later at the end of the evening i went to the ladies room and she was in there standing at the mirror theres an entry room before you get into the main bathroom also mirrored and the way its set up you can get a look into the bathroom as you pass its carpeted i guess she didnt hear me she lowered her eyes she was in there examining herself her arms her dress was cut low on the shoulders but with elbowlength sleeves id noticed it very elegant figured it had cost a fortune shed pulled one of the shoulders down and was looking at her upper arm there was a strange look in her eyes almost hypnotized and her expression was blank and on the arm was a bruise a large one blackandblue right here she touched her own bicep several marks actually dots finger marks as if shed been squeezed very hard her skin was extremely white beautiful skin so the contrast was dramatic almost like tattoos and the bruises looked fresh hadnt yet turned that greenishpurple color she hurried back to the door fighting tears thats it howd she react when you walked in i said she yanked up the sleeve her eyes came back into focus and she said hi julia as if nothing had happened then she made happy talk and put on her makeup chatting on and on about how different things would be if men were expected to always be in perfect face i agreed with her and we both pretended nothing had happened what was i supposed to say who did that to you she opened the door maybe it was nothing maybe she just had delicate skin bruised easily but when she asked me to be on the committee i just felt as if i owed it to her dark bruises on white skin seacrests sudden anger i got back in the seville and onto the north pasadena eats more than its share of smog but today the air was clean and the office buildings on cordova street shone as beautifully as a richard estes painting storm realty and investment was a onestory neospanish surrounded by brilliant flower beds and jacaranda trees still in purple bloom the accompanying parking lot was pristine i pulled in next to milos unmarked just as he got out he was carrying his briefcase and a tape recorder and was wearing a gray suit white buttondown shirt redandblue rep tie very gop i said looking down at his desert boots and trying not to smile when in businessland do as the businessmen speaking of commerce i found a couple of sunset strip bars mandy wright just might have frequented might no id yet but a couple of promising maybes were talking big hair perfect bodies so an ugly girl would have stood out better as is i was lucky to find two bartenders whod been working there a year ago neither would swear it was her just that she looked familiar was she working or hanging out her line of work is there a difference and if she was working they wouldnt admit it and jeopardize the liquor license the thing that makes me think it could be a valid lead is the places were only a block apart so maybe she was cruising club none and the pit trouble is neither barkeep can remember seeing her with anyone but it does put her in la he crossed his fingers the other thing is i spoke to gunderson the temple city detective who handled tessas complaint against her old man hes an assistant chief now barely remembered the case but he pulled the file and said his notes indicate they never took the complaint seriously considered tessa a head case he started to remember the father vaguely as a nice guy admitted to a juvenile record when he didnt have to very upfront about everything so muscadine is looking increasingly righteous and lets finish with the damned committee ready for master storm before we begin ive got some evidence of hope being abused i told him steinbergers story then my few minutes with seacrest bruises and a bad temper he said frowning what specifically got him so pissed he was pissed at the outset got red in the face when i told him i wanted to talk about the relationship good maybe were getting under his skin maybe i should work him a little more wouldnt that be something he roughs her up for years and she writes the book telling women how to defend themselves wouldnt be the first time i said for what style over substance little boxes but if she and seacrest were having problems the book all the attention it got her could have crystallized her dissatisfaction made her decide to finally break away maybe in that sense fame was her death sentence but as to what that has to do with mandy wright i still cant come up with anything and heres another complication last night i took another drive by cruvics office he wasnt in but nurse anna was along with casey locking i told him about the mulholland house and he copied down the address shit he said just when you thought it was safe to go back into hypothesisland okay ill find out who owns it meanwhile lets go persecute a mouthy kid we crossed a long quiet reception area to get to kenneth storm srs office past a pair of secretaries who looked up from their keyboards resentfully talk radio in the background the storms were a testament to genetics both bullnecked and wideshouldered with sandy crew cuts and small suspicious eyes that locked in place for long stretches senior was fiftyish with the dissolute puffy look of a fullback gone sedentary he wore a navy blazer with gold buttons and a masonic pin in the lapel juniors jacket was dark green his buttons as bright as his fathers they were both positioned behind seniors canoeshaped blondoak desk which had been cleared of everything but a cowboy bronze and a green onyx penandpencil set the office was too big for the furniture walled in oak veneer and carpeted in beige shag realestate and lifeinsurance achievement awards were seniors idea of selfvalidation a cigar smell filled the room but no ashtrays were in sight standing in front of the desk was a rangy hawknosed grayhaired man wearing a threepiece charcoal suit frenchcuffed powderblue shirt and a silk tie in someones idea of power pink he introduced himself as pierre bateman storms attorney and i recalled his name from the complaint against the conduct committee before we had a chance to sit he began laying down stipulations for the interview in a slow droning voice kenneth storm jr yawned and scratched behind his ears and stuck his index finger in and out of a buttonhole his father stared down at the desktop furthermore said bateman with regard to the substance of this proced are you a criminal lawyer sir said milo im mr storms attorney of record i handle all his business affairs so you regard this as a business affair bateman bared his teeth may i continue detective has mr storm jr engaged you formally thats hardly relevant it might be if youre going to stand around making up rules bateman massaged a sapphire cuff link and looked at the boy would you care to designate me as your attorney kenny junior rolled his eyes his father tapped his sleeve with an index finger yeah sure all right then said bateman with regard to this procedure detective you will refrain from milo placed his tape recorder on the desk i have a problem with that said bateman with what taping this is neither court testimony nor a formal deposition and my clients not under any formal suspicion so why are you acting like he is detective said bateman i insist that you stop interrupting milo shut him up with a loud exhalation picking up the recorder he examined a switch mr bateman we drove out here as a courtesy rescheduled several times as a courtesy allowed your clients father to be present as a courtesy even though hes reached the age of majority we are not talking juvey traffic court here our interest in the lad is the fact that he had a highly hostile exchange with a woman who was subsequently stabbed to death junior mumbled and senior shot him a look detective said bateman surely counselor said milo taking a few steps closer hes not a formal suspect yet but all this shuffling and dodging is definitely firming up the picture of an individual with something to hide you wanna sit here play f lee bombast thats your business but if we do conduct an interview today its gonna be taped and im gonna ask what i want otherwise well reschedule at the west la substation and you all deal with the freeway and the press junior mumbled again ken warned senior junior rolled his eyes again and fingered a pimple on the side of his neck his hands were big hairless powerful milo said sorry to be taking up your time son though youve got a bit of time on your hands dont you being out of school and all that juniors neck stretched as he jutted his lower jaw his father tapped his cuff again detective said bateman that was a wonderful speech now if youll allow me to continue my stipulations milo picked up the recorder and headed for the door sayonara gentlemen we were halfway across the reception area when bateman called out detective we kept walking and the lawyer hurried to catch up the reception area had gone quiet the two secretaries staring the talk jock was pontificating about athletes salaries the place smelled of mouthwash that was intemperate detective bateman stagewhispered this is a kid hes nineteen and more than big enough to do damage mr bateman expect a call he pushed the door open and bateman followed us out to the parking lot mr storms wellregarded in his community detective and kennys a solid boy good for them with all the gangs and the serious crime one would think the police have better things to do than harass lawabiding citizens said milo what can i say were stupid we reached the unmarked just wait one minute batemans voice had tightened but with anxiety not indignation milo took out his keys look detective im here so theyll feel protected kenny really is a good kid ive known him for years protected against what things have been rough lately theyre both under considerable stress milo opened the car door and put his gear in bateman edged closer and spoke in a lower voice i dont expect you to care but ken ken srs having some financial difficulties serious ones the realestate market milo straightened but didnt answer its a hard time for both of them said bateman first kens wife died very sudden an aneurysm and now this ken built his business from nothing built this building twenty years ago and now its on the verge of foreclosure and losing it wont solve all his problems there are plenty of other creditors so you can see why hed be nervous about the legal process im his friend as well as his lawyer i feel obligated to protect him as much as i can were not talking real estate here mr bateman the attorney nodded truth is i dont know shit from shinola about criminal law and told ken so but he and i go back to grade school he insisted on having me present so he thinks the boy needs legal help no no only in general terms not getting shafted by the system to be frank kennys no genius and he has a bad temper so does ken so did his dad for that matter the whole damn bunch of them have short fuses for all i know thats how they got the family name he smiled but milo didnt return it is kenny an only child no theres a daughter up at stanford med the bright one cheryls a whiz how do she and kenny get along fine but kennys never been at her level and everyone knows it my point is detective take those tempers and add all the stress and without some sort of structure theres a good chance both of them would eventually get hot under the collar and pop off give the wrong impression which is that kennys capable of violence he isnt believe me he played football with my kid in high school had the speed and the muscle but got dropped from the team because he wasnt aggressive enough no killer instinct huh bateman gave a pained look furthermore he assures me that on the night of the murder he was in san diego does he have someone to back that up no but like i said hes no einstein so what i read about the murder sounded thoughtout stalking the woman leaving no physical evidence that just isnt kenny he might lose his cool and run his mouth maybe even punch someone but he calms down fast hes smart enough to get into the u i said a miracle said bateman believe me ken pulled in some alumnus chits had him tutored the boy took the sat four times then he worked his butt off but still couldnt cut it couldnt hack college of the palms either now this it couldnt come at a worse time in terms of his selfesteem thats why that cra your remark about his having free time was hurtful being interrogated by the police isnt pleasant to be honest detective hes pretty scared about today he didnt seem scared he puts on a show believe me hes scared milo finally smiled you like him huh yes i do detective the smile widened well i dont mr bateman cause he hasnt done anything to earn my liking him det ive got a brutal unsolved murder with a lot of angry overtones to it on my hands and what i see in your client is a big strong aggressive kid with a very nasty temper whos been playing hardtoget and finally shows up with daddy acting antsy and a lawyer trying to block every syllable that comes out of my mouth what do you want me to do serve up my questions on a doily with parsley on the side if i wanted to cater id learn how to cook bateman bared his teeth again the affect behind the mannerism was hard to gauge but his body language said submission of course not detective of course not im just trying to all right lets give it another try ask what you want tape everything but ill be taking detailed notes and do try to remember this is a good kid when we returned to the office both storms were smoking cigars and an ashtray had appeared on the desk panamanian said milo senior nodded and blew enough smoke to hide his facial features junior smirked milo set up the tape recorder recited the date and place his badge number and juniors name as the subject of an inperson interview with regard to oneeightseven pc coroners case number ninefour dash sevensevensixfive professor hope devane hearing her name wiped the smirk off juniors face he smoked and fought back a cough bateman and i sat down but milo remained on his feet afternoon kenny grunt do you know why were here grunt how many times did you meet professor devane grunt youre going to have to speak up once when was that the committee the hearing of the interpersonal conduct committee chaired by professor devane grunt whats that yeah ive read transcripts of that hearing son sounds like things got pretty heated grunt whats that she was a bitch senior took his cigar out ken hey tell it like it is said his son so you didnt like her said milo dont put words into his mouth ordered senior milo looked down at him okay well stick to quotes you think she was a bitch seniors mouth got piggish and bateman made a goeasy gesture with his hand milo repeated the question junior shrugged she was what she was which was a fucking bitch ken mr storm said milo please stop interrupting hes my son dammit and its my right to ken said bateman its okay right said senior everythings okay everythings just great counselor said milo bateman got up and put a hand on seniors shoulder senior shook him off and smoked furiously what said milo made you think she was a bitch kenny the way she acted more specific the way she set me up set you up how that letter telling me we were just going to discuss things at the hearing yeah when i got there the way she tried to get cindy to say i was some kind of rapist which is total bullshit sidelong glance at his father it was just a dumb hassle between cindy and me later she called me professor devane did yeah when afterward after the hearing yeah how long after the next day at night i was at the omega house whyd she call to try to freak me out in what way son she was pissed because her little game was a loser howd she try to freak you out she said even if cindy didnt want to press charges i had problems impulsecontrol problems some bullshit like that she said she could make things rough for me if i didnt behave she threatened you the boy shifted in his seat looked at his cigar and put it in the ashtray his father stared at him she didnt exactly come out and say it more like hinting hinting how i dont remember the exact words like ill be watching im in control you know did she use the word control i said no i dont know maybe it was more like how she said it you know watch your step or something like that she was a radical radical said milo leftwing she discussed her political views with you the boy smiled no but it was obvious radical feminism trying to establish a new order know what i mean not really son socialism central control glance at his father communism died in russia but theyre still trying to centralize america ah said milo so you see professor devane as part of some kind of leftwing conspiracy kenny laughed no im no militia freak im just saying theres a certain type of person likes to control things make rules for everyone like playboy is evil and should be banned affirmative action for everyone and professor devane was that type of person kenny shrugged seemed like it milo nodded and ran his hand over his face and she said shed be watching you something like that watching how she didnt say i shined her on anyway how told her to fuck herself and hung up and went back to playing pool i was leaving the place anyway what did i care fuck her leaving the university yeah place sucks waste of time you cant learn business in school another sidelong peek at his father senior his head in a cloud of smoke was staring at the framed awards milo said so you thought she was a bitch and she threatened you did her threat scare you at all no way like i said she was full of shit and i was out of there did you ever consider taking action against her like what like anything senior swiveled and faced bateman can he get that general pierre would you care to rephrase your question detective said bateman no said milo did you ever consider taking any kind of action against professor devane kenny junior looked from his father to bateman milo tapped a foot dad senior gave him a disgusted look milo said shall i repeat the question bateman said go ahead kenny we my father and me we talked about suing her suing her said milo for harassment which it was said senior the whole thing was a complete outrage it woulda served her right said junior but we never did anything why not no answer because she was murdered said milo no because dads got some hes busy with business complications so we discussed it said senior loudly so what last i heard its still a free country or have i missed something milo kept his eyes on the boy did you ever consider taking any other kind of action against professor devane kenny like what anything like what like getting back at her physically no way man and anyway if i wouldve wanted to do that it wouldnta been her id pound it would be that wuss with her id never hit a lady what wuss is that the faggot with her he really got on my case i dont know his name you considered getting back at him physically bateman said detective thats not a kenny said i didnt consider it but if i did he wouldve been the one he kept going at me like trying to outfeminist her so if you wouldve planned to hurt someone it would have been him not professor devane senior said he never said hed hurt anyone exactly said junior him i couldve duked it out fair and square with but she was a woman i still open doors for women car doors said milo like for cindy the boys shoulders bunched milo checked the tape okay now lets talk about where you were

and scowled basically milo repeated kenny touched the pimple on his neck dont pick at it said senior what else did you do that night said milo juniors answer was nearly inaudible beer you had a beer yeah just one a couple how many another glance at dad a couple meaning two said milo maybe three or four maybe you get high son nope the small eyes were active now do anything besides beer no four beers said milo maybe a sixpack no there were two left over so definitely four probably probably maybe i had another in the morning senior stared at his son shook his head very slowly breakfast of champions said milo the boy didnt answer dinner tv said milo then four beers what time did you drink the fourth beer i dunno maybe eight leaving enough time for the twohour ride to la and an hour of stalking but the dog had turned ill earlier in the evening then what said milo then nothing you went to sleep at eight no i more tv tv all night basically be nice to have someone who saw you there son its a small room said kenny as if that explained it make any phone calls um i dunno maybe i dont know its easy to get a look at your phone records the boy glanced at bateman bateman said well have to explore that detective explore away said milo but with no alibi and kennys hostile exchange with professor devane ill have no trouble getting a warrant the boy sat higher then his shoulders fell and he blurted i can i talk to you in private sir kenny said his father sure said milo no way said his father pierre kenny said the lawyer if theres something you need to the boy shot to his feet waving his fists i need privacy im here to safeguard your privacy and your i mean real privacy not legal bullshi ken barked senior this is a murder dad they can do what they want shut up its no big deal dad i just want some fucking privacy okay bateman said kenny there are obviously some things you and i need to no shouted the boy im not saying i killed her or anything crazy like that i just made a phone call okay a fucking phone call but theyre gonna find out so can i have some privacy silence finally senior said what the hell did you do call a whore the boy blanched sat down heavily covered his face great said his father great judgment kenny the boy began sobbing talking between gasps all i wanted fucking pri vacy senior ground out his cigar with all the diseases going around jesus thats why i didnt want to tell you great said his father very smart kenny lowered his hand his lips trembled senior said if you were so concerned about what id think whyd you do it in the first place i used a skin senior shook his head milo said what you do on your own time doesnt concern me kenny in fact it could help you who exactly did you call some service name i dont remember despondent soft voice had you used it before silence senior turned away kenny said milo once once before nod but you dont remember the name starr escorts two rs whered you find out about them the phone book theyre all in the yellow pages what was the girls name i dont hailey i think you think we didnt exactly talk much both times it was hailey no just the second time describe her mexican short long black hair not bad face good bo nicelooking how old maybe twentyfive how much did she charge fifty howd you pay her cash what time did you call starr escorts around ten and what time did hailey arrive maybe tenthirty eleven how long did she stay half hour maybe longer after she watched some tv with me we had the last two beers then then she left and i went to sleep next day i turn on the news and theyre talking about her devane saying somebody offed her and im thinking whoa while she was getting killed i was he looked at his father sat up straighter right around the time she was dying i was having a good time freaky but kind of like some kind of revenge know what i mean christ said senior can we end this so im covered right alibied the boy asked milo she was killed around midnight and i was getting with hailey so i couldnt do it right he took a deep breath and let the air out im glad its out big deal dad i didnt kill anybody arent you happy im overjoyed said senior starr escorts said milo look it up in the book ill take a fucking liedetector test if you want shut your mouth said his father no more gutter talk he turned quickly to milo are you happy now have you squeezed enough blood out of the rock why dont you just leave us alone and go out and catch some gang members milo looked at the boy what about mandy wright genuine confusion on the stolid face who christ said senior lay off ken said bateman ken senior repeated as if the sound of his own name disgusted him pointing his hand to the door he said out all of you this is still my office and i want privacy back at the unmarked i said believe him the hooker thing he said is exactly what a dumb lonely kid would do and he probably isnt smart enough to plan if i can find the massage girl and she alibis him and i dont get the feeling daddys paid her off theres another one off the list and he seemed genuinely unfamiliar with mandys name he pulled out a cigarillo and looked at it a warm breeze was drifting from the san gabriels and the palm trees planted close to the building were doing a line dance so byebye committee hope was probably killed because of something in her private life those bruises on her arm are bringing me back to seacrest andor cruvic cause he was probably fooling around with her problem is i cant get close to either of them and i cant get a clear picture of hope just polarized opinions she was womanhoods great savior or she was a manhating manipulator nothing about her core one of the problems i said is that theres no family other than seacrest no one to talk about her development her childhood what she was like outside of her professional role all i know about her childhood is she grew up in that aggie town higginsville parents dead no sibs and if shes got distant relatives they must be damned distant because after the murder no one ever stepped forward he got in the car still i said no family doesnt mean no family history i could go up to higginsville ask around in a small town someone might remember her sure he said without enthusiasm ill call the local police and let them know youre coming see if they can get you access to records when do you want to go no reason it cant be tomorrow he nodded dress for the heat were talking farmland dont they grow artichokes up there or something that night robin and i went out to dinner by eight she was soaking in a bath and i was stretched out on a sofa in my office rereading the conductcommittee transcripts uncharacteristically spike had chosen to stay with me probably the lingering smell of steak now his big knobby head rested in my lap and he snored the rhythm was soporific and the bitter dialogue began to blur i learned nothing felt myself grow drowsy knew it was time to stop just as i put the transcripts down the phone rang spike snapped upright bounded off and ran to the offending machine baying doctor this is joyce at your service theres a woman on the line sounds pretty distraught a mary farney the woman at the womens center in santa monica beatendown mother of chenise put her on please a strident voice said hello this is dr delaware what can i do for you mrs farney you gave me your card at the center

clinic but you might want to alert santa monica pd anyway cruvic works nights there could be on his way over will do meanwhile get this ladys phone number and address find out any details while shes still eager to help sure i said but when i got back on the line it was dead i tried my service to see if mary farney had left a number she hadnt the west la directory yielded only one farney first initial m on brooks avenue in venice that sounded like a good bet but no answer either shed phoned me from somewhere else or shed left copying down the number i put on street clothes went into the bathroom where robin was still soaking told her id be going out and why be careful honey no sweat i said leaning down to peck her cheek walking distance from the police station bhpd had sent three squad cars the two blocks and i could see their blinking lights from santa monica boulevard the western entrance to civic center drive was blocked by a sawhorse and a uniform waved me away at the east end near foothill but just as i turned milo stepped out of the darkness and told the cop to let me through i parked twenty yards down from cruvics building before i got out a vehicle pulled up beside me big white news van from one of the network affiliates a franticlooking platinumhaired woman jumped out as if parachuting from a moving plane stopped looked around beckoned to a sound man and a camera operator i stayed in the seville as the three of them sprinted toward cruvics building the reporter gesticulating when they saw milo they stopped again he shook his head and thumbed them on then came over to me he had on the same gray suit hed worn at kenneth storms office had replaced the shirt and tie with a gray tshirt his idea of an la barcrawl getup red lights from the nearest cruiser gave him an intermittent blush and his eyes looked hungry whats happening i said suspect in custody that was quick the ominous darrell turns out to be a skinny kid with poor reflexes caught cruvic driving out of that garage next to the building stuck a knife through the window and ordered him out cruvic kicked the door which knocked darrell down then he took the knife and was in the process of pounding the shit out of the kid when bh cops showed up what about chenise if shes a teeny little blond thing in a red blouse she was standing on the sidewalk screaming and they took her to the station along with darrell i told bh hes a suspect in the devane murder to keep things quiet but obviously someone found out they said i can talk to him soon as they clear their paper what about the mom couldnt keep her on the line she probably lives in venice another news van pulled in and another vulturefest said milo cmon lets get over there and see how our heros doing the sliding metal door of the garage was open and the silver bentley turbo was positioned halfin half on the sidewalk the drivers door was still open and the dome light illuminated black leather seats chrome knobs polished wood but no driver cruvic was standing nearby wearing a black suit and black turtleneck talking to a uniform and rubbing his knuckles a blackandwhite backed out and turned left hooking around the municipal parking lot the cop smiled at cruvic who smiled back flexed his foot and pointed to the bentley the officer trotted over got in the big car drove it to the corner and let it idle when he came back to cruvic the doctor shook his hand then that of a second cop malebonding smiles all around then cruvic saw the press and said something to the uniforms as the cops held the microphones at bay cruvic jogged headdown to the bentley milo and i made it over just as he touched the door handle evening doc said milo cruvic turned sharply as if ready to defend himself again the black sweater was skintight over a broad chest rubbing his knuckles again he said why hello detective sturgis quite an evening sir cruvic looked at his hand and grinned sore said milo it smarts but a little ice and some antiinflammatories should do the trick good thing i dont have any surgery scheduled tomorrow he got in the bentley milo positioned himself between the open door and the car nice wheels sir cruvic shrugged four years old finicky but overall it runs pretty well can we talk a bit sir about what i already gave my statement to the beverly hills police i realize that doctor but if you dont mind actually i do smile it was a tough day to begin with and this was the capper he looked at his hand and put it in his pocket got to ice up before it balloons sir shaking his head cruvic said im sorry ive got to take care of my hand he turned a gold ignition key and the bentley started up almost inaudibly countryrock music boomed from lots of speakers travis tritt singing about trouble cruvic turned the volume up even higher and put the bentley in drive milo stood there the camera crew was headed toward us cruvic lifted his foot off the brake and the car began rolling the door pressing against milos back he stepped away quickly and cruvic closed the door when can we talk sir cruvics slanted eyes tightened call me tomorrow as the bentley glided past smoothly the police cleared a way for its escape darrell ballitser was indeed skinny fiveten pounds according to the booking officer nineteen years old born in hawaiian gardens his current address was an sro hotel near skid row he sat in the beverly hills pd interrogation room holding a paper cup of mountain dew third refill his face was long and narrow his shaved head topped with bumps a blond mustache and goatee werent much more than dandelion fluff bloodshot blue eyes that couldnt decide if they were tough or scared looked nowhere a blue harleydavidson tattoo marked the spot where the back of his neck met his shoulder blades another inscription proclaiming party was a magenta smear on his right bicep life on the fingers of his right hand death on the right a blueandred gothic chenise across his neck his baggy white tank top was soiled as were lowrider jeans barely held up by a wide black leather belt two hoop earrings in one ear three in the other a nose ring nature had provided additional decoration angry patches of acne random as buckshot wounds on his face back and shoulders cruvic had contributed a black eye split lip bruised chin lumpy jaw he rocked in his chair attaining as much mobility as the hand cuffed to the bolted table would allow they hadnt cuffed him at first but hed screamed and thrashed and tried to hit milo milo sat across from him placid almost bored ballitser drank the rest of the sweet yellow soda hed finished two sugar doughnuts provided by a slim young brunette detective named angela boatwright chewing painfully each swallow marked by the rise and fall of a plumsized adams apple boatwright was cheerful a few sunburns past beautiful with a surfergirl rhythm to her speech faint freckles and pale eyes a tight runners body and slightly oversized hands she wore a blueblack pantsuit and black flats with stockings when she was with ballitser she seemed more sorry than scornful a longsuffering big sister but out of earshot shed referred to him as a sorry little asswipe now she drank coffee and sat back behind the oneway glass flexing her hands it had taken almost an hour to do ballitsers paperwork i was surprised at the ease with which boatwright and her partner a bald man named hoppey had relinquished control to milo maybe she read my mind because as we entered the viewing room she said we booked him on attempted assault but the murder thing takes precedence lucky that doctor had his wits about him a printout of ballitsers criminal history rested on a fakewood table between us mostly blank except for notation of a sealed juvenile record and twenty unpaid parking tickets occupational hazard milo had explained when darrell works hes a messenger car or bike i said both he gave a tired smile and i knew he was thinking all that time spent on another stupid one now he said im gonna get you a lawyer darrell whether you ask for one or not no answer darrell ballitser crumpled the paper cup and threw it on the floor is there any particular lawyer you want me to call fuck milo started to get up fuck fuck yes or fuck no fuck no fuck no to a lawyer fuck yeah ballitser touched his jaw aspirin didnt kick in yet huh no answer darrell fuck angela boatwright stretched talk about your onenote solo milo got up and entered the observation room how many public defenders do you have on call all the pds are tied up said boatwright weve been into the private list for a while compassionate wilshire boulevard guys doing pro bono ill go find someone two more mountain dews a hamburger and fries and two bathroom breaks later an unhappylooking attorney named leonard kasanjian showed up with an ostrichskin briefcase too small to hold much he had long black hair brushed straight back a fiveday beard and minuscule pewterframed eyeglasses over resigned dark eyes he wore a tailored olive gabardine suit tancheck snapcollar shirt handpainted brownandgold tie brown suede loafers as he approached boatwright smiled and whispered pulled him out of le dome hey angela he said brightening you in charge tonight hows it evening mr kasanjian she said in a hard tone and the lawyers smile died she said let me tell you about your client and did he listened said sounds pretty clear maybe to you mr ballitser said kasanjian putting his briefcase on the table the boys free hand shot out fisted knocking the case to the floor kasanjian picked it up and flicked lint from his lapel smiling but his eyes were furious mr ballit fuck you milo said okay well transfer him downtown pull warrants on his room kasanjian looked down at the booking slip hear that darrell ballitser rocked and fixed his eyes on the ceiling theyre taking you to the county jail darrell ill come by to see you tomorrow morning dont talk to anyone til then nothing then fuck kasanjian shook his head and stood he and milo headed for the door ballitser said spade both men turned whats that son said kasanjian silence spade said kasanjian a black guy fuck said the boy spraying saliva and kicking wildly easy darrell said kasanjian ballitser slammed his fist on the table his eyes shifted to the door his torso quivered and tightened every muscle defined beneath the damaged skin like a frayed anatomical diagram fuuuck spaaade kasanjian said spa spaaaade spaaaade thats fucking why thats fucking why kasanjian looked shaken try to calm down darrell he turned to milo hes obviously in need of psychiatric attention detective im making a formal request that you provide immedia spaaaaade spaaaaade ballitser twisted his body punched his own chest kicking at the chair pounding the bolted table over and over spade is why said milo fucking why why you dont like dr cruvic fuckinga spade fuckinga he fucking did it the boy began crying then curled his free hand and ripped at his cheeks milo pulled him off held him still darrells blemished face was contorted in agony cruvic did it said milo gently yeees he fucking did it darrell yeees to chenise yees spaaaade like a fucking dog wooffuckingwoof ballitser clawed the table panted chenise said milo ballitser flopped his neck hard enough to sprain it he raised his free hand prayerfully nothing aggressive in the gesture milo came closer tell me son tears spurted from the boys eyes its okay tell me son darrells stickbody shook whatd he do son darrell shot a hand into the air waved it his eyes danced wildly he fucking spayed my lady twenty minutes later after conferring with his client kasanjian came out smiling well theres my extenuating circumstance angela boatwright was coming back from the squad room with a cup of coffee hey angie he told her thanks for the referral i especially liked walking out on my date always glad to help they shot smilearrows at each other milo said wheres chenise down the hall any sign of her mother not yet said boatwright and still no answer at home i said if her mother had something to do with the operation she could be scared for her own safety what operation said boatwright whats going on your doctor heros into involuntary sterilization said kasanjian what seven months ago dr cruvic aborted a child ms chenise farney was carrying my clients child but my client had no prior knowledge of the procedure nor was he consulted despite the fact that ms farney is a minor leaving my client as the sole adult parent adult youve got to be kidding said boatwright to make matters worse said kasanjian dr cruvic wasnt satisfied with a termination he sterilized the girl without telling her tied her tubes a minor no valid consent and guess what folks mr ballitser has informed me that dr devane counseled chenise but never told her she was going to be sterilized so there was obviously a conspiracy meaning your hero is no boy scout and his unprofessional conduct is obviously a significant factor in what occurred tonight now in terms of your even assuming mr ballitser had anything to do with dr devanes murder i must insist that you present evidence immediately or relea milo cut him off with a wave and turned to boatwright lets talk to the girl yes lets said kasanjian sorry said milo just us cop folk kasanjians mouth worked he buttoned his suit jacket detective if shes a potential not tonight len said boatwright pushing hair out of her face it sounded like something shed said before she cocked a hip and clicked her tongue the attorney gripped his briefcase have it your way policepeople but if you choose to indict ballitser even for a rinkydink misdemeanor like attempted battery well get to her soon enough as he left boatwright said youre actually staying with the case why not boatwright shrugged nice to see you finally commit after ten minutes with chenise milo was saying im still not sure hon did you know what dr cruvic was going to do or not the girl shook her head miserably she wore tight black jeans a lacy red midriff blouse heavy bubbletoed black boots with red soles a red bandanna for a belt her makeup was thick and chalky just like the time id seen her in the waiting room but the pink highlights in her hair had been replaced by a broad black streak down the middle that turned her coif into a photonegative skunk a dazed look none of the coquettishness id seen in the clinic waiting room shed spent most of the time weeping limiting her speech to mumbles and twoword sentences did darrell know said milo that raised her head wheres darrell on his way to jail chenise hes in big trouble her lip trembled and she scratched her arm milo was sitting next to her hovering one hand on the back of her chair the other flat on the table he shifted slightly closer she angled away from him chenise he said softly im not saying youre in trouble just darrell so far no reaction maybe you can help us maybe you can help darrell more weeping angela boatwright walked over and touched the girls knobby shoulder can i get you something honey chenises mouth dropped open as she considered the offer her peg teeth were caramelcolored her lips chapped and cracked at the edges one short thumb scratched her cheek then the black stripe then the arm again a snack chenise said boatwright or a drink candy said the girl in a very small voice sure what kind do you like um mounds okay and if we dont have that whats your second choice um krackel so some kind of chocolate huh boatwright smiled at her and the girl nodded another touch of chenises shoulder caused her to sink in her chair be right back hon when the door closed chenise leaned farther away from milo her small size made him look huge he glanced at me so i said you and darrell met in a class nod were you both in the class uhuh you werent headshake but you met there yeah where was darrell leaving leaving the class nod he finished the class nod gradated he graduated but you were still in the class nod do you remember where the class was chenise uhhuh where north bower is that a street headshake school in the back in the back of north bower school i said what kind of class was

washing up she touched behind one ear and a tin earring shaped like a lightning bolt swung back and forth food food i repeated emphatic nod making food buying healthy food was the class called dls yeah big smile daily living skills i said to milo state grant for educating the borderline retarded that had run out six months ago chenise said dare to live special its also that she batted heavily mascaraed lashes touched her hard white tummy pressed her knees together then spread them slightly so darrell finished dls i said uhhuh and you guys met at the school nod he got a job pride for ready messenger he had a room his own room yeah she winked at me licked her lips macipated that took a moment to figure out darrell was emancipated nod darrell was an emancipated minor the full phrase went right by her emancipated i repeated her eyes narrowed he hit on him who did lee her boyfriend his mothers boyfriend yeah his mothers boyfriend hit on him i said unsure if that meant beating or sexual abuse yeah how with a belt so darrell ran away and got emancipated nod when i dunno must have been a while ago because hes nineteen now she shrugged and licked her lips boatwright came back with a krackel bar here you go hon the girl took the candy tentatively unwrapped a corner and nibbled at it slow she said boatwright said pardon eat slow dont choke good advice i said did they teach you that at dls show up on time napkins in lap your smile is your wrinkled browis your manner banner i said yeah anything else yeah another wink like what safe sex means life that line recited in a deeper authoritative voice she giggled what is it chenise harder laughter saucy smile the eyelashes worked overtime she rubbed the chocolate against her front teeth turned them brown licked it away safe sex she said unable to stop giggling what does safe sex mean i said giggle skins darrell dont like em rolling her eyes no bad bad boy she wagged a finger giggled some more touched her belly when did you first know you were pregnant i said she grew serious shrugged and nibbled i repeated the question no period then my stomach puked giggling mom said oh no shit giggling so she took you to dr cruvic nod did she tell you why silence suddenly she hung her head touched her tummy again i leaned in spoke very softly what did your mother tell you about dr cruvic chenise silence did she tell you anything long slow nod whats that you know she said i smiled at her can you tell me chenise you know i really dont shrug bortion she told you dr cruvic would be doing an abortion uhhuh did you talk to dr

did you think the abortion was good for had to she said in a clear voice her eyes were clear too purified by anger you had to think it was good for you hard nod why chenise mom said mom said you had to you cant raise it stupid and im sure as hell not raising your basta she stared at me with defiance then her head dropped and she began playing with the candy wrapper the hand dropped to her tummy again it reminded me of something the black girl in the clinic waiting room had comforted herself exactly the same way so you knew you were going to have an abortion no answer cheni yeah did you know dr cruvic was going to do any other operation silence then a small headshake did he do another operation no answer she shoved the candy bar away and it fell off the table milo retrieved it turned it between his thick fingers angela boatwright was in a corner eyes alert chenise i said the girl fingered the lower lace hem of her top tugged down pulled up slipping her hand under the lace she began massaging her belly did dr cruvic do something else to you chenise silence did dr devane tell you dr cruvic was going to do something else silence did dr devane ask you to sign your name to something nod she licked her lips and wiped them with the back of her hand slid sideways in the chair putting her body in an awkward tilt chenise spay she gave a soft grunt bobbed her head as if to music spay i said she coughed and sniffed what does spay mean chenise like a dog who told you that chenise she started to answer then her lips compressed the hand continued to rub her abdomen moving over the navel in rapid cycles stopping pinching the skin then resuming she shifted position straightening slumping still rubbing rubbing the navel the entry point for tubal ligation when you woke up from the abortion i said was there a bandaid on any part of your body the hand stopped small fingers dug into white bellyflesh her top rode up revealing a shelf of rib cage above a white hollow suddenly the other hand slammed to her pubis cupping it here she said arching her pelvis and here standing she arched her back baring the umbilicus uh uh she grunted pressing both sites and showing them again in an awkward bumpandgrind hurt like shit farting all day cramps said boatwright when did you find out dr cruvic had done more than an abortion later how much later shrug who told you mom whatd she say go ahead screw all you want it dont matter we fix you tire the tubes no bastas mascara running the eyes alive with anger i was a spade she stared at me then milo then angela boatwright sat down

the operation uhuh so what did they talk to you about bortion heres a pen a pen to sign to write something nod what like this she made aerial loops i can do it eyeing my ballpoint i gave it to her along with a sheet of paper biting her tongue she hunched and labored finally producing a chain of ragged peaks and troughs i peered at it indecipherable she started to pocket the pen stopped giggled and returned it keep it i said she looked at it shook her head i took it back so you wrote your name for dr devane yeah before the operation yeah but she didnt talk to you about responsibility til after the operation yeah her hands dropped to the surgical sites again yeah she repeated almost snarling it a spadelike a dog pain and gas puking farted all day at eleven i phoned robin to tell her i was all right and would be home late she said its on the news theyre already tying it in with hope i told milo and boatwright he cursed and she said probably kasanjian the idiot talks about court tv all the time wants a big case mary farney showed up just after midnight wearing a short yellow rayon dress with wilted lapels off black stockings and gold backless highheeled shoes caked pale makeup and brown eye shadow liquor and mint on her breath her voice so tight i imagined hands around her neck she said is she okay shes fine said milo frowning weve been trying to reach you for a while maam i was scared so i went somewhere a friends i took in her outfit ready for celebrity where is she i want to see her in a minute mrs farney is she in trouble we havent charged her with anything you mean you might she grabbed milos sleeve no no i didnt call to have that no no shes she dont understand anything i need to ask you a few questions maam i already told her hand covered her mouth told who no one who mrs farney just some people outside there outside the station reporters just a few milo forced a smile what did you tell them mrs farney that darrell was a murderer that he killed dr devane boatwright rolled her eyes well he is he had a knife okay said milo lets go into a room and talk about what chenise maam what about her lets go in that room she sat on the edge of the chair looked around the spare room with disdain coffee said milo no i dont see why i have to stay here i didnt do nothing just a few questions maam chenise says she was taken to dr cruvic for an abortion but he tied her tubes without telling her oh no dont you accuse me shes slinging bull she can lie with the best of them believe me was she sterilized you bet but she knew all right i explained everything to her and so did everyone else everyone maam the doctors the nurses everyone doctors said milo meaning dr cruvic and dr devane right dr cruvic did the surgery what was dr devanes role to talk to her counseling so she would understand shes just saying that to get him off that little bast did dr devane do anything more than talk to chenise what do you mean did she conduct a physical checkup hesitation no why should she youre sure about that i i wasnt in the room every second who saw chenise after the surgery i probably dr cruvic and his nurse i guess you guess it was at night i work days i picked her up later she was throwing up still groggy got my car all filthy okay said milo sitting back so this was at the womens health center in santa monica you bet who referred you there she shifted in her chair pulled at an eyelash no one everyone knows what they do there abortions and sterilizations yeah so what did chenise know what they did you bet she says she didnt thats a crock she has attention problems half the time shes in another world a glance at me attention disorder on top of everything else whats the big deal bandaid sterilization the next day she was walking around she said she had cramps said boatwright so is that some big deal you dont get cramps every month she had cramps and gas she was gassy all day thought it was funny let it out nice and loud she had no problem with any of it til he got involved stupid punk like hes gonna be a father right telling her shed been spayed idiot she never even knew what the word meant i tell you it was no big deal boom boom the gas is cause they fill you up with it here touching her own pubic regionso they can see whats in there then they go in through the belly button and boom its over like i said she was walking around the next day angela boatwright said sounds like you know other women whove had it mary farney stared at her defensiveness giving way to pure anger so boatwright shrugged yeah said farney i had it too okay dr cruvic said it was dangerous for me to have another kid the way im built is that okay with you miss do i have your permission sure said boatwright mary farney shook a hand at her what do you know after chenise was born and they finally figured out she wouldnt be normal her father walked the hell out on me you have any kids miss no maam farneys smile was smug dont let her tell you she didnt know cause she did she signed consent its that little asshole getting her high convincing her they could be mommy and daddy like it was even his in the first place it wasnt said milo who knows thats the point and even if it was his so what he can read at secondgrade level maybe hes gonna take care of her and a baby can chenise read i said some whats her level pause i havent had her tested in a long while but she signed her name to the consent form said milo i told her what it was and she signed it ah farney put her hands on her hips do you have kids he shook his head no one has kids she said must be im the only one crazy enough what about you no i said she laughed can i smoke without waiting for an answer she pulled a package of virginia slims from her purse and lit up whens the last time chenises iq was tested i said who knows probably in school probably you think they tell me what they do all they do is file paper make files this thick spreading her arms two feet wide what was the last iq score you got for her i said what you dont think shes smart enough to understand let me tell you something im her mother and i say she can understand when i give her five bucks for the mall and she asks for ten she understands just fine when she comes home late and makes excuses she understands when darrell or some other punk says be ready at a certain time and shes there at the door early she understands okay only some things she dont understand okay like what said boatwright like how to clean her room like how to keep her pants on her laugh was brutal shes like a magnet for it since shes eleven the boys been sniffing around her she walks that walk winks an eye all these years i been talking myself blue trying to get her to see where that leads she just smiles sticks out her tit her chest like look what ive got im a woman so finally she went and proved she was no one said anything i love her okay before she got her period she was a sweet kid now all i do is worry about aids and stuff now theres one less thing to worry about another laugh maybe she should be in trouble with you guys maybe the best thing would be to lock her up cause i sure cant stop her from humping around and whos gonna help me when she humps herself straight to aids more silence you think she can raise a kid so i protected her the best way i knew how and she understood damn good you know what she told me once about men we were sitting in the car at a wendys or something and she gives this smile and i know its trouble i say what chenise and she says i like when men sweat mom i say oh yeah she says like when they sweat between their legs i nearly choked she was only thirteen then she says know why i like it mom i say why chenise and she takes a big deep breath gives a great big smile and says i like it cause it tastes good shortly after am chenise was released to her mothers morose custody a sheriffs van had come by to transport darrell ballitser to the county jail milo and boatwright and i watched a late replay of the eleven oclock news in the beverly hills station the antsy blond reading copy with a smug smile longshot of cruvic entering his bentley the spin beverly hills doctor fends off attack by crazed skinhead darrells rage fueled by the unauthorized sterilization of his girlfriend police are investigating a link between the attack and the unsolved murder of feminist psychologist dr hope devane reputed to have worked with dr cruvic now for an update on that driveby in east la milo turned off the set better get to work on that warrant before media leeches are camped out at ballitsers flop thanks angela any time she said you see ballitser for devane he admits going after cruvic but denies devane maybe cause cruvics an attempted assault and devanes homicide he does ride a bike yeah let me check out the bike his whole place maybe ill be able to tell more thanks again no problem she said apart from rich little assholes shotgunning their parents we dont get much excitement around here civic center drive was empty again the steel garage door sealed tight milo looked tired but walked fast i said at the risk of being repetitive what link could there be between darrell and mandy wright exactly and on the iq scale darrell makes kenny storm look like einstein so im not counting on this panning out and something else what i was telling you about club none a cocktail waitress who worked there also got killed four days before mandy was killed in vegas stabbed the same way no strangled in the alley four in the morning after closing girl named kathy dinapoli left behind the dumpster legs spread blouse ripped panties down but no sexual entry maybe it was a sex thing and the guy got interrupted or couldnt get it up or maybe someone was trying to make it look like a sex thing i know the mos different and that part of sunset has its share of crime but four days bartender couldnt say if kathy served mandy but she was on shift when he thinks he saw mandy so kathy could have been eliminated because she saw mandy with someone but then the fact that she was murdered first means the killer knew what he was going to do well before exactly he said a planner not darrell he laughed the clubs definitely not darrells venue were talking studs and studettes lots of hair and teeth on the other hand with what ive got so far id be laughed out of the das office trying to make a case for dinapoli as part of the package and we do have motive on the little schmuck plus he threatened cruvic with a knife same kind of knife used on hope and mandy it looked about the right size buck with a nice sharp edge but there are lots of those well see what the woundworms have to say hopefully the boys from central division got to darrells fleabag and secured it maybe somethingll come up there still want me to go to higginsville i said sure why not cause this sterilization things another one of those little boxes and id like to know why hope was ms control your own body in public but willing to serve as cruvics sterilization buddy what do you think did chenise know what they were doing to her maybe on some fuzzy level if she was told though with her intelligence true consent would be shaky and having her sign the consent form was sleazy because shes illiterate thanks mom even so i said was mrs farney evil in pushing through the procedure let the talking heads at the think tanks have fun with it like she said we dont have kids and shes the one living with chenises promiscuity theres no doubt cruvic and hope should have known better but there was plenty of incentive nine hundred bucks for the abortion nine more for the ligation plus hopes fee and other charges over two grand for an hours work not bad and he probably did several other procedures that night maybe the two of them were partners and hope was really getting a bigger cut serving as his backup for slicing up minors with all her book income she could have buried the payoffs and what if mandy was connected to it somehow i said maybe cruvic was her doctor and they got friendly maybe she brought him other patients call girls showgirls lots of potential abortions there lots of potential enemies so why was mandy killed she learned something she wasnt supposed to or she messed someone up but then again whyre she and hope dead and cruvics back home icing his hand i had no answer whatever the specifics i said weve got definite evidence that cruvic was skirting the rules maybe thats what got him kicked out of the u of washington so who knows what else hes done that might have made someone angry like what botching someone up someone smarter than darrell he and hope together and in some way mandy was part of it but the same hitch theyre dead and hes tell me did he look scared to you tonight no but maybe hes got too much selfesteem for his own good or he really doesnt realize theres someone out there waiting for the right time to pick him off the grand prize patient killer if youre right about kathy dinapoli i said very patient he pinched his lips between thumb and forefinger what i said the shape this is taking waiting stalking longterm plans those wounds goddamn choreography artichokes said the pump jockey idnt that castroville way over the hell up by monterey he was bowlegged and potbellied bald on top with a manilacolored braid and matching teeth chuckling he said artichokes again wiped the windshield and took my twenty id pulled off route for a fillup just past the grapevine where the traffic suddenly swells like a clogged hose and fiftycar pileups are the rule when the fog sets in this morning it was hot and hazy but visibility was okay i got back on the highway and continued north my map said higginsville was just west of bakersfield and due south of buena vista lake a hundred miles out of la and twenty degrees hotter the land was midwestflat green fields behind windbreaks of giant blue gum trees strawberries broccoli alfalfa lettuce all struggling to make it in the gasolinedrenched air a turn on a doublelane road took me up into highlands crowded with small ranches and shuttered roadside stands then down into a dry basin and a sign that read higginsville pop over a rusting rotary emblem the lettering was nearly rubbed out and the sheetmetal lemon on top was corroded i passed a short stand of live oak and crossed a siltfilled creek bed then a shutdown recreational vehicle lot and a halfcollapsed barn with a cracked western attire sign on the roof one empty lot later was a twoblock main drag called lemon boulevard filled with onestory buildings grocerycafe fiveanddime a bar a storefront church milo had called this morning and told me the local law was a sheriff named botula the sheriffs station was at the end of the street pink cinder block with an old green ford cruiser out in front inside a heavy pretty dishwaterblond girl who looked too young to vote sat behind a waisthigh counter facing a static switchboard and reading intently behind her a very darkskinned hispanic man in a khaki uniform bent over a metal desk a book was spread in front of him too he didnt look much older than the girl a bell over the door tinkled they both looked up and he stood to six feet he had unlined nutmeg skin and a wide aztec mouth his black hair was straight thin clipped at the sides neatly parted his eyes burnt almonds eager to observe dr delaware sheriff botula he came to the counter unlatched a swinging door and proffered a warm firm hand this is judy our deputy administrator and dispatcher the girl gave him a youvegottobekidding look and he grinned and also my wife judy botula she closed the book and came over i read the title on the cover fundamentals of evidence collection botula said come on in weve done a little prelim work in advance of your arrival judy has actually judy botula said nothing earthshattering he said were new to this place still acclimating i walked behind the counter and took a chair alongside the desk how new two months said botula were each halftime share the job a mop leaned against the wall and he put it behind a file cabinet the walls were clean and bare free of the usual wanted posters and bulletins and the floor was spotless though scarred judy brought her chair over and settled she was almost as tall as her husband with broad shoulders and a heavy bosom the extra weight as much muscle as fat she had on a white knit blouse jeans and running shoes and a badge on her belt her eyes were deep blue dramatic a bit disapproving we both graduated from the criminal justice program at fresno state she said we want to enter the fbi academy but its real competitive right now so we figured a year or so of experience wouldnt hurt not that its too exciting around here nice and quiet said her husband to say the least botula smiled gives us time to study so this murder case youve got we heard a little about it right after and then there was something on it today an arrest probably a false lead i said yeah thats what detective sturgis said a psychologist working on homicides is that getting more common down in la no sometimes i work with detective sturgis im pretty interested in psychology plan to hook up with the behavioral science unit once were in quantico ever do any serialkiller profiling no i said he nodded as if id said yes interesting stuff so what are you doing on this one trying to learn as much as i can about dr devane because she was a psychologist too mostly because we dont know much about her makes sense okay heres where we stand so far after we talked to detective sturgis we thought about the best way to dig something up and came up with a town records b school records and c interviewing the oldtimers but as it turns out all the old records were boxed and shipped up to sacramento ten years ago and we still havent been able to locate them and the schools closed down around the same time did something happen ten years ago yup the place died said judy as im sure you can see it used to be lemon groves a few locals but mostly seasonal migrant camps and the citrus companies who owned all the stores ten years ago a big frost wiped out the lemons and whatever was left was finished off by thrips or mites or something the migrants moved on the camps closed down and instead of replanting the companies bought land elsewhere the locals depended on the migrants so a bunch of them moved out too from what i can gather they tried some tourist things fruit stands whatever but it didnt last long too far off the interstate i passed a sign claiming twelve hundred people live here i said claim is right she said the signs an antique our rough count is three hundred and a good part of those are just parttimers who come up summers to fish over by the lake the permanents all have jobs elsewhere except for a few women who run the stores on lemon and their husbands have jobs elsewhere mostly theyre older so we dont have too many kids and whatever ones there are go to ford city for primary and middle then over to bakersfield high so no schools hope had gone to bakersfield for high school so even back then it had probably been a sleepy town in terms of oldtimers from when your victim was a kid most seemed to have died off but we did manage to find a lady who might have taught her when there was a school at least shes old enough might have i said botula said shes not exactly prime interview material he touched his temple maybe its good youre a psychologist judy said wed go with you but it would probably hurt instead of help youve had problems with her we went to see her yesterday said botula it wasnt what youd call productive thats putting it mildly judy frowned and returned to the switchboard it hadnt blinked since id entered botula walked me out judy thinks the reason the lady was hostile was the race thing our marriage you dont he looked up at the sun and put on shades i dont know what makes people do the things they do anyway the partys name is elsa campos and her place is just up blossom left at the next corner my surprised look made him smile when i said racial you assumed she was anglo i did yup he said logical but people are people the address is eight blossom but you dont need it youll know when youre there blossom lane had no sidewalks just brown weedy strips bordering ravaged road a few twiggy lemon trees grew by the curb dwarfed by gigantic silverdollar eucalyptus no treetrimming here either the north side of the street was houses the south dry field numbers through were cabin courts in various stages of disrepair elsa camposs house was larger a twostory redwood bungalow with a screen porch flanked by a pair of massive cedars the surrounding earth was crusted hardpan without a stitch of landscaping sevenfoothigh chain link surrounded the small property the beware of dog sign on the gate was made extraneous by the pack of twenty or so barking jumping mewling canines lined up behind the fence terriers spaniels a sleek red doberman mongrels of all shapes and sizes something huge and black and bearish that hung back and nosed the soil the noise was deafening but none of them looked mean on the contrary tails wagged tongues lolled and the smaller dogs leaped gaily and scratched at the fence i got out of the seville the racket intensified and some of the dogs ran back circled and charged at least two dozen all decently groomed and in good health but with that many animals there were limits to maintenance and i could smell the yard well before i got to the gate no bell no lock just a simple latch the dogs continued to bark and leap and several of them nuzzled the links i could see mounds of turd forming tiny hills on the bare yard but a tenfoot radius around the house had been cleared the rake marks still evident i offered my hand palm down to one of the spaniels and he licked it then a retriever mixs tongue shot through the fence and slurped my knuckle the doberman ambled over stared walked away other dogs began competing for tongue space and the gate rattled but the big black creature still held back as i wondered whether to enter the front door of the screen porch opened and an old woman in a pink sweatshirt and stretch jeans came out holding a broom the dogs whipped around and raced to her she said aw get a life but reached into her pocket and tossed handfuls of something onto the clean dirt find it the dogs scattered and began sniffing frantically around the yard the scene looked like an early warner brothers cartoon the old woman turned in my direction and came forward dragging the broom in the dirt hi i said hi it sounded like mimicry squinting she continued to inspect me five seven and thin she had black hair tied back in a waistlong braid sunken sallow cheeks that looked as dry as the dirt claw hands barbecued brown the nails thick and yellow the sweatshirt said reno white tennies bottomed sticklegs that gave the pants no incentive to stretch the big black dog came over now in a slow rolling gait so hairy its eyes were hidden by pelt its head reached her waist and its tongue was the size of a hotwater bottle forget it leopold the woman said in a sandy voice go work for treats like everyone else the dog cocked its head just the way spike does and looked up at her eyes wet with melodrama nope no way find it the massive head rubbed against her belt reminding me of something mrs greens bullmastiff this was my week for old women and big dogs a deep moan escaped from beneath the hairy mouth i could see hard muscle under black fur the woman looked around at the other dogs who were still searching reaching into a jeans pocket she brought out another handful nutmegcolored broken bits of dog biscuit find it she said flinging the dogs in the yard circled faster but the big black dog stayed put after another surreptitious glance the woman pulled a whole biscuit out and stuck it hurriedly into the beasts mouth okay leopold now get the black dog chewed contentedly then walked away slowly what is it some kind of sheepdog i said bouvier des flandres belgian can you believe someone abandoned it must be hot under all that coat she gave me a skeptical look theyre hardy protective too ive got a french bulldog i said a lot smaller but the same basic approach to life which is what im a star feed me her face stayed impassive french bulldog those are the little ones with the big ears never had one that your only one i nodded well ive got twentynine counting three sick ones inside rescues you bet some from pounds the rest i pick up driving around she sniffed the air pretty putrid time to spread the enzyme got this new chemical that eats up the poop so who are you and what do you want ive been told you used to teach school here ms campos who told you that sheriff botula and his she snorted those two what else did they tell you that im the town nut just that you might be able to help me find out some information on a woman who grew up here unfortunately shes been murdered and the la police have asked me to murdered who are we talking about hope devane that sucked the color out of her face she looked back at the dogs and when she turned to me again her expression was a mixture of innocence shattered and pessimism confirmed what happened to her when someone stabbed her in front of her house three months ago where la figures tell me did she turn out to be a doctor of some kind she was a psychologist thats almost the same thing she had plans to be a doctor i said she stared past me across the street at the dry empty field touching her cheeks with both hands she drew back the skin stretching it and for a moment i saw a younger woman murdered thats unbelievable any idea who did it no its a dead end so far thats why the police are trying to get as much background about her as they can so they asked you to come up here right you talk about the police in third person meaning youre not one of them or are you just pompous im a psychologist too ms campos sometimes i consult to the police got some proof of that i showed her my id she studied it and handed it back just wanted to make sure you werent a reporter i despise them because they once did a story on my dogs and painted me as a nut she touched her sharp chin little hope i dont claim to remember all my students but i remember her okay come on in she began walking to the house leaving me to open the gate for myself the bouvier had ambled nearly to the back of the property but as i turned the latch it wheeled around and raced toward me hes okay lee said elsa campos dont eat him yet i followed her up the porch and into a dim parlor crowded with cheap furniture and feed bowls shelves full of pottery and glass the smell of wet fur and antiseptics a cuckoo clock over the mantel looked more lake arrowhead than switzerland small room the kitchen was three steps away she told me to sit and headed in there on the counter sat a blowdryer several squeeze bottles of canine shampoo a microwave oven and a plastic dogcrate inside the crate was something small and white and still on top were glass ampules plasticcapped syringes rolls of bandages hey said elsa campos sticking a finger through the wire door the little dog stuck its tongue out and whimpered she cooed to it awhile little girl shih tzu one year old someone cracked her head with a stick paralyzed the rear quarters left her on a trash heap her legs got infected when i got her she was a bag of bones the pound was ready to gas her shell never be normal but well get her adjusted to the others leopold will see to that hes the alpha head dog of the pack hes good with weak things thats great i said suddenly thinking of milos heavy face black brows bright eyes slow movements something to drink no thanks i sank into a grayslipcovered easy chair feather cushions soft as warm tallow shifted to encompass me flanking the cuckoo clock were faded photos of nature scenes the curtains were brown chenille the overhead light fixture dusty bulbs in a tangle of yellowed staghorns she pulled a beer out of an old kelvinator fridge worried youre going to catch something because i run a zoo popping the top she drank well its a clean zoo i cant help the smell but just because i take in hurt animals why should it mean i want to live dirty no reason tell it to those two the botulas the botulas she said in that same mimicking tone monsieur and madame sherlock she laughed first week they got here they started driving around in that old car the county gives em as if they had something to do like dragnetyoure probably too young to remember that just the facts maam i said her smile was briefer than an eyeblink what kind of facts are you going to have here the weeds grew another two inches send samples to the fbi she sipped more beer what a pair driving up and down up and down up and down first week they passed by here saw my herd playing out front stopped got out started rattling the gate needless to say the herd got excited i had a golden with three legs back then really liked to bark what a symphony smiling again i came out to see what the ruckus was all about there they were trying to count heads write it down then she looks me up and down and he starts reciting the health code more than such and such in one place means you need a kennel license i laughed and went inside had nothing to do with them since theyll be gone soon enough just like the others how many others have there been lost count county sends them over from fresno to serve a year in oblivion no action no mcdonalds no cable tv drives them crazy and theyre out of here first thing she laughed then turned serious the fiftychannel generation god help the animals and everyone else when they take over she peered inside the crate dont you worry baby soon youll be running with the best of them she shook her head and her braid swung can you imagine anyone wanting to hurt something so harmless no i said its about as unthinkable as murder straightening she rested her hand on the counter put her beer down and picked up an ampule of medicine after reading the label she put it down and came into the parlor taking a ragged cane chair she sat planting her heels on the linoleum floor hope murdered do you know what the greeks did to badnews messengers she ran a finger across her throat hope youre not greek i said she grinned lucky for you no i used to teach all my classes about the greeks but not in the usual way not that they were cultured and noble and had great mythology and started the olympics i used them to make the point that you can be cultured and outwardly noble and still do immoral things because they pretty much brutalized everyone they came into contact with just as bad as the romans they dont teach morality anymore in schools except how to have sex without dying from it which i guess is okay because what chance do you have to do any good in the world if youre six feet under but they should also look at other things what do you expect to learn from me something about hopes background that might help explain her death why would her background explain anything her black eyes were locked into mine sharp as a falcons theres some indication she might have been abused as an adult sometimes thats related to abuse as a child abused how physically pushed around bruised was she married yes to whom a history professor quite a few years older is he the one who abused her we dont know is he a suspect in the murder no i said no or not yet hard to say theres no evidence against him a professor and a psychologist she said closing her eyes as if trying to picture it hope was a professor too i said shed become pretty prominent as a researcher what did she research the psychology of women sexroles selfcontrol the last phrase made her flinch and i wondered why i see tell me exactly how she was killed i summed up the stabbing and told her about hopes book the publicity tour sounds like she was more than prominent sounds like she was downright famous during the last year she was her head moved back an inch and the black eyes got narrow i felt like corn surveyed by a crow so what does her childhood have to do with it she said were clutching at straws youre one of them she stared at me some more famous thats what i get for not reading the papers or watching the idiot box stopped both years ago interesting what is her getting famous when i first got her as a student she was shy didnt even like to read out loud do you have a picture of her as an adult no too bad would have loved to see it was she attractive very as i described hope her eyes softened she was a beautiful kid i cant stop thinking of her as a kid little blondie her hair was almost white past her waist with curls at the end big brown eyes i showed her how to do all the braids and twists with her hair gave her a book with diagrams for a graduation gift sixthgrade graduation she nodded absently the cuckoo shot out of the clock and beeped once medicine time she said standing got two others in the bedroom even worse than the shih tzu collie hit by a truck out on route five and a partbeagle choked unconscious and left in a field to die she went to the kitchen filled two syringes disappeared through a rear door i sat in the dim room until she came back looking grim problems i said im still thinking about hope all these years i havent thought much about her assumed she was fine but now her face is right here tapping her nose thank you for brightening an old womans day you assumed she was fine i said meaning you worried she might not be she sat down and laughed you are a psychologist her eyes drifted to the clock and stayed there for a while i said you dont remember all your students but you do remember her what made her stand out her intelligence i taught for fortyeight years and she had to be one of the smartest kids i ever had maybe the smartest grasped things immediately and a hard worker too some of the gifted arent as im sure you know rest on their laurels think the worlds lining up for them but hope was a good little worker and not because of her home environment the skin around the black eyes tightened no i said no she said but this time it wasnt mimicry not because despite she got up again sure you dont want a drink something soft thanks swinging the fridge open she took out another beer and a can of orange soda this okay sure popping both tops she sat down and immediately started tapping her feet then she straightened a slipcover pulled her braid forward unraveled it and began to retie you need to understand something she said things were different back then she looked down at her feet kicked aside a pink plastic feed bowl hope came here with her mother when she was just a baby i never saw any father the mother said he was some kind of sailor died at sea this professor husband what makes you think he beat her we dont know that he did its just a possibility whys it a possibility because husbands are usually the ones who do that does he have a raw temper dont know i lied why ive had two husbands and neither would classify as brutal but both had their tempers and there were times i was afraid how much older is he than hope fifteen years why do you ask the beer can rose to her lips and she took a long time drinking she was always mature for her age where did hope and her mother come from i said she shook her head and took a longer swallow i tried the orange soda it tasted like candy mixed with cleaning solvent i tried to produce saliva to wash away the taste but my mouth was dry the mothers name was charlotte everyone called her lottie she and the child just showed up one day with one of the migrant picking crews lottie was nicelooking but she had the face of an okie so maybe she was one or maybe she just had okie heritage know anything about the okies i nodded where are your folks from missouri she thought about that well lottie seemed like pure okie to me pretty like i said but skinny rawboned twangy accent not much education i know its a derogatory term now but im too old to start worrying about shifts of the wind back then they seemed fine being called okies so theyre still okies to me my own familys part californio but ive been called everything from tacobender to greaser and ive survived know who the californios were the original settlers from mexico the original settlers after the indians before the new englanders came out west to find gold ive got both in me tamales and boiled supper but i dont exactly look like dar so ive been getting wetback comments my whole life i learned to close my ears and go about my business lottie devane was an okie two more swallows and the beer was gone she was quite a nicelooking girl slim figure good bust legs but shed seen some wear and she could walk make it look like a dance step natural blond too not the platinum stuff she started using a month after she got here wanting to match hope more of a honey blond she favored blue eye shadow and false eyelashes and red lipstick and tight dresses everyone wanted to be marilyn monroe back then whether it was realistic or not she looked away the thing with lottie was she came with the picking crew but she never went out to pick despite that she managed to pay rent on a tworoom cabin over on citrus street she hooked a finger thats three blocks over we used to call it rind street cause the migrants took the oversoft fruit home to make lemonade and the gutters were full of skin and pulp rows of cabins shacks communal bathrooms thats where lottie and hope lived except soon they got upgraded to a double cabin when lottie was in town she tended to stay indoors was she gone a lot she shrugged she used to take day trips where no car she used to hitch probably up to bakersfield maybe all the way to fresno cause she came back with nice things later she bought herself a car nice things i said the skin around the black eyes tightened my second husband was assistant general manager for one of the lemon companies knew everything about everyone he said when lottie hitched she stood by the side of the road and lifted her skirt way up she and hope lived here until hope was fourteen then they moved up to bakersfield hope told me it was so she could go to high school close to home all those years of paying the rent without picking i said like i said she knew how to walk are we talking a steady lover or business she stared at me why does everything nowadays have to be so overt id like to bring back information not hints mrs campos well i cant see how this kind of information can help you yes she took money from men how much i dont know was it official or did she just lead them to understand they should leave her something under the pillow i cant tell you that either because i minded my own business sometimes she went away for a few days at a time and came back with lots of new dresses was it more than just a shopping trip she shrugged what i will say is she always brought clothes for hope too quality things she liked dressing the child up other kids would be running around in jeans and tshirts and little hope would have on a pretty starched dress and hope took care of her things too never got dirty or mixed in with rough stuff she tended to stay inside the cabin reading practicing her penmanship she learned to read at five always loved it was there any indication hope knew what her mother did she shrugged and passed her beer can from one hand to the other did hope ever talk to you about it mrs campos i wasnt her psychologist just her teacher more kids talk to teachers than to psychologists she put the can down and her arms snapped across her chest like luggage straps no she never talked to me about it but everyone knew and she wasnt stupid i always thought shame was why she kept to herself did you see her after she moved to bakersfield the arms tightened a year after she came back to visit shed won an award wanted to show it to me what kind of award scholastic achievement sponsored by a stockandfeed company big ceremony at the kern county fair she sent me an invitation but i had the flu so she came two days later with photos she and a boy student smartest girl smartest boy she kept trying to tell me i deserved the award for teaching her so much wanted to give me the trophy mature sentiment for a teenager i told you she was always mature it was a oneroom school and with most of the older kids out working the crop it was easy to give her lots of personal attention all i did was keep supplying her with new books she chewed up information like a combine springing up she left the parlor without explanation and disappeared in the back of the house again i went over to the battered shih tzus crate and wiggled a finger through the mesh door the little dog showed me pleading eyes its breathing was rapid hey cutie i whispered heal up shaggy white ears managed to twitch i put a finger through the grate and stroked silky white fur here said elsa campos behind me she was holding a small goldplated trophy brass cup on a walnut base the metal spotted and in need of polishing as she thrust it at me i read the base plate the brookehastings awardfor academic excellencepresented tohope alice devanesenior girls division brookehastings i said that was the stock company i gave her back the trophy and she placed it on an end table we sat down again she insisted i take it after my second husband died i put things away had it in a closet forgot about it til just now did hope talk about anything else we discussed where she should go to college what she should major in i told her berkeley was as good as any ivy league school and it was cheap i never found out if she listened to me she did got a phd there i said and that brought a smile to her face i was already taking dogs in and we talked about that too the virtue of caring she was interested in life sciences i thought she might very well become a doctor or a veterinarian psychologist that fits too she began playing with her braid want another soda no thanks no more beer for me or youll think im an old wetback rummy anyway she was a polite girl very wellgroomed used beautiful language this was a tough town but she never seemed part of it as if she was just visiting in some ways that applied to lottie too even with her behavior she carried herself above it all hope also told me what lottie was doing in bakersfield dancing you know the kind i mean dont make me spell it out place called the blue barn one of those cowboy joints they used to have a whole row of them as you left the city out past the stockyards and the rendering plants pigbars they called them countryandwestern plus bumpandgrind for the white boys mariachi plus bumpandgrind for the mexicans lots of girls dancing sitting on laps et cetera my second husband went there a few times til i found out and set him straight the blue barn i said dont bother looking for it it closed down years ago owned by some immigrant gangster who dealt cattle with questionable brands he opened the clubs during the sixties when the hippies made it okay to take off your clothes raked in a fortune then he shut everything and moved to san francisco why probably because you could get away with even more up there when was this she thought the seventies i heard he made dirty movies too and he was lotties boss if you call that working must have been hard for hope she cried when she told me and not just about the kinds of things lottie was doing for a living but because she thought lottie was doing them for her as if the woman would have been taking shorthand except for having a child lets face it some women are not going to take the time to learn a real skill if they can get by with something else the first day lottie arrived in higginsville she went into her cabin and came out that night wearing a tight red dress that advertised her did she move to san francisco with the club owner i wouldnt know but why would he take her with all the young hippie girls running around by then shed have been too old for his type of business what was his name kruvinski polish or yugoslavian or czechoslovakian or something they said hed been a foreign general during world war two brought money out of europe came to california and started buying up land why hope worked with a doctor named milan cruvic well then she said smiling looks like youve got yourself a clue because milan was kruvinskis first name too but everyone called him micky big micky kruvinski big this way she touched her waist not that he was short but it was his thickness you noticed thick all over big thick neck thick waist thick lips once when i went up to bakersfield with my second husband we ran into him eating breakfast big smile nice dry handshake youd never know but joe my husband warned me away from him said you have no idea ellie what this joker does how olds dr cruvic around hopes age then it would have to be the son because big micky only had one kid little micky he and hope were in the same class at bakersfield high in fact he was the boy who won the brookehastings award with hope everyone suspected a putup but if he became a doctor maybe he was genuinely smart whyd they suspect a putup because big micky owned the brookehastings company and the biggest slaughterhouse in town and packing plants vending machines a gas station farm acreage all that on top of the clubs the man just kept buying things up is he still alive dont know i stay away from the city sit right here and mind my own business she picked up the trophy and tapped it with a fingernail the plating was cheap and bits of gold flaked off and floated to the ground joe my husband was a smoker four packs a day so eventually he got emphysema the day hope came to visit he was in the rear bedroom on oxygen after she left i went in and showed him the trophy and the article and he burst out laughing wheezing so hard he nearly passed out i said whats funny and he said guess who won the boys big mickys kid then he laughed some more and said guess the tramp worked overtime to help her daughter it made me feel rotten here i was feeling proud of my teaching and he popped a big balloon in my face but i didnt say anything because how can you argue with a man in that condition also i suspected there might be some truth to it because i knew what lottie was like still hope was gifted and ill bet she earned it what kind of doctor did little micky become gynecologist poking women guess the apple doesnt fall far and hope worked with him why he does fertility work i said told us hope counseled patients fertility she said that is a laugh why big mickys son helping get life going is he a decent man i dont know it would be nice if he was decent both he and hope managing to get past their origins helping nurture life instead of ending it the way his father did big micky killed people that could very well be but what im talking about is the way he finished those girls off spiritually just used them up she squeezed her hands together and his way with animals thats always the tipoff his slaughterhouse was a big gray place with rail tracks running in and out theyd ride livestock in on one end crammed into rail cars thrashing and moaning and out the other side would come butchered sides hanging from hooks i saw it personally because joe was kind enough to drive by there once after wed gone into town for dinner his idea of funny here we were just finished a nice meal and he drives over there she licked her lips as if trying to get rid of a bad taste it was late at night but the place was still going fullguns you could hear it and smell it from a mile away i was furious demanded joe turn right around he did but not before telling me about big micky and how he liked coming down there personally around midnight putting on a rubber apron and boots and grabbing himself a studded baseball bat the workers would stop the line hoist up some steers and porkers and let him have a go at them for as long as he wanted she shuddered joe said it was big mickys idea of fun trudging to the kitchen she checked the shih tzu again hope and little micky after all these years smartest boy smartest girl hope consulted to a lawyer named robert barone never heard of him how about these names casey locking headshake amanda or mandy wright no who are they people hope knew being famous she must have known lots of people thats part of the problem her book was controversial for all we know she was stalked and killed by a stranger because of it controversial in what way i told her and youre saying this was a bestseller yes im embarrassed not to know about it bending she peered into the crate i said did hope talk about anything else the day she visited shed countered several direct questions by changing the subject and i expected her to do it again instead she came back sat and looked right at me she told me lottie tied her up her lip trembled i sat there shrinkcalm my heart raced when i said why when she was little and lottie had to leave her alone for long stretches also when lottie brought men home tied her up how in her room to her bed the headboard remember i said it was a tworoom cabin one was hopes bedroom the other lotties lottie used a dog leash and a bicycle lock fastened it to the headboard locked her in how long did this go on years i never knew hope never complained thank god there was never a fire when hope told me i was outraged but she kept telling me it was okay there was no abuse lottie always left her plenty of food and drinks toys books a radio a potty later a tv hope didnt seem the least bit angry talking about it kept telling me it was okay lottie had been doing what she thought was best then whyd she bring it up she said she was worried about lottie the things lottie had done to support the two of them the things lottie was still allowing men to do to her lottie was still bringing men home guys she met at the blue barn and other places regulars hope called them she and lottie had moved into a nicesized house in bakersfield by then and the arrangement was that lottie would hang one of those privacy tags you get at a hotel from her bedroom doorknob when she was working hope was always supposed to come in through the kitchen door check the knob if the sign was hanging she had to go straight to her room and stay there til lottie told her the coast was clear more confinement she nodded even so she could sometimes hear what was going on rubbing her eyes she said and i mean besides sex screams sometimes there were marks on lottie bruises and rope burns on her wrists and ankles lottie used makeup to cover them but hope saw them anyway so lottie was getting tied up herself can you imagine thats what i meant by despite her home life did hope talk to her mother about it she said no as if it were a ridiculous question of course not mrs campos shes my mother but she talked about it openly yes but then she cut it off i think she really wanted to unload all the way but just couldnt i never saw her again again she looked at the cuckoo clock what was her demeanor when she told you all this i said calm except when she cried about lottie worried about lottie getting hurt by a customer she rationalized what lottie did by saying she had no education and skills and she was just trying to support the two of them the best way she knew how so what could i say to that face it child mommas a tramp i knew she had to be hurting still a prisoner in her own home can you see bringing friends home to a place like that i tried to get her to talk about her feelings but she wouldnt go for it poor kid yes but to look at her youd never know it beautiful poised perfect hair the right amount of makeup and lottie was obviously still spending on her clothes silk blouse nice wool suit nylons pumps she couldve passed for twenty a young lady and she made a point of telling me she was getting straight as at bakersfield honor society every semester school was probably the only place she felt free i said realizing how far hope really had come getting past the fear and the shame and the isolation only to lose her life on a dark empty street i felt a tightening in my chest at the back of my throat probably she said thats how i rationalized it rationalized what not doing anything not reporting it no matter how good she looked she was still a minor in a bad environment and i was the one she confided in but i told myself shed found her niche why upset the cart and things were different back then whats to say if i had come forth she wouldnt have denied it or that anyone would have listened to me because lottie worked for big micky and he was wellconnected with the powers that be if lottie asked him to help her out what was the chance of bucking that was there any indication he was lotties pimp or her lover she glared as if id finally given her an excuse to be angry i told you before i dont know those kinds of details did hope talk about big micky no the only one she talked about was lottie then as i said she cut it off changed the subject i got the feeling the visit had been an experiment for her how far was she ready to go and i hadnt encouraged her enough i lost a lot of sleep over it dr delaware thinking about that poor child tied up what i should do then with all the hurt things i was taking care of i managed to forget about it until you showed up another glance at the cuckoo and thats all i know she said rising and walking quickly to the door she pushed it open and stepped out onto the porch and a tide of canine noise rose by the time i reached her she was out in the yard surrounded by the dogs leopold the bouvier watched me imperiously i thought of hopes rottweiler unable to protect her probably poisoned hope transforming herself from prisoner to guardian of other womens rights but no one had ever protected her elsa campos continued to the front gate if you find out who murdered her would you take the time to tell me yes you mean it because i dont want to wait for nothing i promise all right then im going to force myself out of here take a drive up to the bakersfield library see if i can find her book not too many kids from here become famous the last word came out strangled suddenly tears were dripping down her weathered cheeks she wiped them with her sleeve goodbye she said i dont know whether to thank you or punch you goodbye thanks for your time i started to go and she said when all this comes out ill be the idiot teacher who didnt report it no reason for it to come out no youre here because you think it relates to her murder it may end up having nothing to do with it she gave a short hard laugh do you know how she rationalized it being tied up she said it had made her stronger taught her how to concentrate i said please child its one thing not to complain but dont tell me it was for your own good she just smiled at me put a hand on my shoulder as if she were the teacher as if she pitied me for not understanding i still remember what she said really mrs campos its no big deal i turned it to my own advantage i taught myself selfcontrol i covered the thirty miles to bakersfield in twentyfive minutes but when i arrived i knew it had been a waste of gas how long since id been up here at least a decade the city had maintained some of its country flavor westernwear outlets cowboy bars too new and flashy to be the skin joints elsa campos had described but it was a big city now any city steadily homogenized by walmarts and fastfood stands the cold clean comfort of franchise no one i spoke to knew anything about the brookehastings company but when i mentioned the slaughterhouses to an old man working the counter of a burger king he gave me a suspicious look and directions the northern edge of the city melting gradually back to agriculture segments of the railroad track were there fragmented like discarded playthings so was the building huge gray so ugly it was hard to believe anyone had actually designed it square holes where the few windows had been no roof the brookehastings sign painted in white had eroded to wisps other signs pure pork sausage livestock and feed prime meat a high barbedwire fence surrounded the concrete corpse acres of fields in all directions were planted in tomatoes and corn stooplaborers scuttled through the fastidious rows one saw me and smiled a mexican woman still on her knees swaddled in layers of clothing despite the heat hands so dusty they looked like clay models fear in her eyes as she took in my face and clothes the sevilles polished grille i headed back to la selfcontrol years later hope had reduced it to an academic paper a prostitutes child it wouldnt play at the faculty club if seacrest knew it was obvious why hed want to minimize her family history little micky little hope smartest boy smartest girl ceremony at the county fair smiles flashbulbs h banners brass bands i could almost smell the corn dogs and horse dung a little girl imprisoned a teenage honor student listening to her mother scream nightly seeing the bruises cruvic smelling the slaughterhouse stench on his father the two of them bonded by good grades and high aspirations the strain for respectability highschool pals maybe sweethearts collaborating on fertility abortion sterilization control big micky moving to san francisco getting into racier clubs producing porn robert barone the lawyer did pornography defense from his san francisco office hope consulted to him too fertility termination what else grownup h projects a new slant on animal husbandry id done h my thirteenth summer raising angora rabbits for fur because it meant shearing not slaughtering my teacher had been a pretty blackhaired farmers wife serious with rough hands mrs dehmers susan dehmers shed sat me down the first week dont get attached to them anyway alexander you wont be living with them forever i pictured big micky and his bat the packaging and selling of women as meat his son leaving surgical residency after only one year leave of absence at the brookehastings institute nice little injoke had hope laughed i got back just after five the house was empty and robin had left a typed note on the diningroom table darling hope your trip went well a big bargain on some old tyrolean maple came up out in saugus and then ive got to deliver some instruments to the hotsound studio in hollywood spike and i will try to be back by but it could be later herere the numbers ill be at if you havent eaten check out the fridge milo called love you inside the fridge was a hero sandwich cut into six segments as i phoned milo at the station i chewed on one wondering how the thing had gotten its name milo was on another line and i held and got a beer when he got on i said i know now why control was such a big issue for her when i finished he said nothing like mother love very softly listening through the walls you think mama got her involved with clients beyond listening who knows tied up for her own good jesus she convinced herself it was for her own good milo grew up and reverted to what she knew bound and hurt so who bruised her seacrest or cruvic or some boyfriend hell why not locking why not i said talk to cruvic today no hes avoiding me bigtime answering machine at the place on mulholland the house is his but he rents doesnt own and when i called his office old nurse anna came on real cold and referred me to his lawyer guess who robert barone bing you get the washerdryer howd you know big micky was a porn merchant in san francisco from that to mysonthedoctor he said how does he spell his last name i told him ill see what sf knows about him i did find out about that hospital in carson where sonny went after leaving seattle one of those forprofit chains ran into financial problems and sold out to a bigger chain the comptroller said fidelity was one of their less profitable outlets so it got canned couldnt pin him down but my impression was it hadnt exactly been the mayo clinic so youre right about it being a comedown for little micky the burrowing bastard the incident with ballitser put him in the public eye i said and hes got lots of things he doesnt want scrutinized the way he practices medicine his checkered academic history gangster heritage and maybe hopes murder anything turn up at darrell ballitsers place dope meth thats probably what got him hyped up but absolutely nothing to tie him to hope so unless he confesses kasanjian will be able to get him out on bail and if cruvic keeps low the da probably wont be interested in prosecuting the attempted battery which doesnt bother me i never saw darrell as mr stalker herr doktor cruvics looking better and better for that its the best explanation for her being dead and his walking around something real bad must have happened that hope wanted no part of cruvic was worried shed squawk so he quieted her and mandy wright i said who cruvic could easily have met through daddys business you got it club nones exactly the kind of place a gangsters kid would hang and mandy just may turn out to be the wedge that pries the shithead out from behind barones custom suit because vegas came through bless their souls and located ted barnaby the boyfriend still dealing blackjack but not in nevada right here in palm springs one of those indianreservation casinos im heading out soon as i clear some paper gonna do a surprise shake and see what tumbles out want company no plans tonight robins out for the evening were you planning to stay over nah no reason to i dont golf or tan rick took the explorer so ive got the porsche which means an hour and a quarter each way and who the hells gonna give me a speeding ticket la to palm springs is miles of a single monster interstate the the first half of the trip takes you through downtown boyle heights and the eastern exurbs azusa claremont upland rancho cucamonga and into san bernardino county where the air varies from sweet to toxic depending on wind and gods whim and the view from the freeway is a lulling homogeny of marts and malls and car lots and the kind of housing youd expect to find hugging the freeway then comes agriculture and rail yards near fontana and just after yucaipa most of the traffic drops off and the air gets dry and healthy by the time you pass the cherry groves of beaumont youre rolling through a platter of gray dirt and white rock joshua trees and mesquite the san bernardino mountains off to the right capped with snow the empty roads an invitation to speed and most people rsvp yes during spring break golden kids tank up on beer and weed and delusions of immortality whooping and highfiving on truck beds hanging over the sides of little convertibles flashing sexual greetings most make it to downtown palm springs some end up roadkill the highway patrol stays furtive and watchful and does its best to keep the death toll within acceptable limits milo got stopped only once just before the san gorgonio pass well after darkness had set in hed pushed ninety since riverside the porsche barely working its a white five years old in perfect condition and the young chp officer looked at it with admiration then inspected milos credentials blinking only once when milo said he was working a homicide case and he needed to catch a material witness by surprise handing back the papers the chippie recited a warning about nuts on the road and the need to keep an eye out detective then he watched as we rolled out we cruised into palm springs at pm passing block after block of lowrent condos and entering the outer edges of the business district unlike bakersfield here little had changed the same seedy mix of secondhand shops posing as antique dealers motels whitebelt clothing boutiques dreadful art all the big money was in palm desert and rancho mirage along with the streets named after dinah shore and bob hope look for palm grove way said milo the sun palace casino this doesnt look like an indian reservation whatd you expect tepees and totem poles these are the lucky indians booted into the desert but their patch just happened to leak shiny black stuff so they got rich learned about loopholes figured they were a nation to themselves and sued for the right to run games the state finally gave em bingo but remained pennyante about the immorality of gambling then the state started running the lottery i said so that argument became a little inconsistent exactly indians all around the state are catching on theres a new casino up in santa ynez state continues to screw around taking its sweet time to grant permits not allowing the indians to manufacture slot machines or bring them in from outofstate which is a big deal because slots are the number one moneymakers so they smuggle the suckers in on produce trucks and once theyre on the reservation nothing anyone can do about it detective i said sounds like youre condoning lawbreaking theres laws and theres laws palm grove i said pointing to the next block he turned left onto another commercial street more motels a laundromat a rundown spa fastfood joints crowded with people soaking up grease and the hot night air then up ahead bright blinking turquoise and yellow lights in the shape of a cowboy hat crowning a fiftyfoot tower tasteful huh so all of downtowns a reservation i said nope it varies from lot to lot the key is to search land records find some square footage once owned by an indian go into partnership here we are he zipped into the massive dirt parking lot surrounding the casino behind the hat tower was a surprisingly small onestory building trimmed with more blue and yellow lights and huge upslanting letters that shouted sun palace in orange neon surrounded by radiating fingers of scarlet between the tower and the building was a brightly lit car dropoff a brandnew purple camaro was parked up against the building a pink ribbon wrapped around its hood the sign on the windshield said four blackjacks in a row wins this car another sign leaning against the hat tower promised valet parking but no one was around and milo found a space in the lot just as we got out a husky brownskinned boy in a white polo shirt and black slacks trotted toward us hey i woulda taken that for you hand out milo showed him a badge i woulda joined the beatles if my name was mccartney the valets mouth closed he stared for a second then ran to open the doors of a urineyellow boatsized cadillac full of laughing sunbroiled silverhaired optimists we walked through the casinos glass double doors and into a wall of noise just as a very tall man in johnny cash black stumbled out behind him was a fourhundredpound woman in a flowered sundress and beach sandals she looked ready to deliver a speech and he kept well ahead of her the doors closed behind us locking in the noise and eyesearing fluorescence we were on a small elevated brassrailed platform covered with bluegreen industrial carpeting and sectioned by arbitrary columns of polished mahogany steps on both sides led down to the playing room one single space a hundred by fifty more aqua carpeting and columns under acousticaltile ceiling white walls no windows no clocks to the right was a single studpoker game hunched men in plaid shirts and windbreakers blacklensed sunshades paralyzed faces then row after row of slots maybe ten dozen machines rolling beeping blinking looking more organic than the people who cranked their handles the blackjack tables took up the left side of the room crammed together so you had to either sit or keep circulating dealers in deep red polo shirts and white name tags stood backtoback laying down patter scooping up ante chips sliding cards out of the shoe bings and buzzers nicotine air cashin window at the rear of the room but this early no one wanted out the players were a mixture of desert retirees japanese tourists bluecollar workers bikers indians and a few dissolute lounge bugs trying to look sharp in fused suits and longcollar shirts everyone pretending winning was a habit pretending this was vegas perfectbodylessthanperfectface girls in white microdresses walked around balancing drink trays big men dressed in white and black like the valet patrolled the room scanning like cameras their holstered guns eloquent someone moved toward us from a corner of the platform then stopped a grayhaired graymustachioed man in a gray sharkskin suit and red crepe tie fiftyfive or so with a long loose face and pursestring lips walkietalkie in one hand hairtonic tracks in his pompadour he pretended to ignore us didnt move but some sort of signal must have been sent because two of the armed guards strolled over and stood beneath the platform one was an indian one a freckled redhead both had thick arms swaybacks hard potbellies the indians belt was tooled with red letters garrett people came in and out of the building in a steady flow milo moved closer to the brass rail and the graymustachioed man came over as garrett turned and watched can i help you gentlemen deep flat voice the name tag computerprinted larry giovanne manager milo showed his id in a cupped hand ted barnaby giovanne didnt react the id went back in milos pocket barnabys working tonight right is he in trouble no just some questions hes new started two weeks ago wednesday said milo giovanne looked up taking in milos face then down to the green poly shirt hanging over tan chinos looking for the gunbulge no problems he said none wheres barnaby did you check in with the tribal police no then technically you have no jurisdiction milo smiled technically i can walk around the room til i find barnaby sit down at his table play real slow keep spilling my drink ask stupid questions keep following him when he moves tables giovanne gave a tiny headshake what do you want with him his girlfriend was murdered half a year ago hes not a suspect but i want to ask him a few questions were new too said giovanne three months since we opened and we dont want to break up the flow if you know what i mean okay said milo how about this send him out when he goes on break and ill stay out of the way giovanne shot french cuffs and looked at a gold watch the dealers do thirtyminute shifts at each table barnabys set to change in five break in an hour if you dont cause problems ill give him his break early fair enough more than fair thanks five minutes then want to play in the meantime milo smiled not tonight okay then go outside over by the camaro and ill send him out to you how bout some drinks peanuts no thanks give any cars away lately three so far after youre finished with him come back and try your luck if i had some id try it whats your game cops and robbers said milo a microdress girl brought out two beers anyway and we drank them standing against the cool block wall of the casino waiting behind the purple car watching the inandout able to feel and hear the gambling inside the outdoor lot seemed to stretch for miles bleeding into black space and starpainted sky motor drone and headlights defined a distant road but for the most part all the movement was here just as we emptied our glasses a tall thin redshirted man came out and looked from side to side long fingers curling and straightening barely thirty with thick blond hair he wore flintcolored bullhide boots under his pressed black slacks thin but knotted arms a turquoiseandsilver bracelet circled a hairless wrist and a gold chain seemed to constrict a long neck with a kinetic adams apple handsome features but his skin was a ruin so acnescarred it made milos look polished a couple of active blemishes stood out in the light most conspicuously an angry swelling on his right temple small round bandaid under his left ear deep pits ran down his neck milo put his glass down and came out from behind the car mr barnaby barnaby stiffened and his hands closed into fists milos id in his face made him step back milo extended a hand and barnaby took it with the reluctance of a man with wet palms milo started to draw him out of the light but barnaby resisted then he saw the valet approaching and came along back at the purple car he looked at me and the glass in my hand what the hell is this all about you just got me fired mandy wright hazel eyes stopped moving what do the la cops have to do with that milo put a foot on the camaros bumper careful said barnaby thats new so youre not too tornup over mandy sure im tornup but what am i supposed to do about it after all this time and why should i get fired over it ill talk to giovanne gee thanks shit whyd you have to come here why couldnt you just call me at home whyd giovanne boot you he didnt but he gave me the look i know the look theyre bending over backward not to have problems and you just made me a problem he touched the bandaid pressed down winced damn

why would i avoid him how do you know he was a customer i dont im guessing but what else working girls get messed up all the time whom i telling you know occupational risk i warned her shed been roughed up before a mark here and there nothing serious until he touched the bandaid again rubbed his pitted neck any idea who roughed her up before nah she never gave me names that was our

always go after hookers frowning which is what mandy was even though she thought of herself as an actress she tell you she was an actress yeah but halfkidding barnaby looked down at the pavement

of people saw me i didnt even find out about her being killed until the next day when i called her and some cop picked up the phone they asked me to drive over to the station then they asked me to go to the morgue and identify her did she work anywhere else but her apartment probably probably if she picked up some player and he had a room in the casino they probably went upstairs if okay when she ever work the street yeah right she was a hardup twobit hooker any idea why she was killed out on the street probably walking the john out and he freaked did she make a habit of walking johns out how would i know you asked me to guess im guessing you never dropped in on her during working hours yeah right and piss her off grandly so she laid down the rules she was the star man faint smile one time when we were she was in a good mood she said i know youre bugged by what i do teddy but try to get past it its no big deal just acting right i said and the oscar goes to and she laughed and said exactly they should give an oscar for what i do best supporting actress with her legs spread i it that bugged me i didnt like hearing it but she thought it was funny laughed like crazy when did she

you went along with her laughed with her things were cool and when you didnt she shut you out so she got sterilized before you met her meaning over a year ago i met her a year and a half before she died and it was before that did she say where she had the operation seconds hesitation no she ever mention the name of the doctor no what ted she never mentioned the name she tell you something else about him no but i saw him where the casino when maybe a month before before she was killed yeah tell me about it why is he some kind of milo held a big hand up tell me ted okay okay i was working and saw her doing her thing slinking around in a little black halter dress her hair up fake diamond earrings he closed his eyes for a second preserving the image opened them tugged at his red shirt i tried to catch her eye so i could maybe get to see her later she gave a big smile then i saw she was smiling past me not at me at someone else the doctor said milo i didnt know he was a doctor later she told me he was she walked right past my table he was at another dollar table big pile of chips she said hi to him and some other guy hugs and kisses like old friends he collected his chips and they all walked off next day i told her nice of you to say hi she said dont get touchy i go way back with the guy hes the doctor who fixed me i owe him whatd she owe him for maybe he did it for free who knows a trade barnaby shrugged what did he look like said milo nothing special thirtyfive forty short but big here touching a shoulder like a gym rat short hair almost skinned kind of jap eyes good threads suit tie the works and the other one what other one you said there was another guy yeah but he was old no big deal sicklooking yellow skin in a wheelchair the doctor was pushing him around maybe he was a bigbucks patient having a last fling you see that all the time in vegas totally fucked up people paraplegics people on air tanks losers with no legs getting pushed around the casino with cups full of chips like a last fling you know what else did mandy say about them she didnt say nothing at all about the old guy and the doctor just that he fixed her and she owed him yeah is he some wacko no said milo hes a hero barnaby looked confused milo said anything else you can think of nope okay thanks yeah youre welcome the address on vista chino your current one yeah whats the address of the place youre leasing whats the diff you got me busted i cant take it now just in case barnaby recited some numbers and a street stuffing his hands in his pockets he started to walk off want me to talk to giovanne said milo it wont do any good suit yourself barnaby stopped hey you wanna do it fine you wanna feel like a hero too fine we played five hands of losing blackjack thanked the pit boss got back on the highway and raced through the desert a gray moon sat low in the sky and the sand looked like snow old man in a wheelchair i said maybe big micky kruvinski milo shifted his bulk in the drivers seat and rolled his neck or maybe he was a rich patient getting his ashes hauled bill it to medical as physical therapy lord only knows what kinds of things cruvic does for a buck the main thing cruvic knew mandy bastard gotta find a way to get into his records barones an expert on building paper walls and all we have against cruvic so far is suspicion no grounds for a warrant did you ask barnaby about dope because you think there might be a dope angle i asked him because hes still a user did you see all that sweat those eyes i meant what i said about bad guys hope and cocaine no evidence she ever used no evidence on hope period casey locking might be able to provide some i said he has some connection to cruvic i keep thinking about the time we talked on campus his taking the lawandorder line which is standard psychopath behavior the rules apply to everyone but me maybe i can learn something about him from hopes other student the one in london ill try her again he pushed the porsche over ninety its weird alex the case starts out all hightone professors the highiq crowd but now were back on the usual terrain dopers dealers hookers characters hopes little boxes i said he thought about that for a mile or two finally said yeah but which box had the rattlesnake we stopped for coffee at an allnight diner in ontario and were back in la just before am another note had been added to the scrap on the diningroom table talk about your ships in the night wake me if you want your pen pal r despite four cups of decaf my throat was dry from the desert air and i poured myself an iced soda water and sat drinking in the kitchen then i realized it was morning in england and went to the library to find mary ann gonsalvezs number this time she answered in a soft curious voice hello i told her who i was yes i got your messages no emotion do you have time to talk about professor devane i suppose its so terrible have they any idea who did it no terrible she repeated i didnt find out until a week after when the department notified me by fax i couldnt believe it but i dont know how i can help were trying to learn as much as possible about professor devane i said the kind of person she was her relationships thats why youre involved dr delaware yes interesting new uses for our field im sorry i didnt call back but i just didnt think i had anything to say she was a fine advisor for me dropping pitch on the last two words for you but not for someone else i said another pause what i meant was her style suited mine handsoff she had her own life she did help get me funding for my year in england handsoff how she let me do my own thing im kind of compulsive so it worked out a selfstarter she laughed thats a nicer way to put it so someone who needed more guidance might find her style difficult i suppose so but that would just be speculation what about casey locking is he a selfstarter i dont know casey tension in her voice not at all not well youre an alumnus dr delaware you know how the program operates three years of coursework quals then on to dissertation research some students know what they want hook up with an advisor right away i didnt between my job my daughter and classes i was in a pretty severe time crunch how olds your daughter three i just sent her off to day care they have excellent day care here better than la better than i found in la i wanted someplace that would provide some nurturance do more than warehousing anyway i was crunched needed to finish so you can see why there wasnt much time to socialize with casey or anyone else did you have any contact with him minimal he our paths were different in what way im interested in clinical work he didnt seem to care about that at all pure research i guess so hes a little different i said what do you mean the black leather yes she said he does try to project an image so even though the two of you were professor devanes only students you had little to do with each other correct do you know anything about his research something about selfcontrol animal studies i think was professor devane handsoff with him too well she said they published together so they must have shared some common ground why is casey implicated somehow would it surprise you if he was of course it would the thought of anyone i know doing something like that would be surprising dr delaware i have to say this conversation is making me uncomfortable i cant even know for sure youre really who you say you are if youd like i can give you the number of the police detective assigned to the case no thats all right i have nothing more to say anyway but discussing casey made you uncomfortable she gave a small soft laugh that sounds like a therapeutic comment dr delaware is it an accurate comment discussing anyone makes me uncomfortable i dont like to gossip so its nothing to do with casey specifically he i have some feelings about him but theyre really not relevant you dont like him id rather not she said a bit louder ms gonsalvez i said professor devane was murdered very brutally there are no leads and no way to know whats relevant and what isnt so casey is under suspicion no he isnt not formally but if theres something about him that upset you id like to know about it or i can have detective sturgis call oh boy she said oh boy i really cant afford to have this getting back to casey hes im not afraid of him but hes someone whose bad side i wouldnt want to be on have you seen his bad side in action no but hes ive seen his research i wasnt being totally honest when i said i thought he was running animal studies i know he was because one night i happened to be down in the basement and passed his lab i was grading some papers and had to pick them up in the profs basement lab it must have been eleven oclock everyone was gone i heard music heavymetal music and saw light coming through a partially open door i peeked in and there was casey with his back to me he had cages of rats mazes all sorts of psychophysiologic equipment the music was very loud and he never heard me he had a rat in his hand between his fingers pinching its neck the poor thing was squirming and squeaking casey was clearly hurting it then he started dancing around to the music doing a little jig while he pinched the rat its tail was it was horrible to watch i wanted to rush in and stop him but i didnt too scared being down there alone since then i guess he always has scared me the leather his manner have you seen that ring he wears the skull tacky she said and juvenile he saw me looking at it once and said hope had given it to him which i find hard to believe why she was the epitome of class he was just playing head games with me anyway it bothered me for a long time the rat i kept thinking i should tell someone the department has rules about humane treatment of animals but hope was his advisor and i knew she liked him and i know this sounds like petty sibling rivalry but he was clearly the favored child so if i made problems for him how would she react cowardly dr delaware but my goal is to finish my phd get out in the world make a good home for my daughter hope was staying out of my life and id adjusted to it did she stay out to the point of neglect honestly there were times i needed her and she wasnt available and sometimes it hung me up because of my tight schedule every delay threw me back i even tried to tell her once she was pleasant but really didnt want to hear it so i never brought it up again when i picked her i thought shed be ideal because of her feminism my field of interest is crosscultural sexroles and child rearing i thought shed get turned on by the topic but she really wasnt interested but with casey it was different very different she always seemed to have time for him dont get me wrong when we did get together she was great supportive incredibly smart and she did come through on my grant but getting her attention was always tough and after her book came out it became impossible by the time i left for england i was starting to feel like an orphan how do you know she had more time with casey because i saw them together a lot and he let me know hope and i were lunching i was over at hopes house the other day almost gloating god this really does sound like sibling garbage doesnt it grad school often works out that way i guess she even took him with her to tv shows he told me about sitting in the greenroom meeting celebrities which isnt to say she wasnt entitled to work with whomever she preferred pinching the rat i said gloating sounds like hes into control in some unpleasant ways yes i definitely see him as highly dominant one of those people who wont have anything to do with a situation unless he can control it but he is bright very bright how do you know during the first three years of classes he always scored high and i remember someone saying he was at the top of his class at berkeley but no interest in clinical issues just the opposite he used to disparage clinical work said psychology was presumptuous because it hadnt laid enough scientific groundwork to be able to help people that point of view goes over pretty well with lots of the department biggies so hell probably end up a full professor heck with his brains and his dominance needs hell probably end up a department chairman chairman in black leather im sure its a stage she said maybe next year itll be tweeds and elbow patches i sat thinking about the rat suffering between lockings fingers mr skull ring hopes gift another berkeley grad the northern california connection big micky moving up to san francisco because you could get away with more there how many connecting threads how far back did it go i tiptoed into the bedroom determined not to wake robin eased into bed careful not to rock the mattress but she said honey and reached out to me i wrapped my arms around her next morning my mind was a gun scope with locking centered in the crosshairs i started phoning at nine in my bathrobe no answer at his home or his campus office down in the basement with his rats i had no home address because his file was missing had he pulled it himself hiding something dialing the psych department i filled my voice with annoyed authority and told the secretary this is dr delaware i need to locate a grad student on a research matter casey locking your file on hims missing and you gave me his number but i need an address one second doctor click out click in i have an address for him on londonderry place after she read it off i said what about his lab is there an extension there hold on no theres nothing here thanks is there a zip code for londonderry place la hollywood hills north of sunset strip nice address for a grad student thanking her again i got dressed i drove sunset through beverly hills and into west hollywood cruising by talent agencies highticket defense attorneys glass boxes filled with used ferraris and lamborghinis past the roxy the house of blues the snake pit what used to be gazzarris before it burned to the ground at holloway i spied a magentaandbrass thing that said club none over a neon highball glass and stirrer so locking lived close to the place where mandy had plied her trade maybe with the ultimate bad john next came sunset plaza with its oscarparty fashion boutiques and sidewalk cafes crowded with wouldbe actresses and the poorly shaved vultures who wait for them to get rich or die if any of the women found screen work chances are it would be with their clothes off one way or another the men would be watching londonderry place was a block beyond the last cafe just past ben frankss twentyfourhour coffee shop a steep skinny aerobic hike above the traffic high canted lawns goodsized houses most with less architecture than a bus stop lockings was two blocks up one story white unmodified since its fifties birthdate this high up there was bound to be a city view but the house had low slatted windows arrow plants and yuccas and gazania crowned the sloping frontage concrete steps led to the front door and an alarmcompany sign was staked at the top i walked up a very long driveway that continued past the house space for half a dozen vehicles but only one was parked there black bmw i through an open wooden gate i saw a blue pool and concrete decking an outdoor lounge chair thick lowhanging ficus trees cast black shade nothing luxurious but still the rent had to be two thousand a month i climbed the steps to the door no mail piled up but it was too early for todays delivery the car said locking might be home i rang the bell and waited music or something like it came through the door loud pounding music screaming vocals thrash metal lockings choice of background as he tormented the rat i knocked louder rang again still no response descending to the driveway i looked back at the street no neighbors out in la they rarely are i slid past the bmw and walked along the side of the house more slatted windows the pool was fiftiesbig an oval that took up ninety percent of the backyard the rest was a hill of ivy disappearing under the gloom of the ficus trees two of them sixty feet tall and nearly as wide with thick roots that had worked their way under the pool decking cracking it lifting it up the lounge chair was rusted as were two others just like it not far away were a gas barbecue and an unfurled garden hose kinked so badly it was useless the music much louder from back here a fiberglass roof darkened slidingglass doors left an inch ajar i went over and looked in the room looked to be a den wellstocked wet bar pub mirrors with ale trademarks hanging glasses big plastic ashtrays lights out except for green numbers dancing on a black face sixfoot stereo stack the cd player going the music at steamdrill level trying to ignore it i put my hand against the glass and squinted alarm panel in a corner another green light unarmed the gray carpeting was grubby black leather couches blacklacquer tables lucite sculpture of a nude woman bending submissively one wall was taken up by a huge chromeframed litho of a melonbreasted rouged woman in leather tights motorcycle cap pulled down over one of her eyes the other winked opposite stood a freeform graygranite fireplace with ragged edges no logs black beanbag chairs a single cd case on one panicattack drumbeat tortured bass jetengine guitars brainscraping vocals over and over no sign of locking i slid the door open a few inches wider stuck my head in hello cigarettes butts and ashes on the carpet on one of the tables were piles of magazines i took a few steps closer shouted another hello the magazines were a mix of psychology journals i recognized and things you didnt need a phd to understand fullcolor covers nipplepink lipred coifblond pubichairumber the oyster glisten of fresh ejaculate the journal of clinical practice and that lockings idea of homework on another table stood a popped can of cola a nearly empty bottle of bacardi and a glass filled with something diluted barely tinted amber melted ice cubes the drink poured hours ago one glass party for one maybe locking had rumandcoked himself into a deep enough stupor not to hear the noise i shouted again no answer i tried once more the room stank of nicotine and a durable relationship with takeout food the big black ashtrays on the bar were overflowing vegas casino logo on the rim of one the place ted barnaby had worked the cd on the chair from a band called sepultura spanish for grave cute the image i turned off the music silence no protest hello nothing not the time to explore further half the people in la own guns and lockings connection to cruvic plus the tough punk image made him likely to be one of them if hed managed to sleep through the racket waking him could be dangerous at the very least i was guilty of criminal trespass i turned to leave and noticed something under one of the ashtrays polaroid snapshot one corner pinned aligned perfectly with the counter edge positioned as if for display photo of a woman bare to the waist arms stretched high above her head bound at the wrists and tied to a wooden headboard her smallish breasts were tugged upward by the pressure stretching pale skin over a delicate rib cage tight deltoids goosebump skin her face was covered by a black leather hood studded with zippers two open zippers in the nasal region zippered mouthslit fastened shut the eyeholes open too two bright brown discs shone through below them two erect nipples pinched by a pair of hands male hands two different men the one on the left striped with hair connected to a bare arm small anchor tattoo midway up the forearm the hand on the right smooth and hairless emerging from a ribbed black cuff a ring on that one silver skull red glass eyes i inched closer to the photo and saw locking on the floor behind the bar propped in a corner legs splayed arms limp one hand curled inward the fingers of the other outstretched blue nails blue lips the skull ring grinned back at me his head had been thrown back so that his neck arched toward the ceiling cheekbones in relief long hair mussed a black silk bathrobe did a poor job of covering his thin white body white except for the raspberry lividity splotches where the blood had settled after hed stopped breathing mouth agape in life hed been smug but hed left this world looking surprised crusted hole in the center of his high forehead rusty stripes on his face trailing down to his hairless chest browning the black silk where they hit the robe blood on the carpet and on the wall behind him blood under the body lots of blood why hadnt i seen it right away his eyes were halfshut dry and dull like those of a fish left on the dock long lashes mascaraed by gritty blood id seen plenty of death the last time the man id killed selfdefense i could hear myself breathing suddenly the room smelled sour the position of his head caught my attention it should have dropped but it was tilted upward leaning against the wall as if in prayer positioned all around him more polaroids lots more framing the corpse the same woman bound and masked close shots that obsessed on her thighs her chest her belly and below full views that exposed her entire body long and slim and pale spreadeagled on a whitesheeted bed legs knotted to the footboard hips thrusting upward as if trying to buck a rider shots of her alone others with the same two hands pinching squeezing kneading spreading probing gynecologic closeups and one facial closeup placed near lockings right hand the hood removed blond hair pinned tightly and pulled away from the face lovely face cultured the open mouth expressing fear or arousal or both the brown eyes wide bright focused and distant at the same time even exposed that way hope devanes emotions were hard to read my eyes shifted back to lockings corpse something else on the floor a cardboard box more photos hundreds of them neat lettering on the side in black marker selfcontrol study batch prelim when locking had carried the carton from seacrests house he hadnt even bothered to close it hiding the pictures under a top layer of computer printout big joke on the cops and seacrest had been in on it he had warned locking the tattooed arm coplayers a buzzing sound made me jump a shiny green fly had entered through the open door it circled the room alighted on the bar took off again inspected an ashtray sped toward me i swatted it away and it veered off studied itself in a becks mirror flew back hovering above lockings body it dove and landed on a patch of abdomen pausing then climbing up to the lifeless face to a bloody spot it stayed there rubbed its forelegs together i went to look for a phone it is not philip seacrest repeated a crime he might have been lecturing to students but milo was no sophomore a west la interrogation room a video camera hummed on auto but milos pen kept busy i was alone in the observation cubicle with cold coffee and frozen images no its not professor i dont expect you to understand but i believe peoples personal lives are just that milo stopped writing when did it begin professor i dont know no it was not my idea never my propensity whose propensity was it hopes caseys i was never sure which of them actually initiated it when did you get involved said milo picking up one of the polaroids on the table and flicking a corner with his index finger seacrest turned away moments ago his gray herringbone jacket had been off and the sleeve of his white shirt had been rolled up revealing the anchor tattoo now he was fully dressed the jacket buttoned he began picking at his untidy beard his first reaction upon seeing the snapshots had been shock then weteyed resignation followed by hardened resolve he hadnt been arrested though milo had offered him an attorney during questioning seacrest had turned him down curtly as if insulted by the suggestion as the interview ground on hed managed to build upon the indignation when did you get involved professor later how much later how could i possibly know that mr sturgis as i told you i have no idea when they began when did you get involved in absolute terms a year year and a half ago and locking was your wifes student for over three years that sounds right so it may have been going on for two years before you started it said seacrest smiling sourly yes it might have so what happened said milo the two of them just walked in one day and announced hey guess what weve gotten into some bandd games care to join seacrest flushed but he kept his voice even you wouldnt understand try me seacrest shook his head and flexed his neck from side to side the smile hadnt totally faded something amusing professor being brought here is perverse my wifes been murdered and you concern yourself with this kind of thing milo leaned forward suddenly staring into seacrests eyes seacrest startled but composed himself and stared back perverse trivial and irrelevant humor me professor how did you get involved i youre right about it being a game thats exactly what it was just a game i dont expect you to be tolerant of divergence but thats all it was milo smiled divergence seacrest ignored him so they asked you to diverge with them no they i happened upon them one afternoon when i was supposed to be lecturing i felt a touch of something coming on canceled class came home and found the two of them yes mr sturgis where in our bed seacrest smiled the marital bed must have been a big shock to say the least whatd you do seacrest waited a long time to answer nothing nothing thats right mr sturgis nothing you didnt get angry you didnt ask me how i felt you asked what i did and the answer is nothing i turned around and walked out howd you feel another delay i really cant say it wasnt anger anger would have been futile why hope didnt take well to anger what do you mean she had no tolerance for it had i displayed anger things would have gotten confrontational married people fight professor seems to me you had a damned good reason how understanding of you mr sturgis however hope and i never fought it didnt suit either of us so what did you mean by confrontational a war of silence interminable frigid seemingly infinite stretches of silence psychological exile even when hope claimed to forgive she never forgot i knew her emotional repertoire the way a conductor knows a score so when i saw the two of them i maintained my dignity and simply walked away and then what and then seacrest pulled at his beard again someone closed the door and i assume they finished im sure you find my reaction contemptible cowardly wimpish no doubt you think you would have reacted differently no doubt youll be going home tonight to a dutiful wife and dutiful children probably somewhere in the valley a charmingly conventional lifestyle milo sat back and pressed a thick finger over his lips looking suddenly tired seacrest covered his eyes with both hands pulled down at the lids let the hands trail down his cheeks and fall in his lap it was go along mr sturgis or or what or lose her now ive lost her anyway he slumped began to weep milo waited a long time before saying can i get you something to drink professor headshake seacrest looked up then at the polaroids may we end this have you heard enough about the sick divergent world of intellectuals just a few more questions please seacrest sighed milo said when you found your wife and locking you didnt figure youd already lost her of course not it wasnt as if it were the the first time seacrests mouth shut tight professor this is exactly what i was afraid of hopes reputation filthied i refuse to be part of that part of what dredging up her past what if her past led to her murder do you know that now that lockings dead what do you think no answer how many other men did she play games with professor seacrest i dont know but you do know there were others i dont know for a fact but she had owned the apparatus for some time by apparatus you mean the hood and the bindings and those rubber and leather garments in her size that we found at lockings house seacrest gave a dispirited nod anything else other than those items im not aware of any no whips seacrest snorted she wasnt interested in pain only only what restraint selfcontrol seacrest didnt answer milo wrote something down so shed had the apparatus for some time how long five or six years three years before she met locking your arithmetic is excellent where did she keep the apparatus in her room where in her room professor in a box in her closet i came across it by accident never told her what else was in there pictures of her of us pictures wed taken shed told me shed thrown them out apparently she liked to review them who moved the photos and the apparatus to lockings house casey when the night you dropped in i only saw him carry out one box he came back later id asked him to move them before right after hope was murdered i was afraid of something exactly like this why didnt he comply seacrest shook his head he said he would but kept delaying more games said milo i suppose he was a rather calculated fellow you didnt like him hope did thats all that mattered your feelings didnt matter seacrests smile was eerie not one bit mr sturgis if locking was delaying why didnt you just throw them out they were hopes so i felt they should be preserved he licked his lips averted his eyes before she died they were hers professor wouldnt that make them yours so why give them to locking for safety said seacrest i thought the police might search hopes room but still said milo you didnt want to sully hopes name yet you kept a couple hundred photos i hid them he said in my university office not that i needed to those first two detectives never even bothered to search hopes room you never really did either so you brought them to your university office then back home correct then you waited for casey locking to take them off your hands but what role did they play for you seacrest gave a start what role should they have played im asking you sir all i know is you kept them instead of destroying them that tells me you had some use for them seacrest flexed his neck again adding a forward bend he opened and closed his fingers because mr sturgis they were the only pictures i had of her except for her book jacket she hated the camera hated having her picture taken except this way seacrest nodded so these were mementos seacrests jaws clenched but you let locking have them anyway i kept some where in my home special ones or did you just stick your hand in and grab randomly seacrest shot to his feet i am terminating this fine said milo i guess ill have to get my information elsewhere ask around at some bondage clubs and see if anyone knew your wife if that doesnt work i can go to the press see what that stirs up seacrest shook a finger sir you are his hands fisted you said if i came down and talked to you here youd be discreet i said if you came down and cooperated thats exactly what im doing think so seacrest flushed deeply the way id seen in his office i watched his breathing get quicker until he closed his eyes and seemed to concentrate on slowing it down what more do you want he finally said i keep telling you this had nothing to do with hopes murder yes you do professor i knew her better than anyone she didnt go to bondage clubs shed never have countenanced anything so plebeian vulgar and stop looking at the pictures every time i defend her they were private private games yes striding forward seacrest swiped at the table knocking most of the photos to the floor snapping his eyes toward milo as if expecting retaliation he placed his hands on his hips and stood there milo looked at him briefly wrote something down seacrests shoe had settled near one of the pictures he stepped on it ground it under his heel private said milo softly hope and locking and you exactly nothing illegal absolutely nothing neither of us killed her i expected milo to follow that up but instead he said are you terminating this interview sir if i stay will you promise not to expose hope im not promising anything professor but if you cooperate ill do my best the first time we met said seacrest you told me we were on the same side what a line show me we are professor are we im out to catch your wifes murderer how about you seacrest started to lurch forward stopped himself his whole body shaking if i found him id kill him im wellversed in medieval torture devices the things i could do the rack huh you have no idea seacrest placed one hand on his own wrist steadying it any idea who killed locking no no hypotheses seacrest shook his head casey was i never really knew him outside of the games correct the night i dropped by he returned your wifes car yes helping out yes even though you didnt really know him hope knew him so he merited driving her car yes and i was grateful to him for what the pleasure he brought hope that night he acted formal toward you called you professor seacrest trying to make it seem as if you two had no personal relationship we didnt really milo lifted one of the photos remaining on the table seacrest said the relationship wasnt between casey and myself mr sturgis both relationships everything revolved around hope she was the nexus one sun two moons said milo seacrest smiled very good yes we were in her orbit who else was no one im aware of no other games none she told me about would she have told you i believe so why she was honest about everything seacrest gave a disgusted look you saw the pictures how much more honest could anyone be milo stretched a hand toward seacrests chair ill remain standing mr sturgis smiling milo got up kneeled and began collecting the fallen photos threeway game and two of the players are dead do you feel threatened i suppose you suppose i dont think about myself much no seacrest shook his head i dont think much of my own value that sounds kind of depressed sir i am depressed profoundly some might say you had a motive to kill both of them and what motive is that jealousy then why would i leave the pictures near caseys body and incriminate myself milo didnt answer youre wasting my time and yours mr sturgis i loved my wife in a way few women are ever loved i obliterated myself in her honor losing her has sucked all the joy from my life i appreciated casey because he contributed to her joy other than that he meant nothing to me where did your joy come from hope seacrest smoothed the lapels of his jacket be logical casey was shot and your own tests proved i havent fired a gun recently as a matter of fact i havent touched a firearm since i was discharged from the service and at the time casey was murdered i was home reading would you like to know the title of the book something romantic miltons paradise lost original sin seacrest waved a hand gorge yourself on interpretation why dont you go fetch delaware get him into the act im sure hell have a field day may i go mr sturgis i promise not to leave town if you dont believe me have a policeman watch me nothing else you want to tell me nothing okay said milo sure seacrest walked shakily to the door that led to the observation room found it locked that one said milo indicating the opposite door seacrest stood taller reversed direction milo squared the stack of pictures reading at home not much of an alibi professor i never imagined id need one talk to you later professor hopefully not seacrest made it to the door and stopped not that youll believe me but hope was never coerced or oppressed on the contrary she made the rules she was the one in control being able to surrender herself without fear thrilled her and her pleasure thrilled me i admit that at first i was repelled but one learns i learned hope taught me taught you what trust thats what its all about mr sturgis total trust think about it would your wife trust you the way mine trusted me milo hid his smile behind a big thick hand i know said seacrest that theres very little use asking you to keep those pictures out of the police locker room but im asking anyway like i said professor if theyve got nothing to do with the murder theres no reason to publicize them they dont they were part of her life not her death yeah its true about the paraffin test he hasnt fired a gun in a while said milo but he still could have hired someone to shoot locking maybe someone he met through the bondage trade hes got a point about not destroying the photos i said if he had youd never have thought of him so maybe the bondage games were the reason he was evasive why did he hold on to the photos could be just what he said mementos mental or sexual either both so you buy his mr submissive routine hope was god he worshiped at her altar it would explain their marriage i said she was so controlled as a child she craved someone willing to subjugate his ego totally despite what she told elsa campos being tied up and left behind had to have been terrifying she kept trying to work it through and seacrests passivity made him a perfect mate for her he told paz and fellows hed been a confirmed bachelor for years maybe the reason was hed been a moon looking for a sun working it through he said so she gets herself tied up again manipulated bruised restaging it i said but this time shes calling the shots with their games the three of them coulda gone on the talkshow circuit he said you are starting to sound i said less like a west hollywood legend than a bourgeois policeman with a dutiful wife and an lifestyle he laughed harder than id heard him in a long time those guns you found in lockings house i said heavy artillery for a grad student three pistols one rifle he said all loaded but stashed up in the closet too cocky for his own good and all that porn he had i said locking was from san francisco big mickys city big mickys business who owns the house dont know yet but a neighbor said it was a rental before locking thered been lots of other tenants be interesting if its the same landlord who owns cruvics place on mulholland cruvic pays rent to a corporation based here in la triad or triton something like that but we havent traced it to any individual yet in terms of big micky what ive learned so far is that he used to be a sizable sexbiz honcho theaters peep shows massage parlors escort services but retired because of serious health problems heart liver kidneys everythings on the fritz had a couple kidney transplants that failed awhile back and ended up pretty screwedup the old guy ted barnaby saw in vegas with cruvic was yellow i said meaning jaundiced meaning liver problems any word on whether mandy wright had ever worked in san francisco not yet but theres another norcal connection hopes mother died up there stanford medical center breast cancer all bills paid by a third party were trying to find out who it reeks of history i said phds with gangster connections he scratched his jaw i hate this case too many goddamn smart people he walked me out of the station as we hit the sidewalk on purdue someone called out detective sturgis a big blue mercedes sedan was parked in a red zone across the street two cellphone antennas on the rear deck one of those aftermarket custom packages that doubles the price wire wheels all the chrome removed front apron rear spoiler smoke puffed out the exhaust pipes almost daintily the man at the wheel was in his early sixties with a shaven head and a deep tan that was probably part sun part bottle black wraparound shades white shirt yellow tie gold glint of wristwatch as he turned off the engine got out and jogged across the street six feet tall trim and nimble probably a few face tucks but time had tugged at the stitches and his chin flesh shook robert barone he said in a breathy voice a tan hand shot forward i know youve been trying to reach me but ive been out of town san francisco said milo as he shook the lawyers hand barones smile was as sudden as bad news as warm as sherbet as a matter of fact hawaii little downtime between cases the sunglasses angled at me and you are detective what can i do for you mr barone said milo i was going to ask you the same thing detective you made a trip here in person to offer your services to the poor benighted lapd the way things have been going said barone you guys can use all the help you can get seriously there is a matter id like to discuss if i didnt find you i was going to talk to your lieutenant still looking at me he said i didnt catch your name holmes said milo detective holmes as in sherlock no said milo as in sigmund so what does dr cruvic want police protection now that darrell ballitser put his name out on the airwaves or is he ready to confess to something barone turned serious his bald head was liverspotted why dont we go inside youre in a noparking zone counselor barone laughed ill take my chances guess thats what you get paid to do said milo but dont blame me to me catch you later sig any research you want to do on the aforementioned topic is fine he headed for the stations front door leaving barone to catch up research on the kruvinskicruvic clan the family lawyer arriving in person because someone was worried little micky still the only one with a confirmed link to hope and mandy i drove to the library and looked up his father found fifteen citations on milan v kruvinski going back twenty years all from san francisco papers a couple of photos showing a bullnecked flatfeatured man with slanted eyes that cemented his paternity but cruder than his son a lessfinished sculpture not a single story from any bakersfield paper quieter town quieter time or payoffs most of the san francisco pieces had to do with obscenity busts the sex impresario and reputed crime figure had been arrested dozens of times during the seventies and early eighties too much flesh in the shows too much customerdancer contact liquor served to underage patrons i thought of something cruvic had told us at his beverly hills office the rise in infertility problems due to all the messing around people did in the seventies firsthand knowledge the articles described lots of arrests but no convictions lots of dismissals prior to trial prosecutors had even made a stab at the old crimebusting standby a taxevasion charge that kruvinski beat by proving the bulk of his income came from agricultural holdings in the central valley some of which had earned him federal subsidies his theaters on ofarrell and polk streets had finally closed down but not apparently due to legal problems almost no quotes either when kruvinski communicated with the press he did it through robert barone but i did find one tenyearold interview a fawning piece by a selfconsciously runyonesque columnist who prided himself on having san franciscos pulse in his pocket hed spoken to kruvinski at home and the piece helped explain the porn brokers business shift out of live entertainment we moved into video said the oncerobust entrepreneur from his multilevel redwoodglass sausalitolairwithabayview guys dont want to go to a theater anymore put up with all the harassment then with typical micky k generosity and a slavic smile as wide as the embarcadero he offered me a scotch yo chivas in the trueblue bottle of course even though he couldnt partake himself liver problems heart kidneys last years transplant his second was a beacon in the fog but it didnt take i refused the booze but micky wouldnt hear about abstinence in the name of empathy an affectionate honey brought mrs micky the beauteous tanned and aerobitoned former actressandmodel brooke hastings out from her stateoftheculinaryart galley smiling and reflecting sausalito sunlight as she wiped mickys brow and murmured soothing wifey words his favorite thing is watching the sea lions she confided in me while pouring a generous dollop of the divine chiv bros blended brew has fresh fish brought down to them every morning he loves animals anything organic and alive thats what attracted me to him then she kissed the big guys pate in a way that went way beyond spousal duty and he smiled and looked out a picture window as big as the stage of the love palace theater almost dreamily and maybe he was dreaming whos this scrivener to testify otherwise the former miss h put her arm around him and he kept looking looking and dreaming like at a movie different from the movies he produces but just as sensual in its own way tf miss h crossed shapely gams and yours truly sipped chivas feeling the warm fire flow down ye olde deadline slaves gullet like scottish lava all in all not a bad day in xanadu we can only hope micky has lots more brooke hastings an actress taking the name of hubbys stockandfertilizer company kruvinskis joke had she known to what he was comparing her family joke junior using the same name for the institute hed supposedly attended during the year between residencies the year after hed left the university of washington i finished the rest of the articles no

angeles police department on a homicide case were trying to get information on one of your former residents a homicide case she said alarmed which resident dr milan cruvic her silence was worth more than words ms blank what has he done were just trying to find out some background information he was only in the program briefly but you remember him well more silence i cant give out dr burwassers number but if you leave me yours ill give him the message thank you isnt there something you can tell me about dr cruvic im sorry no but youre not surprised that the police would be interested in him i heard her throat clear very little surprises me nowadays not expecting any return call and figuring milo was still with barone i got into jogging clothes and prepared to sweat off the frustration the phone rang just as i closed the door behind me and i rushed back into the house and caught it before the service picked up dr delaware this is dr burwasser said a dry testy voice who are you i started to explain sounds fishy he said if youd like i can have detective sturgis call you no im not wasting any time on this cruvic was with us for under a year fourteen years ago not around fourteen brief but memorable whyd he leave i said thats no ones business it will be soon he was intimate with a woman who was murdered and hes a possible suspect the more effort it takes to get the information the more public itll be is that a threat not at all just a statement of fact dr burwasser did cruvic do something to disgrace the surgery program instead of answering he said im not impressed by murder seen plenty of things in my day what did dr cruvic do he never murdered anyone here did he murder someone somewhere else no of course not is this being taped no not that it matters nothing i tell you is libelous because its true all on the record exactly i said he didnt answer whatd he do dr burwasser he stole from whom that i will not tell you because the dead are entitled to their dignity that took a moment to process he stole from a corpse tried to how much he laughed shallowly as if needing the release hard to say the market varies jewelry of sorts another laugh family jewels organs we caught the little bastard trying to remove a heart the only problem was the donor wasnt quite dead my god dont get dramatic i said it wasnt murder the patient was terminal flatlining we were getting ready to turn off the machines and pronounce but we couldnt locate next of kin but the heart was still going of course it was otherwise why bother taking it out nice and strong young fellow head trauma motorcycle accident turned out to be a tourist from germany the idiot could have caused an international incident whod he try to steal the heart for not who what research hed conned us into giving him some lab space said he wanted to practice gallbladder resections on dogs write a paper not true i said oh he worked on a few beagles but that wasnt the real reason idiot fancied himself a transplant surgeon future christiaan barnard i put an end to that pipe dream despite the pressure pressure from who politicians from california the last word delivered with even more contempt than the first san francisco yup lots of calls from greasy characters apparently his father was some sort of big shot no matter to me do something like that youre out how was he caught a nurse walked in on him got him redhanded the fool middle of the night he had a surgical kit laid out next to the patients bed had even made the initial incision lord knows how he thought he could have gotten away with it enough thats all im saying i dont need this grief go bother swenson organ theft sterilization without proper consent smartest boy making his own rules no surprise hed grown up seeing his father do a lot worse years later more surgical felonies what had hopes role been in all of it but the same question why had hope and locking been targeted and not cruvic himself still cruvic had to be at the core of it barone had shown up at the police station because cruvic knew the walls were closing in scared not of the police scared for himself because lockings murder had put hopes into focus for him told him who why but why now and not after hopes murder and what had brought cruvic out in the open darrell ballitsers attack the news reports linking him to hope first time the murderer had known of the link but how could that be if the issue was unethical surgery i went around and around with it assume ballitsers attack had focused the murderer on cruvic after that the murderer had begun watching cruvic seen him with locking at mulholland unless i was totally off and cruvic had killed both hope and locking to keep them quiet but then why send his lawyer to talk to milo the more i wrestled with it the more convinced i became that cruvic was now a target and he knew it getting away with years of loose ethics until hed finally offended the wrong person in collaboration with hope and locking loose ethics sterilization without consent organ theft the house on mulholland private clinic something locking had been involved with too then it hit me so simple but where did mandy wright figure in party girl working girl days before her murder shed done the club scene in la before that shed met with cruvic and his father in vegas left the casino with both of them not for sex another kind of freelancing shed told barnaby its like acting what had milo said about club none big hair and perfect bodies mandy would fit in her companion too the poor waitress kathy dinapoli murdered simply because shed served drinks in the wrong place at the wrong time perfect bodies mandy hired to pick someone up a special kind of john slowly inexorably like a snake coming alive in the heat the chain unfolded in my head the chain between hope locking mandy kathy venomous snake the morry mayhew show that hope had appeared on what was the name of that producer suzette band id promised to call her if i learned something the old information barter shed have to make another payment first next stop mulholland drive the road was beautiful in the daylight the house behind the electric gate a brownbrick contemporary sparkling with color around the borders flowers invisible in the dark id kept my sweatstained tshirt on but had substituted jeans for the running shorts in my hand was a bag picked up from a pharmacy in beverly hills an hour ago id bought toothpaste and dental floss and vitamin c to get it the seville parked just down the road was old enough to pass for a delivery vehicle i supposed i was too old a delivery boy for most cities but la was full of underachievers i rang the bell on the gatepost after a moments delay a voice came through the speaker yeah delivery hold on a few minutes later the front door opened and a man in a black shirt and black jeans came out stared at me and approached in a flatfooted plodding walk he was in his late thirties short and wide with thinning black hair on top the side wisps tied into a barely longenough ponytail bushy sideburns longer than milos oily skin that shone wirerimmed glasses pummeled features sleepy expression except for little piggy eyes that never left me the black shirt was silk oversized untucked and he kept his right hand in front of him as if protecting something plainclothes cops wore their shirts out to conceal guns and i supposed thugs did the same yeah delivery for mr kruvinski i held the druggists bag out whats in it medicine i guess he gets his medicine from his doctor i tried to look apathetic lemme see i gave him the bag and he pulled out a small amber bottle filled with yellow tablets the right color but the wrong shape my physicians desk reference chart showed imuran as a scored doublet these were singles vitamin cs black shirt didnt react as id hoped not observant the label was a work of art id steamed off an old one for penicillin whited out all the specifics but left the pharmacys name and address and the rx date and prescribing physician blanks photocopied it typed in the new information put some glue on the back stuck it back on the vial pretty good job though i wasnt ready for twentydollar bills he read the label now and his mouth pursed when he got to prescribing physician m cruvic md followed by cruvics real license number obtained from the medical board confusion seamed his meaty forehead we just got a big box of this shi who ordered this bingo i tried to look stupid and peeved rather than elated dunno i just go where they tell me you wan me to take it back dropping the bottle back in the bag he kept it and started for the house hey i said stopping short he looked over his shoulder at me his shoulders were enormous his elbows dimpled pink scalp showed through the hair the ponytail was a sad thing you gotta problem cod i said you gotta pay for it keeping it going for realism id already learned what i wanted to know lifting his free hand he made a skingun and aimed it at my face wait bucko i did til he got inside and closed the door then i ran back to the seville and was pulling out by the time he got back along with anna the tightfaced nurse the two of them standing behind the iron gate perplexed as i got the hell out of there so much to do with the movie business is bland mundane characterless the casting studio said it all a muddy brown lump of a onestory building on washington boulevard in culver city it sat between a cuban seafood restaurant and a chinese laundry the stucco was lighter where graffiti had been oversprayed no windows a warped black door inside was a nofrills waiting room crowded with perfectbody hopefuls of both sexes sitting in folding chairs reading variety fantasizing about fame fortune and cutting some obnoxious restaurant customers throat the inner room was much larger but all it contained was a card table and two chairs under cheap track lighting and a rear wall of flyspecked mirror i sat in a tiny storage closet behind the mirror watching two casting directors sat behind the table a heavy sloppylooking puffyfaced man with bad skin and greasy hair wearing a hawaiian shirt and grubby khakis and a thin woman with notbad blue eyes wearing an obvious black wig and clad in red sweats nameplates in front of them brad rabepaige bandura two evian bottles a pack of winstons and an ashtray but no one was smoking next said rabe a hopeful entered audition number for the male lead he looked at rabe and bandura smiled with what he probably thought was warmth i saw tension fear and contempt what was he thinking frick and frack hansel and gretel who were they to judgeboth of them dressed like slobs typical dressing down to show they had the power couldnt give a shit the hopeful knew the type god did he waiting out there in that zoo for three fucking hours for the privilege of being judged by eyes that never changed through the bullshit smiles and the nods and the phony words of encouragement the judging okay said paige bandura looking at her fatso partner how about the scene in the middle of fortysix sure the hopeful grinned charmingly and flipped the scripts pages from but celine you and i no right after that from what exactly is it youre after the hopeful nodded took a deep breath in that covert yoga way that no one could see closed his eyes opened them and glanced down at the script before raising them show them he could memorize instantaneously looking into little paiges eyes because she seemed to be on his side what exactly is it youre after celine i thought our friendship had grown to something more shall i read her line too no said paige ill be her big warm smile maybe lifting a script from the card table she read maybe dirk maybe not but the bottom line is i need a man right now and you just may fill the bill flat voice ugly voice it came out buddaboddomlion is i needa mayan the ones who judged were inevitably ugly in some way the hopeful hated ugly is that so he said softening his tone because i think you feel more than that celine i feel it and i think you feel it too here touching his heart do you dirk dooyoodirk yes i do celine he smiled at her again the script says he puts his hand on her thats okay said paige saucy laugh well just pretend okay whats celines next linebut dirk i know you feel it here celine from your inner being the place where love grows he dropped his arms connotation of vulnerability stood there waiting paige smiled at him again turned to fat sloppy brad brad looked him over rubbed his face grunted not bad he finally pronounced id say excellent added paige brad said okay excellent grudgingly if youd like i can read more said the hopeful the two of them exchanged glances no that wont be necessary said paige that was really good the hopeful shrugged boyishly he had a great boyish grin another look between him and paige onward she said some practical issues the show is going to be fairly physical for daytime lots of love scenes steamy stuff any problems with that not at all said the hopeful but a tightening above his navel had begun someone some little demon screwing up his insides smile acting we mean skin said brad its cable so theyre going to stretch the standards nothing worse than nypd blue but theres gonna be plenty of body shots how about taking your shirt off the hopeful didnt answer his heart rate had climbed to over despite all the cardiovascular training fuck fuck fuck is there a problem said paige rooting for him maybe he could work it out no problem he said ive got a scar some people think its actually pretty masc a scar where said brad no big deal where on my back brad frowned the hopeful had to think fast play to flatvoice paige look casual acting brilliance he reached around just below the waistband so if its only partial lets see said brad take your shirt off the hopeful looked to paige for support she nodded sleepyeyed losing interest bitch he slipped his sweatshirt over his head turn around and pull your jeans down far enough for us to see the whole thing said brad the hopeful did silence long silence he knew why both of them staring grossedout he put his hands on his hips trying to distract them by showing off the big defined muscles of his shoulders and back flex the triceps flex the glutes nice tight butt he could control every muscle howd you get it said brad hiking rock climbing i fell tore my back up got stitched not stitched very well said brad thats some scar and the hopeful knew what he was thinking what both of them were thinking ugly because it was pink puckered glossy keloid fibrosing especially conspicuous because the surrounding skin was so smooth and bronze so perfect severe keloiding crappy surgical technique the books said and genetics black people keloided a lot in africa it was considered a sign of beauty well im white the treatment shots of cortisone right into the wound early on too late now the only hope more surgery and that was a big maybe not that he could afford it yet in more ways than one open that can of worms must have been quite a fall said brad smugness in his voice it set off the feeling like turning on a steam spigot hot boiling ironfoundry rage foaming up from his gut and working its way to his chest like a heart attack but hed been through the nights of panics cold sweats knew his heart was fine his heart his hands wanted to clench and he forced them to remain open forced the sweat to remain inside no one talked the hopeful kept his back to the two of them knowing the smallest glimpse of the rage would kill any chance he had for a goodguy part like there was still a chance but keep going in this business you just keep going what mountain were you climbing said paige and he knew she was mocking him okay thanks babe ciao dont call us well call you does it matter he said slipping the sweatshirt on and turning around nearly falling over in surprise because brad and paige were holding guns and badges looks more like a surgical scar said brad looks more like some kind of serious operation isnt that part of the back where the kidney is the hopeful didnt answer brad said and the oscar goes to okay put your hands behind your back mr muscadine and dont move smiling judging some of the rage must have leaked through because brads smile died and his green eyes got even brighter yet colder the hopeful had never known green could get that cold he took a step backward easy pal said fat brad lets make this easy up with the hands reed said paige sharp voice hostile no longer on his side never on his side he stood there looked at them poor specimens pathetic he was very big very strong could probably do some damage not that it would make a difference in the long run but what the hell might as well get something out of this shitty afternoon he dove for paige because he really didnt like women tried for a jawbreaking punch but only managed to slap her fucking face before brad hit him on the back of his head and he went down after the uniforms took reed muscadine away i came out from behind the dirty mirror milo drank evian water and plucked at his hawaiian shirt sleek huh detective paige bandura said i think it suits you brad that right sure nice and caj joe beachbum caj he looked at me so what do you think i think you could have a new career hell maybe you can be dirk spare me i mean it i really like the shirt said paige if you dont like it you can donate it to the ivy the one at the beach theyve got hawaiian shirts hanging on the wall hoohah said milo how do you know about such things detective bandura rich boyfriend she grinned removed the black wig and fluffed her clipped chestnut curls need me for anything else milo nope thanks hey any time always wanted to act howd i do doctor from where i was sitting i said great havent acted since high school pirates of penzance wanted to be mabel but they made me a pirate you were terrific i lied it made her smile and she walked off with a spring in her step whats her usual detail i said car theft milo sat down in the same chair hed occupied as brad just the two of us in the room now the empty space smelled of toxic sweat good work sig he said luckily hey you had a hypothesis i always respect your hypotheses a hypothesis about what hope and locking and cruvic had in common then back to square one the conduct committee one particular case someone pressured to take a blood test id tested it out confirmed big micky was on imuran the most commonly used antirejection drug meaning he was off dialysis had received yet another kidney transplant after that the details had flooded my head reed muscadines clothes the day id spoken to him in his apartment short shorts which matched the heat of the day but a heavy sweatshirt that didnt the sleeves cut off baring the arms but covering his torso mrs green the landlady telling me hed been laid up with a bad back for over a month muscadine telling me more tried for threetwenty on the bench press it felt like a knife going through me a slip or playing with me acting a good actor professor dirkhoffs prize student dirkhoff had been distressed because muscadine had dropped out to take a job on a soap opera a job that sounded definite but muscadine had lost the part i can practice stanislavsky from now til tomorrow but if the bod goes so does my marketability not remembering the name of the soap opera unlikely starving actors attuned themselves to every detail but giving me enough to sound credible something about spies and diplomats foreign embassies that had narrowed it down enough for suzette band to come up with a name embassy row shed gotten me the number of the shows casting director a woman named chloe gold and id called her posing as muscadines new agent asking her if reed could get another chance because the boy was really talented shed looked him up in her files and said no thanks he was bumped cause of physical factors what physical factors you dont know youre his agent we havent gotten into ask him gotta go physical factors the blood test not just for hiv but also for tissue compatibility hope with faculty clout getting access to the sample it fit not hard evidence but enough to hypothesize cruvics real clinic was the house on mulholland drive honor thy father milo drank the rest of the water and looked up at the track lighting maybe we should throw a wrap party maybe the department will even compensate me for the rental and the ad in variety you paid for it yourself department doesnt authorize sting dough on the basis of hypotheses and i didnt want to spend six goddamn months going through channels and what other choice was there the wimpo judge said no warrant on muscadines medical records and apartment cause he doesnt like hypotheses meaning if id just walked up to the asshole and yanked his shirt up it would be no grounds illegal search and the scar would be excluded from evidence let alone forcing him to take an x ray see if his kidneys missing and not much chance the surgeon kept records and as asshole barone came to tell me the asshole surgeon is out of the country and for the time being with multiple murders on the agenda busting dr heelspur for malpractice isnt going to be the das priority but eventually when what he did gets out he aint going to be working in beverly hills or anywhere else any chance of jail time for him he shrugged forced retirement may not mean much to him i said he probably doesnt need the money though being a doctors a big deal to him psychologically a very big deal so maybe itll hurt why do you say its such a big deal he stole muscadines kidney but sewed him up and let him live fatal error for hope and mandy and locking and if muscadine ever learned whod cut him for himself but cruvic wanted to see himself as a healer not a killer working through his own childhood just as hope had tried to do hope he said shaking his head setting muscadine up for the knife smartest girl and smartest boy devising a project to save big micky i said she and cruvic went back a long way strong bond maybe because cruvic was someone who understood what it was like to be an a student with a parent who lived on the wrong side of the law to have a secret life ill bet big micky paid lottie devanes medical bills at stanford one of the places hed gotten a kidney and the consultation money hopes been getting from junior and barone is probably really some kind of allowance from senior before the book forty grand would have made a lot of difference in her life payback time he said and mandy was the bait where does locking fit in i dont know but keep looking up north another smart boy he said you think the entire conduct committee was just a ploy to find a donor for daddy no i said i think hope believed in it but she and cruvic had probably been discussing what to do for big micky for some time we know from the doctors at stanford that hed already tried going through channels but was unlikely to qualify for another kidney because two failures made him a very high risk for rejection and so did his poor general health and his age maybe cruvic and hope even considered using one of the women at the clinic as a donor sterilize then snip something extra maybe they were just waiting around for the right girl someone with no family ties whatsoever then hope came facetoface with muscadine big and strong and healthy and no family ties plus she believed him to be a rapist who was going to get away with it so there was her moral justification they tested his blood ruled out hiv and other infections and did a tissue match bingo not that it was any big miracle the more compatibility factors the better but kidney transplants are often done just on the basis of an abo match and both kruvinski and muscadine were opositive the most common type christ he said for all we know they did do some poor girl at the clinic and that failed too when all this comes out we may hear about all sorts of people with scars and backaches thered be a limit for the old man he could only tolerate so much surgery this was probably his last chance thats why they had to find an ideal donor muscadine who professor steinberger never met because shed resigned from the committee before his case came up hope didnt like the storm kid much either but he had family ties the worst kind of ties a wealthy father more than willing to make waves and for all kennys obnoxiousness his guilt was a lot more ambiguous maybe hope still held on to a sense of fairness maybe he shook his head setting up muscadine for involuntary charity harvesting him christ its an urban legend come to life i almost feel sympathy for the bastard it would be traumatic for anyone i said but for someone like muscadine prizing his body trying to merchandise his looks it was so much more when i spoke to him at his apartment he said hed found the blood test kafkaesque he also said his back injury had felt like a knife going through him playing with me or just getting it off his chest without letting on free therapy why not i said dont actors learn that seize the moment big micky was anything but he sat facing us under a huge live oak nothing grew under the tree and the ground had reverted to sand the rest of the yard was perfect bonsai grass around a halfolympic blackbottom pool with a spittingdolphin waterfall herringbonebrick hardscape statuary on pedestals bloodred azalea beds more big trees through the foliage a spreading hazy view of the san gabriels said money couldnt buy clean air the old man was so shrunken he made the wheelchair look like a highback no shoulders no neck his smallish head seemed to sprout from his sternum his skin was legalpad yellow his brown eyes filmed the skin around them bagged defatted jeweled with blackheads a fleshy red blob of a nose reached nearly to his gray upper lip bad dentures made his jaws work constantly only his hair was youthful thick coarse still dark with only a few sparks of gray milos warrant had opened the electric gate of the house on mulholland but no one had come up to greet us and hed taken out his gun and let the uniforms come on like an army just as wed reached the front door it had opened and the ponytailed frog id given the medicine vial to was leaning against the jamb trying to look casual milo put him against the wall cuffed him patted him down took his automatic and his wallet read his drivers license armand jacszcyc yeah this looks like you who else is in the house armand just mr k and a nurse youre sure yeah said jacszcyc then he noticed me and his head retracted the uniforms went in a sergeant came back a few minutes later saying no one else lots of guns were pulling an arsenal another uniform came out with nurse anna her tight face was glossy with sweat and her big chest was emphasized by an electricblue angora sweater she kept her head down as they took her away okay said milo leave me a couple of guys to tear up the place for dope no dope so far said the sergeant keep looking and bust this one for concealed weapon frog was hustled off and we stepped in the center of the house was one sixtyfoot stretch of darkpaneled space clear to the back sparkleceilinged and goldcarpeted filled with groupings of green and brown couches ceramic lamps with fringed shades heavy carved tables full of souvenirshop porcelain and crystal clown paintings and rodeo drive oils of rainy paris street scenes said all talent should not be encouraged the rear wall was covered by pleated olive drapes that locked out the sun and sealed in the smell of decay a screechbird voice from the back yelled wheres that water armand a wheelchair sat next to a fake louis xiv commode with an obscenely inlaid front the marble top was crowded with medicine bottles not like the vial id showed jacszcyc big white plastic containers no prescription blanks drugcompany samples armand he had to run said milo nurse annas gone too the old man blinked tried to move the effort turned him green and he sank back who the hell are you police milo flashed id two uniforms came over and he told them over there pointing to the open doorway of a big brown kitchen the counter was piled with water bottles softdrink cans takeout cartons dirty dishes pots and pans what the fuck you moerons doin here his accent was interesting the broad farmer drawl of bakersfield tucked up at the final syllables by a hint of eastern europe lawrence welk without the cheer gimme some water moeron milo filled a glass and held it out along with the warrant whats that drug paper anonymous tip the old man took the glass but ignored the warrant he drank barely able to hold the glass water dribbling down his chin he tried to put it on the table didnt protest when milo took it drug paper wrong customer moeron but what do i give a flying tear up the place its rented anyway rented from you said milo triage properties thats a medical term interesting choice for a doingbusinessas mysonthedoctors idea the old man put his hands together and closed his eyes triage repeated milo dba the peninsula group dba northern lights investments northern lights traces to excalibur properties which traces to revelle recreation which traces to brookehastings entertainment your old skin biz before that your old manureandmeat biz you musta really liked the name giving it to wife number two and the socalled charitable institution you established in san francisco rehab for street girls what junior treating their vd and doing their abortions and helping the cute ones get into dancing you prefer welfare so what else did junior do that year practice his surgical technique the old mans hands shook a bit go ahead moeron finish then go back to your boss and tell him you found nothing then go fuck yourself id rather talk about what bakersfield san francisco nice towns both you wanna know where to eat i got recommendations milo touched his gut food isnt what i need no said the old guy youre a fat fuck heres a tip lay off the meat look what happened to me he reached up with effort flicked a chickenskin jowl it fluttered as if paper big meat eater were you said milo oh yeah meat meat meat a purplish tongue tip cruised along a gray lip i ate the best ate the fat too every bit now my arteries and everything else are clogged and i gotta sit here and put up with moerons like you tough said milo the old man laughed you give a flying huh milo smiled so the new kidney making life any easier the gray lips turned white i also want to talk about junior said milo his sudden holiday fuck off we also served paper for his place in beverly hills alleged medical offices except the only thing we found in there were rooms full of porn videos ready for shipping smiling again and that operating room must have cost a fortune the old man pushed a button on the wheelchairs arm and the contraption began reversing slowly milo held it in place and the chair whined wheels scraping the carpet were still talking mr kruvinski i want a phone i got a right to a fucking phone what rights youre not being arrested leggo of the chair sure said milo pushing another button he locked the tires youre in big trouble pigass said the old man lemme see that paper milo gave him the warrant again and he unfolded it i need my glasses milo stood there gimme my glasses do i look like armand cursing and squinting the old man held the warrant at arms length with palsying hands the arms lost their strength and the paper slipped and fell to the floor i picked it up and tried to give it to him he shook his head you guys are no good rotten no honor oh yeah said milo honor among thieves spare me what do you want just to talk then get yourself a psychiatrist milo grinned at me fuck off clown why so hasty kruvinski maybe we could help each other in hell maybe there too milo leaned over him dont you godfather types make a big thing about gratitude youre looking at the guy who saved juniors life something flickered behind the cloudy eyes unfortunately i couldnt save hope devane or your grandnephew little casey but i did get the guy who did them stopped him before he got to junior the clouded eyes were wide now unblinking who gimme a name milo placed a finger on kruvinskis lips gently that doesnt mean im going to forget about what junior did which you can bet the scumbag will use as his defense odds are any jurys going to sympathize with him especially one of our idiot la juries or we wont even have a trial cause the da will pleabargain it down meaning sooner or later the scumbags gonna be out and guess who hes gonna be looking for so unless junior plans to stay on vacation forever hes gonna be looking over his shoulder a lot the old man smiled i give a right said milo youre don corleone silence so what do you want from me i need to know if junior operated on anyone else for your sake and what was the connection between hope and your family whyd you pay her allowance silence its gonna come out better we let the prosecution have it before the defense yeah said the old man were all on the same side he tried to spit produced only a belch god forbid said milo soft conversation drifted from the kitchen then loud snaps cops opening and closing cabinets shaddup screeched the old man to no effect your people are all gone said milo some people armand and little miss anna the former storm breeze closest she ever came to an rn was playing one in that movie of yours head nurse junior teach her the fundamentals of renal care no answer little blur between reality and fantasy mr k like juniors beverly hills office all those diplomas business cards advertising fertility medicine but no patients anything to make the kid feel important huh the old man spat milo stretched and looked around that operating room those dialysis machines a clinic for one man at least junior had his fling at medicine over in santa monica because the chance of him ever practicing again when all this comes out is zippo assuming the scumbag lets him live kruvinski didnt speak for a long time push me outside he finally said under that tree waving a claw hand toward the olivegreen drapes what tree said milo behind the curtains moeron open em get me out in the air in the shade of the oak he said gimme a name dont know your own donors name i dont know any donor you could be forced to submit to a checkup on what grounds im sure the defense will find one good luck gnarled hands rested in his lap the jaws worked faster how many other kidneys has junior harvested for you youre crazy fine said milo play hardtoget other victims start coming forward juniors going to be in the hot seat and the scumbagll start looking like a hero maybe you dont care about hope just another hookers kid but little casey try explaining that to his grandma your sister sonia san francisco cops told me you bailed him out of those methmanufacturing busts at berkeley smoothed his record got hope to sponsor him into grad school which wasnt that big of a stretch he was a smart kid top of his class just like hope just like junior but look where it got all of them the old man looked up through the tree a hairline of light had pierced the branches creating a hot white scar down the center of his degraded face when it comes out that casey died because of his association with junior how are you gonna explain that to your sister sonia and caseys mommy her daughter cheryl they trusted their baby to you how you gonna explain why hes cooling in the coroners fridge instead of writing his thesis the old man gazed out at the pool the black bottom gave it a mirrored surface no visibility of the depths ten years ago black bottoms had been the thing then a few kids fell in and no one noticed them family ties said milo but don corleone took care of his people my son is said the old man youll never have such a son amen the cloudy eyes popped fuck you coming in here thinking you know

after that he crossed his index fingers family helped him with what he had a accident memorial day picnic i threw it every year for the employees big barbecue on my land near the kern river hot dogs sausage the best steaks from the plant smiling like i said i ate the best he licked his lips again and his head lolled as if he was dozing off then it snapped up he flinched i tried to picture him swaggering bullnecked and muscular into the slaughterhouse late at night swinging the bat at trussed hogs we had races he said nearly inaudible potatosack threelegged i hired a band flags all over the

time on she was a queen and she was a princess cutest little blond thing coulda been a movie star but i said using the brain was better i started this prize for science they earned it mike was always straight as never needed help on the homework track and field swimming baseball you name it gotta fourteen hundred on his sat test so thats it mr cop nothing dirty smart kids being smart until mike got himself into trouble in seattle healthy color finally came into the old mans face a pinkening around the edges of his mouth clarity in the eyes the health benefits of anger moerons whatd he do take some stiff and try to get something good outta it minor technicality the stiff wasnt dead what no brain waves and its ready to get up and do the fucking mamba bullshit it was dead as your dick they do it every day what do you think they give the medical students to practice on their fucking girlfriends stiffs they give em they got hundreds of em stored pickled like pigs feet they take em apart throw out the crap they dont want like garbage so what was mikes crime not filling out the right forms big fucking deal it was a putup job they didnt like him from day one cause he was too smart

medical care mikes a goddamn fine doctor vocational training said milo so they could get fucked by perverts who paid you the old man made another unsuccessful attempt to spit you know everything moeron if they were being abused how come the city never charged us with nothing because the city knew we got em off the welfare rolls those with talent we encouraged to go onstage so what others we sent to school i musta sent fifteen twenty girls to college secretarial school what the fuck did you ever do for society nothing said milo exaggerating a grimace just a civilservant leech you got that right whyd mike switch from surgery to gynecology i said he liked delivering babies he delivered hundreds of em how many lives you ever brought into the world deliveries and abortions i said and sterilizations so what you dont believe a ladys got a right to choose whered he go after the residency at fidelity hospital milo said back to me helping me with the business taking care of the girls

no veins left listening to myself pee all day one day i pass out wake up mike tells me i dont need to be on the machine anymore just like that just like that what did hope have to do with it who says anything she visit you after the operation why not casey too why not what did casey have to do with the operation who says anything and thats all im putting up with from you so fuck off waving a hand wheres mike hiding out no answer the old country nothing he planning on ever coming back no answer the old man closed his eyes suit yourself said milo getting up but you still got a problem the old man kept his eyes shut smiled problems can be solved back home i wondered how the case would resolve the das office thought the castingoffice thing was cute but maybe meaningless because all it proved was that muscadine had a scar on his back the wheels of a bicycle found in muscadines garage fit the tracks at the murder scene but it was a common tire muscadines assault upon paige bandura was fortunate because it gave them something to hold him on while the search for more evidence continued would he walk on four murders rape too because the more i thought about tessa bowlbys terror and mental deterioration the surer i was that hed done something to her hope had been there for her no one was now had she withdrawn her complaint at the hearing because muscadine terrorized her further id called her parents home several times yesterday and today no one had picked up and id also left messages with dr emerson he couldnt talk about his patient but i had facts for him the phone rang dr delaware my name is ronald oster im the public defender representing mr reed muscadine okay mr muscadine has requested to talk to you why mr muscadine understands that you consulted to the police on this case and in that capacity youve already interviewed him he believes your psychological knowledge will help the court understand his motivation you want me to help him develop a diminishedcapacity defense pause not necessarily doctor but youre looking for some kind of psychological excuse for what he did not an excuse dr delaware motivation and after what was perpetrated upon mr muscadine mental anguish would be significant wouldnt you say so oster knew about the kidney theft milod said the da was holding back waiting to see how the case shaped up what would be used as evidence and have to be turned over under the discovery rules meaning muscadine had told his lawyer about the surgery but muscadine still had no idea who the recipient was and if the da chose not to use the information keeping the old man under wraps and if oster didnt ask the right questions the details might never come out but the defenses problem could be turned back on the prosecution too because if muscadine didnt confess openly direct proof of his guilt was lacking no weapons no witnesses no physical evidence how much to use how much to hide leah schwartz the assistant da was still going around with it still talking plea bargain or even dismissal fortyeight hours to file or release muscadine on bail did osters call mean he didnt yet appreciate the weakness of the case against his client he said so will you see him dr delaware i dont think so why conflict of interest hed expected the answer and his response was rich with malicious joy okay dr delaware then i seriously suggest you think about this if i subpoena you as an expert witness youll get paid if i subpoena you and you dont cooperate i still get you deposed and in court but as a regular witness and you dont receive one thin dime sounds like youre threatening me no just laying out the contingencies for your sake its good to know someones looking after my interests i said have a nice day i phoned milo and told him he said figures leah said your name came up today when she was talking to oster apparently muscadine told him about your visit and osters making a big deal about having a psychologist investigate muscadine as evidence that we knew all along he was under mental strain so now he wants to use you its an old tactic coopt the other sides consultant as your own if he cant turn you around he tries to humiliate you on the stand and reduces your usefulness to us has muscadine been charged yet no but there has been progress cause this morning we found a nice big cache of steroids in his apartment no doubt thatll be part of the defense too if it gets that far druginduced rage but at least it buys us some more jail time despite that leahs still thinking about a plea bargain because shes worried a jury will have sympathy for muscadines ordeal what about kathy dinapoli i said if he killed her just because she saw him with mandy wright there wouldnt be much sympathy for that yeah but weve got no evidence on kathy when i mention her name he gives that charming actors smile but thats all whats the plea bargain manslaughter on hope only leahll demand voluntary oster will demand involuntary theyll work something out if the case is that weak why would oster bargain at all he might not leahs keeping big mickys identity close to the vest for now but she may pull it out to scare muscadine walk free turkey and the mob goes for you shes hoping thatll convince muscadine to accept a reduced sentence at a federal prison under protection sweet deal for four coldblooded murders i said but doesnt osters calling me mean he thinks the case is stronger than it is hard to say hes one of those brandnew hotshots grew up on perry mason thinks hes smarter than he is what leahs really worried about is hell motion to get the whole thing dismissed on insufficient evidence and succeed if we could find a weapon anything physical but so far no luck the only knives at muscadines place were for spreading butter and no guns at all to match locking the guys covered his tracks starving actor i said then something hit me when i spoke to mrs green his landlady she told me she kept a gun around the house for protection she also told me muscadine took care of her dog when she was gone meaning he had access to her house what if instead of buying a gun he decided to borrow one borrowed it and put it back why not he wouldnt want to alarm mrs green and ill bet she registered it so even if its missing you could make a point for muscadine being the only one with access and ballistics might have something to say about the bullet pulled out of lockings head being compatible with that model it wouldnt convict him but it might tenderize him a bit it is a long shot but why not mrs green yeah ive got her on my tocall list it took fifteen minutes for him to phone back and this time there was melody in his voice american derringer model one takes longrifle ammo which is exactly what was pulled out of lockings head she hadnt fired it since she took shooting lessons two years ago and muscadine did have a key to her house she ran to look for the gun found it in the kitchen drawer where she left it but it looked cleaner than she remembered freaked her out i told her not to touch it and she said she wouldnt touch it with a tenfoot pole he cleaned it i said too smart for his own good lets not celebrate yet but im going over in person to pick it up take it to ballistics thank you your excellency salaam salaam so what do i do about pd oster shine him on two hours later he said ballistics match and deputy da schwartz would like to have a word with you i knew leah schwartz from a previous case young and smart with curly blond hair huge blue eyes and sometimes a sharp tongue she came on the phone sounding ready to run a marathon hi again thanks for the gun tip i should put you on retainer talk is cheap she laughed sos the city in terms of ronnie oster maybe you should talk to him especially now that weve got the why because up to now muscadines refused to say a word about the crime maybe you can get him to spill if he does its confidential not if oster uses you on the stand or even deposes you because discovery goes both ways now thanks to the voters so once oster opens up the door about muscadines mental status i can crossexamine you and get anything you learn out in the open and if oster doesnt put me on the stand why wouldnt he because im no fan of diminished capacity and i wont testify muscadine was insane oster knows that thats probably why he mentioned mental anguish not dim cap and ill grant muscadine his anguish the bastard was harvested if you get up there and talk about mental anguish well have big fun on cross getting into all the details another thing you can do is write a report if oster doesnt have the smarts to specifically ask you not to do it the minute you have a chance because once its written down it exists as discovery material if oster puts you on his witness list or uses you in the preliminary hearing lets say to get special housing for muscadine in the psych ward your work product is probably fair game probably well squabble but ive got confidence i dont know leah no ones asking you to lie the guy was anguished but not enough to excuse four murders and the way things are going we can only present two of them devane and locking to the jury i dont know about you but the thought of mandy wright and the dinapoli woman never coming to light doesnt do much for my appetite you can make a difference here use your therapeutic skills open muscadine up its not like youd be forcing yourself on him they invited you hell oster pressured you open his client up wide enough i can probably get a warrant to xray him what if he confesses oster tells me to put nothing in writing and never puts me on the stand then we lose nothing you make some expertwitness money we go with the bike and the gun and see how far we can take it but i think you can get him to use you examine muscadine and tell oster the truth his clients been through hell but dont call oster right away to say yes that would look too cute wait a day or two then be reluctantly willing so im a pawn she laughed for justice dr albert emerson got back to me that evening just after nine tessa tried to commit suicide he said in that same youthful voice now sobered ive got her on a seventytwohour hold at flint hills cottages know where it is la canada thats the one their adolescent inpatient units one of the better ones howd she do it i said cut her wrist serious or cry for help she really sawed so serious her father stopped the bleeding damn i called you because i was worried about her i called you back because i appreciate that and so do the parents they like you whatd you want to tell me that i believe tessa about the rape i thought she needed to hear that from someone why now i cant say legal complications oh he said the guy got caught for another one lets just say shes been validated okay ill find out from my da wife she may not know its really a ticklish situation as soon as i can be open i promise i will fair enough hold on the father wants to speak with you a moment later doctor walt bowlby here sorry to hear about tessa thank you sir his words dragged dr emerson says shell pull through what can i do for you i was just checking in to see how tessa was doing his voice broke shes i guess i shouldve believed her about the rape no reason to blame your the funny thing is she seemed to be getting better spending more time with robbie having some fun then she just stopped didnt want to play with him anymore even be with him started to stay in her room all day with the door shut yesterday i went in to talk to her found her in the bathroom thank god anyway the reason i didnt call you is she didnt say anything more about the professor til today i was gonna call you about that but weve been pretty busy whatd she say today that the professor was her true friend because she was the only one who believed her that the bastard tied her up and forced her and no one understood what shed been through but the professor he tied her up yeah if i find him ill cut his balls off mr bowlby i know i know my wife tells me im stupid to even talk that way and i know shes right but the thought of his doing that to my little girl maybe theres a hell the main thing is tessas alive ill deal with the other stuff later anyway thanks for calling doc would it upset you if i came to talk to tessa for what just to tell her that i believe her too wouldnt upset me but youd have to check with dr emerson is he still there he went just down the hall want me to get him please if its no bother no bother at all im not doing much just hanging around i made it to glendale by tenthirty that night and la canada a few minutes later flint hills cottages was up verdugo road well into the foothills on the outskirts of a comfortable residential neighborhood marked only by a small white sign on an adobe gatepost the gate was open and the man in the guardhouse wore a blazer and tie and a practiced smile no central building just small haciendastyle bungalows at the end of a curving gravel drive tucked under hundredyearold sycamores and cedars soft outdoor lighting and bougainvillea trained to the walls gave the place the look of a stylish spa emerson had said tessa was in unit c and i found it directly across the parking lot and to the left the front door was locked and it took a while for a uniformed nurse to answer the bell dr delaware for tessa bowlby she gave me a doubtful look dr emersons waiting for me well hes in back i followed her through a butteryellow hallway new chocolate carpeting framed lithos with a tilt toward flowers a few rockconcert posters seven doors all locked at the end was a nursing station where a man sat charting he looked up and stood dr delaware al emerson he was in his early thirties with wavy brown hair trailing down his back and a thick brown beard squared meticulously at the bottom tweed hacking jacket brown wool slacks chambray shirt blue knit tie his grip was confident and quick thanks gloria he told the nurse and she left i read tessas name on the charts tab the ward was silent peaceful isnt it he said all the pain locked up for the night hows she doing shes starting to express regret which is good is her dad still here no he left a short while ago he was in with her but only for a minute or so tessas pretty mad at him for not believing her that didnt help but it goes a lot deeper it usually does he nodded appreciatively theyre very nice people wellmeaning sincere but simple not stupid just simple as opposed to tessa tessas as complex as they come creative imaginative artistic temperament likes to deal with existential issues in the best of circumstances shed be highmaintenance with this family its like giving a ferrari to a couple of perfectly competent ford mechanics fates little tricks i said ive seen my share will she talk to me i havent asked her yet why dont we find out just pop in on her the two times i tried she became highly anxious but now youve got something to tell her and my wife does know whats going on heard rumors of a student busted for the devane murder if hes tessas rapist it would be nice for her to know hes in custody it would be but the das keeping it quiet for a couple of days i could convince tessa to stay here for more than a couple of days she told me she likes it here finds it restful what if i talk to her and she gets agitated better here where i can deal with it worse comes to worst she freaks and i spend the whole night here grinning my job sure beats sitting with your feet up having a beer watching comedy central right i laughed he laughed too then turned serious want to give it a try can you keep it confidential shes got no phone and i aint known as a blabbermouth all right i said good he said come on shes in three effort had been taken to make the room look homey white wallpaper stamped with pale blue wavelike abstractions real wood furniture a big window flowers in a vase but a closer look revealed padding under the paper no sharp edges on the furniture the light fixture allenbolted into the ceiling external wooden bars striping the window the vase was plastic and also bolted the flowers were real lilies lilies are related to onions nontoxic tessa sat on the bed reading the atlantic monthly other magazines were piled nearby she wore a gray university sweatshirt and denim cutoffs both other times id seen her shed been in all black her legs were long and skinny nearly as white as the walls a triangle of bandage peeked out from under her left sleeve she kept reading hunched vulnerability muscadine had read it as fair game hello again said emerson she looked up saw me and that same look of panic filled her eyes its all right tessa emerson said striding to her side dr delawares a good guy i vouch for him her lower lip shook i smiled she looked down at her magazine good article said emerson she didnt answer her chest was heaving emerson came closer and read over her shoulder reforestation of the eastern seaboard he read some more says here the trees are coming back on their own accord what theyre allowing in good news for a change tessa chewed her lip the trees are coming back because the economy sucks as industries close down people move out of small towns and the land regresses to wilderness oh said emerson so its what bad news or a mixed bag you tell me what do you think that i dont want to talk to him is it okay if he talks to you a bit about what emerson looked at me about what reed muscadine did to you i said i know its true muscadines scum and hes in jail her mouth dropped open why this is going to be tough to hear tessa but youll learn it soon enough hes the prime suspect in professor devanes murder her eyes got wild oh the word was as much animal cry as human speech oh oh oh she sprang up fingers in her hair crossing the threepace room returning and crossing again stopping said oh god god godrobbie what about robbie said emerson where is he back home with your mom tess how do i know why wouldnt he be she stretched her hands in front of her fingers curled tremoring the phone she exclaimed you want me to call home said emerson have your mom tell you robbies okay i want to call i want to speak to him its almost eleven tessa im sure robbies aslee i have to i need to please dr emerson let me call please please please sobbing oh please let me speak to my little robbie okay hon emerson tried to put his arm around her but she backed away confusion tugged at his blue eyes as he unlocked the door and let her out at the nursing station he got her an outside line and both of us watched as she dialed mom wheres robbie youre sure go check please mom please mom just do it she waited pulling at her hair blinking rolling her shoulders twisting the skin of one cheek shifting her feet emerson observed her with a mixture of pity and fascination youre suredid you check to see if hes breathing what im serious from the nursing station he let me hes right here yes no im not tired i was reading what soon soon yes youre sure hes okay mom i know i know you wouldnt sorry mom sorry for bothering what okay yes thanks sorry to bother you just take care of him take real good care of him loveyoutoo she put down the phone sighed buried her face looked up ill go back now in the room i said robbie was the wedge muscadine used on you he threatened to kill robbie unless you dropped the charge at the hearing she looked at me with what seemed like new respect nodded i didnt ask the next question why didnt you tell the police because i knew the answer shed told the police before had been sent away a liar his word against hers he cant hurt robbie now i said he cant hurt anyone wishing i were sure almost hoping muscadine would walk so that big micky could apply his own brand of justice god help me she slumped and began sobbing again emerson let her go on for a while gave her a tissue stepped back her pain was reflected in his eyes but he could tolerate it at the least i might have found someone to refer to finally she stopped and said he killed her because of me definitely not i said it had nothing to do with you it was between him and professor devane i wish i could believe that when the facts come out you will robbie she said you protected robbie i said at your expense she didnt answer did professor devane know about the threat headshake i couldnt i didnt want she understood me but i didnt want her didnt want anyone in my mess but you did tell her hed tied you up long silence long slow nod then she shocked me with a sudden bright smile emerson was caught offguard too he began twisting beard hairs what tessa he said so im a martyr she said finally i drove through quiet streets picturing the way it had happened muscadine charming her treating her well courtly even til they got to his place then turning overpowering her tying her up shed told hope hope had listened the expert listener cool supportive but the story had meant so much more to her than just another outrage hating muscadine thinking about him big strong healthy nice big kidney more than adequate for filtering garbage from the shrunken body of a man who considered her family sweet perfect being tied down she knew what that felt like though shed never tell tessa empathy had its limits ronald oster was too young to be that cynical maybe twentyeight with kinky flamered hair and rampant freckles he was soft around the middle and wore a vested blue suit one size too small i met him outside the county jail off to one side near the long line of women that forms every morning waiting to visit prisoners some of the women looked at us but oster paid them no notice as he gave me a long hard look and kept smoking his british oval so whyd you change your mind he said my own lawyer said you could force me as long as im going to waste my time i might as well get paid he kept staring at me speaking of which i said my fees three hundred seventyfive dollars per hour portaltoportal ill send you the bill and expect you to get it paid within thirty days i also expect a contract from you to that effect within three days i handed him my business card so its the money he said thumbing his vest pocket id rather not do it at all but if i have to it sure isnt for the love of your client he pressed the flat cigarette between his fingers lets get one thing clear doctor from this point on if you work for anyone on this case its for my client anything he says to you as well as anything i say to you about him falls under the purview of therapeutic confidentiality including this conversation once we have an agreement we do though in terms of payment im a civil servant all i can do is go through channels do your best and one other exception if your client threatens me in any way itll fall under tarasoff and ill report it immediately that threw him but he smiled tarasoff applies to threats against third parties no one says it cant apply to the therapist i sense hostility doctor selfpreservation why would my client threaten you they say hes murdered several times im just talking theoretically to make sure were clear about the rules do you get this clear with every attorney you work for i dont work much for attorneys ive heard you do lots of childcustody work when i do i work for the court i see so youre afraid of mr muscadine why i have no specific fear of him but im careful lets say i dont come to the conclusions he wants me to if he has murdered all those people its an indication he doesnt take well to disappointment disappointment he flicked away the cigarette thats a mild way to describe loss of a vital organ i looked at my watch he said essentially the man was raped dr delaware how does he claim it happened ill let him tell you that if i let him talk to you at all even if i dont youll get the contract and a check for your time today meaning i already belong to you and cant cooperate voluntarily with the police he smiled fine i said looking at my watch again far as im concerned the less i have to do with any of this the better he hooked a thumb in his vest the line of waiting women inched past us this he said may not work out up to you im interested in your professional opinion because i think its a clear case of mental anguish like what battered wives go through but im not sure given your history with the police that youll render an impartial opinion if i get data ill render if you want someone you can play ventriloquist with im not your man he looked at my card i hear a clear prosecution bias have it your way you dont lean toward the other side he said i keep an open mind if you want a whore drive down hollywood boulevard and flash a twenty his freckles deepened in color and the skin between them turned pink he gave a deep laugh thats good i like that okay youre my guy because his mental anguish is so obvious even youll see it and getting someone like you to testify to that will be all the more impressive a police consultant he held out his hand and we shook some of the women in line watched and i could only imagine what they were thinking lets go meet reed he said and dont worry he cant hurt you therapy said muscadine smiling and flipping his long hair quite a luxury for a starving actor ever had any therapy i said just the mind games they put you through in acting class probably shouldve though whys that my obvious emotional problems which is what youre here to establish right i want to know as much as i can about you reed thats kind of flattering he smiled and flipped his hair again he was in street clothes a black tshirt and jeans but behind glass a few days of incarceration hadnt hurt his looks and his muscles were still huge and welldefined pushups in the cell probably he was big enough to defend himself the deputy in the corner of the visiting room turned toward us muscadine smiled at him too and he showed muscadine a khaki back how are they treating you i asked not bad so far of course im a model prisoner no reason not to be shall i tell you about my mother she really was a piece of work eventually i said but first tell me about your love for animals the smile left his face and returned stiffer i could hear a director shout loosen up go with the feeling reed well he said crossing his legs they do love me i know the reason im asking is the day i visited you i noticed how well you got along with mrs greens bullmastiff samantha and i are good buddies mrs green said samanthas very protective of her she is but not around you i lived there he said i belonged but yes youre right i do have a special rapport with animals probably cause they sense im at ease with them did you have lots of pets as a child no he said mom she wouldnt let you have any he shook his head never whitetoothed snarlsmile mom was an extremely neat woman and after you left home how old were you by the way college eighteen ever return home not a chance i did you get any pets once you were living on your own couldnt the places i rented wouldnt let me then my job got in the way accounting he nodded the old ninetofive it wasnt fair to leave an animal alone all day when i went back to school and got serious about acting same thing i did do some work as a groomer for a while really yeah just for a few months one of those mobile van things one of the many things i did in order to pursue my craft starving actor yes i know im a cliché but so what so am i i guess la shrink he chuckled so i said grooming must have increased your skills with animals definitely you learn how to touch them how to speak to them with animals ninetynine percent is nonverbal communication you feel right about yourself theyll feel right about you and working with them you learn to read them to know which ones are hostile which are friendly exactly nonverbal i said interesting was hope devanes rottweiler easy to read he looked at his feet flipped his hair were going to get right into it any reason not to i dont know he said oster says i should talk freely to you but hes just a pd you dont have confidence in him he seems fine but you dont trust him sure i do twenty feet farther than i can throw him another whitetoothed grin which is about fifteen feet more than id trust most lawyers actually hes smarter than i expected from a civil servant and whats my choice i am a starving actor i jotted down notes looked back up at him the rottweiler i said howd you handle her she was a bitch wasnt she very much so smile gave her some meat sprinkled with paregoric through the gate he nodded she just took it from you just like that he said amazingly easy because id driven and walked by the house when she was out in the yard and she barked plenty but she must have smelled the meat because the minute i started up the lawn she quieted and by the time i got to the gate she was sitting there with her tongue out lapped it up was this during the day or at night at night maybe eight oclock the night professor devane was killed use the passive voice keep him at ease nod was anyone home i said they both were big smile that was the beauty of it the street was so dark those big trees no one walking i leaned my bike against the tree walked up their front lawn gave the meat to the dog and just rode away long silence finally he said so easy i nodded you came back later yes when around ten because that was the time of her nightly walk the smile dropped off she walked between tenthirty and eleventhirty same route black sweats one night gray the next black gray black gray like a machine i didnt know if shed walk without the dog or call it off but she did does that tell you the kind of person she was the poor rotties barfing its guts out and she just goes about her routine if shed veered offschedule who knows i might never have gone through with it really he stared at me broke into the widest grin yet nah eventually it would have happened in the script huh he looked down at his feet again yes thats a good way to put it if you dont mind lets back up a bit reed to what mandy wright mandy who i smiled crossed my legs she bothers you more than devane no he exhaled what do you want to know tell me what happened how she set you up he cracked his knuckles loud enough for the deputy to turn around flipped his hair combed his fingers through it let it cascade around his handsome face and flipped it once more the deputy turned again frowned faced the wall muscadine said whew still hard to talk about i said yeah you hit the nail on the head the basic issue is the setup that fucking committee hearing the blood test exactly devane hated my guts for whatever reason must have decided right then to harvest me incredible isnt it like a bad dream for months i was walking around in a nightmare tell me about it the nightmare everything starting with mandy mandy he said mandy the working cunt she told me her name was desiree did you know her before you met at club none no but i knew hundreds like her how la woman he said like that doors song did she pick you up in retrospect she must have at the time i thought i was picking her up where club none you go there often once a week or so i was taking some night acting classes in brentwood used to drive home on sunset sometimes i dropped in and had a beer they must have been watching me stalking me he started to cry covered his face shit he said through gigantic fingers to be preythe violation spooky i said sickening he looked up i nodded the degradation he said they cheapened me i wouldnt treat a dog that way i let him compose himself so you went into club none and saw mandy desiree and she was at the bar we made eye contact she smiled bent over showed me her tits luscious tits i went over sat down chatted her up we moved to a table i bought her a drink had myself another beer we talked next thing her hands on my knee and shes saying lets go back to my place smiling its happened to me before did you go to her place we never got there she must have slipped something in my beer cause the last thing i remember is getting into my car and then god i still cant believe they fucked me like that big shoulders shook acting maybe maybe not then what reed then i woke up in an alley a block from my house with the goddamnedest pain in my back and the stink of garbage in my nose what time around four am it was still dark i could hear rats smell the garbage they dumped me like garbage i shook my head unbelievable kafka i tried to get up couldnt my back was starting to hurt like hell a throbbing dull pain right over my hipbone and it felt tight really tight as if i was being squeezed i reached around touched something gauze id been wrapped like a mummy then my arm started throbbing too and i managed to roll up my sleeve and saw a blackandblue mark a needle stick he touched his inner elbow at first i thought someone had screwed with my head too given me dope though i couldnt figure out why later i realized it was the anesthesia i was woozy nauseous started to throw up heaved my guts for a long time finally i managed to stand made it to my apartment somehow and collapsed slept all day when i woke up i was still in the dream and the pain was unbearable and i knew i had a fever i drove myself to the free clinic and the doctor took off the bandage and this look came on his face like how can you be walking around then he told me youve been operated on man dont you remember i started to freak out he held up a mirror so i could see the stitches like a fucking football he played with his hair some more rubbed his eyes shook his head oh man it was like you have no idea no idea the violation fritz lang hitchcock this hippie doctors telling me ive had surgery and im saying no way he must have thought i was nuts hitchcock i said the classic plot line innocent man gets caught up only the star hadnt been told the star had been improvised on horrible i said beyond horror splatter cinema then i started to remember things desiree mandy us getting into my car her leaning over to me kissing jamming her tongue down my throat then fade to black boom he put the palm of one hand over his eyes the free clinic doctors saying calm down man youve got a fever better check into the hospital did the doctor say what kind of operation youd had i asked he asked me if id had kidney disease and when i said no what the hell are you talking about he took an x ray and told me thats when he said i should be in the hospital did you check yourself in with what i dont have insurance what about county no he said place is a zoo and i didnt want any more documentation i didnt want to go anywhere because i was already thinking about getting back at them about regaining my selfrespect it was only desiree mandy at that point but i knew shed just been the bait did you suspect professor devane no not yet i didnt suspect anyone but i was damned well going to find out so whatd you do wangled a prescription for painkillers and antibiotics from the free clinic doc and went home you werent worried hed report it he said he wouldnt theyre cool over there so you went home to recuperate telling mrs green it was a back injury what about the stitches he winced i took them out myself must have been tricky dosed myself up with the painkiller rubbed neosporin all over and used a mirror it hurt like hell but i wasnt going to have anyone else knowing so you never saw another doctor never i shouldve the scars all fucked up keloided one day when i can afford it ill have it fixed i wrote some more its still tough to talk about he said i can imagine oster asked me if id experienced mental anguish i had to control myself from laughing in his face no kidding i said nodding talk about understatement okay lets move on howd you find mandy a few weeks later when i could walk i went back to the club and saw the waitress whod served us he put his hands behind his neck flexed to the sides back and forward stiff i stretch each morning but it must be damp in the walls its an old building i said so you saw the waitress then what he dropped his hands and moved closer to the glass smiled stretched again i waited until she was offshift she parked out in back in the alley poetic justice huh i was a regular alley cat meow meow he scratched the glass partition the deputy turned looked at the wall clock and said twenty more minutes so she came out to the alley after work i said and i was there waiting grin being the hunter is so much better than being the prey i put a hand over her mouth a knee in the small of her back so she lost her balance twisted her arm up behind her hammerlock dragged her behind a dumpster and said im going to remove my hand honey but if you make a sound ill fucking kill you she started to breathe hard hyperventilating i said shut up or ill cut your fucking throat even though i didnt have a knife or anything else then i said all i want is information about the girl i was with a few weeks ago desiree and she said i dont know any desiree and i said maybe thats not her name but you remember her remember me cause id left a big tip i always do waitering myself she still tried to deny it and i said let me refresh your memory she was wearing a tight white dress drinking a manhattan and i was drinking a sam adams cause i know from waitering that sometimes its the drink you remember not the customer she said i remember her but i dont know her so i twisted her arm a little bit more and covered her mouth and nose cutting off her air she started to strangle and i let go and said come on honey whos she to you to suffer for because id seen the way she and mandy were acting friendly was sure they knew each other she cried stalled got choked off some more finally told me her real name was mandy she was from vegas and thats all she knew honest i twisted the arm almost to the breaking point but all she did was whimper and say please believe me thats all i know so i said thanks put my hand around her throat and squeezed because she was a witness that and because shed been part of it the entire club was contextually i shouldve gone back and bombed the whole fucking building maybe i wouldve if if i wasnt here the deputy consulted the clock again mandy from vegas i said so you went there i had time he said nothing but id dropped out of school to get the embassy row part then lost it because of the scar only that before they saw the scar they loved me it was cable and i was just getting scale but to me it wouldve been major wealth id already been thinking of moving to a new place maybe a nice rental near the beach his jaw clenched and his mouth tightened so you went to vegas i said howd you get there took the bus went from casino to casino figuring a whore that goodlooking would be working out of one of them and i was right you know thats the amazing thing about all of this what is how easy it is finding people finding and taking care of them i mean id never even come close to doing anything like that to anyone before i handled the girl in the alley he snapped his fingers ive had harder parts to play was mandy easy too easier because i had even more motivation and she made it easy driving around in a ferrari convertible ostentatious little bitch right there in the open i watched her park it at a casino give the valet a big tip miss hotshot i followed her watched her for two days found out where she lived waited until she came home alone and surprised her same way i said hand over the mouth knee in the back why mess with a good thing she was stupid enough to have her keys out so i just opened the door and got her inside her apartment she was loopy to begin with stoned on something probably coke because her nose was a little raw i put my knife across her throat and told her id filet her like a monkfish if she made a peep this time you brought a knife definitely it had to be a knife didnt it oh yeah flipping his hair because reciprocity synchronicity like that police song they cut me i cut them makes sense i said makes perfect sense all i had to do to remember how much sense it made was to try a toetouch or a situp and feel the pain in my back thinking about embassy row and what might have been his eyes turned to slits moving closer to the glass again he said they say you only need one kidney i can live til a hundred but having only one makes me vulnerable what if i get an infection and lose the one so it was time to make mandy feel vulnerable not feel be be i echoed what next she pissed her panties miss tough call girl i tied her up with some bicycle bungee cords id brought hogtied her began the interrogation she claimed all she knew was that a psychology professor from the u had hired her to pick me up slip a mickey in my drink that she hadnt known why as if that excused it i said which professor and she tried to hold back on me i covered her mouth and pinched her nose the way id done with the waitress and she blurted out the name which i already knew because what other psychology prof hated me did she say how she knew devane yes she said devane had hired her for sex games she called it she said hope was into kinky stuff bondage had seen her dance somewhere up in san francisco and picked her up sick huh a psychologist that twisted then what then i untied her and said thanks for being honest with me baby to disarm her psychologically then i took her back outside in front of her house told her i was going to let her go if she kept her mouth shut she looked so relieved she actually thanked me tried to kiss me showing tongue it reminded me of how shed kissed me in my car just before the lights went out no one was on the street so i took hold of her hand held it still so she couldnt touch me then i gave her the knife where first in the heart because theyd broken my heart by looting my body robbing me of my entire future then in her cunt because shed used her cunt to trap me then i put her on the ground and turned her over and stabbed her in the back just like shed done to me right over her kidney he reached behind and winced never really knew where the kidney was before still painful i said sitting is painful he said how much more time do we have ten minutes so once youd learned hopes name from mandy it was time to take care of her too you bet and you used the same strike pattern heart vagina back absolutely he said the only difference was that hope tried to struggle not that it helped her but it did mess me up id wanted to get the fucking surgeons name out of her but i was afraid shed manage to break free and scream so i just did it when did you learn the surgeons name not until last week when that kid attacked him and the news said hed known devane light bulb on two plus two so i started watching him too and got a bonus the punk casey locking my other judge i was never really sure if he was in on the plan but i suspected because he was sucking up to devane once i knew he was history i got his file from the psych department learned his address i already knew where cruvic lived because thats where id seen him with the punk his house up on mulholland so i started watching locking saving cruvic for last you bet tell me about locking another easy one its so easy probably harder to act it out definitely where was i locking locking i followed him home walked into the house and shot him why a gun and not a knife three reasons he said pleased to answer a i know cops are into mo and i didnt want it to be obvious that the same person had done him and the girls b stabbing was for the women it just didnt feel right for him and c id already gotten rid of the knife where tossed it off the santa monica pier you could have bought another one hey he said grinning starving artist what about the photos framing lockings body another bonus showing the world what she was like what they were all like do you believe that stuff sick so what was your plan to get cruvic him and the asshole using my kidney i figured to learn everything eventually perform a little surgery of my own take back what was mine the deputy said two minutes muscadine mouthed screw you to his back and smiled at me so howre we doing fine i said i appreciate your forthrightness hey only way to go tell the truth it feels good to finally unload oster was just outside the prisons main door the line was still long well he said well what i instructed him to cooperate he did what do you think gruesome ill say so does it fit does what fit is there severe mental anguish definitely i said shaking my head no shortage of anguish good he said great gotta go well talk more he hurried into the jail instead of returning home i drove to a restaurant on sixth street where i ordered lunch nice big one caesar salad tbone steak medium rare home fries creamed spinach their best burgundy by the glass while i waited for the food i opened my briefcase and took out a yellow pad as i sipped the wine i began psychological evaluationreed
