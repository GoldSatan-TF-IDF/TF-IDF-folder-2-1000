bed surrounded by machines people either both like man in the really wide view theyre the same far out who cares do i care shit maybe im already dead maybe theres life after life hmm maybe all the rest was a dream yeah sure and i wake up to thedarkstation what was that did you hear that did i hear that the dark station there it was again a noise like a train whistle something about to depart something about to begin or end or both something that is thedarkstation me or not me no know me new here no ask me the dark station oh all right metaphormosis one the dark station shuttered and empty echoed to the distant fading whistle of the departing train in the grey evening light the whistle sounded damp and cold as though the cloud of exhausted steam producing it had imparted some of its own character to the noise the mountains covered in their close dark weave of trees absorbed the sound like heavy cloth soaking up drizzle only the faintest of echoes came back reflected from where crags and cliffs and slopes of jumbled scree and fallen boulders broke the conformity of forest when the noise of the whistle had died away i stood for a while facing the deserted station reluctant to turn to the silent carriage behind me i listened trying to catch some last hint of the engines own busy noise as it steamed down the steep valley i wanted to hear its panting breath the busy clatter of its pistoned hearts the chatter of its valves and slides but though no other sound disturbed the valleys still air i could hear nothing of the train or its engine they were gone above the steeply pitched roofs and thick chimneys of the station stood out against the overcast sky black on grey some wisps of steam or smoke only slowly dissipating in the valleys moist chill air hung above the black slates and sootdarkened bricks an odour of burned coal and the damp used smell of steam seemed to cling to my clothes i turned to look at the carriage it was sealed locked from the outside and fastened with thick leather straps it was blackpainted funereal in the traces two nervous mares stamped at the leafstrewn road leading from the station they shook their dark heads and rolled their huge eyes their harnesses clinked and jingled rocking the carriage behind them slightly and from their flared nostrils issued clouds of steam equine impressions of the departed train i inspected the carriages shuttered windows and locked doors testing the tight leather strapping and pulling on the metal handles then i climbed to the drivers seat and took up the reins i stared at the narrow track leading into the forest i reached for the whip hesitated then put it back unwilling to disturb the valleys atmosphere of silence i took hold of the wooden brake lever in some strange inversion of physiology my hands were moist while my mouth was dry the carriage shook perhaps due to the restless movements of the horses the sky above was dull and grey and uniform the higher peaks around me were obscured somewhere above the tree line by the smooth mat of cloud their jagged summits and sharp ridges seemingly levelled by the soft clinging vapour the light was at once shadowless and pervasively dim i took out my watch and realised that even if all went well i was unlikely to finish my journey in daylight i patted the pocket containing my flint and tinder i could make my own light when that around me failed the carriage rocked again and the horses stamped and stirred craning their necks round eyewhites bulging i could delay no further i released the brake and urged the pair into a trot the carriage lurched and creaked rumbling heavily over the rutted road away from the dark station and into the darker forest the road climbed through the trees past small clearings and over hollowbellied wooden bridges in the darkness and the silence of the forest the torrents beneath the bridges were rushing oases of pale white light and chaotic noise the air grew steadily colder as we climbed the mares breath wreathed back around me thick with the smell of their sweat the perspiration on my own brow and hands was chill i reached into my coat for my gloves and my hand brushed against the thick grip of the revolver in my jacket i fastened my gloves drew my coat closer about me and as i tightened the belt of the garment was impelled to look again at the bindings and fastenings securing the carriage behind me in the gloom however it was impossible to tell whether the straps still held or not the way steepened between the thinning trees the mares laboured up the rutted track into the lower reaches of the dark grey overcast wisps of barely seen cloud mingling with and absorbing thier ghostly white breath the valley beneath was a formless black pit not a single light no fire or movement and no sound that i could detect issued from its depths a groan seemed to come from the carriage as we rolled into the enveloping clouds it lurched as a wheel struck and rolled over a rock in the track i patted the pistol concealed within my jacket determining that the groan i had heard was simply that of the carriages wooden couplings flexing against each other the cloud grew thicker the small stunted trees just visible at the sides of the rough track looked like the dwarfish deformed sentinels of some phantom fortress i stopped in the mist on a level length of the track the carriage lamps produced when the flames had steadied two cones of light which did little to illuminate thp ground far beyond the sweatslicked tossing heads of the mares but the lamps hiss was somehow purposeful and comforting in their glare i again checked the carriage bindings some had loosened doubtless due to the roads many corrugations and stony obstacles i turned the lamps in their sockets pointing them forward again once my inspection was completed their diffused beams encountered the damp vapour like contrary shadows obscuring more than they revealed the carriage rose through the clouds and out of them following the increasingly broken surface of the track as it gradually levelled out and straightened heading through a narrow defile in the rocks where the mists slowly thinned the lamps on either side of me seemed to hiss more quietly and their beams became sharper we approached the saddle of the pass and the small plateau beyond the last tendrils of the mist stroked past the gleaming flanks of the horses and the strapped sides of the carriage like nebulous fingers reluctant to let us go above the stars shone grey peaks rose into blackness on either side jagged and alien the confined plateau was steel grey under the bright stars dark shadows spread from the rocks on either side of us where the beams of the lamps struck them the clouds behind formed a hazy ocean lapping at the sharp islands of distant peaks rising from it i looked back to see those summits on the far side of the valley we had left and when i turned to the fore again immediately saw the lights of the oncoming carriage my initial start disturbed the mares causing them to shy and swerve i checked them immediately and urged them forward again calming my foolish heart as best i could and reproving myself for such nervousness the distant carriage twinlamped like my own was still some way off at the far end of the flattened crucible which formed the summit of the pass i settled the revolver further into my inner pocket and flicked the reins sending the gasping mares into a slow trot which even on that level surface they struggled to maintain the opposing set of lights flickering yellow stars come down to earth wavered their approach quickening near the centre of the plateau in the midst of the boulderfield our carriages slowed the road through the pass was broad enough for only a single vehicle the larger rocks and stones having been cleared to each side to provide a way through the broken terrain a small passing place an oval area where a width of road greater than a single carriage had been swept from the surrounding rubble lay equidistant between my own carriage and that approaching i was now able to discern the two white horses pulling the vehicle and despite the glare of the flickering lamps make out an indistinct figure seated on the drivers box i reined the mares in letting them amble slowly forward so that our two carriages would meet at the passing place my counterpart appeared to anticipate me and also slowed it was at that instant that a strange unnamable fear gripped me a sudden and uncontrollable spasm of shivering ran through me as if an electric charge had struck my body some lightning bolt invisible and silent leaping from that clear still sky our carriages reached the opposite ends of the small passing area i swerved to the right the carriage facing me went to its left so that our teams faced one another each blocking the others way they stopped even before i and the other driver reined them in i pulled back clicking with my tongue persuading the animals to reverse the other carriage also retreated i waved at the shadowy figure on the other vehicle trying to indicate i would go to the left this time allowing him to pass on my right he waved simultaneously our carriages stopped i was unable to determine whether the gesture by the other driver was meant to show he agreed to proceed or not i pulled the two panting mares to my left again the other carriage moved as though to block me but so immediately that it appeared we had moved simultaneously once more defeated again i stopped the two mares they faced their ghostly opposites across a clear space of air which was filled by their joined breaths i decided that rather than retreat on this occasion i would hold my own carriage steady and wait for the other driver to do so thus enabling me to pass the other carriage remained quite stationary an increasing unease caused my whole frame to stiffen i felt impelled to stand up shading my eyes from the glare of the sputtering lamps and attempting to see the driver facing me across this short but frustratingly impassable distance between us i saw the other man rise to his feet as well for all the world as though he was my own reflection i would have sworn that he too raised one hand to his eyes just as i had done i remained still my heart beat quickly within my chest and the strange clamminess i had experienced on my hands before returned even within my hide gloves i cleared my throat and hailed the man on the opposite carriage sir if you please go i halted the other driver had spoken and stopped speaking just at the moment i had started and then stopped his voice was not an echo he did not speak the words i spoke and i was not even sure that he had spoken the same language but the tone had been similar to my own a nervous fury gripped me i waved violently to the right he gesticulated at the same moment to his left right i shouted as he too called out i remained standing for a moment unable to pretend to myself that the tremor which ran through me then was any sort of reaction to the physical temperature i trembled i did not shiver and as much to take the weight from my now unsteady legs as to proceed with my just decided course i sat down quickly without looking directly at my opponent for so i now thought of this person apparently determined to prevent my progress i took up the whip and cracked it over the mares guiding them left i heard no other whip crack but the pair of white horses facing me reared like my own pair then swerved to their right so that the four beasts rushed momentarily towards each other before they reared once more forelegs rising harnesses jangling heads and flailing legs almost touching crying out standing again cracking the whip over them i pulled them back attempted to pass the other carriage on its opposite side again i was thwarted the carriage facing me seeming to mirror my every action i drew the nervous headtossing mares back at last facing the equally disturbed pair on the other side of the rockcleared oval space my hands were shaking and a cold sweat had broken on my brow i squinted ahead desperate to see just who my strange adversary was but above the glare of the carriage lamps there was only the faintest outline of a figure and the face was quite invisible there was no mirror i was certain even this absurd possibility at that moment seemed more acceptable than anything else and besides the horses facing me were white not dark like the pair attached to my carriage i wondered what to do next i could see no alternative route through the pass the boulders and rocks which had been cleared to form the track had been piledup forming a makeshift wall half the height of a man on either side of the way even if i was able to find a gap the ground beyond would be so rough and broken as to remain impassable i put the whip away climbed down to the stony ground the other driver did the same i hesitated when i saw this the sensation of unattributable but intense unease striking me again almost involuntarily i turned and looked behind me past the sealed carriage down the road from the lip of the plateau to return to retrace my steps was unthinkable even had my purpose been mundane had i been some ordinary traveller merely intent on reaching a remote inn or distant town on the other side of the pass i would have been reluctant in the extreme to turn back i had seen no other tracks or roads deviating from the path i had taken from the station far below in the valley and i had heard of no other pass through these mountains within a days ride given the nature of my cargo and the urgency of my mission i had no choice but to continue on the way i had chosen under the pretence of pulling my collar tighter about me i pressed the bulk of my concealed revolver against my chest stealing myself trying to reach within my being to draw on whatever reserves of rationality and courage i could find it all but escaped my notice that the figure standing in the glare of the opposing lights seemed to mimic my movements also pulling on his lapels or collar before stepping forward the fellow was dressed something like myself in truth any other apparel in that frigid atmosphere would have invited a quick end his coat might have been a little longer his body a little more thick set than mine he and i came level with the shaking heads of our horses my heart was beating now with a rapidity and a ferocity i could not recall having experienced before a sort of horror drew me on made me walk towards this still notquiteseen figure it was as if some magnetic repulsion which before had kept our two carriages from meeting and passing had now been reversed and so sucked me inexorably forward drawing me towards something my heart made clear i feared or should fear utterly in the way some people are fatally attracted towards an abyss while standing on its very edge he stopped i stopped it was with a surging sense of relief a brief feeling of total and unalloyed joy that i saw this man did not have my own face his face was squarer than my own his eyes were closer together and deeper set and over his mouth there was a dark moustache he looked at me standing in the light of my lamps as i stood in the light of his and inspecting my face with i imagined the same intense and relieved expression i exhibited myself i started to speak but got no further than my good before i stopped the man had started to talk at the same time as i had some short word or phrase seemingly addressing me as i had been about to address him it was i was now sure a foreign tongue he used but i could not identify it i waited for him to speak again but he stood without speaking apparently studying my face we shook our heads at the same moment this is a dream i said quietly while he spoke softly in his own tongue this cannot be happening i continued this is not possible i am dreaming and you are something from within myself we fell silent together i looked at his carriage as he looked at mine his conveyance appeared to be the same type as my own whether his was sealed locked and strapped shut like mine whether its contents were as important and awful as those secured in my carriage i could not tell i stepped suddenly to one side he moved at the same instant as though to block me we stepped back i could smell the fellow now a strange odour of some musky perfume mingling with stale hints of a foreign spice or bulb his face wrinkled slightly exactly as if he were smelling something from my person something he found vaguely unsettling or distasteful one of his eyebrows flickered oddly just as i remembered my pistol i had the most absurd and fleeting mental picture of us pulling and firing our revolvers and the lead projectiles meeting and striking each other in mid air flattening into a perfectly circular coin of squashed metal my imperfect double smiled just as i did so myself we shook our heads this motion at least seemed not to require translating though it occurred to me that a similarly slow and thoughtful nodding of the head would have suited the situation just as well we each stepped back and looked around at the quiet cold barren landscape of that high place as though in its very desolation we might find something to inspire one of us or both i could think of nothing we each turned walked back to our carriages and climbed into our seats a dim figure in the shadow behind the uneven light of his carriages lamps as i no doubt was to him he sat motionless for a while then took up the reins just as i did with a sort of resigned shrug and a bending of the back and a grasping with one hand which looked like the motions of an old man and i mirrored him and i knew a sort of ancient bitterness a heaviness an icebrittle thickness which invaded me more deadly and intense than any airborne chill he tugged gently at the heads of his horses i signalled to mine in the same fashion we started to turn our carriages round using our own confined area of the small passing place edging back and forth and whistling together at our horses when we are level i decided square on like battling ships of the line i shall draw my gun and shoot i cannot go back no matter that he will not give way regardless of his determination i must go on i have no choice we slowly manoeuvred our awkward vehicles until they were abreast his like mine was locked shuttered strapped tight he looked at me and reached with an almost complacent slowness into his coat just as i did the same thing feeling past my jacket to the inside pocket and carefully withdrawing my gun would he remove his glove we each hesitated then he unbuttoned his glove at the wrist just as i did he laid the glove on the seat as his side then raised the gun to point at me he pulled the trigger just as i did there were two small clicks nothing more we each pulled the chambers open in the light of one lamp i could see the hammer in my gun had struck home on the base of the cartridge a tiny dent showed on the coppercoloured metal the round like his apparently had been damp or somehow badly made this happens occasionally he looked at me again and our smiles were sad we each put our revolvers back in our jackets then we turned our carriages fully round and i with my dread load and he with his rode back towards the valleys and the clouds then we both fire at the same time or at least we both pull the triggers at the same time but nothing happens both rounds are duds so we just smile at each other in a resigned sort of way i suppose and finish turning the carriages right round and then head back the way we came i stop talking dr joyce looks at me over his goldrimmed spectacles is that it he says i nod then i wake up just like that dr joyce sounds annoyed no more end of dream i tell him crisply emphatic dr joyce looks profoundly unconvinced i dont blame him really this is all a pack of lies and shakes his head in what may well be a gesture of exasperation we are standing in the centre of a room with six black walls and no furniture it is a rackets court and we are near the end of a game dr joyce fiftyish not unfit but a little puffy believes in sharing the pursuits of his patients where he can we both play rackets so rather than sit in his office we came here for a game ive been telling him my dream in instalments between points dr joyce is all pink and grey grey frizzy hair pink face and mottled greypink arms and legs poking out from his grey shorts and shirt his eyes however behind the goldrimmed chainsecured glasses are blue sharp hard blue and set in his pink face like fragments of glass stuck in a plate of raw meat he is breathing hard i am not perspiring profusely i only broke sweat in the last point and looking very suspicious as ive said with good reason you wake up he says i try to sound as annoyed as i can damn it man i cant control what i dream a lie the doctor issues a professional sigh and uses his fieldingracket to scoop up the ball he missed at the end of the last point he stares intently at the serving wall you to serve first orr he says sourly i serve followed by the doctor rackets is a game for two players each with two rackets a fieldingracket and a shotracket it is played in a hexagonal blackpainted court with two pink balls this last fact subjected to the unsubtle allotrope of humour which passes for wit on the bridge has resulted in rackets being known as the mans game dr joyce knows the game better than i do but he is shorter heavier older and less well coordinated i have been playing the game for only six months my physiotherapist recommended it but i win the point and the game easily enough fielding one ball while the doctor fumbles the other he stands panting glaring at me a very picture of pink pique youre sure theres no more he says positive i tell him dr joyce is my dream doctor he specialises in the analysis of dreams and believes that by analysing mine he will be able to discover more about me than i am able to tell him through any conscious effort i am an amnesiac using whatever he finds by this method he then hopes somehow to jog my delinquent memory back into action hoopla with one mighty leap of the imagination i shall be free i have been doing my honest best to cooperate with him in this noble venture for over half a year now but my dreams have always been either too vague to be accurately recalled or too banal to be worth analysing in the end not wanting to disappoint the increasingly frustrated doctor i have resorted to inventing a dream i rather hoped my dream of the sealed carriages would give dr joyce something to get his yellowgrey teeth into but from his peeved look and belligerent stance i get the impression that this is not the case he says thanks for the game my pleasure i smile in the showers dr joyce hits below the belt your ah libido orr quite normal he soaps his paunch i am rubbing foamy circles on my chest yes doctor hows yours the good doctor looks away i was asking in a professional capacity he explains wejust thought there might be some problems if youre sure his voice trails away and he steps under the stream of water to rinse off what does the good doctor want references showered and changed and after a call at the rackets club bar we take an elevator to the level where dr joyces consulting rooms are the doctor looks more at home in his grey suit and pink tie but he is sweating still i feel refreshed and cool in trousers silk shirt waistcoat and frock coat carried over one arm for now the elevator soft class leather seats pot plants hums as it climbs dr joyce goes to sit down on a bench by one wall near the attendant who is reading a paper the doctor takes out a slightly offwhite handkerchief and mops his brow so what do you think this dream means then orr i look at the newspaperreading attendant we three are the only people in the lift but i would have imagined that even a liftboys presence would be sufficient to prohibit what i thought was meant to be a confidential exchange that was why we were heading for the good doctors office i stare round at the elevators wooden panelling leather furniture and rather unimaginative seascape prints and decide that i prefer lifts with outside views ive no idea i say once i seem to remember i thought that what my dreams meant was exactly what dr joyce was supposed to tell me but the good doctor disabused me of this notion some time ago while i was still struggling to have dreams meaningful enough for him to get to work on but thats just it dr joyce says wearily you probably do know but i dont want to tell you i suggest dr joyce shakes his head no you probably cant tell me so why ask the elevator is slowing to a stop the doctors offices are about midway up the top half of the bridge equidistant from the always steamwreathed train deck and one of the often cloudentangled summits of the great edifice a man of no little influence his offices are on the outside of the main structure with one of those much sought after sea views we wait for the doors to open what you have to ask yourself orr dr joyce says is what this sort of dream means in relation to the bridge i look at him the bridge yes he nods youve lost me i tell him i dont sec what possible connection there can be between the bridge and my dream another doctorly shrug perhaps the dream is a bridge he muses as the inner doors slide back he takes out his travelpass to show the attendant perhaps the bridge is a dream well thats a great help i show the attendant my hospital identity bracelet then follow the good doctor along a broad carpeted corridor to his offices the identity bracelet on my right wrist is a plastic strap which contains some sort of electronic device detailing my name and residence it describes the nature of my affliction the treatment i am undergoing and the name of my doctor printed on the plastic strap is my name john orr this is not really my name it is the name i was given by the bridges hospital authorities when i arrived here john because it is a common inoffensive name orr because when i was fished out of the waters surging around one of the bridges great granite piers there was a large livid circular bruise on my chest an almost perfect circle stamped on my flesh and beyond i had six broken ribs it looked like an o orr was the first name starting with an o that occurred to the nurses charged with looking after me it is they who are by tradition allowed to name foundlings and as i was discovered without any form of identification this definition was extended to myself my chest i might add still aches on occasion as if that curious unexplained mark remained there in all its multicoloured splendour i need hardly add that i had also received head injuries originally presumed to be the cause of my amnesia dr joyce is inclined to attribute the ache which i experience in my chest to the same trauma which caused my amnesia he believes my inability to remember my past lifewas caused not so much by the head injuries i received as by some other perhaps linked psychological shock and that the answer to the question my amnesia poses is to be found in my dreams this is why hes taken me on i am an interesting case a challenge he will discover my past for me no matter how long it takes in the doctors outer office we encounter the appalling young man who is the doctors receptionist he is a breezy and bright fellow always ready with a joke or a quip ever willing to provide coffee or tea and to help people on or off with their coats never gloomy or morose rude or unpleasant and always interested in what dr joyces patients have to say he is slim neatly dressed well manicured he wears a pleasantly unobtrusive scent applied sparingly but effectively and his hair is neat and smart without looking artificial need i add that he is heartily despised by every one of dr joyces patients i have ever spoken to doctor he says so good to see you again did you enjoy your game oh yes the doctor says unenthusiastically looking round the waiting area there are only two other people in the room a policeman and a thin worriedlooking man with bad dandruff the worriedlooking man is sitting eyes closed on one of the rooms halfdozen or so seats the policeman is sitting on top of him sipping a cup of coffee dr joyce takes in this arrangement without a second glance any calls he asks the appalling young man who is standing slightly bowed with his hands placed fingertip to fingertip none urgent sir ive left a chronological list on your desk with tentative prioritisations re the replies in ascending order in the left margin cup of tea dr joyce coffee maybe no thank you dr joyce waves the appalling young man to one side and escapes through to his office i hand the aym my coat as he says good morning mr orr can i take your oh thank you enjoy your game mr orr no the policeman continues to sit on top of the thin man with the dandruff he looks away with an expression somewhere between surliness and embarrassment oh dear the young receptionist says looking desolate i am sorry to hear that mr orr cup of something to cheer you up perhaps no thanks i hurry through to join the doctor in his office dr joyce is examining the prioritised list lying under a paperweight on the blotter of his impressively large desk dr joyce i say why is there a policeman sitting on top of a man in your outer office he looks towards the door i have just closed oh he says going back to the typed list thats mr berkeley he has a nonspecific delusion keeps thinking hes an article of furniture he frowns taps one finger on an item on the list i sit down in an unoccupied chair really yes what he thinks he is varies from day to day we tell whoevers guarding him just to humour him where possible oh i thought perhaps they were some sort of minimalist radical theatre group i take it mr berkeley thinks hes a seat at the moment dr joyce frowns dont be stupid orr you wouldnt put one seat on top of another would you he must think hes a cushion of course i nod why the police guard oh it can get a bit tricky every now and again he thinks hes a bidet in a ladies toilet hes not normally violent just dr joyce stares vacantly at the pastelpink ceiling of his office for a moment he gropes for the right word then dredges down insistent he goes back to the list i sit back dr joyces office is floored with teak covered with occasional delicately hued carpets of a banal abstract design the imposing desk has a matching filing cabinet and brace of tomestuffed bookcases and there is a low table with tastefully bland chairs on one of which i am sitting half of one wall of the doctors inner office is window but the view is concealed by vertical blinds translucent the sunstruck blinds glow in the morning light providing our illumination the doctor crumples the neatly typed sheet into a ball and throws it into his wastebin he drags his seat round from behind his desk and positions it so that we can sit facing each other he takes a notebook from the desk top and puts it on his lap then removes a small silver propelling pencil from his jackets breast pocket right orr where were we i believe the last supposedly constructive thing you said was that the bridge might be a dream dr joyces mouth droops down at the corners how would you know if it wasnt how would i know if this wasnt the doctor sits back a knowing look on his face quite well how do you know it isnt a dream doctor i smile the doctor shrugs no point asking me that id be part of the dream he leans forward in his seat i do the same thing so that we are almost nose to nose what does the sealed carriage mean he asks i guess it shows im frightened of something i snarl yes but what the doctor hisses from close range i give in you tell me we stay eyeball to eyeball for a few moments longer then the doctor breaks off sitting back and making a sighing noise like the air going out of a fake leather chair he makes some notes how are your investigations going he says matteroffactly i sense a trap i watch him through narrowed eyes what investigations i ask before you left hospital and until quite recently you would always tell me about the investigations you were making you told me you were trying to find out things about the bridge it seemed quite important to you at the time i sit back i did try to find some things out but but you gave up the good doctor nods notes i tried i wrote letters to every office and bureau and department and library and college and paper i could find i sat up into the night writing letters i spent weeks sitting in antechambers and waiting rooms and reception areas and corridors i ended up with writers cramp a bad cold and a summons to appear before the hospital outpatients living allowance abuses committee they couldnt believe the amount i was spending on postage what did you discover dr joyce is amused that there is no point trying to discover anything worthwhile about the bridge what do you call worthwhile where is it what does it join how old is it that sort of thing no luck i dont think luck had much to do with it i dont think anybody knows or cares my letters all disappeared or were returned unopened or with replies attached in languages i couldnt understand and nobody else i was able to contact could fathom well the doctor makes a sort of balancing motion with one hand you do have a problem with languages dont you i have a problem with languages indeed in any single section of the bridge there are anything up to a dozen different languages specialised jargons originated by the various professions and skillgroups over the years and developed and added to altered and refined to the point of mutual incomprehensibility so long ago that nobody can actually recall the process taking place or remember a time when it had not yet begun i it was discovered when i came out of my coma speak the language of the staff and administrators the bridges official ceremonial tongue but whereas everybody else speaks at least one other language usually in connection with their work or official position i do not when i am amongst the bustling crowds which inhabit the main thoroughfares of the bridge at least half of the conversations going on are quite unintelligible to me i find this redundancy of languages merely annoying but i imagine that to the doctors more paranoid clients the plethora of tongues must seem almost definitively conspiratorial but its not just that i looked for records concerning the construction of the bridge and its original purpose i looked for old books newspapers magazines recordings films for anything which referred to any place off the bridge or before it or outside it theres nothing its all gone lost stolen destroyed or just misfiled do you know that in this section alone theyve managed to lose to lose an entire library a library how the hell do you lose a library dr joyce shrugs well readers lose library books he begins in a reasonable voice oh for gods sake man a whole library there were tens of thousands of books in it i checked real books and bound journals and documents and maps and i am aware i am starting to sound upset the third city records and historical materials library missing presumed lost for ever its listed as being in this section of the bridge there are countless references to it and crossreferences to the books and documents it contained and even reminiscences of scholars who went there to study but nobody can find it nobody has ever heard of it except through those references theyre not even looking for it especially hard my god youd think theyd send out some sort of search party of librarians or bibliophiles or something remember the name doctor give me a call if you ever come across it i sit back folding my arms the doctor makes some more notes do you feel that all this information you are seeking is or has been deliberately hidden from you he lifts one eyebrow in interrogation well that would give me something to fight against at least no i dont think theres any malice behind it all just muddle incompetence apathy and inefficiency you cant fight that its like trying to punch mist well then the doctor smiles glacially eyes like ice gone blue with age what did you discover where did you stop give in i discovered the bridge is very big doctor i tell him big and rather long it disappears over the horizon in both directions i have stood on a small radio tower atop one of its great summits and counted a good two dozen other redpainted peaks hazing off into the blue distance towards both the city and the kingdom both invisible i have seen no land since i was washed up here unless one counts the small islands which support every third bridge section tallish too at least fifteen hundred feet six or seven thousand people live within each section and there is probably room and overdesigned strength in the primary structure for an even greater density of population shape i shall describe the bridge with letters in crosssection at its thickest the bridge closely resembles the letter a the train deck forms the crossbar of the a in elevation the centre part of each section consists of an h superimposed over an x spreading out on each side from this centre are six more xs which gradually reduce in size until they meet the slender linking spans which have nine small xs each linking the extremities of each x one to another then produces a reasonable silhouette of the general shape hey presto the bridge is that it dr joyce asks blinking its very big is that all its all i needed to know but you still gave up it would have been the act of an obsessive to go on now im just going to enjoy myself i have a very pleasant apartment a quite reasonable allowance from the hospital which i spend on things which amuse me or which i find beautiful i visit galleries i go to the theatre concerts the cinema i read i have made some friends mostly among the engineers i play sports as you might have noticed im hoping to be admitted to a yacht club i occupy myself i wouldnt call that rejecting anything im right in there having a great time dr joyce gets up surprisingly quickly throwing the notebook onto his desk and going to pace up and down behind it oscillating between bookclogged bookcases and glowing blinds he cracks his knuckles i inspect my nails he shakes his head i dont think youre taking this seriously enough orr he says he goes to one of the windows and draws the blinds back revealing a bright sunny day blue sky and white clouds come here he says with a sigh and a small ohallrightifitllkeepyouhappy smile i join the good doctor at the windows straight ahead and almost a thousand feet down the sea greyblue and ruffled a few yachts and fishing boats speckled about seagulls wheel the doctor points to the side though one side of his office juts out so he can look along the side of the bridge the hospital complex of which the doctors offices form a part stands slightly proud of the main structure like an energetically growing tumour from here at such an acute angle the bridges elegant grace is obliterated and it appears merely cluttered and too solid its sloping sides rise russetred and ribbed from the graniteplinthed feet set in the sea nearly a thousand feet below those latticed flanks are slabbed and crammed with clusters of secondary and tertiary architecture walkways and lift shafts chimneys and gantries cableways and pipes aerials and banners and flags of all shapes sizes and colours there are small buildings and large ones offices wards workshops dwellings and shops all stuck like angular limpets of metal glass and wood to the massive tubes and interweaving girders of the bridge itself jumbled and squeezed and squashed between the original structures redpainted members like brittle hernias popping out between immense collections of muscles what do you see dr joyce asks i peer forward as if asked to admire the detail brushwork on some famous painting doctor i say i see a fucking great bridge dr joyce pulls hard on the cord snapping it at the top and leaving the blinds open he sucks his breath in he goes to sit behind his desk scribbling in his notebook i follow him your trouble orr he says as he writes is that you dont question enough dont i i say innocently is this a professional opinion or just a personal insult at the window a windowcleaners cradle is lowered slowly into view dr joyce does not notice the man in the cradle taps at the window time to have your windows cleaned i think doctor i tell him the doctor looks up briefly the windowcleaner is tapping alternately at the windowpane and his wrist watch dr joyce goes back to his notebook shaking his head no thats mr johnson he tells me the man in the cradle has his nose pressed against the glass another patient yes let me guess he thinks hes a windowcleaner he is a windowcleaner orr and a very good one he just refuses to come back in thats all hes been on that cradle for the last five years the authorities are starting to worry about him i gaze at mr johnson with new respect how agreeable to see a man so happy in his work his cleaning cradle is worn and cluttered there are bottles cans a small suitcase a tarpaulin and what may be a campbed at one end balancing a variety of cleaning equipment at the other extremity he taps on the glass with his tshaped wiper does he come in to you or do you go out to him i ask the good doctor walking over to the windows neither we talk through an open window dr joyce says i hear him putting the notepad away in a drawer when i turn he is standing looking at his watch anyway hes early i have to go to a committee meeting now he mimes something like this to mr johnson who shakes his wrist and holds the watch up to his ear and what of poor mr berkeley upholding the law even as we speak hell have to wait too the doctor takes some papers from another drawer and stuffs them into a thin briefcase what a pity mr berkeley doesnt think hes a hammock i say as mr johnson hoists himself up out of sight then you could keep them both hanging around the good doctor scowls at me get out of here orr certainly doctor i head for the door come back tomorrow if you have any dreams rightoh i open the door you know what orr dr joyce says seriously clipping his silver propelling pencil back into his breast pocket you give in too easily i think about this then nod yep fair enough doc youre right in the outer office the doctors ghastly receptionist helps me on with my coat he has brushed it while i was in with the doctor well mr orr and how did it go today well i hope yes very well considerable progress great strides meaningful discussion oh that does sound encouraging literally incredible i take one of the grand main elevators down from the hospital complex to street level above the train deck in the great lift surrounded by thick rugs tinkling chandeliers and gleaming brasswork framing polished mahogany i take a glass of cappuccino from the bar and sit down to watch the resident string quartet framed against the outer windows of the huge slowly descending room behind me round an oval table inside a ropedoff rectangle twenty or so bureaucrats and their aides are discussing a convoluted point of order which has cropped up during their meeting which according to a placard on a small stand just inside the ropedoff area concerns the standardisation of contract specifications in invitationstotender for locomotive highspeed bunkering channels coal dust type fire prevention in from the elevator to an open street above the main train deck this is an avenue of walk and cycleway metaldecked which forges a comparatively straight path through both the bridges own structure and the chaotically unplanned additions of shops cafes and kiosks which clutter this bustling level the street rather grandly called the boulevard queen margaret lies near the outer edge of the bridge its inside buildings form part of the lower edge of the ziggurat of secondary architecture piled inside the original framework its outeredge buildings abut the main girders themselves and in intermittent gaps offer views of the sea and sky long and narrow the street makes me think of ancient towns where haphazardly thrown together buildings jutted out towards each other tilting over and enclosing both the thoroughfares themselves and the swarming crowds they contained the scene here is not so different people jostling walking bicycling pushing prams hauling carts carrying sedan chairs straining on trikevans chattering in their various languages dressed in civilian clothes or uniforms and forming a dense mass of confused motion where people flow in both directions at once and across the main stream as well like blood cells in an artery gone mad i stand on the raised platform outside the elevator halt over the noise of the milling people the continual hisses and clanks grindings and gratings klaxons and whistles of the trains on the deck beneath sound like shrieks from some mechanistic underworld while every now and again a deep rumble and a still more profound quaking and rattling announces a heavy train passing somewhere below great pulsing clouds of white steam roll around the street and upwards above where the sky ought to be are the distant hazily seen girders of the high bridge obscured by the rising fumes and vapours dimmed by the light intercepted outside them by their carapace of peopleinfected rooms and offices they rise above and look down upon the rude profanity of these afterthought constructions with all the majesty and splendour of a great cathedral roof a frenzied chorus of beeping swells from one side a black rickshaw pulled by a young boy rushes through the crowds which part for it it is an engineers cab only important officials and couriers of the major guilds are allowed to use rickshaws merely welloff people are permitted to use sedan chairs though in practice few do because elevators and trams are quicker the only other alternative is to cycle though as wheels are taxed on the bridge the only affordable conveyance of this type for most people is a monocycle accidents are common the fusilade of honking which precedes the cab emanates from the uniformed rickshawboys feet in the heel of each of his shoes there is a small horn people know the sound and are warned i repair to a cafe to think about what i shall do after lunch i might go swimming there is a very pleasant uncrowded pool a couple of levels down from my apartment or i might phone my friend brooke the engineer he and his cronies usually play cards in the afternoon when they cant think of anything better to do or i might take a local tram and go in search of new galleries i havent bought any paintings for a week or so a pleasant tingle of anticipation runs through me as i contemplate these various agreeable ways of spending my time i leave the cafe after a coffee and liqueur and rejoin the busy press of people i throw a coin from the tram i take back to my own section of the bridge as we cross the narrow linking span it is traditional to throw things from the bridge for luck night a pleasant evening behind me spent swimming dining at the rackets club then taking a stroll down at the harbour i am a little tired but watching the tall yachts bobbing quietly in their dark marina has given me an idea i stretch out on the chaiselongue in my sitting room and consider the exact form my next dream for the good doctor ought to take decided i prepare my writing table then go to the television screen built into the wall behind where i will sit i work better with it on talking quietly to itself most of the programmes are dross intended for the unthinking quiz shows soap operas and so on but i watch occasionally ever in hope of seeing something which is not the bridge i find a channel still broadcasting a play apparently set in a mining community on one of the small islands and turn the dialogue down to a murmur loud enough to hear but not make out i take my place at my desk pick up my pen the television starts to hiss i turn round a grey haze fills the screen white noise issues from the speaker perhaps the set is faulty i go to turn it off but then a picture appears there is no sound the hiss has gone the screen shows a man lying in a hospital bed surrounded by machines it is in black and white not colour and grainy i turn up the sound but only a very gentle hiss emerges even at maximum volume the man in the bed has tubes and pipes appearing from his nose and mouth and arm his eyes are closed i cant see him breathe but he must still be alive on every channel the picture stays the same still the man the bed the surrounding machines the camera looks down and across at the bed it shows part of a wall and a small unoccupied seat at one side of the bed the fellow looks at deaths door even in monochrome his face is terribly pale and his thin hands lying motionless on the white bedsheet one with a tube attached at the wrist are almost transparent his face is thin and battered as though hes been in a bad fight his hair looks mousy a small bald patch sits on the crown of his head on the whole a rather short grey ordinarylooking man poor devil i try changing channels again but the picture remains perhaps i have a crossed line with one of the hospital cameras used to monitor very ill patients ill call the repair people in the morning i look at the still silent picture for a little while longer then switch the set off back to my desk i have to prepare my next dream for the good doctor after all i write for a while but the lack of background noise is vexing and i have an odd feeling sitting with my back to the dead television i take my pen and papers to bed and complete my next dream there before falling asleep where if i do dream i dont remember dreaming anyway this is what i write two all day we had fought under a topaz sky which slowly clouded over as though obscured by the smoke from our guns and the spreading fires below the clouds turned dark red with the sunset beneath our feet the decks were slick with blood still we fought desperate now though the light was going and our numbers were but a quarter of what they had been the dead and dying lay thrown about like splinters our proud ships paint and goldleaf were blackened and burned our masts were felled and our sails once puffed out bright and decorated as any military chest now hung like halfburned rags from the maststumps or covered the debrislittered decks where fires burned and dying men moaned our officers were dead our boats were burned or smashed our ship was sinking and burning the form of its inevitable fate dependent only on whether the rising waters reached the powder magazines before the unchecked fires the enemy vessel wallowing across the wreckagestrewn sea seemed in scarcely better condition than our own a single holed and flamesooted sail hung from her remaining tilted mast we tried to shoot down that remnant of her rigging but we had no chain shot left and no mastergunners left alive our powder on deck was almost finished the enemy ship turned towards us closing we used the last of our shot then took up cutlass and boarding pistol we left the wounded to their own devices lacking any yards to hang boarding lines from we made ready to leap aboard the other vessel when she hit the other ship fell silent too the last dark clouds from her cannons blowing slowly ahead of her over the dull red swell of the empty ocean our smokes mingled as the ships drew near the two torn bulbous hulls touched we leapt across away from our stricken vessel the collision felled our enemys last makeshift mast and the two craft separated again like us they had used no hooks or grapples we staggered shouting and cursing through the enemy galleons decks as our old ship drifted away but we found no men to fight only the dead and the moaning wounded we found no powder or shot only rising waters and spreading fires we found no ships boats only wreckage and charred wood resigned exhausted we gathered on the sloping splintered poop deck in the smoky flickering light of the spreading fires we looked out across the slowincreasing gap of littered bloody ocean to our old ship her masts were flame her sails were smoke her reflection burned on the waters between us a livid and inverted ghost our adversaries stared back through the smoke at us my apartments are high up on this section of the bridge close to the summit and not far from one angle of the squashed hexagon which the section resembles it would appear that i deserve this exalted position because i am one of dr joyces star patients my rooms are wide and tall and their walls on the seaward side are the glassedin girders of the bridge itself i can look out from perhaps twelve hundred feet or more in the direction we call downriver that is when the view is not obscured by the grey clouds which often submerge the bridge from above my rooms were quite bare when i came here from the hospital i have improved them adding several useful and decorative pieces of furniture and a modest but carefully chosen collection of small paintings and little figurines and sculptures the paintings mostly show details of the bridge itself or are of the sea i have several fine paintings of yachts and fishing vessels the sculptures are in the main figures bridge workers frozen in bronze it is morning now and i am dressing performing my toilet i dress slowly in measured stages i have an extensive wardrobe it seems only polite having been given so many wellmade clothes to give some thought to their effect they are after all a language they do not so much say things about us they are what is said the bridges menial workers of course have uniforms to wear and dont have to worry about what to put on each morning my envy for their way of life begins and ends there though they accept their lot and their position in society with a meekness i find both surprising and disappointing i wouldnt settle for being a sewage worker or a coal miner all my life but these people fit into the structure like happy little rivets embrace their position with the adhesion and cohesion of coats of paint i comb my hair a pleasantly intense black and just curly enough to give it body and select a cravat and matching enamelled pocket watch i admire my tall and aristocratic reflection for a moment and check that my cuffs are even my waistcoat centred collars straight and so on i am ready for breakfast the bed needs to be made and yesterdays clothes require cleaning or putting away but the hospital very considerately sends people to do that sort of thing as i go to select a hat i pause the television has switched itself on it clicks and starts to hiss at first as i go through to the sitting room i think i might be mistaken that it will be a leaking pipe water or gas making the noise but no the screen built into the wall is on it shows the same view as before the man in the bed silent and still and in monochrome i switch the set off the picture vanishes i switch it back on the sick man reappears and the channelchanging control has no effect the light is different there seems to be a window set into the wall on the far side of the bed beyond the encircling machines i look carefully for any further clues the picture is too grainy for me to be able to read any of the writing on the machines i cant even tell what language is being used how can the set switch itself on i turn it off and hear a droning noise outside from the windows of the room i look out onto a blue bright day a formation of aircraft is flying past the bridge from the direction of the kingdom there are three of them identical rather cumbersomelooking singleengine monoplanes flying one above the other the lowest aircraft is about level with me the middle plane is fifty feet above it the highest plane another fifty feet above that they fly past engines droning course steady propellers glittering like huge protruding glass discs and from the tail of each aircraft little dark bursts of smoke issue seemingly at random the small black clouds hang in the air strung out like some strange code a long trail of smoky signals marks the course of the planes disappearing into the cityward distance like some strange airborne fence this both puzzles and excites me i have not seen or heard of any aircraft at all since ive been on the bridge not even flying boats which the bridges engineers and scientists are obviously quite capable of constructing and operating these aircraft had no visible undercarriage they certainly had no floats and generally they looked quite unable to operate from water i assume they have retractable wheels and come from an airport on land i would find that encouraging the puffs of black smoke start to drift with the slow wind heading towards the city they dissipate as they go into the wide blue sky the planes pistonengine noise gradually fades as well the thinning black clouds seem to have a vague pattern they are grouped in threebythree grids carefully spaced i watch the gradually moving cloudgroups waiting for the merging smokepuffs to form letters or numbers or some other recognisable shapes but after a few minutes all that is left is an indistinct hanging curtain of dull air being blown slowly citywards like a gigantic scarf of soiled gauze i shake my head at the door i remember the malfunctioning television but when i try to call the repair people the telephone isnt working either it transmits a series of slow notquiteperfectlyregular beeps at me time to go the world the bridge anyway may be going mad but a man must still have his breakfast at the elevator doors in the corridor outside i recognise a neighbour he watches the brass hand on the clocklike face of the floorindicator above the closed doors tapping one foot impatiently he is dressed in the uniform of a senior timetabling official he gives a little start the carpet must have muffled my steps good morning i say as the floorindicator sweeps slowly up the fellow grunts he takes out his pocket watch and looks at it his foot taps faster i dont suppose you saw those aircraft did you i ask him he looks at me oddly im sorry the planes the aircraft that flew past not ten minutes ago the man stares at me his eyes flicker as he glances at my wrist he sees the plastic hospital bracelet the elevator chimes oh yes the official says yes the aircraft of course the lift doors open smoothly he looks round at the woodpanelled brasstrimmed interior of the waiting elevator as i gesture for him to enter first he inspects his watch again mutters excuse me and hurries off down the corridor i ride down alone on a circular leatherpadded bench i watch the rippling surface of a fish tank in one corner as the elevator rumbles down the shaft there is a telephone by the door the brass instrument is heavy i hear nothing for a moment then a few small bleeping noises which at first sound like the odd tones i heard on my apartments machine these are quickly replaced by the voice of a rather surly operator yes what do you want this is something of a relief oh repairs and maintenance please what now the lift slows as it approaches the floor i want no never mind i hang up i leave the elevator on one of the upper arcade decks where a brisk walk takes me past small shops selling the fresh produce just arrived on the early morning goods trains to the inches breakfast bar i stop on the way at a small flower stand and choose a carnation which will contrast nicely with the watch and the cravat the panelled windowless walls of the breakfast bar are painted with competent but unconvincing views of green pastureland it is a quiet subdued place with high ceilings and low lighting thick carpets and thin porcelain i am shown to my usual table at the back a newspaper lies folded on the table it is concerned almost entirely with minute changes to the regulations and laws governing the running and maintenance of the bridge and its traffic the promotions and deaths of the bridges administrators the generally quite remarkable boring society gatherings perpetrated by the same groups and with some of the complicated arcane and littleplayed sports and games popular with these mandarins i order smoked fish fillets devilled lambs kidneys toast and coffee putting the paper aside i gaze up at the painting on the opposite wall it shows a sloped meadow of brilliant green bordered with evergreens and sprinkled with bright flowers across a shallow valley there are treelined hills edged in sunlight were these scenes painted from life or did the places exist only in the artists head coffee is brought i have never seen a coffee plant on the bridge my lambs kidneys must come from somewhere but where on the bridge we talk of down and upriver and of citywards and kingdomwards there must be land would a bridge make sense without it but how far away i did all the research i could given the limitations of both language and access which the organisation of the bridges facilities impose on the amateur investigator but for all my months of work i came no closer to discovering the nature or location of either the city or the kingdom they remain enigmatic placeless my longabandoned requests for information are doubtless still sinking through the miasmic layers of bureaucratic ooze that represent the bridge authorities organisational structure i have the impression that all my original questions concerning the size of the bridge what it is bridging what it connects and so on will have been handed on rephrased precisd tidiedup glossed paraphrased and retransmitted so often and between so many different departments and offices that by the time they come to be considered by anybody capable of and willing to answer them they will be virtually meaningless and that should they by some miracle survive this process just uncontaminated enough to be comprehensible any reply however considerately helpful and paradigmatically clear will even more certainly have generated into utter incomprehensibility by the time it finally reaches me so frustrating did i find the whole investigative process that at one time i seriously considered stowing away on an express train and just going looking for the damned city or the kingdom officially my wrist band which identifies me and informs tram conductors which hospital department to charge my ticket to restricts my travel between two tram termini only a range of a dozen bridge sections and about the same number of miles in each direction not an ungenerous allowance but a restriction nevertheless i decided not to become a stowaway i think it is more important to recover the lost territories inside my skull than to go exploring for lost lands here i shall stay put when im cured i might go morning orr i am joined by mr brooke an engineer i met in hospital a small dark pressuredlooking man he sits down heavily opposite me and scowls good morning brooke see those damn his scowl deepens aircraft yes did you no just the smoke damn cheek you disapprove disapprove brooke looks shocked not up to me to approve or disapprove but i called up a chum of mine at shipping and timetabling and they didnt know anything about these aircraft whole thing was totally unauthorised heads will roll mark my words are there laws against what they did theres no law to permit it orr thats the point good grief man you cant have people going off and doing things just because they want to just because they think something up you have to have a a framework he shakes his head god you have some odd ideas at times orr id be the last to deny it brooke orders kedgeree we were in the same ward in hospital and he has also been a patient of dr joyces brooke is a senior engineer specialising in the effect of the bridges weight on the seabed he was injured in an accident in one of the caissons which support some of the structures graniteshod feet he is physically recovered now but still suffers from acute insomnia something about brooke always makes me think of him as illlit even in direct sunlight he always seems to be standing in shade another strange thing happened to me this morning i tell him he looks wary really he says i tell him about the man in the hospital bed the television which switches itself on and the malfunctioning phone he seems relieved oh that sort of thing happens all the time crossed lines somewhere ill bet you get on to repairs and maintenance and keep annoying them until they do something about it i shall hows that quack joyce still persevering with me ive started to have some dreams but i think they might be too structured for the good doctor he practically ignored the first one he critised me for giving up my investigations brooke tuttuts well orr hes the doctor and all that but if i were you i wouldnt waste any more time on all these he pauses searching for a suitable severe epithet questions not likely to get you anywhere you know certainly cant see it getting your memory back nor will mooning like a schoolgirl over that sort of stuff he gestures dismissively at one of the pastoral scenes on the wall frowning as though pointing out some unsightly blemish on the varnished panels but brooke dont you ever want to see something other than the bridge mountains forest a desert think of my friend he says heavily watching a waiter pour him some coffee do you know how many different types of rock the foundations rest upon he sounds patient almost tired i am going to be lectured but at least this will give me a chance to eat my devilled kidneys which have arrived and are cooling no i admit ill tell you brooke says no less than seven major different types not counting traces of dozens of others every type of strata is represented sedimentary metamorphic and both intrusive and extrusive igneous rocks there are major deposits of basalt dolerite calciferous and carboniferous sandstone basaltic and trachytic agglomerates basaltic lavas tertiary and old red sandstone and considerable amounts of schistose grit all present in complex folded systems whose histories have yet i can stomach no more rocks you mean i say as his kedgeree arrives he coats it with a snowstorm of salt and deposits pepper on it like a layer of volcanic ash that the bridge has more than enough to offer the enquiring mind without recourse to anything outside it precisely id have said it was more like approximately but never mind anyway there is something beyond the bridge something i can almost but not quite remember i seem to possess abstractions general ideas for things i could never find on the bridge glaciers cathedrals automobiles a nearly endless list but i can recall nothing specific no particular images come to mind i can cope with my single language and with the customs and mores of the bridge all surely the product of training at some point but i can remember nothing of my schooling my upbringing i am complete in everything but memories where other people have the equivalents of encyclopedias and journals i have a pocket dictionary well i cant help it brooke i say there just seem to be so many things one cant talk about here sex religion and politics for a start he pauses a forkful of kedgeree poised halfway to his mouth well he says uncomfortably theres nothing wrong with the first one if ones married or the girl has a licence or whatever but damn it orr he puts the fork down again youre always going on about religion and politics what exactly do you mean he seems to be serious what have i got myself into first this and then a session with dr joyce to follow all the same for the next ten minutes i attempt an explanation for brooke he looks increasingly mystified finally once i have finished he says hmm dont know why you need two words they sound like the same thing to me i sit back in awe brooke you should have been a philosopher a philo what never mind eat your kedgeree a tram takes me to dr joyces bridgesection the cramped rattling upper deck is full of workers they sit on the grubby seats and read newspapers with large print and photographs they are almost entirely taken up with sport and the results of lotteries the men are steel workers or welders their thick working jackets have no outside pockets and are covered in numerous small burns the men talk amongst themselves ignoring me occasionally i think i catch a word are they using a thick dialect of my own tongue but the more i listen the less i understand really i should have waited for a softclass tram but i might have made myself late for my appointment with dr joyce and i do believe in punctuality i take an express lift to the level where the good doctor has his offices piped music plays but as ever it sounds to me like a random collection of notes and jumbled mismatched chords as though all music on the bridge has been encrypted i have given up expecting to hear anything i can remember or whistle a young lady shares the elevator for most of the way she is dark and slim and looks modestly at the floor her lashes are long and black and her cheek curves exquisitely she wears a finely cut suit with a long skirt and short jacket and i find myself watching the rise and fall of her breasts under a white silk blouse she does not look at me as she quits the lift a faint hint of perfume is all thats left behind i concentrate on a photograph on one of the darkwood panels by the elevator door the picture is old sepiatinted and shows three of the bridge sections being built they stand alone unconnected except through their jagged uncompleted similarity tubes and girders jut out festooned with scaffolding and heavylooking steam cranes are dotted about the brown lines of iron the three incomplete sections look almost hexagonal there is no date on the photograph a smell of paint permeates the doctors offices two workmen in white overalls are carrying a desk in through the doors the reception area is empty apart from white sheets which cover the floor and the desk which the workmen place in the centre of the room i look into the doctors room it is empty too more white sheets covering the floor dr joyces name has been removed from the doors glass panel whats happened i ask the workmen they look at me blankly the lift again my hands are shaking thankfully the hospital reception desk has not moved i have to wait while a young couple with a small child are directed down a long corridor by the receptionist but then it is my turn im looking for dr joyces office i tell the stern thickset woman behind the desk he was in room i was there just yesterday but he seems to have been moved are you a patient my name is john orr i let her read the details on my wrist band just a moment she lifts the telephone i sit on a soft bench in the middle of the reception area which is surrounded by corridors they radiate away like spokes from a hub the shorter corridors lead to the outside of the bridge soft white curtains blow in a light breeze the woman at the desk is transferred from one person to another finally she puts the phone down mr orr dr joyce has been relocated to room she draws a diagram showing the way to the doctors new office my chest aches dully for a while a circular echo of pain mr brooke sends his regards dr joyce looks up from his notes blinking through his greypink lids i have told the doctor the dream about the galleons which exchange boarding parties he listened without comment nodding occasionally frowning sometimes making notes the silence dragged on mr dr joyce says puzzled his thin silver pencil hangs over the notebook like a tiny dagger mr brooke i remind him came from surgical at about the same time i did an engineer he suffers from insomnia you were treating him oh dr joyce says after a moment yes him he bends back to his notes again dr joyces new offices are even grander than his previous accommodation three levels further up with increased floor space the doctor would appear to be continuing his advancement he now has a private secretary as well as a receptionist unhappily his elevation has not entailed the replacement of the aym my mr orr you are looking well how nice to see you have a seat do let me take your coat cup of coffee perhaps tea the little silver pencil is replaced in the doctors breast pocket so he says clasping his hands what do you make of this dream hmm here we go again doc i say trusting that this will annoy him for a start i dont have a clue not really my field how about you dr joyce looks at me evenly for a moment then he gets up from his seat and throws his notepad onto the desk he goes over to the window and stands there looking out and shaking his head ill tell you what i think orr he says he turns staring at me i think both these dreams this one and yesterdays tell us nothing ah i say and after all my hard work i clear my throat not a little peeved well what do we do now dr joyces blue eyes glitter he opens a drawer in his desk and brings out a large book with wipeclean plastic pages and a felttip pen he passes these to me the book contains mostly halfcompleted drawings and inkblot tests last page the good doctor says i turn dutifully to the last page it contains two drawings what do i do i ask this looks childish you see those small lines four in the top drawing five in the bottom one yes complete those by making them into arrows so that they indicate the direction of force the structures shown are exerting at those points he holds up one hand as i open my mouth to ask a question thats all i can say im not allowed to give you any clues or answer any further questions i take the pen complete the lines as asked and hand the book back to the doctor he looks nods i ask well well what he takes a cloth from his drawer and wipes the book as i put the pen on his desk did i get it right he shrugs what does right mean he says gruffly putting everything back in the drawer if it was an exam question you got it right yes but its not an exam question its supposed to tell us something about you he makes a note in his notebook with the little silver propelling pencil what does it show about me he shrugs again looking at his notes i dont know he says shaking his head it must show something but i dont know what yet i would quite like to punch dr joyce right on his greypink nose i see i say well i hope i have been of some use to the progress of medical science me too dr joyce says looking at his watch well i think thats all for now make an appointment for tomorrow just in case but if you dont have any dreams call in and cancel all right golly that was quick mr orr how did it go like a cup of tea the immaculately groomed receptionist helps me on with my coat you were in and out of there in no time how about some coffee no thanks i say looking at mr berkeley and his policeman who are waiting in the reception area mr berkeley lies curled in a tight foetal position on his side on the floor in front of the seated policeman who is resting his feet on him mr berkeley is a footstool today the appalling young man tells me proudly in the high airy spaces of the upper structure the ceilings are tall and the broad deeppile carpet in the deserted corridors smells rich and damp the wood panelling lining the walls is teak and mahogany and the glass strapped in the brassframed windows looking out into gloomy lightwells or towards the now hazedover sea has a blue tint to it like lead crystal in niches along the dark wooden walls old statues of forgotten bureaucrats loom like blind ghosts and high overhead masses of great dark furled flags hang like heavy nets hung out to dry they sway gently as a soft chill draught moves ancient dust through the dark tall corridors about a halfhours wander from the doctors offices i discover an old elevator opposite a gigantic circular outside window which looks out over the firth like some transparent clockface robbed of its hands the lift door is open an old grizzled man sits on a tall stool inside asleep he wears a long burgundy coat with shiny buttons his thin arms are crossed over his belly his impressively bearded chin rests on his bebuttoned chest and his whitehaired head moves slowly up and down in time with his wheezy breathing i cough the old man sleeps on i knock on the protruding edge of one door hello he comes awake with a jerk uncrosses his arms and steadies himself on the lift controls there is a click and the doors start to close groaning and creaking until his waving arms flap against the brass levers again whereupon the doors retreat bless me sir what a fright you gave me just having a little snooze so i was come in sir which floor now the generous roomsized lift is full of illassorted chairs peeling morrors and dustdulled hanging tapestries unless it is a trick of the mirrors it is also lshaped which makes it unique in my experience train deck please i say right you are sir the ancient attendant hooks a withered hand over the control levers the doors grate and clank closed and after a few nudgings and carefully aimed thumps on the brass plate containing the control levers the old fellow finally succeeds in coaxing the elevator into motion it slides rumbling stately downwards mirrors vibrating fitments rattling the lighter seats and chairs rocking on its unevenly carpeted floor the old man sways precariously on his high stool and holds on tightly to a brass rail under the controls i can hear his teeth chattering i hang onto a brightly polished and loosely rattling handrail a noise like shearing metal echoes somewhere overhead feigning nonchalance i study a yellowed notice at my shoulder it lists the various floors the elevator serves and the departments accommodation sections and other facilities to be found on these levels one near the top catches my eye my god ive found it excuse me i say to the old man he turns his head shaking as though with palsy to look at me i tap the list on the wall ive changed my mind id like to go to this floor to the third city library the old man looks despairingly at me for a moment then puts one shaking hand to the clattering controls and slaps one of the levers down before clutching desperately at the brass rail again and closing his eyes the elevator whines screams bounces crashes and judders from side to side i am almost thrown from my feet the old fellow parts company with his high stool chairs topple a mirror cracks a light fixture falls halfway from the ceiling then jerks like a hanged man bouncing to a swaying stop in a cascade of plaster and dust and hanging wires we come to a halt the old man pats dust off both shoulders adjusts jacket and hat picks up his stool and presses some more controls we ascend comparatively smoothly sorry i shout to the attendant he stares wildly at me and starts glancing about the lift as though trying to discover what terrible crime i am apologising for i didnt realise stopping and going back would be quite so traumatic i yell to him he looks utterly mystified and gazes round the rattling creaking dusthazed interior of his small domain as though unable to see what all the fuss is about we stop the elevator does not chime on arrival instead a bell whose power and tone would do justice to a large church concusses the air within it the old fellow looks fearfully overhead were here sir he shouts he opens the doors to a scene of utter chaos and jumps back i watch amazed for a few moments slowly coming forward to the doors the old attendant peers nervously round the edge we seem to have arrived at the scene of terrible disaster in a huge but wreckagechoked hall in front of us we see fire fallen girders mangled pipes and beams collapsed brickwork and drooping cables uniformed people rush around carrying fire hoses stretchers and unidentifiable pieces of equipment a great pall of smoke overhangs everything the din and racket of jangling alarms and klaxons explosions and amplified shouted orders are frightening even to ears somewhat stunned by the bell which announced our arrival what has happened here strike me sir the old attendant coughs doesnt look much like a library from this angle does it no it doesnt i agree watching a dozen men wheel some great pumping apparatus across the debrisstrewn floor of the hall in front of us are you quite sure this is the right floor he checks his floor indicator thumping the dial with one arthritic fist sure as i can be sir he digs out a pair of spectacles and peers again at the indicator an explosion in the wreckage of pipes and girders sends up a roll of black smoke and sparks men nearby jump for cover a man wearing a tall hat and bright yellow uniform sees us and waves a megaphone he steps over some bodies on stretchers and approaches us you there he shouts what the hell do you think youre doing eh looters ghouls eh is that it get on your way at once im looking for the third city records and historical materials library i tell him calmly he waves his megaphone at the chaotic scene behind him so are we you idiot now fuck off he jabs the megaphone in the direction of my chest and storms off tripping over one of the bodies on the stretchers and then running over to direct the men manoeuvring the giant pump the old attendant and i look at each other he closes the doors rude bugger eh sir he did seem a little upset train deck sir hmm oh yes please i hold onto the rattling brass rail again as we descend i wonder what happened to the library the old man shrugs goodness knows sir all sorts of funny things happen in these higher reaches some of the things ive seen he shakes his head whistles through his teeth youd be amazed sir yes i admit ruefully i probably would at the rackets club in the afternoon i win one game lose the other the aircraft and their strange signals are the only topic of conversation most of the people at the club professionals and bureaucrats to a man regard the odd flypast as an unwarranted outrage about which something must be done i ask a newspaper journalist if he has heard anything about a terrible fire on the level where the third city library was supposed to be but he hasnt even heard of the library and certainly not of any upperstructure disaster he will check from the club i phone repairs and maintenance and tell them about my television and telephone i eat at the club and go to a theatre at night an uninspired production about a signalmans daughter who falls in love with a tourist who turns out to be a railway bosss son engaged and having one last fling i leave after the second act at home as i undress a small crumpled piece of paper falls from a pocket in my coat it is the smudged diagram the hospital receptionist drew for me to show me the way to dr joyces office it looks like this i stare at it vaguely troubled my head feels light and the room seems to tip as though i am still in the decrepit lshaped elevator with the old attendant completing another unscheduled and dangerous liftshaft manoeuvre for a moment my thoughts feel scrambled mixed up like the smoke signals trailed by the strange flight of planes this morning and for an instant dizzy and swaying i myself seem somehow clouded and formless like something chaotic and amorphous like the mists which curl amongst the snagging complexity of the high bridge coating the layers of ancient paint on its girders and its beams like sweat the telephone rings snapping me out of this odd moment i lift the receiver only to hear the same curious regular beeping at the other end hello hello i say nothing i put it down it rings again and the same thing happens i leave it off the cradle this time and cover the earpiece with a cushion i dont even try the television i know what ill see as i head for bed i realise i am still holding the small piece of paper i throw it into the wastebin three at my back lay the desert ahead the sea one golden one blue they met like rival modes of time one moved in the immediate sparkling in troughs and crests lifting white and falling beating the shelf of sand and the tide as breath the other moved more slowly but as surely the tall advancing waves of sand stroked over the waste by the combing hand of the unseen wind between the two half submerged by each the ruined city abraded by both sand and water caught like something soft between two meshing iron wheels the stones of the city submitted to the agents of the wind i was alone and walked through the midday heat a white ghost billowing through the tumbled wreckage of the shattered buildings my shadow was at my feet beneath me invisible the rosered stones were jumbled and askew most of the streets were gone long ago buried under the soft encroaching sands ruined arches fallen lintels collapsed walls littered the slopes of sand at the scalloped edge of shore brushed by the waves more fallen blocks broke the incoming waves a little out to sea tilted towers and the fragment of an arch rose from the waters sucked at by the waves like the bones of the longdrowned on the worn stones over empty doors and sandfilled windows friezes of figures and symbols had been carved i inspected these curious halflegible images attempting to decipher their linear patterns the windblown sand had eroded some of the walls and beams until the thickness of stone was less than the depth of the chiselled symbols blue sky shone through the bloodred rock i know this place i said to myself i know you i said to the silent wreckage a huge statue stood apart from the main area of the citys ruins the thickset trunk and head of a man perhaps three or four times lifesize it faced along a diagonal between the line of foamwashed beach and the centre of the silent ruins the statues arms had fallen or been broken off long ago the stumps worn smooth by the wind and sand one side of the massive body and head showed the accumulated effects of the scouring wind but on the front and the other side this figures details were still apparent a naked torso bigbellied but the upper chest covered in chains and jewels and ropethick necklaces the great head bald but crowned ear heavy with rings nose studded the expression on that timeworn face was one which like the graven symbols i could not translate perhaps cruelty perhaps bitterness perhaps a callous disregard for all things save sand and wind mock mocca i found myself whispering gazing up at the bulbous stone eyes the giant offered no help names too became worn away however slowly at first altered then reduced then forgotten on the beach before the city some way from the statues stony gaze i found a man he was small and lame and hunched over and he stood up to his knees in the shallow surf the waves washing round the dark rags he wore and he beat at the surface of the water with a heavy lash of chains cursing all the while his head was bowed under the weight of his deformed back long filthy hair hung down in tight tangles to the chopping waves and sometimes like a sudden greywhite hair erupting from the centre of this dark mass a long strand of spittle would drop towards the waves and float away all the time his right arm rose and fell whipping at the sea with his flail a short heavy thing with a shining wooden handle and a dozen glistening rusting lengths of iron chain the waters around him frothed and bubbled under this steady and unceasing attack and clouded with the grains of sand disturbed from the slope beneath the hunched man stopped his flogging for a moment shifted crablike a step to one side wiped his mouth with one cuff then resumed muttering all the time as the heavy chains rose fell splashed i stood on the shore behind him watching for a long time he stopped again wiped his face once more then took another step to the side the wind blew his ragged clothes briefly lifted his oily tangled hair my own loose garment flapped in the same gust and he may have heard the noise over the falling surf for he did not immediately resume his labours his head moved slightly as though to catch some faint sound he seemed to try to straighten his twisted back but then gave up he turned slowly round in a succession of tiny shuffling steps as though his feet were hobbled on a short chain until he faced me he brought his head up slowly until he could look at me then stood the waves still breaking around his knees the flail dangling in the water from one gnarled hand his face was almost hidden by the tangled mass of hair piled around his head and falling like another uneven flail towards the sea his expression was unreadable i waited for him to speak but he stood silent patient until finally i said excuse me please carry on he said nothing for a while gave no sign of having heard as if there was some medium slower than air between us then replied in a voice of surprising gentleness its my job you know i am employed to do this i nodded oh i see i waited for some further explanation he seemed to hear my words again long after i had spoken them after a while he gave a lopsided shrug you see once a great emperor then his voice died away and he was silent for a few moments i waited he shook his head after a while and shuffled round to face the curved blue horizon i shouted but he gave no sign of having heard he started to beat the waves again muttering and cursing quietly and monotonously i watched him whip at the sea for a little longer then i turned and walked away an iron bracelet like the remains of some snapped manacle i had not noticed it before made a faint rhythmic clinking noise on my wrist as i walked back to the ruins did i really dream that the ruined city by the sea the man with the chain whip i am confused for a moment did i lie down last night and try to dream up something to tell the doctor in the darkness of my large warmed bed i feel a sort of relief i laugh quietly inordinately pleased with myself for having finally had a dream i can tell the good doctor with a clear conscience i get up and pull on a dressinggown the apartment is cold the grey dawn glows softly through the tall windows a tiny slowly pulsing light shines far out to sea beneath a long low bank of dark cloud as though the cloud is land and the slowly flashing buoy a harbours signal a bell sounds somewhere far away followed by the quieter chimes which announce the hour as five oclock a train whistle blows in the distance beneath and a hardly heard partly felt rumble witnesses the passing of a heavygoods in the sitting room i watch the grey unmoving picture of the man in the hospital bed the small bronze sculptures of the bridge workers placed variously about the room reflect the palely shining monochrome light from their rough surfaces suddenly a woman a nurse comes silently onto the screen and goes to the mans bed i cannot see her face she seems to be taking the fellows temperature there is no sound other than a distant hiss the nurse walks round the bed over the shiny floor to check the machines she disappears again going beneath the camera then returns holding a small metal tray she takes a syringe from it draws some fluid from a little bottle holds the needle up then swabs the pale mans arm and injects him i suck air through my teeth i have never i am sure liked injections the picture is too grainy for me to see the needle actually piercing the mans skin but in my imagination i see the slantedged tip of the needles tube and the pale soft yielding skin i wince with sympathetic pain and turn the set off i lift the cushion off the telephone the beeping noise is still there maybe a little faster than it was before i replace the receiver on the cradle the machine rings immediately i pick it up but instead of the pulsing monotone ah orr got you at last that is you isnt it yes brooke its me where have you been his voice is slurred asleep out where sorry this noise i can hear babbling voices in the background i wasnt anywhere i was asleep or rather i was asleep brooke says loudly that wont do orr that just wont do at all im sorry were at dissy pittons the bar come over at once weve saved you a bottle brooke its the middle of the night good grief is it just as well i called the dawn is just coming up is it brookes astonished voice goes away from the phone i hear him shout something then there is loud ragged cheering hurry up then orr get a milk train or something well expect you brooke i begin but then i hear brooke talking away from the telephone again and some distant shouting oh he says yes and bring a hat youve got to bring a more shouting in the background oh it has to be a widebrimmed hat have you got a widebrimmed hat i i am interrupted by further shouting brooke yells yes it has to be widebrimmed if you havent got a widebrimmed hat dont bring one that isnt have you got one i think so i say suspecting that to say so is to commit myself to going right brooke says see you soon dont forget the hat he rings off i put the phone down lift it again and hear the regular beeping noise once more i look out at the slowly flashing light under the cloud bank shrug and head for my dressing room dissy pittons bar lies spread over several eccentrically arranged floors in an unfashionable area only a few decks above train level directly beneath the lowest of the bars there is a rope works where ropes and cables are wound in a series of long and narrow sheds accordingly dissy pittons is a place of ropes and cables where the tables and chairs are suspended from the ceilings rather than supported by the floors in dissy pittons as brooke once observed in one of his rare bouts of humour even the furniture is legless the doorman is asleep on his feet leaning back against the wall of the building arms folded and head down peaked cap shading his eyes from the flashing neon sign over the door he is snoring i let myself in and climb through two dark deserted floors to where noise and light indicate the party continues orr the very man brooke comes unsteadily through the crowd of people and the swaying maze of suspended tables chairs couches and screens he steps over a snoring body on the way drunks in dissy pittons seldom remain under the table for long usually they end up sprawled on the floor in some distant part of the bar having been tempted by the seemingly endless plane of teak floor into crawling off on all fours driven by some deeply ingrained instinct of infantile inquisitiveness or perhpas the desire to impersonate a slug good of you to come orr brooke says taking my arm he looks at the widebrimmed hat i am clutching nice hat he leads me towards a distant table yes i say handing it to him who wanted it whats it for what he stops he turns the hat over in his hands he looks mystified inside the crown as though for a clue you asked for a widebrimmed hat remember i tell him you asked me to bring one earlier hmm brooke says and leads me to a table with four or five people clustered around it i recognise baker and fowler two of brookes fellow engineers they are in the process of trying to stand up brooke still looks puzzled he is looking closely at the hat brooke i say trying not to sound exasperated you asked me to bring the damn thing not half an hour ago you cant have forgotten you sure that was this evening brooke says sceptically brooke you rang you invited me over here you oh look brooke says belching and reaching for a bottle have some wine and well think about it he shoves a glass into my hands youve got some catching up to do i fear your lead is unassailable youre not upset are you orr brooke says pouring wine into my glass merely sober the symptoms are similar you are upset no im not why are you upset why do i form the impression that brooke is not really listening to me this happens sometimes i talk to people but a sort of emptiness seems to come over them as though the face really is a mask with the real person somewhere behind it normally pressed up against the inside like a child with their nose against a sweetshop window but when i am talking to them trying to make some difficult or unacceptable point lifting that internal self away from the mask and turning somewhere inside themselves performing the mental equivalent of taking their shoes off and putting their feet up having a cup of coffee and resting for a while returning later only when theyre good and ready to nod inappropriately and make some wholly irrelevant remark redolent of stale thoughts perhaps its me i think perhaps only i have this effect on people maybe nobody else does well this is paranoid thinking i suppose and i dont doubt the effect is one of those which once one has the courage to broach the subject with other people will prove to be extremely common if not nearly universal oh yes ive felt that that happens to me i thought it was only me meanwhile engineers baker and fowler have both succeeded in standing and pulling on their coats brooke is talking earnestly to engineer fowler who looks perplexed then enlightenment spreads across his face he says something which brooke nods at before coming back to me bouch he tells me then picks up his own coat from the back of a couch what i say tommy bouch brooke says putting his coat on he wanted the hat what for dont know orr brooke admits well where is he i ask looking round the bar went outside a while ago brooke tells me he buttons his coat fowler and baker stand behind him swaying uncertainly are you three going i ask rather unnecessarily have to brooke says then takes my arm leans closer urgent appointment at mrs hanovers he whispers loudly mrs i begin mrs hanovers is a licensed brothel i know that brooke and his cronies visit it occasionally and i suspect it is frequented mostly by engineers a host of unsubtle allusions suggest themselves i have been invited before but made it clear i have no interest in attending this reticence arises from vanity not moral scruples i have assured brooke but i suspect he still thinks i am beneath my talk of sex politics and religion a prude dont suppose you want to come along do you brooke says thank you no i say hmm didnt think so brooke nods he takes my arm again puts his mouth near to my ear thing is orr its a bit awkward what i watch engineer fowler talking to a young man with long hair who is sitting in the shadows behind him another young man is slumped over the table behind him its arrols daughter brooke says glancing back over his shoulder who chief engineer arrols daughter brooke whispers shes sort of attached herself to us you see and that brother of hers has gone and fallen asleep so if we leave now there wont be anybody to look you wouldnt mind sort of talking to her would you brooke i say coldly first of all you call me at five oclock in the morning then i get no further baker supported by an anxiouslooking fowler stumbles into brooke and says think wed better go now brooke not feeling awfully engineer baker stops seems to belch his cheeks bulge he swallows then grimaces and nods in the direction of the steps to the lower floor got to go orr brooke says hurriedly grabbing one of bakers arms while fowler grasps the other see you later thanks for looking after the girl have to make your own introductions sorry the three of them barge past me brooke shoves the widebrimmed hat back into my hands fowler drags baker off towards the stairs with brooke in tow via bakers other arm ill tell tommy bouch about the hat if i see him brooke shouts they stagger together through the crowds towards the stairs as i turn my attention is caught by the young man i saw fowler talking to earlier he is looking up from rather baggy eyes smiling at me wrong not a young man a young woman she is wearing a dark rather wellcut suit with wide trousers a brocade waistcoat with a rather ostentatious gold chain across it and a white cotton shirt her shirt collar is open a black bowtie hanging undone from it black shoes her hair is dark shoulder length she is sitting sideways on a seat one leg drawn up under her one dark hooked eyebrow hoists i follow her gaze to where the tripod of engineers who have just left the table are attempting to navigate their way through the press of bodies at the head of the stairs think theyll make it she says she tips her head to one side one clenched fist supporting the back of her head i think id want very good odds i reply she nods thoughtfully and takes a drink from a long glass yes me too she says im sorry i dont know your name my name is john orr abberlaine arrol how do you do i say abberlaine arrol smiles amused i do as i like mr orr and yourself one irrelevant reply deserves another you must be chief engineer arrols daughter i say putting the widebrimmed hat on the end of the couch where with any luck at all somebody else will pick it up thats right she says are you an engineer mr orr she waves one long unringed hand at a seat beside her i take off my coat sit down no im a patient under dr joyce ahh she says nodding slowly she looks at me with a directness ive found unusual on the bridge as though i am some complicated mechanism in which one small part has come adrift her face is young but softlooking in the way of an older womans though unlined she is smalleyed with the hoses obvious under the smooth skin at brow and cheek her mouth is quite broad and smiling but i find my gaze drawn to small crinkles of skin under her grey eyes small folds which give her a knowing ironic look what do they think might be wrong with you mr orr her eyes glance towards my wrist but my medical name band is hidden by my cuff amnesia ah really from when she wastes no time between sentences about eight months ago i was netted by some fishermen oh i think i read about it they fished you out of the sea so im told thats one of the many things ive forgotten havent they found out who you are yet no no one has claimed me at any rate i dont match the description of any missing person hmm it must be strange a finger goes to her lips i imagined it might be quite interesting and a shrug romantic to have lost ones memory but perhaps its just frustrating she has rather fine very dark eyebrows mostly frustrating but also interesting as is the treatment my doctor believes in dream therapy and do you not yet you will if it works she nods probably but she raises one finger what if you have to believe in it before it can work im not sure that would accord with the good doctors scientific principles but if it works who cares ah but if one has belief without reason in the process one may end up having belief without reason in the result this makes her pause but only for a moment so you might think youre cured when youre not she says but thered be a definite result youd either have your memory back or not ah but i might not i might make it up make up your own past life sceptically some people do it all the time i think i am teasing but even as i speak the words i wonder only to fool other people they must know theyre lying im not sure its that simple i think the easiest people to fool are ourselves fooling ourselves may even be a necessary precondition for fooling others oh no she says quite definitely to be a good liar you have to have a very good memory to fool others you usually have to be cleverer than they you think no one ever believes their own stories oh maybe a few people in psychiatric hospitals do but thats all i think most of the patients who claim to believe theyre other people are just playing a sort of game with the staff such certainty i seem to recall being that sure of things even if i cant remember what it was i was so definite about you must think doctors very easy to fool i say she smiles her teeth are unobjectionable i am aware of evaluating this young woman of sizing her up she is entertaining without being entrancing absorbing without being captivating probably just as well she nods i think they can be fooled quite easily when they treat the mind like a muscle it doesnt seem to occur to them that their patients might be trying to fool them deliberately id dispute this dr joyce for one seems to make it a matter of professional pride never fully to believe anything his patients tell him well i say i think a good doctor will usually spot the charlatan patient most people lack the imagination to assume the role sufficiently well her brows crease maybe she says staring past me intently unfocused im just thinking of childhood when we at this point the young man sitting on the far side of her with his arms on the table and his head on his arms stirs sits up and yawns looking round with bleary eyes abberlaine arrol turns to him ah awake once more she says to him a gangly fellow with closeset eyes and a long nose finally scrape together a quorum of neurons did we dont be a shit abby he says after a dismissive glance at me get me some water you may be an animal brother dear she says but i am not your keeper he looks about the table which is mostly covered in dirty plates and empty glasses abberlaine arrol looks at me i dont suppose you know if you have any brothers do you not to the best of my knowledge hmm she gets up and heads for the bar the fellow closes his eyes and leans back in his seat making it swing slightly the bar is emptying only a few legs can be seen poking out from beneath distant tables witnessing where their owners alcoholic excursions into the longlost days of fourlimbed locomotion have come to their stupefied conclusions abberlaine arrol returns with a pitcher of water she is smoking a long thin cigar she stands in front of the young man and pours a little over his head puffing on the cigar he stumbles to the floor cursing and stands up shakily she hands him the pitcher and he drinks she watches him with a sort of amused contempt did you see the famous aircraft this morning mr orr miss arrol asks watching her brother not looking at me yes did you she shakes her head no i was told about them but i thought at first that it was a joke they looked real enough to me her brother finishes the water and throws the pitcher behind him with a theatrical gesture it smashes on a table in the shadows abberlaine arrol shakes her head the young man yawns tm tired lets go wheres dad gone to the club but that was some time ago he might be home by now good come on he walks towards the stairs miss arrol shrugs at me i must go mr orr thats all right nice talking to you a mutual pleasure then she looks to where the young man is waiting hands on hips at the top of the steps perhaps she says to me well have the chance to continue our conversation at a later date i hope so she remains standing there for a moment slim slightly dishevelled smoking her cigar then executes a deep mocking bow hand flourished and backs away sticking her cigar in her mouth a line of grey smoke curls after her the revellers have departed most of the people left in dissy pittons are bar staff they are switching out lights wiping tables sweeping the floor lifting inebriated forms from the deck i sit and finish my glass of wine it is warm and bitter but i hate to leave an unfinished glass finally i rise and tread the narrow corridor of remaining lights to the stairs sir i turn a broomwielding barman is holding the widebrimmed hat your hat he says shaking it at me just in case i thought he meant the broom i take the cursed thing secure in the knowledge that had it been precious to me had i been looking after it and trying to make sure that i didnt lose it it would most assuredly have disappeared for ever at the door tommy bouch is being held against the wall by the no longer dormant doorman and quizzed on his identity and destination engineer bouch seems unable to make any coherent noises his face has a distinctly green hue about it and the doorman is having difficulty supporting him you know this gentleman sir the doorman asks i shake my head never seen him before i say then shove the hat between the doormans arms but he left his hat inside oh thank you sir the doorman says he holds the hat in front of the engineers face so that he can see it or both of them as the case may be look sir your hat thanyoo engineer bouch succeeds in pronouncing before transferring the contents of his stomach into the crown of the headgear thanks to the wide brim of course remarkably little splatters over the side i walk away feeling oddly triumphant perhaps that was what he wanted it for all the time not here oh golly you know i really and honestly am sorry mr orr but no he isnt but i have an appointment yes i know mr orr i have it here see well whats the matter urgent meeting of the administrative board primary subcommittee vetting committee im afraid pretty important the doctors a very busy man these days sir there are just so many calls on his time you mustnt take it personally mr orr im not its just the way things go nobody likes all this admin stuff but its just a dirty job that has to be done yes i it could have happened during anybodys appointment you were just unlucky i appreciate you mustnt take it personally it was just one of those things yes of course and of course theres absolutely no connection with us forgetting to tell you wed moved offices the other day that was purely coincidence it could have happened to absolutely anybody whatsoever you were just unlucky it really really isnt anything personal i you mustnt take it that way im not oh mr orr not at home to mr tetchy are we outside remembering yesterdays eventful elevator journey i head in the same direction as before looking for the giant circular window and the entrance to the decrepit lshaped lift opposite it increasingly frustrated and annoyed i wander for over an hour through the highceilinged gloom of the upper structure past the same blindstatued niches ancient bureaucrats fastened in pale stone and the same heavily hanging flags furled like thickly ponderous sails on some great dark ship but without finding the circular window the old bearded man or the lift a senior clerk whose longservice ribbons proclaim he is a veteran of at least thirty years service looks puzzled and shakes his head when i describe the lift and its grizzled operator eventually the doctor would not be proud of me i give up i spend the next few hours tramping round various small galleries in a distant section of the bridge some distance from my usual haunts the galleries are dark and musty and the attendants look surprised that anybody should come to view the exhibits nothing satisfies me the works all look tired and spent paintings washed out sculptures deflated worse than the poor execution though is the downright unhealthy preoccupation with distortions of the human form which all the artists appear to share the sculptors have twisted it into a bizarre resemblance of the structures of the bridge itself thighs become caissons torsos either caissons or structural tubes and arms and legs stressed girders section of bodies are constructed from riveted iron painted bridge red tubular girders become limbs merging into grotesque conglomerations of metal and flesh like tumorous miscegenistic eruptions of cell and grain the paintings exhibit much the same preoccupations one shows the bridge as a line of misshapen dwarfs standing in sewage or blood arms linked another depicts a single tubular formation but with meandering blue veins picked out beneath the ochre surface and small trickles of blood coming from each rivet hole beneath this part of the bridge is one of the small islands which support every third section these islands are regular only in their approximate size and spacing otherwise they vary in shape and use some are riddled with old mine workings and underground caverns others almost covered in the decaying concrete slabs and circular pits of what look like old gun emplacements some support ruined buildings either old pithead works or longcrumbled factories most have a small harbour or marina at one end and a few are quite without any sign of human habitation or construction at all mere lumps of green covered in grass and scrub and green seawrack they share a mystery though and that is simply how they come to be here in the first place they look natural but together seen in all their linear regularity the islands betray themselves with a pattern an unnatural order that makes them even stranger than the bridge they intermittently support i toss a coin out of the window on the tram home it goes glittering away heading for the sea not an island a couple of other passengers throw coins too and i have a brief absurd vision of the waters below eventually being filled with thrown coins the whole firth silting up with the monetary debris of spent wishes surrounding the hollow metal bones of the bridge with a solid desert of coin in my apartment again before going to bed i watch the man in the hospital bed for a while staring at his grey and grainy image so hard and for so long that i almost mesmerise myself with that blank still image rooted in the evening darkness eyes fixed i seem to be looking not at a phosphorescing screen of glass but a bright metal plate an engraving lined and stamped on a shining largegrained slab of steel i wait for the phone to ring i wait for the flight of planes to return then a nurse appears the same nurse complete with metal tray the spell is broken the illusion of the screen as plate fractured the nurse readies the syrings swabs the mans arm i shiver as though that alcohol that spirit chilled me chilled all my flesh quickly i switch off four it wiz this majishin that geez this

bugir for a start off heeze a triky custimur so i kilt the majishin but the fukin things nevir sed enythin usefyull ever since just blethers oil day long of course according to the preceptive rules of the new symbology as characterised in the grande cabale the tower signifies retreat the limitation of contact with the real world philosophical extrospection in short nothing to do with the literally infantile preoccupation with phallic symbolism i mentioned earlier indeed except within the most morally constipated of societies when people want to dream about sex they dream about sex actually the combination of the cards la mine and la tour in the minor game is considered particularly important and the significance of the tower over the pit does have a sexual resonance for predictive purposes which the simple combination of retreat and the fear of failure would not appear immediately to imply but see whit i meen drive ye daft so it woold i cany get the wee basturd aff ma showldur niythir on account of its got these claws inside me biride in ma flesh so they are their no soar untill i try takin the thing aff but soar enuoph then alright canny even stab it or bash it with a rok on

feed it itill tolk ded loud oil nihgt an keep me awake so seein it disnae eet mutch an its been luky fir me i just leeve it thare now an we get on as wel as can be excpected wish it didnae shite doon ma bak thow interesting point actually i mean im sure you wont have noticed it being so singleminded well almost singlecelled if the truth were told but in the lands below the situation is quite the reverse of the arrangements at this rarefied altitude have you noticed youre out of breath no probably not there in the elysian pastures of this quintessentially verdant locale the women command and the men remain the size of babies all their lives its jibbering agen an hears me just aboot at the tap o this fukin big towur ma sord curverd in blud soar arm whare wun o them gards cot me at the gate erlyier an am lost in this maze with oll these wee rooms an am wurryin aboot that fyre i started farthur doon coz i can smel the smoake an id rather no be roseted alive thankyou very mutch an the dam things bletherin away as useyull ill nevir catch that old kween at this rate an her with her majik powirs an oll to anuthir o them gards cum at me but i kilt him nae bothir an jumpt ower him stil lookin fur the way up an switherin whitch way tae go god these drones are tedious this hive mentality is a real lossleader in the higher vertebrates a label applicable to you ive always felt only in terms of physical height you still lost i thought so worried about the smoke of course a smarter chap would solve both problems at once by watching the way the smokes drifting it will try to rise and there arent many windows on this floor not that theres much chance of you making that sort of connection i imagine your wits are about as fast as a sloth on valium pity your stream of consciousness hasnt entered the interglacial yet but we cant all be mental giants i imagine its all due to some appalling genetic miscoding probably went wrong in the womb all the blood supply went to form your muscles and your brain was left to develop on the portion normally reserved for the left big toe or something i thaught i wiz totaly scunnerd fur a minit thare but i just watched whare the smoake wiz goin an i found this big trapdoar so i think ahm okay but its no joak trying tae wurk oot whits goan on wi that skelyayed wee bugir gein it crak in ma eer oll the time talking about babies again as i was saying oh well done weve found a way up to the next storey have we congratulations will we remember to close the trapdoor oh very good we are coming on youll be tying your own bootlaces next probably to each other but anythings a start what was i saying babies yes in the lands below it is the fair rather than the unfair sex which is in charge males are born seemingly normal but they only grow for a short while and halt at about toddler stage they do mature sexually growing ample bodily hair and even thickening out a little and their genitals are fully developed but they stay a pleasantly cuddleable size all their lives and never grow large enough to be a threat they never fully develop mentally of course but plus ça change ask any woman these hairy mischievous little bundles of fun are of course used to father new offspring and naturally they do make marvellous pets but the women tend to form serious relationships only amongst themselves which is quite right and proper if you ask me apart from anything else it takes three or four of the males to form a satisfactory tactile quorum for lovemaking as opposed to mere insemination see stil jibbering away qwite the thing litil basturd woold be roseted meet by now if i hadnae found the way up heer ded windy up here so it is bloan fastur than a dragins fart like they say an oll these pillers and curtins and things

quicksilver quite breathtaking even with breathing equipment i should think no you wouldnt need that i suppose not much chance of you suffering from oxygen starvation i guess you could probably get by on a couple of molecules a day at a pinch god man look at you becoming a vegetable would be promotion still to give you your due i must say you did despatch those rather loudly offensive carnivores pretty calmly they very nearly had me frightened but you just waded in there quite happily didnt you yes youve got guts me lad pity theyre where your brains should be but you cant have everything including a clue it would seem personally i didnt think that throne looked quite right there doesnt appear to be any way from this storey to the next but there has to be one and if i was a monarch id want a pretty fast and handy one too if things ever did get a bit sticky in the throne room funny that you dont normally see a joinline between a throne and its dais not the sort of detail id expect

nevir mind stil majicjust been a sordsman no no no no it was worse than that this later this now waking up to the watery grey light beyond the curtains my eyes stuck and mouth gummed and foul head aching i was there that was me and i lusted after those crippled women and they excited me i raped them to the barbarian it meant nothing less than one more streak of blood on his sword but i wanted those women i made them and they were mine disgust fills me like pus my god better a lack of all desire than one excited by mutilation helplessness and rape i stumble from my bed my head hurts i feel sick and a sweat like dirty oil lies cold on my skin and my bones ache i throw open the curtains the clouds have come down the bridge at this level anyway is wrapped in grey inside i turn on all the lights the fire and the television the man in the hospital bed is surrounded by nurses they are rolling him over onto his front his white face shows nothing but i know he is in pain i hear myself groan i turn the set off the pain inside my chest comes and goes with a rhythm and a pace all its own insistent nagging i stagger like a drunkard to the bathroom in here all is white and precise and there are no windows to show the clinging fog outside i can shut the door turn on more lights and be surrounded by precise reflections and hard surfaces i let the bath run and stare for a long time at my image in the mirror after a while it is as though everything becomes dark again as if everything fades away the eyes i remember only see by moving tiny vibrations shake them so that the viewed image lives paralyse the muscles of the eyes or somehow fix something to the cornea so that it moves along with the eye and vision itself disappears i know this i learned it somewhere once but i dont know where or when my memory is a drowned landscape and i look from a narrow cliff out over where there were once fertile plains and rolling downs now there is just the uniform surface of the water and a few islands that were mountains foldings produced by some unfathomable tectonics of the mind i shake myself from my little trance only to discover that my image really has disappeared the bath waters are hot and the swirling vapour has condensed on the mirrors cold surface masking it covering it rubbing me out carefully clothed and groomed wellbreakfasted and having discovered almost to my surprise that the doctors office is still where it was yesterday and my appointment neither cancelled nor postponed morning mr orr how nice to see you yes of course the doctor is here would you like a cup of tea here i sit in the doctors enlarged office ready for my mentors questions i decided over breakfast that i would lie about my dreams after all if i can invent the first two i can cover up the others i shall tell the doctor i had no dreams last night and shall make up the one i was supposed to have had the night before there is no point in telling him the sort of things i have really been dreaming about analysis is one thing but shame is quite another the doctor all in grey as usual eyes glittering like splinters of ancient ice looks at me expectantly well i say apologetically there were three dreams or one dream in three parts dr joyce nods makes a note mmhmm carry on the first is very short im in a huge palatial house looking across a dark corridor to a black wall everything is monochrome a man appears from one side he walks slowly and heavily he is bald and his cheeks seem puffed out i cant hear any sound he walks from left to right but as he walks past where im looking i see that the wall on the far side of him is actually a huge mirror and his image is repeated and repeated in it by another mirror which must be somewhere to one side of me so i see all these thick heavylooking men in a great row marching more precisely in step than any line of soldiers i look up at the doctors eyes deep breath the ridiculous thing is the reflection nearest the man the first one doesnt mimic his actions for a second just for a moment it turns and looks at him it doesnt break step only the head and the arms move and it puts both its hands to its head spread out like this i show the doctor and waggles them and then immediately jerks back into position the reflected line of fat men walk out of view the real man the original one doesnt notice what has happened and well thats all the doctor purses his lips and clasps his pink stubby fingers together did you also identify with the man in the sea at any point as well as being the man in the robes who was watching from the shore was there at any time a sensation of being the other one who after all was the more real the man on the shore seems to have disappeared at some point the man with the chainlash stopped seeing him well dont answer that now think about it and the fact that the man you were had no shadow carry on please what is the next dream i sit and stare at dr joyce my mouth hangs open what did he just say did i hear that what did i say my god this is worse than last night i am dreaming and you are something from within myself whi im sorry wh what what how did you dr joyce looks puzzled i beg your pardon what you just said i say my tongue stumbling over the words im sorry dr joyce says and takes off his spectacles i dont know what you mean mr orr all i said was carry on please god am i still asleep no no definitely not no point trying to pretend this is a dream press on keep going maybe its just a temporary lapse i still feel odd fevered thats all it is thats all it can be fog on the brain dont let it disturb you maintain the show must go on yes i i beg your pardon im not concentrating very well today didnt sleep well last night probably why i didnt dream i smile bravely of course the good doctor says putting his spectacles back on his nose do you feel well enough to continue oh yes good the doctor actually smiles if a little artificially like a man trying on a loud tie he knows doesnt really suit him please continue when your ready i have no choice i have already told him there were three dreams in the next dream in monochrome again im watching a couple in a garden perhaps a maze theyre on a bench kissing theres a hedge behind them and a statue of well a statue a figure on a pedestal nearby the woman is young attractive the man t who is wearing some sort of formal suit is older he looks distinguished they are embracing quite passionately i have avoided the doctors eyes it takes a considerable act of will to bring my head up and face him again and then a servant appears a butler or footman he says something like ambassador the telephone as the old distinguished man and the young woman look round the young woman gets up from the bench smooths down her dress and says something like damn duty calls sorry darling and follows the servant away the old man frustrated goes over to the statue gazes at one of the figures marble feet then pulls out a large hammer and brings it smashing down on the big toe dr joyce nods makes some notes and says i would be interested in what you think the dialect signifies but carry on he looks up i swallow there is a strange high whine in my ears the last dream or the last part of the single dream takes place during the day on some cliffs above a river inside a beautiful valley a young boy sitting eating a piece of bread with some other children and a beautiful young teacher theyre all having lunch i think and theres a cave behind no there isnt a cave anyway the young boy is holding his sandwich and im looking at it too from very close up and a big splash suddenly appears on it then another and the boy looks up puzzled at the cliff above and theres a hand hanging over the edge of the cliff top and its holding a bottle of tomato sauce which is dripping onto the boys bread thats all what now mmhmm the doctor says was this a wetdream i stare at him it is asked reasonably enough and of course what is said here is completely confidential i clear my throat no it was not i see the doctor says and spends some time making half a page of microscopically neat notes my hands are shaking i am sweating well the doctor says i feel weve come to a fulcrum in this case dont you a fulcrum what does the good doctor mean i dont know what youre talking about i say we have to go on to another stage of the treatment dr joyce tells me i dont like the sound of this the doctor issues a precisely weighted professional sigh while i think we might have a well quite a good deal of material here he looks back through several pages of notes i dont feel were getting any closer to the core of the problem were circling around it thats all you see he looks up at the ceiling if we regard the human mind as say like a castle ohoh my doctor believes in metaphors then all youve been doing for the last few sessions is taking me on a guided tour of the curtain wall now im not saying youre deliberately trying to deceive me i feel sure you want to help yourself as much as i want to help you and you probably think were really heading inwards towards the keep but im an old hand at this john and i can see when im not getting anywhere oh i cant take much more of this castle comparison so what now im sorry if i havent oh no apologies needed john dr joyce assures me but i do think a new technique is required here what new technique hypnosis dr joyce says avuncularly smiling its the only way through the next line of walls or to the keep perhaps he sees my frown it wouldnt be difficult i think you would make a good subject really i stall well it may well be the only way forward he nods the only way forward i thought we were trying to go backwards youre sure i need to think about this how much does dr joyce want how much of me does he want quite sure the doctor says perfectly certain such emphasis i fiddle with my wrist band im going to have to ask for time to think but perhaps youd like to think about it dr joyce says i show no relief besides he adds looking at his pocket watch i have a meeting in half an hour and id like to schedule you on an openended basis so perhaps now isnt the most convenient time he starts to pack up putting the notepad on his desk checking his little silver pencil is safely in the scabbard of his breast pocket he takes off his glasses blows on them polishes them with his handkerchief you have he says exceptionally vivid and coherent dreams remarkable fecundity of mind now do his eyes twinkle or glitter thats almost too kind of you doctor i say dr joyce takes a moment or two to ingest this but then he smiles i take my leave agreeing with the good doctor that the fog is a nuisance i run the gauntlet of proffered tea and coffee inane remarks and unutterably good grooming in his outer office without any psychological illeffects as i leave mr berkeley is led in by his policeman mr berkeleys breath smells of mothballs i can only assume he thinks he is a chest of drawers i walk along the keithing road through the swirling cloud which has submerged us the thoroughfares become tunnels in the mist the lights of shops and cafes cast a fuzzy glow over people who emerge from the mists like dimly seen ghosts beneath me are the sounds of the trains every now and again a thick rolling cloud of their smoke bursts up from the train deck like a clot of fog the trains howl like lost souls long anguished wails the mind cannot help but interpret in its own terms perhaps the whistles were designed like that to strike an animal chord from the unseen river hundreds of feet below foghorns boom in still longer and lower choruses of baleful warning as if every place they sound from had already been the site of a terrible shipwreck and the horns placed there to mourn longdrowned sailors a rickshaw comes furiously out of the fog announced in advance by the squeaking horns in the boys heelpumps a match girl steps out of the way as it charges past i turn and watch seeing a white face framed by dark hair inside the wicker and clothdark depths of the contraption it speeds past id swear the occupant returned my gaze a dim red light glowing fuzzily through the fog from its rear there is a shout then from ahead as the faint light hazes over disappears the sound of squeaking heelhorns decelerating stopping i walk on and catch the stationary rickshaw up that white face seemingly glowing through the mist looks round the side of the devices canopy mr or miss arrol what a surprise i seem to be going in your direction precipitously i stand by the side of the twowheeled vehicle the boy between the handles looks on panting his sweat glowing in the diffused light of a streetlamp abberlaine arrol looks flushed her white face almost rosy from close up i am oddly delighted to see that those distinctive crinkles under her eyes are there yet they may be permanent or she may have spent another late night carousing perhaps she is just heading home now but no people have a morning look and feel and an evening one and chief engineer arrols daughter positively exudes freshness just now can i give you a lift your very appearance has already done so i execute a curtailed version of one of her exaggerated bows she laughs deep in her throat where usually men laugh the rickshawboy is watching us with an expression of annoyance he takes his abacus from his waist and starts to click it with noisy ostentation you are gallant mr orr miss arrol says nodding my offer stands but would you prefer to sit i am disarmed delighted i step into the light vehicle miss arrol clad in boots culottes and a dark heavy jacket shifts over in the seat making room the rickshawboy makes a loud tut sound and starts talking and gesticulating excitedly abberlaine arrol answers in the same voluble tongue with hand gestures the boy puts the handles down with another loud tut and marches into a cafe across the woodendecked road hes gone to get another boy miss arrol explains its worth the extra to maintain speed is that entirely safe in this fog i can feel a halfseat worth of warmth seeping through my coat from the small padded bench beneath me abberlaine arrol snorts of course not her eyes more green than grey in this light narrow the slim mouth twists at one side thats half the fun the boy comes back with another they take a handle each and with a jerk we are borne off into the mist a constitutional mr orr no im returning from a visit to my doctor how are you progressing fitfully my doctor now wants to hypnotise me i am beginning to question the utility of my treatment if it can be called that miss arrol is watching my lips as i speak an endearing but oddly unsettling experience she smiles broadly now and looks ahead where the two running boys labour tearing through the lighthazed fog scattering people to either side you must have faith mr orr miss arrol says hmm i say as i too watch our breakneck progress through the grey cloud for a moment i think i might be more inclined to make my own investigations your own mr orr yes i dont suppose youve ever heard of the third city records and historical materials library have you she shakes her head no sorry the rickshawboys shout we swerve round an old man m the middle of the road missing him by less than a foot i am pressed against miss arrol as the rickshaw heels over then steadies most people dont seem to have heard of it and those who have cant find it miss arrol shrugs staring through narrowed eyes into the fog these things happen she says matteroffactly she glances back at me is that the limit of your investigations mr orr no id like to know more about the kingdom and the city about what lies beyond the bridge i watch her face for some reaction but she seems to be concentrating on the fog and the road ahead i continue but that would probably require me to travel and im rather restricted in that respect she turns to me brows raised well she says ive done a bit of travelling perhaps gangway our original rickshawboy shrieks miss arrol and i glance forward together to see a sedan chair directly in front of us parked right across the wooden deck of the narrow street two men are holding one of its broken poles they throw themselves to one side as our two boys try to brake bracing their heels but were too close the boys swerve and we start to tip miss arrol throws one arm across my chest i am staring stupidly ahead as our rickshaw skids and judders creaking and squealing into the side of the sedan chair she is thrown against me the side of the rickshaw roof comes up and slaps me on the head something incandesces in the fog for a second then goes out mr orr mr orr mr orr i open my eyes i am lying on the ground it is very grey and strange and people are crowded around me looking at me a young woman with crumpled eyes and long dark hair stands beside me mr orr i hear the sound of aircraft engines i hear the swelling drone of those planes as they fly through the seaward fog i lie and listen wondering frustrated unable to tell which direction they are flying in it seems important mr orr the noise of their engines fades i wait for the darkly drifting smudges of their pointless signals to appear out of the faintly moving fog mr orr yes i feel dizzy and my ears are making their own noise like a waterfall its foggy lights blaze like smudged crayon marks on a grey page a shattered sedan chair and broken rickshaw lie in the middle of the road two boys and a couple of men are arguing the young woman kneeling beside me is quite beautiful but her nose is bleeding red drops gather under it and i can see where she has already wiped some of the blood away making a red smear on her left cheek a warm glow like a warm red light inside the fog fills me from inside when i realise that i know this young woman oh mr orr im sorry are you all right she sniffs wipes more blood from her nose her eyes glisten in the diffused light but i think not with tears she is called abberlaine arrol i remember now i thought there were other people crowded around me but there are none just her people appear out of the mist to stare at the crashed vehicles im fine perfectly fine i say and sit up are you sure miss arrol squats on her haunches at my side i nod feeling my head one temple is a little tender but there is no blood quite sure i say in fact everything is a little distant but i dont feel faint i still have the presence of mind to reach into my pocket and offer miss arrol my handkerchief she takes it and dabs at her nose thank you mr orr she holds the white cloth to her nose the rickshawboys and sedan chair carriers are shouting and cursing at each other more people appear i get shakily to my feet supported by the girl really im all right i say the roaring in my ears resumes for a while then gradually fades we walk over to the wreckage she looks at me talking through the handkerchief i dont suppose that knock to your head brought your memory back she sounds as though she has a cold her eyes look mischievous i shake my head carefully as miss arrol looks inside the cover of the rickshaw then brings out a thin leather briefcase and dusts it down no i say after some thought i should not have been in the least surprised to find i had forgotten even more how about you are you all right your nose it bleeds easily she shakes her head not broken otherwise only a few bruises she coughs and seems to start to double up and i realise again that she is actually laughing she shakes her head violently im sorry mr orr this is all my fault a mania for speed she holds her leather briefcase my father needs these drawings in the next section and it seemed like a good excuse a train would probably have been faster but look i really must be getting along if youre quite sure youre all right ill take an elevator and a train from here youd better sit down theres a bar over there ill buy you a coffee i protest but i am vulnerable just now i am escorted to the bar miss arrol argues vociferously outside with the two men and the rickshawboys for a minute or so then turns as another rickshaw comes squeaking out of the mist behind her she runs to the boy talks quickly then comes back to the bar where i am sipping my coffee never mind got another cab she tells me breathlessly must be off she takes the bloodstained handkerchief away from her nose looks at it sniffs experimentally then stuffs the handkerchief into a deep pocket in her culottes ill return it she says you sure youre all right yes well goodbye sorry again take care she backs off waves then walks quickly outside snapping her fingers at the rickshawboy a final wave then she is away racing off into the fog the barman comes to fill up my coffee cup again these youngsters he says smiling and shaking his head it would appear i have been declared an honorary senior citizen looking in the mirror at the far side of the bar i can understand why i am about to reply when from outside the bar the manic beeping of a rickshawboys heels makes us both turn to the window miss arrols newly hired vehicle reappears skids and turns round just outside the open door of the bar she sticks her head round the edge mr orr she calls i wave her new rickshawboy already looks annoyed the two previous ones and the sedan carriers look slightly incredulous my travels ill be in touch all right i nod she seems satisfied ducks back in and snaps her fingers the cab leaps offence more the barman and i look at each other god must have sneezed when he blew life into that one he says i nod and sip my coffee not wishing to talk he goes to wash some glasses i study the pale face in the mirror opposite above serried glasses beneath poised bottles shall i be hypnotised i think i am already i stay a little longer recovering the sedan chair and rickshaw are manhandled away the fog if anything becomes thicker i leave the bar and take elevator train and elevator home there is a package waiting for me there engineer bouch has returned my hat along with a note full of assorted apologies as profuse as they are both unoriginal and ungrammatical he has spelt my name or the hat has been expertly cleaned and restored it smells fresher and looks newer than when i brought it out of the wardrobe to take to dissy pittons i take it outside and throw it from the balcony it vanishes into the grey mist on a falling curve silent and swift as though on some grand important mission to the invisible grey waters below triassic i dont have to be here you know i could be any damn place i want to here in my mind in my brain in my skull and that all seems so ob no no because it all seems so obvious now is a cliche and i have an inbuilt ingrained indignant dislike of clichés and cliques and clicks aktcherly the bit about clicks was stretching a point mathematically nonsense because if you stretch a point you get a line in which case it isnt a goddam point any more is it i mean what is the bloody point where was i damn these lights and tubes and being turned over and getting jabbed chap can lose his concentration dontcherno respool rewind

just let me rewind here rushed to hospital lights overhead big white shining lights in sky emergency operation situation critical bla bla bla fuck that pal i was always critical condition stable fairynuf it wiz only recently it all started to get to me comfortable no i am not bloody comfortable would you be fast forward again dot dot dot hek gang look you dont want to listen to my problems and i certainly dont want to listen to yours so howsa bout i intraduce my fren here old pala mine fren frum waybak wontchya ta giv him ghost capital steady boy like i was saying me and this guy go waybak an i wantcher to give him a real ghosts capital real city of ok ok on ye go fur fuksake basturt ghost capital real city of varied stones the great grey place of wynds and winds old new and festive by turns between the river and the hills with its own stone stump that frozen flow that fractured plug of ancient matter which fascinated him he came to stay in sciennes road just liking the name not knowing the place it was handy both for the university and the institute and if he pressed his face against the window of his cold highceilinged room he could just see the edge of the crags greybrown corrugations above the slate roofs and smoke of the city he would never forget the feeling of that first year the sense of freedom just being on his own gave him he had his own room for the first time his own money to spend as he wanted his own food to buy arid places to go and decisions to make it was glorious sublime his home was in the west of the country in the industrial heartland which was already failing silting up with cheap fat starved of energy clogging and clotting and thickening and threatened there he had lived mum and dad and brothers and sisters and him in a pebbledashed house on an estate beneath the low hills just within sight of the sihoke and steambannered chimneys above the railway workshops where his father worked his father kept pigeons in a loft on some waste ground there were a dozern or more lofts on the piece of wasteland all tall and misshapen and unplanned and made of corrugated iron painted matt black in the summers when he went there to help his father or to look at the softly cooing birds the loft was very hot and its befeathered droppingspattered spaces seemed like a dark richscented other world he did well at school though of course they said he could do better he came top in history because he chose to that was enough hed shift up a gear if and when he had to meanwhile he played and read and drew and watched television his father was injured at work and laid up for a year and half his mother went to work in the cigarette factory his sisters and brothers were old enough to look after the others his father recovered more or less the man he had been maybe a little more quick to anger and his mother went parttime until she was made redundant years later he liked his dad until he became a little ashamed of him as he became a little ashamed of all his family his father lived for football and pay day he had old records by harry lauder and of several pipe bands and he could recite about fifty of the bestknown burns poems by heart he was a labour man of course forever faithful but wary always excepting the betrayal the fudging the lies he maintained that he had never knowlingly drunk so much as a quartergill in the company of a tory with the possible exception of some publicans who for the sake of the socialist causes good name he rather hoped were conservatives or liberals whom he regarded as honourable misguided but relatively harmless a mans man a man who never walked away from a fight or a workmate who needed another pair of hands a man who never left a goal uncheered or a foul unjeered or a pint unfinished his mum always seemed like a shadow compared to his dad she was there when he needed her to wash his clothes and comb his hair and buy him things and give him a cuddle when hed skinned his knee but he never really knew her as a person his sisters and brothers he got on with but they were all older than he was it was years before he discovered he was the mistake and they already seemed grownup by the time he was of an age to become really interested in them he was tolerated spoiled and victimised by turns according to how they felt he considered himself hard done by and envied those from smaller families but slowly came to understand that in general hed been more spoiled and indulged than tormented and made scapegoat he was their child too special to them as well they always looked delighted when he answered television quizshow questions before the contestants and were proud and a little amazed that he read two or three library books every week they like his mum and dad would give a little smile and then a long frown when they saw his school report card ignoring the es and the vgs and tapping at the f for ri religious instruction god the confusion he suffered for years because his father approved of atheism but not of doing badly at any school subject and the pe pe he hated the gym teacher and it was mutual they went their various ways the girls marrying sammy going into the army jimmy emigrating morag did best he supposed marrying an office equipment sales manager from bearsden he gradually lost touch with them all over the years but he never forgot the sense of quiet almost respectful pride which permeated their congratulations mailed or phoned or delivered in person when he was accepted for university even if they were all surprised he wanted to do geology rather than english or history but the great city that year was everything to him the western hub glasgow and its heartlands he would always be too close to always have too many memories of all jumbled up from childhood days out and visits to aunties and grannies it was part of him part of his past the old capital old edwins town edinburgh that was another country to him a new and wonderful place eden ascendant eden before the fall eden before his own longdesired escape from the technicalities of innocence the air was different though he was only fifty miles from home the days seemed to shine on that first autumn at least and even the winds and the fogs were like something he had always waited for alternate scourings and coatings he underwent with a kind of happily pampered vanity as though it was all for him a priming and preparation a grooming he explored the city whenever he could walking taking buses climbing hills and descending steps always watching and looking surveying the stones and layout and architecture of the place with all the possessive glee of a new laird inspecting his lands he stood on that stark volcanic remnant eyes slitted against a northsea wind and looked out over the swept spaces of the city he forced his way through the thrown sheets of stinging rain walking the old docks and the coastal esplanade he meandered through the jumbled erratics of the old he strode the clean geometry of the new he wandered through the quiet fog under the dean bridge and discovered the village within the city in its notyetquaint decrepitude and he strolled along the famous bustling street on sunlit shopping saturdays just grinning at the rockrooted castle and its royal train of colleges and offices an encrusted battlement of buildings along the basalt spine of the hill he took to writing poems and song lyrics and in the university he would walk along the corridors whistling he got to know stewart mackie a small quietspoken sallowfaced aberdonian and fellow geology student they and their friends decided they were the alternative geologists and called themselves the rockers they drank beer in the union and the pubs in rose street and the royal mile they smoked dope and some took acid white rabbit and astronomy dominé blared from stereos and one night in trinity he at last lost that technical ghost of innocence to a young nurse from the western general whose name he forgot next day he met andrea cramond in the union one night while he was with stewart mackie and some of the rockers they went off without telling him to danube street to a wellknown brothel later they claimed they only did so because theyd noticed this chick with granitered hair giving him the eye she had a flat in comely bank not far from the queensferry road andrea cramond was an edinburgh girl her parents lived only half a mile away in one of the tall grand houses circling moray place she wore psychedelic clothes she had green eyes remarkable cheekbones a lotus elan a fourroomed flat two hundred record and seemingly inexhaustible supplies of money charm red leb and sexual energy he fell in love with her almost immediately when they first met at the union they talked about reality mental illness she had read her laing the importance of geology that was him recent french cinema her the poetry of ts eliot her literature in general her mostly and vietnam both she had to go back to her parents house that night it was her fathers birthday the following day and it was family tradition to start the celebrations with a champagne breakfast a week later they literally bumped into each other at the top of the waverley steps he was heading for the station to go home for the weekend she was off to see friends after doing some christmas shopping they went for a drink had several and then she invited him back to her flat for a smoke he rang a neighbour who would go round and tell his parents he was going to be late she had some whisky at the flat they listed to stones and dylan lps they sat on the floor together in front of the hissing gas fire as it grew darker outside and after a while he found himself stroking her long red hair and then kissing her and then after that he called the neighbours again and said he had an essay to finish and couldnt come home that weekend and she rang some people who were expecting her at a party to say she couldnt make it and then they spent the rest of the weekend in bed or in front of the hissing gas fire two years went past before he told her he had seen her amongst the crowds of people on north bridge that day loaded with her shopping and had already walked past her twice before deliberately bumping into her by the steps she had been thinking not looking at the people around her and he had been too shy just to stop her without some pretext she laughed when she heard this they drank smoked and screwed together and tripped together a couple of times she took him round museums and galleries and to her parents house her father was an advocate a tall grey impressive man with a powerful resonant voice and halfmoon glasses andrea cramonds mother was younger than her husband greying but elegant and tall as her daughter there was one older brother very straight also in the law and whole circle of her old school friends it was with them that he gradually came to be ashamed of his family his background his westcoast accent even some of the words he used they made made him feel inferior not in intellect but in training in the way hed been brought up and slowly he started to change trying to find a middleground between all the different things he wanted to be true to his upbringing his class and beliefs but also true to the new spirit of love alternatives and real possibility of peace and a better less greedy less fuckedup world and true to his own fundamental certainty in the understandability and malleability of the earth the environment ultimately everything it was that belief which would not allow him to accept anything else completely his fathers view he thought at the time was too limited by geography class and history andreas friends were too pretentious her parents too selfsatisfied and the love generation he already felt though hed have been uncomfortable admitting it too naive he believed in science in maths and physics in reason and understanding in cause and effect he loved elegance and the sheer objective logic of scientific thought which began by saying suppose but could then build certainty hard facts from that unprejudiced unrestricted starting point all faiths it seemed began imperatively by saying believe and from this ultimately fearful insistency could conjure up only images of fear and domination something to submit to but built of nonsenses ghosts ancient vapours there were some difficult times in that first year he was appalled to find himself jealous when andrea slept with somebody else and cursed the upbringing that had told and retold him that a man should be jealous and a woman had no right to screw around but a man did he wondered if he ought to suggest they move in together they talked about it he had to spend that summer back in the west working for the corporation cleansing department sweeping leafy dogshitspattered westend streets andrea was abroad first with her family in a cretan villa and then visiting a friends family in paris but at the start of the next year they were to his surprise back together again relatively unchanged he decided to drop geology while everybody else was doing eng lit or sociology or so it seemed to him he would do something useful he started a degree course in engineering design some of andreas friends tried to persuade him to do english because he seemed to know something about literature he had learned how to talk about it not just enjoy it and because he wrote poetry it was andreas fault anybody knew he hadnt wanted the stuff published but shed seen some of it lying around in his room and sent it to a friend of hers who published a magazine called radical road he had been embarrassed and proud in almost equal measure when she surprised him with the issue of the magazine flourishing it triumphantly in front of him a present no he was determined to do something which would be of real use to die world andreas friends could call him a plumber if diey wanted he was determined he remained friends with stewart mackie but lost touch with the other rockers some weekends he and andrea would go out to her parents second house at gullane along the firths duned shore east the house was large and bright and airy and stood the golf course looking out across the greyblue waters to the distant coast of fife they would stay there for a weekend and take walks along the beach and through the dunes occasionally in the quietness of the dunes they would make love sometimes on good really clear days they would walk to the end of the beach and climb the highest dune because he was convinced they would be able to see the three long red summits of the forth bridge which had terribly impressed him when he was just a wee boy and which he always told her were the same colour as her hair but they never did see it from there she sat crosslegged on the floor after her bath pulling a brush through her long thick red hair her blue kimono reflected firelight and her face legs and arms shone newly scrubbed in the same yelloworange glow he was at the window looking out into the fogfilled night his hands cupped on either side of his face like blinkers as he pressed his nose against the glass she said what do you think he was silent for a moment then pulled away from the window closing the brown velvet curtains again he turned back to her shrugging pretty thick we could make it but it wouldnt be much fun driving should we stay she brushed her hair slowly holding it out to one side of her tilted head and pulling the brush through it carefully patiently he could almost hear her thinking it was sunday night they ought to be leaving the coast house and heading back to the city it had been foggy when they woke that morning and they waited all day for it to lift but it had just kept thickening shed called her parents it was in the city too and all over the east coast according to the weather centre so they would not run of it once they left gullane it was only twenty miles or so that was a long way in the fog she hated driving in fog and thought he drove too quickly whatever the conditions hed only passed his test in her car six months earlier and he loved driving fast two of her friends had had car crashes year not bad ones but still he knew she was superstitious and believed that bad luck ran in threes she wouldnt want to go back though she had a tutorial the next morning the flames flickered over the logs in the wide grate she nodded slowly ok i dont know if weve got much food in though fuck the food do we have any dope he said coming to sit beside her twisting some of her hair in his fingers and grinning at her she clonked him on the head with the brush addict he made a mewling noise and rolled around the floor rubbing his head then seeing this had no effect she was still calmly brushing her hair he sat up again back against an armchair he looked over at the old radiogram want me to put wheels of fire on again she shook her head no electric ladyland he suggested put on something old she said frowning in the firelight looking at the brown folds of the velvet curtains old he said feigning disgust yeah is bringing it all back home there oh dylan he said stretching and pulling his fingers through his long hair i dont think weve got it ill have a look theyd brought a case full of records with them hmm no not here suggest something else you choose something old im feeling nostalgic something from the good old days she laughed as she said it these are the good old days he told her thats not what you said when prague burned and paris didnt she told him he sighed looking at all the old lps yeah i know in fact she added its not what you were saying when that nice mr nixon got elected either or when may daly ok ok so what do you want to hear oh put on ladyland again she said sighing he took the record to the radiogram do you want to eat out she asked him he wasnt sure he didnt want to leave the cosy intimacy of the house it was good to be alone with her also he couldnt afford to eat out all the time she paid for most of the meals could do could do he said blowing some dust off the needle under the heavy bakelite arm he had stopped making jokes about the radiograms antiquity ill see whats in the fridge she said unfolding from the floor standing and straightening the kimono i think the stash is in my bag oh goody he said ill roll a funny cigarette they played cards later after shed called her parents to say theyd be back tomorrow afterwards she took out tarot cards and started to tell his fortune she was interested in the tarot in astrology and sun signs and the prophecies of nostradamus she didnt believe deeply in them they just interested her he thought that was worse than believing in them completely she got annoyed with him during the reading he was being sarcastic she packed the cards away upset i just want to know how it works he tried to explain why she sprawled over the couch behind him reached down and lifted the record cover they were using as a crashboard why he laughed shaking his head because thats the only way to understand anything first does it work then how perhaps dearest she said licking a cigarette paper not everything has to be understood perhaps not everything can be not like equations and formulae they kept returning to this emotional sense versus logic he believed in a sort of unified field theory of the consciousness it was there to be understood emotions and feelings and logical thought together a whole an entity however disparate in its hypotheses and results which nevertheless worked throughout on the same fundamental principles it would all eventually be comprehended it was just a matter of time and research it seemed so obvious to him that he had great and genuine difficulty understanding anybody elses point of view you know he said if i had my way i wouldnt let anybody who believed in star signs or the bible or faith healing or anything like that use electric power or ride in cars and buses and trains and aircraft or use anything made of plastic they want to believe the universe works according to their crazy little rules ok let them live that way but why should they be allowed to use the fruits of sheer fucking human genius and hard work things produced only because people better than them once had the sense and the hope to will you stop laughing at me he glared at her she was shaking with silent laughter her pinkly quivering tongue poised to lick another paper she turned to him eyes glistening and held out a hand youre just so funny sometimes she said he took her hand kissed it formally so glad i amuse you my dear he didnt think hed said anything funny why was she laughing at him in the end he had to admit he didnt really understand her he didnt understand women he didnt understand men he didnt even understand children very well all he really understood he thought was himself and the rest of the universe neither anything like completely of course but both well enough to know that what remained to be discovered would make sense it would fit in it could all be gradually and patiently fitted together a bit at a time like an infinite jigsaw puzzle with no straight edges to look for and no end in sight but one in which there was always going to be somewhere for absolutely any piece to fit once when he was quite small his dad had taken him to the railway shed where he worked they overhauled locomotives there and his dad had taken him round showing him the huge tall steam engines being taken apart and put back together scraped and cleaned and repaired and he remembered standing watching a massive loco on a static test working up to full speed on a set of buried whining steel drums its manhigh wheels spinning in a blur heat quivering from its metal plates steam whirling about the strobing spokes linkages and bars and piston rods flashed in the lights of the echoing groundshaken shed and smoke from the engines chimney pulsed and hammered up a great riveted metal tube which vented it to the shed roof it was a terrifyingly noisy blastingly powerful indescribably vivid experience he was at once aghast and ecstatic filled with a sense of appalled ravished awe at the sheer stunning contained power of the machine that power that controlled working energy that metal symbol of all that could be done with work and sense and matter resounded in him for years he would wake up from dreams panting sweating heart pounding unsure whether he was frightened or excited or both all he knew was that having seen that pounding stationary engine anything was possible he had never been able to describe the original experience to his own satisfaction and he had never tried to explain that feeling to andrea because he could never fully explain it to himself here she said passing him the joint and a cigarette lighter see if you can get this to work he lit the joint blew the smoke at her in a ring she laughed and waved the fluid grey necklace away from her newlywashed hair they smoked the last of his opiated dope they got the munchies and she made some wonderful scrambled eggs he never forgot and she could never reproduce they went giggling and sniggering down to the nearest hotel for a quick drink before closing time then giggling and sniggering back up the road to the house they started goosing each other then groping then kissing and finally they screwed on the grass at the roadside invisible and very cold and quick in the fog while twenty feet away peoples voices sounded now and again and car headlights crept slowly past back at the house they dried off and warmed up and she rolled another joint and he read a sixmonthold paper hed found in a magazine rack laughing at the things people found important they went to bed drank the last of the laphroaig shed brought and sat up singing songs like wichita lineman and ode to billy joe with the lines changed regardless of whether they scanned or not to make them scottish i am a lineman for the countycounsell and throw them in in the muddy waters off the forth road bridge he drove the lotus back in the fog at lunchtime on the monday slowerthan he wanted faster than she liked hed started a poem on the friday and he tried to go on with it now while he drove but the rest of it just wouldnt come it was a sort of antirhyming antilovesong poem partly a result of him being sick to death of songs rhyming arms and charms and blethering on about love lasting longer than the mountains and the oceans oceanemotiondevotion chancedanceromance the lines he had but could not add to in the fog were lady that soft skin your bones and mine will all be dust before another mountains razed no oceans not a river hardly a stream will dry before our eyes do and our hearts metamorpheus one some things echo more than others sometimes i hear the last sound of all that never echoes because there is nothing to bounce back from it is the sound of final nothing and it comes booming through the great pipes that are the bridges marrowless bones like a hurricane like god farting like every shout of pain collected and replayed i hear it then a noise to rupture ears split skulls shatter walls break souls those organ pipes are dark tunnels of iron in the sky enormous and strong what other sort of tune could they play a tune fit for the end of the world the end of all life the end of all things the rest just hazy images patterns of shadow screen not silver dark stop the false and flimsy stuff in the gate if you want to see what its all made of there watch the pretty colours as it static moves again cooking burning bubbling and splitting and peeling back darkly like bruised lips parting the image forced aside by the pressure of that pure white light see what im doing for you laddie no im not him im just watching him just a man i met somebody i used to know i think i met him again later that comes later all in good time im asleep now but well im asleep now thats enough no i dont know where i am no i dont know who i am yes of course i know its all a dream isnt everything a wind comes and blows the fog away in the early morning i dress in a daze trying to remember my dreams i am not even sure i did dream last night in the sky above the river swollen grey shapes are slowly revealed by the lifting fog big bloated balloons like immense pneumatic bombs barrage balloons up and down the length of the bridge there must be hundreds of them floating in the air at about summit height perhaps higher and anchored either to the islands or to trawlers and other boats the last of the fog lifts and is scattered it looks like it will be a fine day the barrage balloons turn together in the sky looking not so much like birds but a school of great grey whales slowly moving their bulbous snouts into the atmospheres soft current i press my face to the cold glass of the window looking down the hazy length of the bridge at as acute an angle as possible the balloons are everywhere spread out across the sky some only a hundred feet or so from the bridge others standing several miles off i assume they are to prevent any more flypasts by the aircraft rather an excessive reaction id have thought the letterbox flaps a letter falls to the carpet it is a note from abberlaine arrol she will be doing some drawing at a certain marshalling yard a few sections away this morning and would i like to join her today is looking brighter all the time i remember to pick up my letter to dr joyce i wrote it last night after disposing of the returned hat i have told the good doctor that i wish to delay the hypnosis i ask his indulgence politely i assure him i am still more than happy to meet and discuss my dreams they have been more profound lately i tell him and hence probably more useful in the sort of analysis he originally intended to make i put miss arrols letter and my own to the good doctor in my pocket and stand watching the balloons a moment longer they swing slowly in the morning light like huge mooring buoys floating on some invisible surface above us somebody knocks at the door with any luck it will be a repairman for the screen or phone or both i turn the key and try to open the door but cannot the knock comes again yes i call pulling at the handle a man shouts from outside come to have a look at your television set that mr orr is it i struggle with the door the handle turns but nothing happens is it mr j orr the man shouts yes yes it is hold on a moment i cant get the damn door open right you are mr orr i tug and haul at the door handle twisting it shaking it it has never even been stiff before now not a hint of trouble perhaps everything in the flat is designed only to operate for about six months i start to get angry you sure you unlocked it mr orr yes i say trying to keep calm sure its the right key positive i shout just thought id ask the man sounds amused you got another door mr orr no no i havent tell you what push the key through the letterbox ill try unlocking it from this side he tries this it does not work i walk back to the windows for a moment breathing deeply and looking out at the massed balloons then i hear more muffled talking outside the door telephone engineer here mr orr another voice calls something wrong with your door he cant open it the first voice says definitely unlocked is it the phone man says the door is rattled i say nothing you got another door we can use mr orr he shouts i already asked him that the first man says the door is knocked again what i say you got a phone mr orr the television repairman says of course he has the phone man says indignantly can you phone buildings and corridors mr orr theyll know wh how can he do that the phone mans voice is high with incredulity im here to repair his bloody phone arent i i retreat to my study before he suggests i watch some television to pass the time it takes another hour a corridor janitor takes the whole wood surround away from the door finally the door just clicks open without warning leaving him standing puzzled and suspicious in the midst of broken wood and dusty plaster both the repairmen have left for other jobs i step out over wooden slats pierced by bent nails thank you i tell the janitor he is scratching his head with a claw hammer i post the letter to dr joyce then buy some fruit to break my fast my release has left me just enough time to rendezvous with miss arrol the tram i take is full of people discussing the barrage balloons most people have no idea what they are for once the tram clears the section proper and enters the relatively uncluttered linking span we all turn to look at them i am amazed they are on one side only downriver more barrage balloons than you could shake a stick at upriver not one everybody else on the tram points and goggles at the massed balloons only i it seems stare thunderstuck in the other direction into the unmarred skies upriver beyond the xing girders of the linking span not a single solitary balloon good morning it is rather isnt it good morning to you too hows your head my head is fine how is your nose same horrible shape but not bleeding oh your handkerchief abberlaine arrol digs into a jacket pocket brings out my handkerchief fresh and crisp miss arrol has just arrived here on a railway workers tram we are in a marshalling yard the widest place on the bridge ive seen so far some of the sidings extend out far beyond the main structure on broad cantilevered platforms great engines long trains of multifarious carriages sturdy shunters and flimsy complicated trackmaintenance vehicles clank and shift over and across the complexity of lines and points and sidings like ponderous pieces in some huge slow game steam drifts in the morning light smoke billows across the harsh points of the still blazing arc lamps high in the girders uniformed men dash to and fro shouting and waving different coloured flags blowing whistles and talking quickly into trackside telephones abberlaine arrol wearing a long grey skirt and short grey jacket her hair gathered up inside an officiallooking cap is here to draw the chaotic scene her freehand sketches and watercolours of railway subjects already adorn several boardrooms and office foyers she is considered a promising artist she hands my handkerchief to me there is something curious in her eyes and stance i glance at my laundered kerchief and stuff it into a spare pocket miss arrol smiles to herself not to me i have the disquieting impression that i have missed something here thank you i say you may carry my easel for me mr orr i left it over here last week we cross several tracks to a small shed near the centre of the broad railtangled platform of the marshalling yard around us linked carriages and decoupled engines shift slowly back and forth in other places whole engines sink slowly through the deck on massively pulleyed platforms transporting them to workshops beneath the tracks what do you make of our strange balloons mr orr she asks me as we walk i assume theyre there to stop aircraft though why theyre only on one side i dont know nobody else seems to either miss arrol says thoughtfully probably another administration cockup she signs even my father hadnt heard anything about them and hes usually fairly well informed at the small shed she retrieves her easel i transport the ashaped structure to her chosen vantage point she appears decided upon one of the heavy engine hoists as her choice of subject she adjusts the easel sets down her small folding stool opens her satchel to reveal bottles of paints and a selection of pencils charcoal sticks and crayons she surveys the scene with a critical eye and chooses a black length of charcoal no further illeffects from our little crash the other day mr orr she makes a line on the greywhite paper a certain conditioned nervousness at the sound of rapid rickshaw heelhorns no more a temporary symptom im sure she unleashes a smile of quite stunning charm before returning to the easel we were talking about travelling before we were so rudely interrupted werent we yes i i had been going to ask you how far youd travelled abberlaine arrol adds a few small circles and arcs to her sketch university i suppose she says quickly brushing a few intersecting lines across the paper that was about she shrugs a hundred and fifty two hundred sections away cityward you couldnt see land from there could you land mr orr she says glancing at me my you are ambitious no i could see no land apart from the usual islands do you think there is no kingdom then no city either oh i imagine they both exist somewhere more lines havent you ever wanted to see them cant say i have at least not since i stopped wanting to be a train driver she shades areas of the sketch i can see a succession of vaulting xs a suggestion of cloudshrouded heights she draws quickly at the nape of her pale slender neck some escaped black strands of hair curl over the creamy suface like intricate swirls of some unknown writing you know she says i knew an engineer once quite senior who thought what we really lived on wasnt a bridge at all but a single huge rock in the centre of an uncrossable desert hmm i say uncertain how to take this perhaps it is something different to all of us what do you see same as you she says turning briefly to me a bloody great bridge what do you think im drawing here she turns back i smile oh a bit less than a fathom at a guess i hear her laugh and you mr orr my own conclusions this earns me one of her flashing smiles she goes back to the drawing for a while then looks distractedly up for a moment you know the thing i miss most about university she says whats that being able to see the stars properly she nods looking thoughtful too much light to see the stars properly round here unless you go out to sea but the university was stuck in the middle of farming sections and it was quite dark at night farming sections you know abberlaine arrol steps back arms folded from her work places where they grow food yes i see it had not occurred to me that other sections of the bridge might be given over to farming it would not be difficult i suppose one might require windbreaks perhaps even mirrors to farm on different levels and water rather than soil would be the best growing medium but it would be possible so the bridge may well be totally selfsufficient in food my idea that its length was limited by the time it would take for a fast goods train to deliver fresh produce each day would appear to be irrelevant the bridge can be any length it likes abberlaine arrol lights a thin cigar one booted foot taps on the metal deck she turns to me folding her arms again beneath the bloused and jacketed contours of her breasts her skirt swings comes back a heavy expensive cloth there is a hint of a light dayperfume over the fragrant cigar smoke well mr orr i inspect miss arrols finished drawing the broad platform of the marshalling yard has been sketched in then altered the lines and tracks look like creepers in a jungle all fallen to the floor the trains are grotesque gnarled things like giant maggots or decaying tree trunks above the girders and tubes become branches and boughs disappearing into smoke rising from the jungle floor a giant infernal forest one engine has become a monster rearing out of the ground a snarling fiery lizard the small terrified figure of a man runs from it his miniature face just visible twisted into a shriek of terror imaginative i say after a moments thought she laughs lightly you dont like it my tastes are too literal perhaps the quality of drawing is impressive i know that miss arrol says her voice is sharp but her face looks a little sad i wish i liked the sketch better but what a signalling capacity miss abberlaine arrols greygreen eyes possess they view me now with an expression almost of compassion i think that i like the young lady very much she says i meant it for you she reaches into her satchel and takes out a rag begins to clean her hands really i am genuinely pleased thats very kind of you thank you she takes the drawing from the easel and rolls it up you have my permission to do whatever you will with it she says wryly make paper aircraft out of it certainly not i say as she hands it to me i feel as though i have just been presented with a diploma ill have it framed and hung in my apartment already i like it a great deal more knowing that it was drawn for me abberlaine arrols exits amuse me this time she is picked up by a track engineers car a quaint elegantly glassed and panelled carriage full of complicated but archaic instruments all bright brass clinking balances and drums of paper flowing past scribbling pens it hisses and rattles to a stop a door concertinas open and a young guard salutes miss arrol who is on her way to lunch with her father i hold her easel having been instructed to replace it in the shed her satchel bulges with rolled line drawings the commissioned work she really came here to do and which she has been busy with while still talking to me since completing my sketch she puts one boot on the high step up to the carriage and holds out her hand to me thank you for your help mr orr thank you for my drawing i take her hand between miss arrols boot top and skirt hem her stocking is revealed for the first time a fine but unmistakable black fishnet i concentrate on her eyes they look amused i hope ill see you again i glance at those pretty bags beneath the greygreen eyes fishnet indeed i am netted again she squeezes my hand i feel faint with an absurd euphoria well mr orr if i can summon up the courage i may let you take me out to dinner that would be most pleasant i do hope you discover quite inexhaustible reserves of bravery in the near future i bow a little and am rewarded with another glimpse of that besottingly lovely leg goodbye then mr orr keep in touch i will goodbye the door closes the carriage clanks and hisses off steam from its passing curls round me like mist making my eyes water i take out my handkerchief it has been monogrammed miss arrol has had a finely sewn o added to one corner in blue silk such grace i am captivated and those few inches of delectable dark stockinged leg brooke and i sit after lunch drinking mulled wine in dissy pittons sea view lounge lounging on suspended couches watching a depleted fishing fleet setting out to sea far below the departing trawlers sound their horns as they pass their stationary sisterships on barrage balloonanchoring duties cant say i blame you brooke says gruffly i never did think the fellow would do you much good i have told mr brooke about my decision not to let dr joyce hypnotise me we both look out to sea damn balloons my friend glares at the offending blimps they shine almost silver in the sunlight their shadows speckling the blue waters of the firth another pattern i thought youd approve i begin then stop frowning listening brooke looks at me not up to me to approve or orr shh i say quietly i listen to the distant noise then open one of the lounge windows brooke gets to his feet the drone of the approaching aero engines is quite distinct now dont say those bloody things are coming back brooke shouts behind me indeed they are the planes come into view they are lower then before the middle one almost level with dissy pittons they are flying kingdomward in the same vertical formation as before once again each trails pulses of oily smoke leaving a giant ribbon of dark smudges hanging in the sky behind them the planes silvergrey fuselages have no markings the silveredover cockpit canopies glint in the sunlight the combined wires of the barrage balloons seem to provide only the most rudimentary of obstacles to the planes progress the aircraft are flying about a quarter of a mile from the bridge where the wires are probably at their most dense yet as we watch they have to make only one brief turn to avoid a cable the flight drones away into the distance leaving smoke brooke smacks one fist into the other palm cheeky beggars the hanging wall of smoky smudges drifts slowly towards the bridge in the steady breeze after a couple of energetic games at the rackets club i call at the pictureframers miss arrols drawing has been mounted on wood and covered in nonreflective glass during the afternoon i hang it where it will catch the morning light above a bookcase to one side of my nowrepaired front door the television switches itself on while i am straightening the drawing on the wall the man still lies there surrounded by his machines his face is expressionless the light has altered a little the room looks darker his drip will need changing soon i watch his pale slack face i want to tap the glass of the screen to wake the fellow i switch the set off instead is there any point in testing the telephone i pick it up the same calm beeps still sound i decide to dine at the rackets club bar according to the television in the club bar the official line on the rogue planes is that they are an expensive prank perpetrated by somebody from another part of the bridge following todays latest outrage the barrage balloon defences are to be strengthened there is no mention of why only one side of the bridge is ballooned the culprits responsible for these unauthorised flights are being sought the administration asks us all to be vigilant i seek out the journalist i talked to before cant really add anything to that he confesses what about the third city library couldnt find it in our records there was some sort of fire or explosion up on those levels some time ago though you sure this was only a couple of days ago positive well probably still trying to bring it under control he snaps his fingers oh tell you something they havent mentioned on the broadcasts what theyve found out what language the planes are writing m yes braille what braille the blind language still complete nonsense even when you do decipher it but thats what it is all right i sit back in my seat utterly dumbfounded for the second time today two i am standing on a moor a sloped plain of tundra leading up towards a ridge and the grey featureless sky this place is cold and scoured by a gusting wind which tugs and plucks at my clothes and flattens the rough stunted grasses and heathers of the heath the moor continues downhill vanishing into the grey distance as the slope steepens all that breaks the monotony of this dull waste of grass is a thin straight stretch of water like a canal its surface roughened by the cold wind from the ridge uphill comes a thin siren sound grey smoke driven and made ragged by the tearing wind moves along the skyline a train appears over the distant ridge as it comes closer the siren sounds again a harsh angry noise the black engine and few dark carriages make a dull line pointing directly at me i look down i am standing between the rails of the track two thin lines of metal head straight from me to the approaching train i step to one side then look down again i am still standing between the tracks i step aside again the tracks follow me they flow like quicksilver moving as i move i am still inbetween the rails the trains siren shrieks once more i take another step to the side the rails move again seeming to slide over the surface of the moor without resistance or cause the train is closer i start to run but the tracks keep pace one always just ahead one always just at my heel i try to stop and fall rolling still between the rails i get up and run in the other direction running into the wind my breath like fire the tracks glide in front and behind the train very close now screams again it easily negotiates the corners and kinks in the rails my stumbling twisting progress has produced i keep running sweating panicking unbelieving but the rails flow smoothly with me gauge constant before and behind perfectly attuned to my desperate pounding gait the train bears down on me siren bellowing the ground shakes the rails whine i scream and find the canal at my side just before the engine reaches me i throw myself into the choppy waters under the surface of the water there is air i float down through its thick warmth turning slowly seeing the undersurface of the water above glistening like an oily mirror i land softly on the mossy surface of the canals floor it is quiet and very warm nothing passes overhead the walls are grey smooth stone and close at full stretch i could almost touch both sides the walls curve slightly fading away in either direction under the dim light falling from above i put my hand on one of the smooth walls and stub my toe on something hard under the moss near the wall clearing some of the moss away reveals a piece of shining metal i brush more of the moss away on either side it is long like a pipe and fastened to the floor of the channel in crosssection it has the shape of a bloatedlooking i closer inspection proves that it runs under the moss to each side raising the greenbrown surface in a continuous hardlynoticeable ridge on the other side of the tunnel there is a similar raised line of moss near the wall i jump up hurriedly brushing the moss back over the section of rail i have uncovered as i do so the thick warm air starts to move slowly past me and from far down the tunnels narrow curve there comes the faint thin sound of a siren coming closer slightly hungover waiting for my kippers in the inches breakfast bar i wonder whether i ought to take that drawing by miss arrol down from my wall the dream disturbed me i woke up sweating and lay tossing and turning in my bed still wet with sweat until finally i had to get up i had a bath fell asleep in the warm water and woke up freezing cold terrified jarred as though electrocuted suddenly certain in my immediate confusion that i was trapped in some constricting tunnel the bath a tunnelcanal its cold waters my own sweat i read the morning paper and sip my coffee the administration is being criticised for not having prevented yesterdays flypast unspecified new measures are under evaluation with a view to preventing further violation of the bridges airspace my kippers arrive their filleted bones have left a pattern on the pale brown flesh i recall my thoughts on the general topography of the bridge i try to ignore my hangover there are three possibilities the bridge is just that a link between two landmasses they are very far apart and the bridge leads an existence independent of them but traffic crosses the bridge from one to the other the bridge is effectively a pier there is land at one end but not the other the bridge has no connection with land whatsoever save for the small islands beneath every third section in cases and it might be still under construction it may only be a pier because it has not yet reached the farther landmass or if it has no connection with land it might still be being built not just at one end but two there is one interesting subpossibility in case the bridge appears to be straight but there is a horizon and the sun rises arcs falls so the bridge might eventually meet itself form a closed circuit a circle vertically ringing the globe topographically closed visiting the library on the way here to look at a braille book reminded me of the stilllost third city library i feel quite recovered after my breakfast and decide to walk to the section which houses both dr joyces office and the fabled library ill have another crack at finding the damn thing it is another fine day a soft warm wind blows upriver slanting the wires of the barrage balloons as the grey blimps try to drift towards the bridge extra balloons are being floated into the sky large barges support the halfinflated shapes of even more balloons and some of the trawlers have already been equipped with two balloons producing a giant v of cables in the sky above them some of the balloons have been painted black i walk whistling across the linking span from one section to the next swinging my stick a plush but conventional elevator bears me up to the highest available floor still a few levels down from the actual summit of the section the dark tall mustysmelling corridors up here seem familiar now in their general character at least the exact layout remains a mystery i walk beneath the ancient agegrimed flags between the niches occupied by stoneremembered officials past rooms full of whispering smartly uniformed clerks i cross dim whitetiled lightwells on rickety crosscorridors peer through keyholes into locked dark deserted passages whose floors are inches deep in dust and debris i test the doors but the hinges have rusted finally i come to a familiar corridor a large round patch of light glows on the carpet ahead where the corridor broadens out the air smells damp id swear the thick dark carpet squelches with each footfall i can see tall potplants now and a length of wall which ought to hold the entrance to the lshaped lift the patch of light on the floor has a shadow in the centre of it which i dont recall the shadow moves i reach the light the great round window is there still staring downriver like a huge handless clockface the shadow is cast by mr johnson dr joyces patient who refuses to leave the cradle he is cleaning the window polishing the glass at its centre with a rag an expression of rapt concentration on his face behind and a little below him in mid air well over a thousand feet above sealevel floats a small trawler it is suspended on three cables it is blackbrown in colour ruststreaked above the waterline and barnacleencrusted below it it floats slowly towards the bridge rising as it nears i walk towards the window high above the drifting trawler are three black barrage balloons i look up at the stillpolishing mr johnson i knock on the glass he takes no notice the trawler still rising heads directly for the great round window i bang on the glass as high as i can reach i wave my stick and hat and shout as loudly as i can mr johnson look out behind you he stops polishing but only to lean forward still smiling beatifically breathe on the glass and then start polishing again i hammer on the glass near mr johnsons knees as far as i can reach even with my stick the trawler is twenty feet away mr johnson polishes happily on i beat on the thick glass with the brass knob on the tip of the stick the glass chips cracks fifteen feet the trawler is level with mr johnsons feet mr johnson i thrash at the cracking pane of glass it finally smashes spraying shards i stagger back from the hail of fragments mr johnson is scowling furiously in at me ten feet behind you i scream thrusting my stick out to point then running for cover mr johnson watches me run and turns round the trawler is a fathomlength away he dives to the deck of his cradle as the trawler crunches into the centre of the great round window its keel scraping the rail of mr johnsons cradle and showering him with barnacles panes shatter glass showers down onto the broad landing the sound of breaking glass competes with that of creaking fracturing metal the trawlers stem grinds through the centre of the window its metal frame bends like a huge spiders web making a terrible groaning screaming sound the structure around me shakes then it stops the trawler appears to bounce back a little then scrapes and grates its way up over the top part of the great mandala breaking more glass as it goes barnacles and fragments of the shattered panes fall together onto the carpet beating at the broad leaves of the nearby potplants like some hard fierce rain then incredibly it is gone the trawler disappears from view glass stops falling the sounds of the boats scraping progress up the side of the remaining floors of the upper bridge quiver through the air mr johnsons cradle swings to and fro gradually slowing he stirs looks about him and stands up slowly spears of fallen glass sloughing from his back like glittering snakeskin he licks at a couple of cuts he has sustained on the backs of his hands carefully brushes his shoulders free of some dusty grains of glass then walks along his still slightly swaying platform and picks up a shorthandled broom he starts to brush the fragments of windowpane off the cradle whistling to himself every now and again as he sweeps he looks with an expression of sad concern at the bowedin shattered mess of the great circular window i stand and watch he cleans up his cradle checks his supporting cables then bandages his stillbleeding hands finally he takes a good look at the wrecked window and finds some bits which are both unbroken and not yet washed he starts cleaning these ten minutes have passed since the trawler impacted i am still alone here noboby has come to investigate no alarms or warning signals have sounded mr johnson carries on washing and polishing a warm breeze blows through the smashed window ruffling the torn leaves of the potplants where the doors to the lshaped elevator were there is now a blank wall with niches for statues i leave my quest for the third city library again abandoned i return to my apartment and an even greater disaster men in grey overalls are moving in and out of the doorway loading all my clothes onto a trolley as i watch another man appears straining under a load of paintings and drawings he piles them onto another trolley and returns inside hoy you you there what do you think youre doing the men stop and look at me perplexed i try to tear some of my shirts from one tall fellows arms but he is too strong and simply stands blinking with surprise and holding stiffly onto the clothes he has taken from my room his mate shrugs and walks back inside my apartment you there stop come out of there i leave the oaf with my shirts and dash into my rooms they are in turmoil greyoveralled men moving everywhere putting white cloths over furniture carrying other pieces outside taking books from my bookcases and putting them in boxes removing pictures from walls and ornaments from tables i gaze round stunned aghast stop this what the hell do you think youre doing stop it a few turn and look but they dont stop what theyre doing one man is making for the door with all three of my umbrellas put those back i shout blocking his way i threaten him with my stick he takes it from me adds it to the collection of umbrellas and disappears outside ah you must be mr orr a large bald man wearing a black jacket on top of his overalls holding a black hat in one hand and a clipboard in the other appears from my bedroom i certainly am what the hells going on here youre being moved mr orr the fellow says smiling what why to where i shout my legs are shaking there is a sick heavy feeling in my stomach umm the bald man looks through the papers on his clipboard ah here we are level u room what wheres that i cannot believe this u that surely means under the rail deck but thats where workers ordinary people live whats happening why are they doing this to me it must be a mistake dont rightly know sir the man says cheerfully but im sure you can find it if you look but why am i being moved absolutely no idea sir he chimes happily you been here long six months more of my clothes are taken out of my dressing room i turn to the bald fellow again look those are my clothes what are you doing with them oh returning them sir he assures me nodding smiling returning them to where i shout this is all very undignified but what else can i do i dont know sir wherever you got them from i suppose not my department exactly where they go back to sir but theyre mine he frowns looks at his clipboard ruffling paper he shakes his head smiling confidently no sir but they are dammit sorry sir theyre not they belong to the hospital authorities says so here look he shows me the clipboard a sheet of paper details my purchases of clothes from shops on the hospitals credit lines see he chortles had me worried for a second there sir that wouldve been illegal that would removing any of your stuff you could have called the police you could have and quite right too if wed touched any of your own stuff you shouldnt go but i was told i could buy what i liked i have an allowance i now sir the man says watching another load of coats and hats go past and ticking something off on his clipboard im not a lawyer or anything like one sir but ive been doing this sort of thing for longer than i care to think about and i think youll find sir if you dont mind me saying that all this stuff actually belongs to the hospital and you only had the use of it i think thats what youll find but i dont know if that was explained to you sir but im sure thats what you would find if you were to investigate the matter sir i i feel dizzy look cant you stop just for a moment i ask let me phone my doctor dr joyce youve probably heard of him hell sort this out there must have been a mistake sir the bald man laughs wheezily for a moment bless me sir sorry to interrupt you like that but i couldnt help it thats what everybody says wish i had a shilling for every time ive heard that he shakes his head wipes one cheek well if you really think so sir youd better get in touch with the relevant authorities he looks around the phones around here somewhere it doesnt work oh it does sir i used it not half an hour ago to let the department know were here i find the telephone on the floor its dead it clicks once when i try to dial the bald man comes over cut off sir he looks at his watch bit early sir he makes another note on his board very keen those boys at the exchange sir very very keen he makes a little papping noise which his mouth and snakes his head again obviously impressed will you please please just wait a moment let me get in touch with my doctor hell sort this out his names is dr joyce no need sir the man says happily an ugly sickening thought occurs to me the bald man looks through the sheets of paper on his clipboard he runs a finger down one of the papers near the back of the bundle then stops here we are sir look here it is the good doctors signature the bald man says see he already knows sir it was him authorised it yes i sir down and stare at the blank wall opposite happynow sir the bald man does not seem to be attempting either levity or irony yes i hear myself say i feel numb dead wrapped in cotton wool all senses reduced ground down fuses blown fraid were going to need those things youve got on sir he is looking at my clothes you cannot i say wearily be serious sorry sir weve got a nice and i might add sir new set of overalls for you you want to change now this is ridiculous i know sir still rules are rules arent they im sure youll like these overalls theyre brand new overalls they are bright green they come complete with shoes shorts shirt and rather rough underwear i change in my dressing room my mind as blank as the walls my body seems to move of its own accord performing the motions it is expected to automatically mechanically and then stopping waiting for a fresh order i fold my clothes neatly and as i fold my jacket see the handkerchief abberlaine arrol gave me i take it from the breast pocket when i go back into the sitting room the bald man is watching the television it is showing a quiz programme he turns it off when i enter bearing my bundle of clothes he puts his black hat on this handkerchief i say nodding at the handkerchief on top of the bundle it has been monogrammed may i keep it the bald man motions one of the men to take the bundle of clothes he takes the handkerchief and looks down a list on his clipboard he taps at a point on the list with a sharp pencil yes ive got the handkerchief down here but no mention of it having this letter on it he shakes the handkerchief looking closely at the blue embroidered o i wonder if he will have the stitching unpicked and present me with the thread all right take it he says sourly i take it but youll have to pay the value of it out of your new allowance thank you it is curiously easy to be polite well thats that he says efficiently he puts his pencil away i am reminded of the good doctor he points to the door after you i put the handkerchief in a pocket in the garish green overalls and precede the fellow from the apartment all but one of the other men have gone the last man holds a large piece of rolledup paper and an empty picture frame he waits until his superior has locked and chained the door then whispers something in his ear the foreman holds out the rolled paper which i realise is abberlain arrols drawing is this yours i nod yes a gift from a fr here he shoves it into my hands then turns away the two men walk away down the corridor i head for the elevator clutching my drawing i have gone a few paces when there is a shout the bald foreman is running towards me beckoning i walk to meet him he shakes the clipboard in my face not so fast chum he says theres the small matter of a broadbrimmed hat this is the office of dr fjoyce and a very good afternoon to you indeed this is mr orr i want to talk to dr joyce its very urgent mr orr how nice to talk you how are you this fine day i im feeling quite terrible

i see i tho what was that noise oh thats the beeps mr orr you have to put more money in i havent got any more money oops oh well nice talking to you mr orr bye now have a nice d hello hello level u is seven levels beneath the train deck quite close enough for one to be able to distinguish the difference between a local train a throughtrain express and a fast goods by their vibrations alone even without the concomitant rumblingscreamingthundering noise as confirmation the level is broad dark cavernous and crowded on the floor below there is a light engineering and sheet metal works above six more levels of accommodation an odour of sweat and old smoke pervades the thickened atmosphere room is all mine it contains only a single narrow bed a rickety plastic chair a table and a thin chest of drawers and it is still crowded i smelt the communal toilet on my way here at the end of the corridor the room looks out into a lightwell hardly worthy of the name i close the door and walk to dr joyces office like an automaton blind deaf unthinking when i get there it is too late the office is closed doctor and even receptionist gone home a floor security guard looks at me suspiciously and suggests i get back to my own level i sit on my small bed stomach rumbling head in hands looking at the floor listening to the shriek of metal being cut in the workshop below my chest aches there is a knock at the door come in a small grubby man wearing a long shiny coat of dark blue comes in shuffling sideways through the door his eyes flicker round the room and hesitate briefly only on the rolledup drawing lying on top of the chest of drawers his gaze settles on me though his eyes dont meet mine scuse me pal new here arent ye he stands by the open door as though ready to run back out through it he sticks his hands into the deep pockets of his long coat yes i am i say standing my name is john orr i offer my hand his grabs mine briefly then scuttles back to its lair how do you do i just have time to say lynch he says addressing my chest call me lynchy what can i do for you lynchy he shrugs nothin just bein neighbourly wondered if there was anythin ye wanted thats very kind of you i would be grateful for a little advice regarding an allowance i was told i would receive mr lynch actually looks at me his notrecentlywashed face seeming to glow albeit dully aw yeah i can help ye with all that stuff no problem i smile in all the time i lived in the more elevated and refined levels of the bridge not one of my neighbours even wished me goodday far less offered help of any kind mr lynch takes me to a canteen where he buys me a fishmeal sausage and a plate of mashed seaweed they are both appalling but i am hungry we drink tea from mugs he is a carriage sweeper he explains and occupies room he seems quite unduly impressed when i show him my plastic bracelet and tell him i am a patient he explains how to go about claiming my allowance in the morning i am grateful he even offers me a small loan until then but i am too beholden to the man already and refuse with thanks the canteen is noisy steamy crowded windowless everything clatters and the smells do nothing for my digestive processes chucked ye out just like that eh yes my doctor authorised it i refused to undergo the treatment he had in mind for me i assume thats why i was relocated anyway i may be wrong what a bastard eh mr lynch shakes his head and looks fierce them doctors it does seem rather vindictive and petty but i suppose i have only myself to blame total bastards mr lynch maintains and drinks tea from his mug he slurps his tea this has the same effect on me as nails scratched down a blackboard i grit my teeth i look at the clock above the serving hatch ill try to contact brooke he will probably be at dissy pittons soon mr lynch takes out tobacco and papers and rolls himself a cigarette he sniffs powerfully and makes a grunting snorting catarrhal noise at the back of his throat a hacking series of coughs like a large sack of rocks being shaken vigorously somewhere inside mr lynchs chest completes his antecigarette preparations ye got to go somewhere pal mr lynch says seeing me glance at the clock he lights up producing a cloud of acrid smoke yes i had best be off actually im going to see an old friend i get to my feet thank you very much mr lynch im sorry to rush off once im in funds again i hope youll allow me to return your generosity no problem pal if ye want a hand tomorrow give us a knock its my day off thank you you are a kind man mr lynch good day aye byebye i get to dissy pittons later than i intended footsore i ought to have accepted mr lynchs offer of money for the train fare i am amazed at how much less pleasant walking becomes when it is adopted due to necessity rather than idle choice i am also aware of being seen as the uniform i wear my face would seem to be invisible for all practical purposes nevertheless i pace head up shoulders back as though i still wear my best coat and suit and i believe my stick is more obvious in its absence than it was when actually held and swung the doorman at dissy pittons is not impressed however dont you recognise me im here most nights im mr orr look i hold up my plastic identity bracelet for him to see he ignores it he is embarrassed i think at having to deal with me and still tip his cap and open the door for customers look just clear off right dont you recognise me look at my face man not the damn overalls at least take a message to mr brooke is he here yet brooke the engineer small dark fellow slightly hunched the doorman is taller and heavier than me or i might try to force my way in you clear off now or youre in trouble the fellow says glancing down the broad corridor outside the bar as though looking for somebody i was here the other night i was the chap who gave that fellow bouch back his hat you must remember that you held the hat in front of him and he threw up into it the doorman smiles touches his cap lets a couple i do not recognise into the bar look pal ive been off the last two weeks now just you fuck off or youre going to be sorry oh i see im sorry but please if i write a note would you i get no further the doorman takes another look round discovers the corridor to be deserted and punches me in the stomach with one heavy gloved hand it is stunningly painful as i double up he lands another blow on my chin jarring my whole head i stagger back ringing with pain he cracks me across the eye it is the shock of it i suppose i hit the planking of the floor in a daze i am picked up by the rump and neck of my overalls and dragged and scraped across the deck through a door into the cold open air i am dumped on an open metal deck two more heavy blows strike my side kicks i think a door slams the wind blows i lie for some time the way i was dropped unable to move a throbbing pulsing pain builds up sickly in my belly without seeing where i am i think there is blood in my eyes i vomit up the fishcake sausage and seaweed i lie on my cramped bed the man and woman in the room above are having an argument i am racked with pain i feel nauseous but hungry at the same time my head teeth and jaws my right eye and temple my belly guts and side all ache a symphony of pain in all this the nagging whisper that is my old injurys echo the deep circular chest pain i am so used to is quite drowned out i am clean i have washed my mouth out as best i could and placed my handkerchief over my cut eyebrow i am not quite sure how i walked or staggered back here but i did my dazed pain like drunkenness i find no comfort in my bed only a new place to appreciate the waves of pain which flood me beating on the bodys shore in the end but in the middle of the night i drift off to sleep but it is an ocean of burning oil i am cast adrift upon no seas repose i pass from waking agonies which the reasoning mind can at least attempt to place in context looking forward to a time when the pain has ceased to the semiconscious trance of torment in which the smaller earlier deeper rings of the brain know only that the nerves scream the body aches and there is no one to turn crying to for comfort three i do not know how long i have been here a long time i do not know where this place is somewhere far away i do not know why i am here because i did something wrong i do not know how long i will have to stay here a long time this is not a long bridge but it goes on for ever i am not far from the bank but i will never get there i walk but i never move fast or slow running turning doubling back jumping throwing myself or stopping nothing makes any difference the bridge is made of iron it is thick heavy rusting iron pitted and flaking and it makes a dead heavy sound beneath my feet a sound that is so thick and heavy it is almost no sound just the shock of each footfall travelling through my bones to my head the bridge seems to be solid iron perhaps it was not once perhaps it was riveted together once but now it is one piece rusted into one decaying into a single rotting mass or it may have been welded who cares it is not large it bridges a small river i can see through the thick iron bars which rise from the edge of the balustrade the river flows straight and slow out of the mists under the bridge then just as straight and slow away again into the same damned mist downstream i could swim that river in a couple of minutes if it wasnt for the carnivorous fish i could cross this bridge in much less than that even walking slowly the bridge is part of a circle perhaps the upper quarter in terms of height its whole forms a great hollow wheel which encircles the river on the bank behind me there is a cobbled road leading off across a marsh on the far bank are my ladies reposing or disporting in a variety of small pavilions or opened wagons resting on a small meadow surrounded so i see on the odd occasions when the mist thins slightly by tall broadleafed trees i walk for ever towards the ladies sometimes i walk slowly sometimes fast i have even run they beckon to me they wave and hold out welcoming hands to me their voices call to me in tongues i cannot understand but which are soft and lovely to me warm and beseeching to me and which fill me with furious desire the ladies walk back and forth or lie among satin pillows in their small pavilions and broad wagons they wear all sorts of dress some severe and formal covering them from neck to sole some loose and flowing like silk waves on their bodies some thin and transparent or full of carefully positioned tears and holes so that their full young bodies white as alabaster black as jet gold as gold itself shine through as though their youth and primed nubility was something bright that burned within them a warmth my eyes detect they undress for me slowly sometimes while watching me their large sad eyes are full of longing their slender delicate hands going softly to their shoulders opening sloughing off brushing away straps and layers of material as if they were drops of water left after a bath i howl i run faster i scream for them sometimes they come to the lip of the bank the very edge of the bridge and tear their clothes off screaming to me clenching their little fists and moving their hips going down on their knees legs spread crying to me holding out their arms to me i scream then too and throw myself forward i sprint for all my worth or stiff with desire hold my prick like some stunted flagpole in front of me running and shaking it and bellowing with frustrated desire often i ejaculate and fall weakly used up to the hard iron surface of the bridges curved deck to lie there panting sobbing crying beating the flaking iron surface with my hands until they bleed on occasion the women make love to each other in front of me i wail and tear my hair they take slow hours sometimes gently kissing and stroking caressing and licking each other they cry out at orgasm their bodies jerking clutching pulsing in time to each other sometimes they watch me as they do this and i can never decide whether the look in their large moist eyes is still sad and longing or satiated and mocking i stop and shake my fist at them yell and shout at them bitches ingrates bloody torturers hellbags what about me come here you come on here here come on just step on well throw me a fucking rope then they do not they parade they strip they fuck they sleep and read old books they make meals and leave small ricepaper trays of food on the edge of the bridge so that i can eat but sometimes i rebel i throw the trays into the river the carnivorous fish demolish food and tray but they will not step onto the bridge i recall that witches cannot cross water i walk the bridge revolves slowly rumbling and shivering just a little the bars which rise from its edges moving slowly stroking through the mist i run the bridge quickly revs up matches my speed quivering beneath my feet the bars on either side of me making a soft ripping noise through the mistfilled air i stop the bridge stops i am still above the centre of the small slowly flowing river i sit the bridge remains static i jump up and throw myself towards the bank where the ladies are i roll scramble i hop or skip or jump the bridge rumbles one way or the other never more than a few steps out of step with me and always always bringing me back in the end to its shallow summit its mid point over the sluggish stream i am the keystone of the bridge i sleep usually at night sometimes during the day above the centre of the waters i have several times waited until the very centre of the night feigning sleep for hours then up jump bursting away with one mighty leap a single bound ahha but the bridge moves quickly not fooled and in seconds i am whether running or leaping or rolling back above the centre of the stream again i have tried to use the bridges inertia against it its assumed momentum its own terrible mass so i run first one way then the other trying by these may rapid changes in direction to catch it out somehow fool it outwit it bamboozle the bastard just be too damn quick for it of course i always try to make sure that if i do get off it will be on the bank which holds the ladies dont forget the carnivorous fish but without success the bridge for all its weight for all the solid massiveness of it which ought to make it slow to move and hard to brake always moves just too fast for me and i have never come closer than half a dozen strides from either bank there is a breeze sometimes not enough to clear the mist but sufficient if the wind comes from the right direction to bring to me the perfumes and bodily odours of the ladies i hold my nose i tear strands from my rags and stick them up my nostrils i have thought of stuffing rags in my ears as well and even of blindfolding myself every few tens of days small men swarthy and thickset and dressed as satyrs come running out of the forest behind the meadow and fall upon the ladies who after a show of resistance and displays of coquetry surrender to their small lovers with unaffected relish these orgies go on for days and nights without pause every form of sexual perversion is practised red lamps and open fires light the scene at night and vast quantities of roasted meats exotic fruits and spicy delicacies are consumed along with many skins of wine and bottles of spirits i am usually forgotten on such occasions and even my food is not left on the bridge so i starve while they sate their every appetite to the point of gluttony i sit and face the other way scowling at the dank marsh and the unreachable road crossing it quaking with anger and jealousy tormented by the whimpers and screams coming from the far bank and the succulent smells of roasting meats once i grew hoarse screaming at them hurt my ankle jumping up and down and bit my tongue while cursing them i waited until i needed a crap then threw the turd at them those obscene brats used it in one of their filthy sex games after the small dark men dressed as satyrs have dragged themselves back into the forest and the ladies have slept off the effects ofaheir multifarious indulgences they are as they were before if a little more apologetic even wistful they make special dishes for me and give me more food than usual but often i am still upset and throw the food at them or into the river for the carnivorous fish the look sad and sorry and go back to their old habits of sleeping and reading walking and undressing and making love with each other perhaps my tears will rust the bridge and i shall escape it today the mist cleared not for long but for long enough on my bridge without end i have reached the end i am not alone when the mist lifted i saw that the river went straight into the clear distance for ever on either side the marsh lines it on one bank the meadow and forest on the other without a break a hundred paces or so upstream there is another bridge just like mine iron like part of a circle and edged with thick iron bars there was a man inside it gripping the bars and staring at me beyond him another bridge and another man and so on and so on until the line of distant bridges became an iron tunnel vanishing to nothing each bridge had its own road across the marsh each had its ladies pavilioned and carriaged downstream just the same my ladies did not seem to notice the man in the bridge downstream from mine stared at me for while then began running i watched his bridge revolve fascinated by its steady smoothness then stopped and stared at me again then at the bridge downstream from him he climbed up onto the parapet up the bars and over them and then after only the briefest of hesitations dropped into the river the water frothed red he screamed and sank the mists came back i shouted for a while but i could hear no other voice from up or down stream i am running now steady and fast and determined several hours so far it is growing dark the ladies seem worried i have run right over three of their foodfilled trays my ladies stand and watch me sad and largeeyed somehow resigned as though they have seen all this before as though it always ends this way i run and run the bridge and i are one now part of the same great steady mechanism an eye the river threads i shall run until i drop until i die in other words for ever my ladies are crying now but i am happy they are caught trapped transfixed heads bowed but i am free i wake up sceaming believing i am encased in ice more cold than that produced by water so cold that it burns like molten rock and under a grinding crushing pressure the scream is not my own i am silent and only the sheet metal works shrieks i dress stumble to the toilet block wash i dry my hands on the handkerchief in the mirror my face is puffed and discoloured a few teeth feel somewhat looser than they did my body is bruised but nothing is seriously damaged at the office where i register to claim my allowance i discover that i shall be on half allowance for the next month to pay off the amount i owe on the handkerchief and the hat i am given a little money i am directed to a secondhand store where i purchase a long worn coat this at least covers the green overalls half my money is gone now i start to walk to the next section still determined to see dr joyce but i feel faint before long and have to take a tram paying cash for the ticket casualty is three floors down two blocks to kingdom the young receptionist tells me when i walk into the good doctors outer office he goes back to his newspaper no coffee or tea is offered i would like to see dr joyce im mr orr you might recall we spoke on the telephone yesterday the young man lifts perfectly clear eyes to look at me tiredly up and down he puts one manicured finger to his smooth cheek sucks air through luminescently white and flawless teeth mr orr he turns to look through a card index i feel faint again i sit down on one of the chairs he glares at me did i say you could sit down no did i ask for permission to well i hope that coats clean are you going to let me see the doctor or not im looking for your card do you remember me or not he studies me carefully yes but youve been relocated havent you does that really make such a difference he gives a little incredulous laugh and shakes his head as he searches his index ah i thought so he pulls out a red card and reads it youve been transferred id noticed that my new address is no i mean youve got a new doctor i dont want a new doctor i want dr joyce oh do you he laughs and taps the red card with one finger well im afraid it isnt up to you dr joyce has had you transferred to somebody else and thats all there is to it and if you dont like it tough he puts the red card back in the index now please go away i go to the doctors office door it is locked the young man does not look up from his paper i try to look through the frosted glass in the door then i knock politely dr joyce dr joyce the young receptionist starts to snigger i turn to look at him just as the telephone rings he answers it dr joyces office he says no im afraid the doctor isnt here hes at the annual conference for senior administrators he turns in his seat and looks at me as he says this watching me with a look of spiteful condescension two weeks he grins at me do you want the longdistance code oh yes good morning officer yes mr berkeley of course and how are you oh yes has he a washing machine does he really well thats a new one i must say mmhmm the young receptionist looks professionally serious and starts taking notes and how many socks has he eaten i see right yes got that ill get a locum down to the launderette right away thats quite all right officer and may i wish you a very good day indeed bye now my new doctor is called anzano his offices are about a quarter of the size of joyces and eighteen floors below them with no outside view he is an old tubby man with sparse yellow hair and matching teeth i get to see him after a wait of two hours no the doctor says i dont think there is much i can do about you being moved not what im here for you understand give me time let me read your file be patient ive got a lot on my plate just now ill get round to you as soon as i can then well see about getting you well again what do you say he tries to look cheerful and encouraging but in the meantime i ask feeling tired i must look a terrible sight my face throbs and vision out of my left eye is restricted my hair is unwashed and i have been unable to shave this morning how can i convincingly lay claim to my earlier way of life looking the way i do so badly dressed and in every sense i suspect beaten meantime dr anzano looks perplexed he shrugs do you need a prescription have you enough of anything youve been he is reaching for his prescription pad i shake my head i mean what is to be done about my situation not a lot i can do mr orr im not dr joyce i cant issue grand apartments to myself let alone my patients the old doctor sounds a little bitter and annoyed at me just wait until your case is reviewed ill make whatever recommendations i think fit now is there anything else im a very busy man i cant go whizzing off to conferences you know no there was nothing else i get up thank you for your time not at all not at all my secretary will be in touch with you about your appointment very soon im sure and if there is anything you need just give me a call i return to my room mr lynch comes to my door again mr lynch good day oh fuck what happened to you an argument with an unhinged doorman do come in would you like this seat cant stay i brought this he shoves a folded sealed piece of paper into my hand mr lynchs finger marks remain on the envelope i open it post left it stuck in the door could have got stole thank you mr lynch i say are you sure you cant stay i was hoping to repay your kindness yesterday by inviting you to dinner this evening aw sorry pal no got overtime to do oh well some other time then i scan the note it is from abberlaine arrol she confesses to quite brazenly using a fictitious dinnerdate with me tonight to get out of an engagement of potentially terminal tedium will i agree to be an accomplice after the fact she includes the phone number of her parents apartment i am to call her i check the address the note has been forwarded from my old rooms ok mr lynch says hands stuck in the pockets of his coat for all the world as though his trouser turnups are full of stolen lead and he is desperately trying to hold them up no bad news eh no mr lynch in fact a young lady wants me to take her out to dinner i must make a phone call dont forget though after this you have first call on my meagre abilities as dinnerhost whatever you say pal my luck holds miss arrol is in somebody i take to be a servant goes to find her it takes several coins i have to assume the arrol apartments are of considerable size mr orr hello she sound breathless good day miss arrol i received your note oh good are you free this evening i would like to meet then yes but whats wrong mr orr you sound like you have a cold not a cold its my mouth its i pause miss arrol i would very much like to see you this evening but im afraid i have suffered something of a reverse i have been relocated effectively demoted dr joyce has had me put down as it were to level u to be precise oh there is a flatness to the tone with which she pronounces this simple word which says more to me in my feverish state than a wholehour of polite explanations about propriety places in society discretion and tact perhaps i am expected to say something more but i cannot how long do i wait then for some other word two seconds at most three nothing measured in bridge time but long enough to pass through an instant of despair to a plateau of anger shall i put the phone down walk away make of this dirty thing as clean and quick an end as possible yes now to appease my own bitterness but it is not in me in a moment though to spare the girl further embarrassment right sorry mr orr i was just closing the door my brother hanging around now where have they moved you to can i help would you like me to come over there now orr you are a fool i dress in the clothes of abberlain arrols brother she arrived here an hour before the time we arranged to meet with a suitcase full of castoffclothes mostly her brothers she reckons we are near enough the same build i change while she waits outside i was loath to leave her in such a vulgar area but she could hardly have stayed in the room in the corridor she is leaning back against the wall one leg drawn up behind her so that she rests one buttock on her foot arms folded talking to mr lynch who looks at her with a sort of wary awe oh no dear abberlaine arrol is saying we always change ends at halftime she sniggers mr lynch looks shocked then snorts with laughter miss arrol sees me ah mr orr the same i make a small bow or rather not quite abberlaine arrol resplendent in baggy trousers of rough black silk matching jacket cotton blouse high heels and dramatic hat says what a dashing figure you cut mr orr bluntly spoken miss arrol presents me with a black cane your stick thank you i say she puts out her arm waiting so i offer mine and she takes it we face mr lynch arm in arm i can feel her warmth through her brothers jacket dont we look quite fine mr lynch she asks standing straight head back mr lynch shuffles his feet aw yeah very very mr lynch searches for a word very a very handsome couple i would like to think that is just what we are miss arrol seems pleased too thank you mr lynch she turns to me well i dont know about you but im starving so what are your priorities now mr orr abberlaine arrol rolls her whisky glass around between her hands gazing through the blue lead glass and the light amber liquid at the flame of a candle i watch her maltwetted lips glisten in the same soft light miss arrol has insisted on buying me dinner we sit at a window table in the high girders restaurant the food has been superb the service discreetly efficient we have space fine wine and an excellent view lights twinkle all over the sea where the trawlers anchor the barrage balloons the blimps themselves are vaguely visible almost level with us dull presences in the night reflecting the bridges massed lights like clouds a few of the brighter stars are also visible my priorities i ask yes which is more important regaining your position as one of dr joyces favoured patients or rediscovering your lost memories well i say only now really thinking about it certainly its been rather uncomfortable and painful coming down in the bridge but i suppose i could eventually learn to live with my reduced rank if the worst comes to the worst i sip my whisky miss arrols expression is neutral however my inability to remember who i am is not something i give a small laugh that i can ever forget ill always know there was something in my life before this so i imagine ill always be looking for it its like a sealed forgotten chamber in me i shant feel complete until ive discovered its entrance sounds like a tomb arent you afraid of what youll find in there its a library only the stupid and the evil are afraid of those so youd rather find your library than regain your apartment abberlaine arrol smiles i nod watching her she took off her hat as she came in but her hair is still up her head and neck look very fine those beguiling crinkles under her eyes fascinate me still they are like a tiny guard she has put up a line of sandbags beneath those amused greygreen eyes confident secure unaffected abberlaine arrol stares into her glass i am about to comment on a small line that has just formed on her brow when the lights go out we are left with our candle other tables glow and flicker with their own small flames dim emergency lights come on there is a dull background of muttering outside the lights on the trawlers start to disappear the balloons are no longer visible in the reflected light of the bridge the whole structure must be dark the planes they come without lights droning through the night from the direction of the city miss arrol and i stand up looking out of the window various other diners gather alongside us peering out into the night shading the weak emergency lights and candles with their hands noses pressed against the cool glass like schoolboys outside a sweetshop somebody opens a window the planes sound almost alongside us can you see them abberlaine arrol asks no i admit the droning engines sound very close the planes are quite invisible without navigation lights there is no moon and the stars are not bright enough to show them they pass seemingly unaffected by the lack of light think they did it miss arrol says still peering into the night her breath mists the glass i dont know i confess i wouldnt be surprised she is biting her lower lip her fists are clenched against the dark window an expression of excited anticipation on her face she looks very young the lights come back on the planes have left their pointless messages the clouds of smoke are just visible darkness upon darkness miss arrol sits down and takes up her glass as i raise mine she leans conspiratorially across the table and says quietly to our intrepid aviators wherever they may come from and whoever they may be i touch her glass with my own when we leave a faint odour of oily smoke is just detectable over the more palatable smells of the restaurant itself the equivocal signal of the vanished aircraft merging with and blown through the structural grammar of the bridge like criticism we wait for a train miss arrol smokes a cigar music plays in the softclass waiting room she stretches in her chair and stifles a little yawn i beg your pardon she says then mr oh look if i can call you john will you call me abberlaine never abby certainly abberlaine right then john i take it you are less than totally delighted with your new accommodation its better than nothing at all yes of course but not that much though and without mr lynch id be even more at a loss than i am already hmmm i thought so she looks preoccupied and stares hard at one of her shiny black highheels she rubs one finger over her lips looks seriously at her cigar ah the finger caressing her lips is lifted into the air i have an idea her grin is mischievous now my paternal greatgrandfather had it built just a minute ill find the lights i think there is a dull thud bastard miss arrol giggles i hear a rapid rubbing sound rough silk between smooth flesh i suspect are you all right fine just bumped my shin now then those lights i think theyre no damn this i cant see a thing you dont have a light do you john i used my last match on the cigar im sorry no i know could you give me your stick certainly here is that have you yes thank you got it i hear her tap and scrape her way through the darkness i put my suitcase down on the floor waiting to see whether my eyes will adjust sufficiently or not i can see vague hints of light over to one corner but the interior of this place is quite black from further away abberlaine arrols voice comes back it was to be near the marina that was why he had it built then they built the sports centre on top he was too proud to accept the compensation buyout so it stayed in the family my father is always talking about selling it but we wouldnt get much for it we just use it for storage there was some damp on the ceiling but its been repaired i see i listen for the girl but all i can hear is the sounds of the sea waves brush the rocks or the piers nearby i can smell the sea too something of its fresh dampness pervades the air about bloody time abberlaine arrol says her voice muffled a click and all is revealed i am standing near the door of a large apartment mostly openplan and splitlevel and full of old furniture and packing cases from a high dampstained ceiling an assortment of complicated light clusters hang varnish peels from old panelled walls there are white sheets everywhere half covering ancient heavylooking sideboards wardrobes couches chairs tables and chests of drawers other pieces are still totally covered wrapped and trussed like huge dusty white presents where there were vague areas of light before there is now a single long screen of blackness where unshuttered windows look out into the night abberlaine arrol appears flat broad hat still in place clapping her hands together rubbing dust off them from a side room there thats a bit better she looks around bit dusty and deserted but its quiet and a bit more private than your room on u or wherever she hands me back my stick then starts pacing through the assembled furniture whipping back sheets and covers glacing underneath raising a storm of dust as she investigates the contents of the huge room she sneezes should be a bed around here somewhere she nods to the windows might be an idea to close the shutters it never gets very light in here but you might be woken in the morning i make my way down to the tall windows a length of obsidian framed in crackled white paint the heavy shutters creak as they swing across the dustdimmed panes outside and below i can see a broken line of white surf and a few lights in the distance mosdy navigation and harbour beacons above where i would expect to see the bridge there is only darkness starless and complete the waves glitter like a million dull knives here abberlaine arrol has found a bed it might be a bit damp but ill find some more sheets should be some in these cases the bed is huge with a headboard carved from oak to resemble a pair of immense outspread wings abberlaine stamps off through the clouds of dust to rummage through stacked chests and packing cases i test the bed abberlaine this is really very kind of you but are you sure you wont get into trouble for it she sneezes powerfully from a distant packing case bless you i say thank you no im not certain she says pulling out blankets and bundles of newspapers from the chest but in the unlikely event my father did find out and was annoyed im sure i could talk him round dont worry no one ever comes down here ah she discovers a large quilt and some sheets and pillows she buries her face in the quilt breathing deeply yes this seems dry enough she brings the bedding over in a bundle and starts to make the huge bed i offer to help but am shooed away i take my coat off and go in search of the bathroom it is about six times the size of room level u the bath alone looks as though it could float a sizeable yacht the toilet flushes the sink runs too the shower and bidet both spray efficiently i pause in front of the mirror brushing my hair back smoothing my shirt checking my teeth for bits of trapped food when i return to the main room my bed has been made the huge oaken wings are spread over a white duvet of duckdown abberlaine arrol has gone the apartments front door swings gently to and fro i close the door put out most of the lights i find an old lamp and perch it on a packing case by the side of my huge cold bed before i put the light out i lie for a while looking at the great hollow circles longdried waters have left on the plaster above me faded and dull leftovers from an old complaint they look down on me like ancient painted images of my own chestheld stigmata i reach out to the old lamp and turn the darkness on again four i luv the ded this old basturt sez to me when i wiz trying to get some innfurmashin out ov him you fukin old pervirt i sez gettin a bit fed up by this time

sounds awfy familiar it sez why my boy thats absolutely correct aw shite an abandoned searching the smell of salt and rust darkness down here buried under the structure like something thrown away wandering through the light and shade within the sound of the sea i wake slowly still immersed in the barbarians rough thoughts my thoughts entangled soft grey light seeps round the edges of the shutters into this wide and cluttered space outlining the shrouded furniture and feeding my struggling consciousness as though it were a growing shoot struggling out of the clinging clay the cold white sheets are twisted around me like ropes dozily i try to roll over to become comfortable but cannot i am trapped tied down panic fills me in an instant and suddenly im awake cold and sweating and sitting up in the bed wiping my face and looking round the rooms dim quietness i open the window shutters the sea surges round the rocks thirty feet below i leave the door to the bathroom open so that i can hear its slow roaring breath while i bathe i breakfast in a modest bar off the concourse edgar waiters swipe at nearby table with long white cloths seagulls call and circle through the air crowding round an outjutting building where kitchen scraps are being thrown out the wings of the birds flash white the cloths of the waiters crack and flap across the tables i came here via room to see if there was any mail for me nothing the sheet metal works screamed below i linger over my last cup of coffee i wander from one side of the bridge to the other most trawlers now have two barrage balloons some balloons must be anchored directly to the seabed orange buoys mark where their cables meet the waves i have a sandwich and a waxpaper cup of tea for lunch sitting on a bench looking upriver the weather changes growing colder under a sky gradually becoming overcast it was early spring when i was washed up here now the summer is almost over i wash my hands in the rest room of a tram station and take a tram hard class to the section where the lost library should be i search and search i try every elevator shaft there is but none contains the lshaped lift im looking for or the old attendant my enquiries meet with blank looks the surface of the firth is grey now like the sky the barrage balloons strain at their cables my legs hurt from climbing stairs rain spatters against the dirty glass of the high corridors where i sit and try to regain my strength beneath the summit of the bridge in a dark dripping corridor i find a pool of small white balls lying under a broken skylight the balls have a dimpled surface and feel very hard as i stand there another ball comes flying through the broken skylight and drops to the floor of the corridor i drag a motheaten chair from an alcove put it under the skylight and climb up sticking my head through the broken pane in the distance there is a tall old man with white hair he wears plusfours a jumper and a cap he is swinging a long thin club at something in front of his feet a white ball comes sailing through the air towards me fore the man shouts at me i think he waves the ball bounces near the skylight he takes his cap off and stands hands on hips looking at me i get down off the chair and find a stairwell leading to the summit when i get there there is no sign of the old man the trawler is there though surrounded by workmen and officials it is lying beneath a damaged radio tower the deflated barrage balloons hanging over the girders nearby like broken wings it is raining and blowing hard oilskins and greatcoats flap and glisten early evening dull and wet my feet are sore and my stomach rumbles i buy another sandwich and eat it on the tram it is a long and tiring walk down the monotonously spiralling steps to the arrols old apartment my legs ache by the time i get to the right floor i feel like a thief in the deserted corridor i hold the apartments small key in front of me like a tiny dagger the apartment is cold and dark i switch on a few lights the grey waters crash white outside a damp salt smell fills the chill rooms i close the windows i left open this morning and lie down on the bed just for a moment but fall asleep i go back to the moor where impossible trains chase me into narrow tunnels i watch the barbarian stalk an underworld of pain and torment i am not him i am chained to the walls crying out to him he lopes on dragging his sword i am on the revolving iron bridge again pounding for ever over the rusting torus through which the river flows running and running in the rain until my legs ache i wake again damp with sweat not rain my legs feel tense cramped a bell rings i look groggily round for a phone the bell rings again twice and i realise it is the door mr orr john i get off the bed and smooth my hair down abberlaine arrol stands in the doorway in a long dark coat grinning like a mischievous schoolgirl abberlaine hello come in how are you john she sweeps in looking round the lit room then turning lifting her head to me all right here yes thank you can i offer you one of your own chairs i close the door you can offer me one of our wines to drink she says laughing she spins round once on one foot sending the coat belling out a heady odour of some musky perfume and drink flows past me her eyes sparkle over there she points to a chest half covered by a white sheet ill get some glasses she heads for the kitchen that was a rather sudden departure last night i say opening the chest it contains racks of wines and spirits clinking noises come from the kitchen what was she says coming back with two glasses and a corkscrew i select something not too old and preciouslooking from the wines i was taking a look round the place and when i came back in here you were gone she hands me the corkscrew looking mystified was i she says vaguely her brows crease oh dear she smiles shrugs flops down onto a sheetcovered couch she is still wearing her coat but i can see blackstockinged legs black high heels and a touch of red at throat and coat hem ive been partying she explains really i open the wine hmm want to see my outfit why not she stands handing me the glasses she unbuttons the long black coat sweeps it from her shoulders and throws it over a chair she pirouettes she is wearing a bright red clinging satin dress it is knee length but slashed to the top of her thigh as she turns i see a slim length of white flesh between the dense black of stocking top and an edge of black lace above the dress has a high neck which almost conceals a thin black choker the shoulders are padded the bust not abberlaine arrol stands hands on hips facing me her arms are bare and a dark down on them has the effect of edging them in black her carefully madeup face looks amused we are sharing a joke suddenly she turns and digs in a coat pocket pulling out what at first i take to be another pair of stockings they are matching gloves though she pulls them on almost to her shoulders she chuckles from deep in her chokered throat does another pivoting turn what do you think i take it this wasnt a formal party i pour the wine sort of fancydress i went as a loose woman but i got tight she holds her hand up in front of her mouth as she laughs she curtsies when she takes her glass well you look stunning abberlaine i tell her soberly another curtsy she sighs and runs a hand through her hair then turns walking away with measured steps tapping an old tall cupboard of some dark heavily varnished wood running her long gloved fingers over it she drinks her wine i watch her as she moves round the covered and uncovered furniture of the room pulling open doors looking in drawers lifting the corners of sheets rubbing her hand over dusty glassfronts and stroking the lines of inlays all the time humming and taking small sips from her glass i feel forgotten for a moment but not insulted i hope you dont mind me coming here she says blowing dust off a standard lamps shade of course not its nice to see you she turns that smile again then she looks frowning at the grey sea and rainclouds beyond the long windows and puts her hands to her bare upper arms still holding her glass she sips from it it is a curious oddly touching action a small snuggling almost childish gesture quite unconsciously beguiling im cold she turns to look at me and there is something almost mournful about her grey eyes can you close the shutters it looks so cold out there ill put the fire on shall i of course i put my glass down and go to the shutters slowslamming the tall wooden boards over the dark day abberlaine persuades an old hissing gas fire to light then squats down on her haunches in front of it gloved hands held out to it i sit on a sheetshrouded chair nearby she watches the flames the fire hisses after a while she seems to wake from some daydream and says still looking at the fire did you sleep all right yes i did thank you very comfortable she has left her glass lying on the tile fire surround she lifts it drinks her stockings have a crisscross design small xs within larger xs a stretched lettering of sheer material moulded to her legs in curved patterns of stress pulling here lightened by the shown flesh beneath relaxing there where the stockings go dark the compressing grammar of those xs and xs densed over the girls pale skin good she says quietly she nods slowly still firefascinated the red dress reflecting the yelloworange flames like a ruby mirror good she repeats the warmth of the fire heats her skin the smell of her perfume builds slowly in the air between us she breathes in deeply holds it then sighs out still staring at the hissing fire i drain my glass pick up the bottle i go over to the girl and sit beside her to fill her glass and mine her perfume is sweet and strong she comes down from her haunches to sit on the floor legs to one side one arm behind her supporting her she watches me fill the glasses i put the bottle down watching her face her lipstick is slightly smudged in one corner she sees me looking one eyebrow arches slowly i say your lipstick it is the handkerchief which she had monogrammed i take from my pocket she leans forward to let me wipe the offending red mark i feel the breath from her nose on my fingers as i touch her lips through the fabric there im afraid she says i left some on quite a few collars her voice is quiet and low almost a murmur oh i say mockingly disapproving shaking my head i wouldnt go kissing collars she shakes her head no no i come closer to her to gently touch her full glass with mine what then her voice does not go quieter it takes on another resonance instead conspiratorial knowing even ironic this is invitation enough i havent exactly thrown myself at her i kiss her just lightly watching her eyes and she kisses back lightly and watches mine she tastes faintly of wine and something savoury also a hint of cigar smoke i press forward a little and put my free hand to her waist feeling her warmth through the smooth red satin the fire hisses busily behind me warming my back i move my mouth slowly over hers tasting her lips brushing her teeth her tongue comes out to meet mine she moves straining away to one side for a moment so that i think she is drawing away her brows crease but she is just reaching for a place to put her glass down then she holds me by the shoulders eyes closing her breath comes a little quicker against my cheek and i kiss her more deeply abandoning my own glass on a chairarm her hair is fine and smells of that musky perfume her waist feels even more slim than it looks her breasts move within the red dress held but not confined by something she wears beneath the satin her stockings are smooth to the touch her thighs warm she hugs me grips me then pushes away puts her hands to either side of my head and looks at me her bright gaze going from eye to eye her nipples form little red mounds under the satin her mouth is wet smeared red she gives a little shuddering laugh swallows still breathing hard i didnt think you would be so passionate johnshe says throughher breath i didnt think you would be so easily fooled a little later here here not the bed itll be too cold here is there anything you have to do first what oh no no just oh come on take that damn jacket off orr shall i leave this stuff on well why not abberlaine arrols body is encased in blackness strapped and ribbed with obsidian silks her stockings attach to a sort of frontlaced silk corset another pattern of xs form a cantilevered stripe from pubis to just below where a separate brassiere of sheer silk transparent as her stockings cups her neat firm breasts she shows me where it unfastens in front her camiknickers black gauze over the deeper black curls stay on loose enough we sit together kissing slowly not moving yet after i first enter her she sits there upon me stockinged legs round my rump longgloved arms beneath mine gripping my shoulders your bruises she whispers i am quite naked stroking the places where i was kicked and punched with a tantalising softness that raises my hairs never mind i tell her kissing her breasts her nipples are almost carnationpink quite thick and long with little indented creases pink puckerings at the tip the aureoles smooth raised and round forget about them i pull her back so that i lie on my pile of discarded clothes and her red dress i move slowly under her watching her outlined against the flames of the hissing gas fire abberlaine hangs in the air above me riding me her hands on my chest her head down the parted brassiere dangling like her thick black hair her whole body is contained by the lingerie an absurd trapping on her who could need nothing else to make her more desirable save breath itself just a moving force behind those bones that flesh and the mind that wears and inhabits all she is i think of the women in the barbarians tower xs that pattern within a pattern covering her legs another rneshing beyond our own the zigzagging lace of her camiknickers the crisscrossing ribbon holding the silk across her body those straps and lines the sheathed arms like stockinged legs themselves a language an architecture cantilevers and tubes suspension ties the dark lines of the suspenders crossing her curved upper thigh under the knickers and down to the thick black stockingtop caissons structural tubes the engineering of these soft materials to contain and conceal and reveal that softness within she cries out arches her spine head thrown back hair hanging between her shoulder blades her fingers splayed arms in a v behind her extended and straining i lift her suddenly conscious of myself within her inside that structure of dark materials and as i strain taking her weight suddenly in that moment i am aware of the bridge above us towering into the grey evening with its own patterns and crisscrossing and massed xs its own feet and legs and balanced stresses its own character and presence and life above us above me pressing down i struggle to support that crushing weight abberlaine arches further shouting grips my ankles with her hands then comes down groaning like some crumpling structure my own invasive addition to the girls body structural member indeed pulsing with its own brief beat abberlaine collapses on top of me panting and relaxing limbs sprawled she lies on me breathing hard perfumed hair tickling my nose i ache i am exhausted i feel like i have just fucked the bridge i stay inside her softening but not withdrawing after a while she squeezes me from inside it is enough we start to move again more slowly more softly later in the bed which was cold but which warms quickly i carefully remove all the black material part of its effect we decide is to more exactly delineate areas for a concentrated programme of caresses this final time takes the longest and contains like the best works many different movements and changes of tempo its climax chills me though something makes it worse than joyless makes it frightening terrifying she is beneath me her arms grip around my sides and back towards the end she wraps her slim strong legs round me pushing at my rump and the small of my back my orgasm is nothing a detail from the glands an irrelevant signal from the provinces i shout out but not with pleasure not even from pain that gripping this pressure this containing of me as though i am the body to be dressed enfolded strapped and parcelled lined and laced sends something crashing through me a memory ancient and fresh livid and rotten at once the hope and fear of release and capture of animal and machine and meshing structures a start and an end trapped crushed little death and that release the girl holds me like a cage i must go she holds out her hand as she comes back from the fireside with her clothes i take her hand squeeze it wish i could stay she says looking sad clutching her few thin pieces of clothing to her pale body thats all right a few hours her family expect her now she dresses whistling unselfconscious a foghorn sounds from far away it is quite dark beyond the shuttered windows one quick trip to the bathroom she finds a comb brandishing it triumphantly her hair is hopelessly tangled and she has to be patient sitting coat on on the edge of the bed while i carefully comb her hair making it smooth again she digs into a coat pocket and comes out with a small pack of thin cigars and a book of matches her nose wrinkles this whole place smells of sex she announces taking out a cigar it doesnt does it she turns to look at me holding out the pack of cigars i shake my head hmm disgusting behaviour she pronounces lighting up i comb her hair slowly removing the entangled results she blows smokerings grey os towards the ceiling she puts one hand onto mine moving it along with the comb she sighs a kiss before she goes face washed breath fragrant with the grey smoke id stay if i could she tells me dont worry you were here for a while you came here in the first place i would like to say more but i cannot that terror of being crushed of being trapped is with me still like an echo deep inside me still resonating she kisses me when she has gone i lie for a while in the large cooling bed listening to the foghorns one horn is quite close i may not be able to sleep tonight if the fog doesnt clear there is a faint fading hint of smoke in the air on the ceiling the discoloured rings on the plaster look like imprinted smokerings branded there by abberlaine arrols cigar i breathe in deeply trying to catch the last traces of her perfume she is right the room does smell of sex i am thirsty and hungry it is only midevening i get up and have a bath then dress slowly feeling pleasantly tired i am putting the lights out front door already open when i see the glow coming from a doorway across the cluttered room i close the door go to investigate it is an old library shelves bare there is a television screen at one end switched on my heart seems to beat somewhere in my throat but then i realise the picture is not the usual one the screen is white a textured blankness i go to switch it off but before i can something dark closes over the view then withdraws a hand the picture shakes then settles on the man in the bed a woman moves away from the camera she goes to stand near the edge of the screen she lifts a brush and pulls it slowly through her hair staring ahead at at what must be a mirror on the wall the view of the man in the bed is altered only slightly otherwise a chair has been shifted and the bed is not quite as neat as it was after a while the woman puts the brush down leans forward one hand to her brow then pulls back again she picks up the brush and moves away passing in a dark blur beneath the camera i dont get a good look at her face my mouth is dry the woman reappears at the bedside wearing a dark coat she stands looking down at the man then bends and kisses him on the forehead smoothing some hair away from his brow as she does so she picks a bag up from the floor and leaves i switch the set off there is a phone on the wall of the kitchen the noise is there not quite regular perhaps a little faster than before i leave the apartment take a lift to the train deck it is foggy lights make yellow and orange cones out of the thick vapour trams and trains pass hooting and clanking i wander along the walkway on the outside of the bridge hand on the tall rail at the walkways lip fog blows softly through the girders foghorns sound from the hidden sea people pass by mostly railmen i smell steam within the fog and coal smoke and diesel fumes in a railway workers shed uniformed men sit round tables reading papers playing cards drinking from large mugs i walk on the bridge shudders beneath my feet and a crashing grinding metallic noise comes from somewhere ahead the noise echoes through the bridge reflecting from the secondary architecture bouncing through the fogcurdled air i walk through a dense silence then the foghorns sound one after another i hear trains and trams nearby slowing stopping ahead sirens and klaxons burst into life i walk by the very edge of the bridge through the glowing fog my legs ache again my chest throbs dully as though in sympathy i think of abberlaine the memory of her ought to make me feel better but it does not it was in a haunted apartment the ghosts of that mindless noise and that nearly unchanging picture were there all the time a hands notion away a switchturning away probably even when i first kissed her even while her four limbs gripped me and i cried out in terror the trains are silent now nothing has passed me in either direction for some minutes klaxons and sirens compete with the baying foghorns yes very sweet and good indeed and i would love to dwell on that fresh memory but something in me will not let this happen i try to recreate the smell and feel and warmth of her but all i can recall is that woman calmly brushing her hair looking into an invisible mirror and brushing brushing i try to remember the way the room looked but see it only in black and white from up in one corner just one bed in the clutter and a man in it a train heads past me in the fog lights flashing heading towards the stillwailing sirens what now anyway oh more much more of the same that freshly sated part of my mind says nights and days of that weeks and months of that please but what really another distraction something else besides lost libraries and incomprehensible aircraft missions and faked dreams either way any of the ways i cant see much good coming of it i walk on into the rolling mists into the gathering noise of sirens and shouts and crackling fires of a train wreck i see the flames first rising through the fog like thick quivering masts smoke rolls like a solid shadow in the mist people shout lights flash some railwaymen pass me running heading towards the wreck i can see the rear of the train that passed me a few minutes ago it is an emergency train loaded with cranes and hoses and hospital cars it moves slowly down the track disappering behind the freight cars of another train two tracks away nearer me the first few freight cars are normal still on the rails but the next three have come off their wheels lying in the metal troughs at the edge of the rails neatly caught as the bridge designers intended the carriage beyond these lies diagonally across the tracks its axles straddling a rail each after that each succeeding car is more damaged than the one before the flames still rise ahead i am near to their source i can feel the heat beating through the fog onto my face i wonder if i ought to retrace my steps im probably not wanted here in the fog it is confusing but i think i am near the end of this section where the bridge narrows like a distended hourglass on its side down to the bridgewithinabridge which is the linking span cars are spilled across the tracks here where the network of points leads the tracks within the main section of the bridge towards the funnelneck of the linking span where only a few lines cross to the next section the heat on this side of the crashed train is quite fierce jets of water from the emergency train on the far side of the wreck arc over the burning freight cars hissing on their stovedin wood and metal frames railmen with extinguishers move to and fro others are unrolling canvas hoses and connecting them up to hydrants the flames roll and shudder the fires hiss as the water hits i keep on walking faster to get away from the heat of the flames water runs in the wheel troughs and draining channels of the deck steaming as it goes beneath the pounding heat of the flames adding its own vapour to the fog and the rising black smoke something has caught light above where the train burns and drips molten fire onto the furnace of smashed cars below i have to put my hands to my ears when i pass one of the sirens wailing away into the fog from a post by the track side more railmen scatter past me shouting the fire is at my back now roaring into the cluttered girder space in front the smashed train lies on its side crumpled and askew thrown across the tracks like something dropped from above like a dead snake the frames of the broken cars its fractured ribs beyond that another train larger and with long windowed carriages rather than low slabsided freight cars men swarm over its torn surfaces where they merge with the long still solid shape of a freight locomotive its snout buried in one of the tall carriages i see people being pulled from the wreckage stretchers lie by the track more klaxons and horns sound nearby obliterating the foghorns below i am halted by the sheer manic energy of this desperate scene watching the rescue operation more people are brought moaning and bloody out of the passenger train an explosion bursts from the wreckage behind me men run towards this new scene of catastrophe the wounded are being taken away on stretchers you one of the men shouts at me he is kneeling by a stretcher holding a womans bloody arm while another man ties a tourniquet higher up give us a hand take one end of a stretcher cant you there are ten or twelve stretchers by the side of the tracks men run up and ferry them away but many people are left lying waiting their turn i step over the rail from walkway to trackside go over to the stretchers and help a railman carry one we take the first stretcher to the emergency train where medical orderlies take it from us there is another explosion in the wrecked freight train when we come back with the next casualty the emergency train has been moved back up the track away from the danger of explosions we have to carry the stretcher with a moaning bleeding man on it two hundred yards to the end of the freight train where orderlies relieve us we run back to the passenger train the next casualty may well be dead already he pours blood as soon as we lift him we are directed by a railway official told to take him not to the emergency train but to another train further down the track in the opposite direction it is an express held up by the crash and taking some of the victims on board before ferrying them to the nearest hospital we take the stretcher on board in what looks like a softclass diningcar a doctor is going from victim to victim we put our bloody charge down over a white tablecloth splattering blood as the doctor reaches us he presses down on the mans neck holding it i had not even noticed that was where the blood was coming from the doctor looks at me a young man he looks frightened hold this he tells me and i have to put my hand to the mans neck while the doctor goes away for a while my fellow stretcherbearer runs off i am left holding the faint pulse of the man on the dinnertable his blood flowing over my hands when i relax or try to get a better purchase on the ragged patch of skin torn from his neck i grip i press i do what i am told and i look at the face of the man pale with blood loss unconscious but still suffering free from whatever mask he ever chose to meet the world with reduced to something pathetic and animal in his agony ok thanks the doctor comes back with a nurse they have bandages a drip bottles and needles they take over i walk away through the whimpering wounded i find myself in a passenger carriage deserted and unlit i feel faint and sit down for a moment then when i get up can only stagger as far as the toilet at the end of the carriage i sit down there head pounding lights in my eyes i wash my hands while i wait for my heart to catch up with the demands my body is making on it by the time i feel ready to stand again the train is moving i go back to the diningcar as the train slows nurses and auxiliaries from the hospital crowd in taking the stretchers i am told to get out of the way by three nurses and two auxiliaries clustering round a stretcher being taken towards the nearest door an injured woman giving birth i have to head back for the toilet and i sit there thinking no one comes to disturb me the whole train becomes very quiet it shakes and jerks a couple of times and i hear shouts outside the translucent window but the interior is silent i walk down to the diningcar it is a different one fresh and clean and smelling of polish the lights go out the white tables look ghostly in the light shed by the bridge outside still wrapped in fog should i get off now the good doctor would want me to brooke would so i hope would abberlaine arrol but for what all i do is play games games with the doctor with brooke with the bridge with abberlaine all very well and with her quite sublime save for that echoing horror do i go then i could why not here i am in a thing become place the link become location the means become end and route become destination and in this long articulated symbol phallic and poised between the limbs of our great iron icon how tempting just to stay and so to go to voyage out bravely leaving the woman at home place and thing and thing and place is it really so simple is a woman a place and a man just a thing good heavens youngfellowmelad of course not ho ho ho what a preposterous idea its all much more civilised than that still just because it seems so offensive to my taste i suspect there might be something in it so what do i represent then sitting here inside the train within the symbol good question i tell myself good question then the train moves again i sit at a table watching the stream of carriages alongside slowly we gain speed leave the other train behind in its siding we slow again and i watch as we pass the place where the wreck took place jumbled freight cars litter the side of the track twisted rails rear from the scored deck like so much bent wire and smoking debris gutters in the drifting fog under bright arc lights the emergency train lies a little way up the track lights bright the carriage shakes gently around me as the train gathers speed lights flare through the fog we flash through the main station of the section past other trains past local trams through the lights of the streets and thoroughfares and their surrounding buildings we are still gathering speed quickly the lights start to thin as we approach the sections far end i watch the lights for a moment longer then go to the end of the carriage where the door is i open the window and look out into the fog tearing past the window with a roar itself patterned by the unseen structure of the bridge echoing the trains headlong progress according to the density of girder work and addedon buildings around the track the last few building lights fall astern i work my hospital identity tag loose pulling it slowly and painfully from my wrist licking it when it sticks finally hauling it off regardless cutting myself across the linking span still well within the range my identity bracelet allows me of course a little circlet of plastic with my name on it my wrist feels odd without it after all this time naked i throw it out of the window into the fog it is lost the instant it leaves my hand i close the window and go back to the carriage to rest and see how far ill get eocene is the microphone on ah there you are yes well then nothing to worry about not really confused here at all no way honestly everything totally fine and wonderful completely under control absolutely wunnerful total command all aspects

she got her degree and letters after her name he made gentle fun of her new qualification and found other symbols to describe her he had given up the room in sciennes road and was renting a small flat in canonmills andrea more or less moved in though she kept on the flat in comely bank a cousin of hers from inverness called shona stayed there while she went to the pe college in cramond the place where andreas family had originated he still had to work in his vacations and she still spent hers abroad with family and friends which made him both jealous and envious but each time they met again it was as it had been before and at some point he could never pin down just when he started to think of their relationship as being something that might last longer than just the next term he even thought of suggesting they get married but a sort of pride in him would not tolerate the idea of the state far less the church being appeased in this way what mattered lay in their hearts or rather in their brains not in any register besides he admitted to himself she would probably have said no they were exhippies now he supposed if theyd every really been hippies in the first place flower power had well people chose their own phrases withered gone to seed blossomed and died he once suggested the problem was petal fatigue shed worked hard for a good degree and after graduation took a year off while he finished his own studies she went on short holidays to visit people in other parts of scotland and england and in paris and on longer trips to the states the rest of europe and the soviet union she renewed acquaintance with her edinburgh friends would cook for him while he studied visit her mother sometimes play golf with her father who to his amazement he found he could talk to quite easily and read novels in french when she came back from the su it was with a determination to learn russian he would arrive back at the flat sometimes to find her poring over novels and textbooks filled with the oddlooking halffamiliar cyrillic alphabet brows creased pencil poised over a notebook she would look up gaze incredulously at her watch and apologise for not having cooked him something hed tell her not to be daft and do the cooking himself he missed his own graduation day lying in the royal infirmary recovering from an appendectomy his mother and father went to the ceremony anyway just to hear his name read out andrea looked after them they all got on fine even when the parents met he was amazed that they all seemed to chat like old friends he was ashamed of himself for ever being ashamed of his own mother and father stewart mackie met shona the cousin from inverness they got married during stewarts first postgrad year he was stewarts best man andrea was shonas maid of honour they both made speeches at the reception his was the better planned but hers was the best delivered he sat watching as she stood speaking and realised then how much he loved her and admired her he also felt vaguely proud of her though he felt that was wrong she sat down to enthusiastic applause he raised his glass to her she winked back a few weeks later she told him she was thinking of going to paris to study russian he thought she was joking at first he was still looking for a job he had vague ideas of going with her perhaps he could do a crash course in french and look for a job over there then he was offered a good position in a firm working on power station design he had to take it three years she told him itll only be three years only he said she tried to tempt him with the idea of holidays in paris with her but he found it difficult to be supportive he was anyway powerless and she determined he wasnt going to see her to the airport they went out instead on the evening before she left across the road bridge and into fife along the shore to a small restaurant in culross they took his car he had bought a small new bmw on credit on the strength of his newfound wealth as an employed man it was an awkward meal and he drank too much wine she was staying sober for the flight the following day she loved flying she would always have a window seat so she drove back he fell asleep in the car when he woke up he assumed they were back outside the flat in canonmills or her old place at comely bank but lights shimmered far away across a mile of dark water in front of them before she switched off the headlights he caught a glimpse of something vast towering over them at once massive and airy where the hells this he said rubbing his eyes and looking around she got out of the car north queensferry come and see the bridge she told him puliing on her jacket he looked out sceptically the night was cold and there was a hint of rain come on she called itll clear your head so would a fucking revolver he muttered as he got out of the car they walked past notices warning people about objects falling from the bridge and others which claimed the land beyond as private until they came to a gravel turning circle some old buildings a small slip grass and whincovered rocks and the round granite piers of the railway bridge itself the smir of rain inside the cold wind made him shiver he looked up into the windmoaning spaces of the structure above the waters of the firth of forth shushed and slapped on nearby rocks and the lights of buoys flashed slowly on and off up and down the wide dark river she held his hand upstream the road bridge was a tall web of light and a distant grumble of background noise i like this place she told him and she hugged him her body quivering with the cold he held her but looked up into the web of steel overhead lost in its dark strength three years he thought three years in another city the tallahatchie bridge fell down he said eventually more to the cold wind than to her she looked up at him nuzzled her cold nose into the presentable remnant of the fine beard hed grown over the last two years and said what the tallahatchie bridge ode to billy joe bobbie gentry remember the damn thing fell down he gave a small despairing laugh anybody hurt she asked then put her cold lips on his adams apple i dont know he said suddenly very sad i didnt even think to look i just saw the headline a train rumbled over the bridge filling the night air with the bassy voice of other people going to other places he wondered if any of the passengers would pay heed to the old tradition and throw coins out of their nice warm carriages spinning futile wishes into the uncaring waters of the cold firth below he didnt tell her but he remembered being here in this very spot years ago one summer an uncle who had a car took him and his parents on a ride through the trossachs and then over to perth they came back this way it was before the road bridge opened in before theyd even started it he supposed it was a bank holiday and there was a queue a mile long waiting for the ferries the uncle drove them down here instead to have a look at one of scotlands proudest monuments what age had he been then he didnt know maybe only five or six his father had held him on his shoulders hed touched the cool granite of the piers and reached stretching straining small hands open and grasping for the redpainted metal of the bridge the queue of cars had grown no shorter when they went back they crossed by the kincardine bridge instead andrea kissed him waking him from his memories and hugged him very tight tighter than hed ever have thought she could hug so tight he almost had difficulty breathing then she let go and they went back to the car she drove over the road bridge he looked out over the dark waters to the dim nightshape of the rail bridge they had stood beneath and saw the long dotted row of lights of a passenger train as it crossed high over the river heading south lights like a row of dots at the end of a sentence he thought or at the start of one three years dots like meaningless morse a signal made up of only es and hs and is and ss the lights flickered through the intervening girders of the bridge the nearer cables of the road bridge flicked past too quickly to make any difference no romance he thought watching the train i remember when there were steam trains id go up to the local station and stand on the footbridge over the tracks until a train came along chuffing steam and smoke when it went under the wooden bridge its smoke exploded on the metal plates put there to protect the timbers a sudden blast of smoke and steam which surrounded you for what seemed like very long seconds with a delicious uncertainty another world of mystery and swirling halfseen things but they closed the line they dismantled the engines they tore down the footbridge and turned the station into an attractive very unique and spacious residence with a pleasant southerly aspect and extensive grounds very unique that just about said it all even if theyd got it right theyd still have been wrong the train flowed across the long viaduct and disappeared into the land just like that no romance no fireworks as the ashes and cinders were dumped no flying comettail of orange sparks from the chimney not even any clouds of steam he would try to write a poem about it the next day but it wouldnt work and he would throw it away he turned from the bridge yawning as andrea slowed the car for the tolls you know how long it takes them to paint it dont you he said to her she shook her head wound the window down as they came up to the toll plaza what the railway bridge she said digging in a pocket for the money i dont know a year wrong he told her folding his arms looking ahead towards the red light at the far end of the booth three three fucking years she said nothing she paid the toll and the light turned green he worked he got on his mum and dad were proud of him he got a mortgage on a small flat still in canonnrills the company he worked for let him put some money towards his company car once hed ascended to such heights of bourgeois decadence so he had a bigger and better bmw rather than a cortina andrea wrote him letters he would make the same old joke whenever he referred to them john peel played reggae on nighttime radio one he bought past present and future by al stewart post world war two blues very nearly made him cry roads to moscow actually did once and nostradamus annoyed him he played the confessions of doctor dream a lot lying with the headphones on spreadeagled on the floor in the darkness smashed out of his skull and humming along with the music the first track on the eponymous second side was called irreversible neural damage things had a certain pattern he observed to stewart mackie stewart and shona moved to dunfermline across the river in fife shona having been trained to be a pe teacher in the dunfermline college of physical education located confusingly but cannily not in dunfermline but across the river near edinburgh it seemed then singularly appropriate that she should become a teacher in dunfermline itself from one dispossesed capital to another stewart was still at the university finishing postgrad work and probably all set to become a lecturer he and shona called their first child after him it meant more to him than he could tell them he travelled round europe on a railpass before he got too old across canada and america by train too and by hitchhiking and buses and trains down to morocco and back that trip he didnt enjoy he was only twentyfive but he felt old already he had the beginnings of a bald patch still there was a wonderful train journey towards the end of it travelling for some twentyfour hours through spain from algeciras to irun with some american guys who had some of the finest dope hed ever encountered hed watched the sun come up over the plains of mancha listening to the trams steel wheels playing symphonies he always found excuses not to visit paris he didnt want to see her there she came back every now and again changed different somehow more steady and ironic and even more sure of herself her hair was short now very chic he supposed they had holidays on the west coast and the islands when he could get the extra time off and once went to the soviet union his first trip her third he remembered the trains and the journeys on them of course but also the people the architecture and the war memorials it wasnt the same though he was frustrated unable to speak more than a few words of the language and listening to her chattering away quite happily with people made him feel hed lost her to a language and to a foreign tongue he thought bitterly he knew there was someone else in paris he worked on refineries and rig design and made money he sent some home to his mum now that his dad was retired he bought a mercedes and changed it soon afterwards for an old ferrari which kept fouling its plugs he settled for a threeyearold red porsche though really he wanted a new one he started seeing a girl called nicola a nurse hed known since hed had his appendix out at the royal infirmary people made jokes about their names called them imperialists asked them when they were going to claim russia back she was small and blonde and had a generous allowing body she disapproved of him smoking dope and told him when he splashed out and bought some coke that he was insane to waste that sort of money stuffing it up his nose he felt very tender towards her he told her once when he suspected he was supposed to tell her he loved her i feel tender every bloody morning you animal she said laughing and snuggling up to him he laughed too but realised it was the only joke she had ever made she knew about andrea but didnt talk about it they drifted apart after six months after that when asked he said he was playing the field the phone rang at three oclock one morning while he was screwing an old school pal of andreas the phone was by the bedside go on she said giggling answer it she held onto him while he inched across the bed to the ringing machine it was his sister morag ringing to tell him that his mother had died of a stroke an hour before in the southern general in glasgow mrs mclean had to get back home anyway she left him sitting on the bed holding his head and thinking at least it wasnt dad and hating himself for thinking it he didnt know who to ring he thought of stewart but he didnt want to wake their latest baby theyd had problems with the kid sleeping anyway he rang andrea in paris a man answered and when her sleepy voice came on the phone she hardly seemed to know who he was he told her hed had some bad news she hung up he couldnt believe it he tried calling back but the phone was engaged the international operator couldnt get through either he left the phone on the bed engaged tone beeping mindlessly while he dressed then took the porsche on a long frosty starlit drive north almost to the cairngorms most of the tapes he had in the car at the time were pete atkin albums but clive jamess lyrics were too thoughtful and often too melancholic for a good fast mindless drive and the reggae tapes he had mostly bob marley were too laid back he wished he had some stones he found an old tape one hed almost forgotten and turned the motorola up to maximum volume playing rock and roll animal over and over all the way up to braemar and back a sort of knowing sneer on his face allo he whined nasally to the headlights of the occasional passing car allo ça va allo he went to that place on the way back he stood under the great red bridge which he had once thought looked the same colour as her hair while his breath smoked and the porsche idled clatteringly on the gravel turning circle and the first streaks of dawn outlined the bridge a silhouette of arrogance grace and power against the pale flames of a winter morning sky the funeral was two days later hed stayed with his father in the pebbledashed council house after quickly packing a bag in his flat and slamming the whining phone down he ignored his mail stewart mackie came through for the funeral looking down at his mothers coffin he waited for tears that did not come and put his arm round his fathers shoulders only realising then that the man was thinner and smaller than he used to be and quietly steadily quivering like ajuststruck iron rod as they were leaving andrea met them at the cemetery gates getting out of an airport taxi dressed in black and carrying a small case he couldnt speak she hugged him talked to his father then came to him and explained that after they were cut off shed tried to call him back shed been trying for two days shed sent telegrams shed had people go round to his flat to look for him in the end shed decided to come herself shed phoned morag in dunfermline as soon as she got off the plane found out what had happened and where the funeral was all he could say was thank you he turned to his father and hugged the man and then cried crying more tears into his fathers coatcollar than he thought his eyes could ever have held for his mother for his father for himself she could only stay for one night she had to go back to study for some exams the three years had become four why didnt he come to paris they slept in separate rooms in the pebbledashed house his father had been sleepwalking and having nightmares he would sleep in the same room to wake his father if he had nightmares stop him hurting himself if he walked in his sleep he drove her through to edinburgh they had lunch at her parents then he took her to the airport who was your friend the one on the phone in paris he asked her then wanted to bite his tongue gustave she said easily enough youd like him have a nice flight he said he watched the plane take off into the aquamarine skies of a crisp winter afternoon and he even followed it a little way by road as it turned south he leant forward over the steering wheel of the porsche staring up through the windscreen to watch the aircraft as it climbed into the immaculate blue of the cloudless sky driving after it as though he could catch the jet it was just starting to make a vapour trail when he lost sight of it glinting and disappearing over the pentland hills he felt tugged by age for a while he took the times balancing it with the morning star now and again he would look at the logo heading the times and think he could almost catch the pages of times present as they flicked over almost hear the rustle of the dry leaves turning future became present present became past a truth so banal so obvious and accepted that he had somehow managed to ignore it before he combed his hair so that the bald patch barely the size of a twopenny piece would not be so noticeable he changed to the guardian he spent more time with his father now he would drive through on some weekends to the small new council flat and regale the old man with tales of the wonderful world of engineering in the seventies pipelines and crackers and carbon fibres the use of lasers radiography the spinoffs from space research he described the furious force the incredible energy of a power station undergoing a steam purge when the newly completed boilers are fired up water is fed in the pipework fills with superheated steam and any bits of loose weld spatter dropped gloves or tools or nuts and bolts or decaying apple cores or whatever are exploded through the great pipes and blasted into the atmosphere cleaning the whole system of debris before the final pipework joins the boilers to the turbines themselves with their thousands of delicate and expensive blades and fine tolerances once hed seen the head of a sledgehammer thrown quarter of a mile by a steam purge it went through the side of a parked van the noise put concorde to shame a noise like the end of the world his father smiled nodding thoughtfully from his chair he still saw the cramonds he and the advocate would sit up late every so often like two old men and discuss the world mr cramond believed that law and religion and fear were necessary and that a strong government even if it was a bad one was better than none at all they argued but always amicably he was never able to explain quite why they got on or how perhaps because in the end neither of them took anything they said themselves seriously perhaps because neither of them took anything at all entirely seriously the did agree it was all a game elvis presley died but he cared more that groucho marx died in the same week he bought albums by the clash and the sex pistols and the damned glad that something different and anarchic was happening at last even if he listened to the jam elvis costello and bruce springsteen more he still knew people at the university besides stewart including some in a couple of small revolutionary parties theyd stopped trying to get him to join after hed explained he was utterly incapable of following a party line when china invaded vietnam and they had to try and prove that at least one of them wasnt socialist he found the resulting theological contortions wildly amusing he knew some younger people through a poetry writing group at the university which he attended sporadically he knew a select few of andreas old crowd and there were a couple of men in the new company he worked for who he liked he was young he was welloff and although he would rather have been taller and his hair was an undistinguished brown and with a bald spot the size of a fiftypence piece inflation he wasnt unattractive he lost count of the number of women hed slept with he found himself buying a bottle of laphroaig or macallan every two or three days he bought dope every couple of months and usually had a joint to put him to sleep he gave the whisky up for a few weeks just to make sure he wasnt becoming an alcoholic then rationed himself to one bottle a week the two men he liked in the company tried to persuade him to come in with them partners in their own business he wasnt sure he talked to mr cramond about it and stewart the advocate said it was a good idea in principle but it would mean hard work people expected things too easily these days stewart laughed and said well why not might as well make money for himself as anybody else pay your taxes under labour and hire a very smart accountant indeed if the tories got in stewart had his own more severe problems though he hadnt been really well for years and hed been finally diagnosed as diabetic he drank bottles of pils when they met and looked longingly at other peoples pints of heavy he still wasnt sure about joining a partnership he wrote to andrea who told him do it she would be coming back soon she said studies complete russian mistressed to her satisfaction he thought ill believe shes back when i see her he had taken up golf stewart had persuaded him he balanced this by joining amnesty international after years of dithering and sending a large cheque to the anc after his firm had worked on a south african contract he sold the porsche and brough a new saab turbo he was driving out to gullane one bright saturday in june to meet the advocate for a game at muirfield playing a tape which consisted solely of because the night and shot by both sides recorded backtoback time after time when he saw the advocates crumpled blue bristol being dragged up onto a breakdown truck he drove on a little way slowing but still heading for gullane telling himself the car with the stovedin front and smashed windscreen wasnt mr cramonds then turned round in a side road and went back to where two very younglooking policemen were measuring the road the scarred verge and a shattered stone wall mr cramond had died at the wheel a heart attack he thought that wasnt such a terrible way to go providing you didnt hit anybody else the one thing i mustnt say to andrea he thought is we cant go on meeting like this he felt slightly guilty about buying a black suit for mr cramonds funeral when all hed had for his own mothers was an armband he drove out to the crematorium with butterflies in his stomach he was hungover after finishing most of a bottle of whisky on his own the previous night he felt he had a cold coming on for some reason as he drove into the place through a grey impressive gateway he just knew that she wasnt going to be there he felt physically sick and ready to turn around and go drive away anywhere he tried to control his breathing and his heart and his sweating palms and he drove the saab on into the wide immaculate grounds towards the cluster of parked cars in front of the low buildings of the crematorium he hadnt felt like this at his mothers funeral and he hadnt really been all that close to the advocate maybe they would think he was still drunk hed had a shower and brushed his teeth but he probably smelled of whisky from his pores despite his new suit he felt grubby he wondered if he should have brought a wreath he hadnt thought he looked round the cars of course she wouldnt be there it made a warped sort of sense expected here she somehow wouldnt be able to show given up for ever at his mothers grave she had suddenly appeared all part of lifes rich pattern he told himself straightening his black tie before approaching the opened doors just remember son he thought this is bat country she was there of course she looked older but more beautiful under her eyes there were little puckermarks hed never noticed before tiny fleshy folds which made her look as though shed been brought up for ever squinting into some desert storm she took his hand kissed him held him for a second then let go he wanted to say she looked beautiful that she looked beautiful in black but even while he was telling himself what a cretin he was his mouth was mumbling something equally but more acceptably inane he could see no tears in her perfectly madeup eyes the service was brief surprisingly tasteful the minister had been a personal friend of the advocate and listening to his short but obviously sincere eulogy he felt his eyes tingle i must be getting old he thought either that or drinking too much of the hard stuff and getting soft the man i was ten years ago would have sneered at me for being moved almost to tears by words spoken by a minister in praise of an uppermiddle class barrister nevertheless he talked to mrs cramond after the service if he hadnt known her better hed have thought she was on drugs she seemed to glow her eyes wide her skin shining with an energy born of death a tearless astonishment a state of shock produced by the taking away of the man who for more than half her life had been half her life something beyond the immediacies of grief he thought of the instant after some injury when the eye saw the hammer crush the finger or a slipping blade cut flesh but before the blood flowed or the pain signal reached the brain she was in that penumbra now he thought surfaced in the oily calm seas of the storms eye she was leaving the following day for a holiday with a sister in washington dc the last thing she said to him was will you look after andrea they were so close she wont come with me will you look after her he said if shell be looked after theres somebody in paris anyway she might no said mrs cramond and shook her head once quite definite a gesture the daughter had inherited he suddenly saw one in the other no its you you she said and squeezed his hand before getting into her sons bentley she whispered youll be the closest now he stood puzzled for a while then went to look for her she was outside in the car park slouched against an undertakers black daimler limousine she was lighting up a menthol more as he walked up frowning you shouldnt do that he told her think of your lungs she regarded him with crushedlooking eyes solidarity she said bitterly my old mans smoking at the moment too a small muscle in her jaw trembled oh andrea he said suddenly filled with pity for her he put his hand out towards her but she flinched away turning from him and pulling her black coat tighter about her he stood still for a moment knowing that a few years ago he would have been hurt at this instant of rejection and probably turned on his heel he waited and she came back to him throwing the more down into the gravel and stepping on it with one black swivelling shoe get me out of here kid she said beam me up scotty wheres the porsche i was looking for it they took the saab to gullane she wanted to see the place where hed died so they stopped at the still rippedup trench of verge and the notyet repaired wall he watched her in the rearview mirror standing looking down at the torn piece of turf as though expecting to see the grass grow back before her eyes she touched the gashed ground and the stones of the farm wall then came back to the car rubbing stonedust and earth from her pale manicured fingers she told him that her brother thought she was morbid for wanting to come here you dont think i am do you he said no no she wasnt they drove on to the cold empty house on the dunes overlooking the firth she turned and hugged him as soon as they were through the door when he tried to kiss her gently and softly she rammed her mouth against his her nails dug into his scalp into his back through his jacket into his buttocks through the black suits trousers she made a whimpering noise hed never heard her make before and pushed his jacket offhis shoulders he had just decided to go along with this desperate anguished erotic reaction but to try to manoeuvre her into somewhere a little more comfortable than the draughty front hall with its cold tiles and bristly doormat when such a decision became unnecessary it was as if his body woke up to what was actually happening as though some instantly transmissible fever spread from her to him he was suddenly as consumed as wildly absurdly abandoned as she was wanting her more than he could ever remember having wanted her before they collapsed onto the doormat she pulled him to her without taking off coat or underclothes it was over for them both in seconds and only then did she cry the advocate had left him his golfclubs he had to smile it was a nice gesture he left his wife who had her own money the house in moray place the son got all his law books and the two most valuable paintings andrea was to have the rest save for a few thousand to go to the sons own children and some nieces and nephews and a couple of charitable bequests the son was busy with the estate so he and andrea drove mrs cramond to prestwick for her night flight to the usa he held onto andreas slim shoulders and watched the aircraft climb curving over the dark clyde heading for america he insisted on waiting until they could no longer see it so they stood and watched its winking lights grow smaller and smaller against the last glow of the day somewhere over the mull of kintyre when hed almost lost sight of it the jet climbed out of the shadow of the earth and into the retreating sunlight its vapour trail blazed suddenly glorious pink against the deep dark blue andrea caught her breath then gave a small laugh the first since shed heard the news about her father in the car driving north by the side of the deep dark river he confessed he hadnt known the trail would suddenly appear like that and after a moments hesitation he told her about trying to follow the parisbound jet a year earlier sentimental fool she told him and kissed him they went to see his father then took a few days off she had two weeks before she had to go back to paris and he had no urgent work so they just drove wherever they wanted for the next few days staying in small hotels and bedandbreakfasts and not knowing where theyd be heading when they got up each morning they went to mull sky cape wrath inverness aberdeen dunfermline where they stayed with stewart and shona then bypassed the bridges and the city to head via culross and stirling blyth bridge and peebles to the borders it was her birthday while they were away he bought her a bracelet in white gold they were heading back to edinburgh from jedburgh on the last day when she saw the distant tower lets go there she said they could only get within half a mile with the saab they parked oil a narrow deserted road she put on her kickers he lifted his camera and they tramped across a field then up through a wood and thick bracken uphill towards the tower which stood on a broad summit of rock and grass he hadnt realised it was so huge from the road it was massive a local lairds solution to local unemployment at the start of the previous century as well as a monument to a man and a great battle its dark stones seemed to rise for ever into the wind a heavy grey superstructure of wood protruding at the top held what looked like an open viewing platform beneath a conical wooden spire hed have imagined there would be a road up to such a place a car park a souvenir shop turnstiles officials and tickets and commerce there didnt even seem to be a path they stood craning their necks looking up at it the view just from the hillside was impressive enough he took some photographs she turned grinning to him what did you say this place was called he looked at the map he was carrying shrugged penielhaugh i think he said she laughed penilehaugh wonder if we can get inside she went to a small door there were three large boulders resting against it she tried to roll them away youll be lucky he told her he pushed and heaved the rocks away the little door opened she clapped her hands and went in wow she said as hejoined her the tower was hollow just a single tube of stone it was dark the earth floor was covered in pigeon droppings and tiny soft feathers and the noise of the disturbed cooing birds echoed faintly in the darkness sudden flapping sounded like fading uncertain applause high above a few birds flew across dusty beams of light shining from the wooden cupola the air was rich with the smell of the birds a single narrow stairway stones set jutting from the wall spiralled up into the lightcapped gloom amazing place he breathed how sweet the sound tolkienesque as they used to say she said her head back looking straight up mouth open he went over to the bottom of the spiralling stairs there was a narrow metal rail set on spindly rather rustedlooking rods he thought a century and a half old if its original more even older he shook it dubious think its safe she asked him her voice was low he looked up again it looked like a very long way to the top a hundred and fifty feet two hundred he thought about the rocks which had been rolled against the door she gazed up too caught a falling feather and looked at it he shrugged what the hell he started up the stone steps she started after him immediately he stopped let me get ahead a bit first im heavier he went on up another twenty or so steps keeping his feet close to the wall not using the iron rail she followed not coming too close probably quite all right he told her halfway up looking down towards the small circle of dark spattered earth at the base of the tower probably find the local rugby team trains by running up and down this every day sure was all she said they got to the top it was a broad octagonal platform of greypainted wood thick timbers solid planks and a firm secure set of rails they were both breathing hard when they got there his heart was hammering it was a clear day they stood getting their breath back the wind stroking their hair he breathed in the fresh cool air and walked round the airy circle drinking in the view and taking a few photographs think we can see england from here she said coming over to him he was gazing north wondering if a distant smudge on the horizon over the other side of some distant hills was above edinburgh he made a mental note to buy a pair of binoculars for keeping in the car he looked round soitinly he said good grief you could probably see your mother from here on a really clear day she put her arms round his waist and cuddled him her head on his chest he stroked her hair really she said how about paris he sighed looked away from her over the border countryside across low hills woods and fields and hedges yeah maybe paris he looked into her green eyes i think you can see paris from almost anywhere she said nothing just hugged him some more he kissed the crown of her head are you really coming back yes she said and he could feel her head nodding rubbing against his chest yes im coming back he gazed at the distant landscape for a while watching the wind move the tops of the serried firs he laughed once just a sudden shrugging motion of his shoulders a noise in his chest what she said not looking up i was just thinking he said i dont suppose if i asked you to marry me youd say yes would you he stroked her hair she looked up slowly an expression he could not read shown on her calm face i dont suppose i would either she said slowly her eyes flickering switching from one of his eyes to the other a tiny frown etched in between her deep dark brows he shrugged looked away again well never mind he said she hugged him once more head on chest sorry kid itd be you if anybody it just isnt me yeah what the hell he said i dont suppose its me either i just dont want to be apart from you for so long again i dont think we ever have to be again the wind blew some of her red glossy hair up against his face tickling his nose it isnt just edinburgh you know its you as well she told him quietly i need my own place and i dare say ill always be too easily led astray by a soft voice or a nice bum but well its up to you you sure you dont want to look for a nice wee wifey she looked up at him grinning oh he said nodding pretty damn certain she kissed him lightly at first he leant back against one of the grey square posts of the towers superstructure clutching her buttocks and rolling his tongue round inside her mouth thinking well if the damn post gives way what the hell i may never be this happy again there are worse ways to go she pulled away from him a familiar ironic smirk on her face yi talked me inta it yi sweettalkin bestid he laughed and pulled her back you insatiable hussy you bring out the best in me she fondled his balls through his jeans stroked his erection anyway i thought your period had started good god man not afraid of a little bit of blood are you no of course not but i havent brought any tissues or oh why are men so fucking fastidious she growled biting his chest through his shirt and pulling a thin white scarf from a pocket in her jacket like a magician producing a rabbit use this if you must mop up she covered his mouth with hers he pulled her shirt out of her trousers looked at the scarf held in his other hand this is silk he told her she pulled his zip down you better believe it kid i deserve the best afterwards they lay still shivering a little in the breeze of a cool july day as it moved through the painted wooden structure he told her her aureoles were like pink washers her nipples like little marshmallow bolts and the tiny puckered slits at their tips like slots for a screwdriver she laughed quietly dozily amused at such comparisons she looked up at him a sort of ironical roguish expression on her face do you really love me she said apparently unbelieving he shrugged fraid so youre a fool she chided gently lifting one hand to play with a lock of his hair smiling at it you think so he said lowering himself for a moment kissing the tip of her nose yes she said i am fickle and selfish you are generous and independent he brushed some windblown hair away from near her eyes she laughed shook her head well love is blind she said so they tell us he sighed cant see it myself metamorphosis oligocene when i was young i used to see these things float down in front of my eyes but i knew they were inside my eyes and that they moved the same way that pretend snowflakes move in one of those little snow scene ornaments never could work out what the hell they were i described them to the doctor once as looking like roads on a map i still know what i meant but theyd be better described as looking like tiny twisted glass pipes with bits of dark matter stuck in the tubes but they never seemed to cause any real problems so i paid them no attention only years later did i find out they were quite normal just dead cells from the top of the eye floating down through the fluid i believe i did once worry about them silting up but i guessed there was some bodily process that went on inside my eyes which would make sure it didnt happen shame really with an imagination like mine i think id have made a great hypochondriac somebody told me something about silt that little dark fellow with the stick said the whole thing was sinking theyd taken so much water from artesian wells and so much oil and gas too that whole bits of the thing were just sinking into the water quite upset about it he was of course theres a fix you pump in sea water more expensive than just sucking out what you want but you dont get anything for nothing although of course there are margins which come pretty damn close we are rock part of the machine what machine this machine look pick it up shake it see the pretty patterns form watch it snow or rain or blow or shine and we live the life of rocks first igneous as children metamorphic in our prime sedimentary in our sedentary dotage back to the subduction zone in fact the literal truth is even more fantastic that we are all stars that we all our systems and this single system are the gathered silt of ancient explosions dying stars from that first birth detonating in the silence to send their shrapnel gases spinning swarming collecting forming beat that mean magined monks so we are silt we are precipitate we are leavings cream and scum none the worse for that you are what has gone before just another collection a point on a stretched line just the wavefront shake and jostle a machine within a machine within a machine within a machine within a you want me to stop here jostle shake dreams of something long ago something lodged in the brain somewhere finally coming to the surface another shrapnel more splinters jostle shake jostle shake half awake half awake cities and kingdoms and bridges and towers im sure im heading for them all cant go for long without getting somewhere after all where the hell was that dark bridge still looking in the silence of the speeding train i see the bridge pass at speed the secondary architecture can almost disappear at times all that is visible is the bridge itself the original structure flashing red crisscrossing in its own lights or the sunlight beyond the blue firth shining under a new day the slanted girders pass like forever chopping blades dimming the view sectioning it parcelling it in the new light and in the haze of the day i seem to see another bridge up river a grey echo a shadowghost of the one bridge towering out of the mists above the river at once more straight and less so ghost ghost bridge a place i knew once but know no more a place to on the other side downriver through the cutting dark lines of the structure i can see the barrage balloons hanging blackly in the sunlight like obese submarines dead and bloated with some corrupting gas then the planes come level with me flying alongside me they are heading in the same direction as the train overtaking it slowly they are surrounded by black clouds dark bursts of smoke detonate in the sky all around them their own pulsed signals mingle with the black smudges of the bridges reactivated antiaircraft defences scrambling the already nonsensical message trailed behind the craft still further invulnerable uncaring the silver planes fly on through the furious hail of exploding shells their formation perfect their sky writing as neat and precise as ever sunlight glinting over their sleekly bulbous bodies all three from boss to skid look quite undamaged their flushriveted lines are unmarred even by soot or oil stains then when they are almost too far away for me to see them clearly through the angle of increasing structure when i have determined they must be really invulnerable or at least that the bridges guns are firing smoke charges not shrapnel or even impact rounds one of the aircraft is hit hit in the tail it is the middle plane immediately it starts to slow down dropping behind the other planes grey smoke pouring from its tail the black puffs of its message continuing for a while then growing fainter as the plane drops further and further back until it is alongside the train it does not peel away or take any other evasive action it keeps the same steady course but slower now its tail disappears consumed by the smoke still it flies straight and level gradually the fuselage is eaten away the plane keeps pace with the train and does not deviate from its course though black antiaircraft bursts still swarm around it damage or no half the fuselage is gone it has no tail the grey smoke starts to eat into the trailing edge of the wing roots and the rear of the cockpit canopy the plane cannot be flyable it should have tumbled out of control the instant it lost its tail surfaces but it flies on still accurately level with the racing train and matching its speed the thick cloud of grey smoke eats fuselage cockpit wings then thins out as they disappear only the engine cowling and the nearinvisible line of the propeller remain to be consumed a flying engine no pilot no fuel no control surfaces no means of lift the cowling disappears exhaust by exhaust only a few puffs of black smoke bother to follow it the engine has vanished the propeller disappears in a sudden thick pulse of grey then only the boss is left quickly shrivelling to leave a thin grey line then it is gone just blue sky and balloons beyond the whirling verticals and slants of the speedblurred bridge the train jostles and shakes me i am half awake i go back to sleep on the journey i had strange recurring dreams of a life lived on land i kept seeing one man first as a small boy and then as a youth and finally as a young man but i did not see him clearly at any stage it was as though all of it was through some mist and only in black and white and cluttered with things that were more than just visual images but less than real as if i watched that life on a distorted screen but at the same time could see into that mans head see the thoughts inside the associations and connections conjectures and imaginings all bursting from him and onto the screen i was watching it all seemed grey and unreal and i could sometimes spot similarities between what happened in this odd recurring dream and what really did happen while i lived on the bridge perhaps that was reality my damaged memories just restored enough to put on some sort of disordered show and doing their best either to entertain or to inform me i recall that i did see something that looked like the bridge at one point in my dream but only from a distance from a desert coast i think and besides it was far too small later i thought i might have stood underneath it but again it was too small and too dark a minor echo no more the empty train i had stowed away on moved for days over the bridge sometimes slowing but never stopping i could have jumped from it a couple of times but i might have killed myself and i was still determined to reach the end of the structure i had the run of only three deserted carriages two passenger cars with seats and small tables and sleeping compartments and one diningcar but no kitchencar no galley and locked doors at each end of those three carriages i hid most of the time slouched down in one of the reclining seats so that i could not be seen from outside or lying in a sleeping compartment top bunk and peeping out through half drawn curtains at the bridge outside i drank water from the toilet washbasins and daydreamed or dreamt about food the carriages were unlit at night haunted by the flickering beams of yelloworange light from outside it grew gradually warmer with each passing day and the sunlight outside became brighter the overall shape of the bridge outside the windows did not seem to change but the people i glimpsed occasionally by the trackside did alter their skins became different colours darker as the sunlight increased after some days though everything seemed to get darker again as i lay faint with hunger rattled like something loose in a long reclined seat i began to believe that the light had not changed at all and that it was something inside my eyes that made the people look like shadows still my eyes hurt then one night i awoke dreaming of the last meal i had had with abberlaine arrol and saw that it was very dark both inside the carriage and out no glow of light came from the bridge outside no chrome edge of reflecting cabin fitments was visible neither was my own hand when i held it in front of my face i closed my eyes and pressed them only then seeing the false nervelight that is the eyes reaction to pressure i felt my way to the nearest outside door opened the window and stared out a strange thick heavy smell came into the carriage on the warm air it alarmed me at first no smell of salt of paint or oil or even smoke and fumes then i saw a faint edge of light above me moving very slowly the train was still moving at close to full speed the slipstream poured roaring through the window to tug at my loose clothes but whatever it was i could see the light was moving very slowly over it it must be very far away a cloudbank i thought lit by starlight then realised i could see that outline of light continuously without any interrupting beams and girders chopping the sight into flickering fragments a part of the bridge where the loadbearing structure was beneath the level of the rails i started to feel faint again then the train slowed for some points and before it speeded up again i could hear through the lessened noise of its progress the distant night noises of a dark wild forest and saw that the edging of the light i had mistaken for a cloudbank was a raggedly wooded ridge a couple of miles away i laughed delirious and delighted and sat by the window until the dawn came up and made the green forest steam with fragment mists that day the train slowed and entered the outskirts of a sprawling town it wound sinuously slowly through a great marshalling yard towards a long low station i hid in a linen cupboard the train stopped i heard voices the whirring noises of unidentifiable machines inside the carriages then nothing i tried to get out of the cupboard but it had been locked from the outside while i was sitting wondering what to do next more voices sounded through the cupboards metal door and i formed the impression that the train was filling up with people after a few hours the train moved again i slept in the locked cupboard that night and was discovered by a steward the next morning the train was full of passengers welldressed ladies and gentlemen who looked as though they came from the bridge they wore summer suits and dresses they sipped cocktails chinking with ice at little tables in the observation cars they looked vaguely disgusted when they saw me led through the train in my crumpled stale clothes a railway policemans hand forcing one of my arms painfully high up my back outside the countryside was mountainous full of tunnels and tall viaducts spanning bouldertorn torrents i was interrogated by one of the trains deputy firemen a young man in a sparkling white uniform which seemed rather inappropriately spotless given his rank he asked me how i came to be on board i told the truth i was taken back through the train and locked in a bare barred section of a baggage car i was fed well on galley leftovers my clothes were taken from me washed and returned the handkerchief abberlaine arrol had monogrammed and on which she had left a smudged red image of her lips came back quite thoroughly clean the train moved for days through mountains and then across a high grasscovered plain where distant herds of animals scattered and fled on its approach and the wind blew continually beyond the plain it started to climb towards another range of mountains it unwound its way through those across more spindly viaducts and long tunnels descending all the time and stopping at small quiet towns along the way amongst forests and green lakes and rock spires plinthed in scree the barred and rattling little cell had only a single small window two feet long and six inches high but i could observe the scenery well enough and the fresh rarefied smells of the mountains and the plateaux leaked through the large baggage door at one end of the car wrapping me with the scents which i seemed tantalisingly to recall from long ago i had other dreams besides the recurring one of the man in the severely beautiful city i dreamt one night that i woke up and went to my small window and looked out over a boulderstrewn plain and saw two sets of weak lights as they approached each other over the moonlit wasteland just as they stopped facing each other the train roared into a tunnel on another occasion i thought i looked out during the day while the train ran along the top of a great cliff facing a blue glittering sea the cliffedge was strung about with puffy clouds which we continually plunged into and rushed out of and a few times in the clear spaces through a haze of heat far below on the surface of the sunburnished sea i thought i saw two ships of the line sailing alongside one another the space between them filled with puffs of grey smoke and darting flames but that was a daydream they left me here eventually after the mountains and the hills and tundra and another lower colder plain here is the republic a cold concentric place once known they say as the eye of god it is reached from the barren plain by a long causeway which divides the waters of a huge grey inland sea the sea is almost perfectly circular and the large island at its centre is also very close to that same geometric shape the first i saw of it was the wall the grey sea wall skirted by low surf and topped by low towers it seemed to stretch curving away for ever vanishing in a haze of distant rain squalls the train clattered through a long tunnel over a deep moat of water and then another wall beyond lay the island and the republic a place of wheatfields and wind low hills and grey buildings it seemed at once rundown and full of energy and those grey buildings gave way every now and again to immaculate palaces and temples of an obviously earlier age perfectly restored but seemingly unused and there was a graveyard a cemetery miles to each side packed with millions of identical white pillars spread geometrically across a green sea of grass i live in a dormitory with a hundred other men i sweep leaves from the broad paths of a park tall grey buildings rise on all sides bulking square shapes against the grainy dustyblue sky there are spires and thin towers on top of the buildings banners i cannot read fly from them i sweep the leaves even when there are no leaves to sweep it is the law i formed the impression when i first came here that this was a prison but this is not the case at least not in the obvious sense it seemed then that everybody i met was either a prisoner or a guard and even when i was weighed and measured and inspected and given my uniform and taken by bus to this large anonymous town that nothing had really changed i could talk to relatively few people this came as no surprise of course but the ones i did talk to seemed delighted that i could speak to them in my strange alien tongue but also rather guarded when talking about their own circumstances i asked them if they had heard about the bridge some had but when i said i came from there they seemed to think i was joking or even that i was mad then my dreams changed were taken over invaded i woke up one night in the dormitory the air was sick with the smell of death and choked with the sounds of people moaning and crying out i looked through a broken window and saw the flashes of distant explosions the steady glow of large fires and could hear the crump of falling shells and bombs i was alone in the dormitory the sounds and smells came from outside i felt weak and desperately hungry more hungry than i had felt on the train which had taken me away from the bridge i discovered i had lost almost half my weight during the night i pinched myself and bit the inside of my cheek but i did not wake up i looked round the deserted dormitory the windows had been covered in tape black and white tape made xs all over the rectangular panes outside the town was burning i found some illfitting shoes and an old suit where my standardissue uniform should have been i went out into the town the park which i was supposed to sweep was there but covered in tents and surrounded by ruined buildings planes droned overhead or came hurtling down out of the cloudy night sky screaming explosions shook the ground and air flames leapt into the sky everywhere was rubble and the smell of death i saw a dead skinny horse fallen in its traces the cart behind it halfcovered by the ruins of a fallen building the horse was being carefully butchered by a group of thin wideeyed men and women the clouds were orange islands against the inkblack sky fires reflected there on the hung vapour and sent huge columns of their own darkness into the air to meet them the planes wheeled like birds of carrion over the burning town sometimes a searchlight would pick one out and a few black puffs of smoke would darken the sky around the plane still further but it seemed that otherwise the town was defenceless occasionally shells shrieked overhead twice explosions nearby made me duck for cover as debris dusty bricks shards of stone fell pattering and thumping around me i wandered for hours towards dawn as i was returning to the dormitory through this unending nightmare i found myself behind two old people a man and a woman they were walking along the street each supporting the other when the man suddenly crumpled and fell taking the old lady down with him i tried to help them up but the man was already dead there had been no bombs or shells for several minutes and though i thought i could hear distant crackling smallarms fire none of it was near us the woman almost as thin and grey looking as the old dead man cried hopelessly sobbing and moaning into the worn collar of the old mans coat slowly shaking her head and repeating over and over some words i could not understand i did not think the shrivelled old could contain so many tears the dormitory was full of dead soldiers in grey uniforms when i returned one bed was unoccupied i lay down on it and woke up it was the same peaceful intact town with the same trees and paths and tall grey buildings i was still here the buildings i had seen in flames or in ruins were those that overlooked the park where i worked when i looked carefully though in some places i found stones which had not been restored and which were part of the original buildings some of those blocks were chipped and scarred with the distinctive but weathered marks of bullets and shrapnel i had similar dreams for weeks always much the same never exactly similar somehow i was not surprised when i discovered that everybody had these dreams they were surprised surprised that i had never had such dreams before i cannot understand i tell them why they seem frightened of their dreams that was the past i say this is the present the future will be better it wont be the past they think there is a threat i tell them there isnt some people have started to avoid me i tell the people who will listen that they are in prison but the prison is in their own heads i sat up drinking far too much spirit with my workmates last night i told them all about the bridge and that i had seen nothing threatening to them on my long journey here most of them just said i was crazy and went to bed i stayed up too late drank too much i have a hangover now at the start of the week i pick up my brush from the depot and head into the chilly spaces of the park where the leaves lie damp or frozen on the ground according to where the sunlight falls they are waiting for me in the park four men and a big black car in the car two of them hit me while the other two talk about the women they screwed that weekend the beating is painful but not enthusiastic the two men administering it seem almost bored one of them cuts a knuckle on my teeth and looks annoyed for a moment he takes out a knuckleduster but one of the other men says something to him he puts it away again and sits sucking at his finger the car screams through the wide streets the thin greyhaired man behind the desk is apologetic i wasnt supposed to be beaten up but its standard procedure he tells me i am a very lucky man i dab at my bloody nose and puffy eyes with my monogrammed hanky still miraculously not stolen and try to agree with him if you were one of ours he says then shakes his head he taps a key on the surface of his grey metal desk i am somewhere in a large underground building they blindfolded me in the car on the road between the town and whatever city this is i know it is a city because i heard its noises and we drove through it for an hour before the car dipped into some echoing underground space spiralling down and down into the earth when it stopped i was led out of the car and along innumerable curving corridors to this room where the thin greyhaired man was waiting tapping his grey desk with a key and drinking tea i ask him what they are going to do with me he tells me instead about the combined prison and police headquarters i am now in it is mostly underground as i had guessed he explains with genuine enthusiasm the principles upon which it has been designed and built warming to his subject as he goes on the prisonhq is in the form of several tall buried cylinders inverted circular skyscrapers interred together beneath the surface of the city he is deliberately vague about the exact number but i form the impression there are between three and six of these closepacked cylinders each of these huge sunken drums contains many hundreds of rooms cells offices toilets canteens dormitories and so on and each cylinder can be individually rotated like some immense battleship magazine so that the orientation of the corridors and doors leading into and out of each drum can be changed almost continually a door which one day leads to a lift or an underground car park or a railway station or a certain place in one of the other cylinders might on the following day lead to a completely different cylinder or to solid rock from day to day even in conditions of high security alert from hour to hour this massive gearbox of revolving drums can be moved either at random or according to a complex coded pattern thus totally confounding the planning and execution of any attempted escape the information necessary to decode these erratic transformations is distributed to the police and staff strictly on a needtoknow basis so that nobody ever knows in exactly what new configuration the composite subterranean complex has been arranged only the very highest and most trusted officials have access to the machines which set up and oversee these rotations and the machinery and electronics which are its muscles and nerves are so designed that no engineer or electrician working on any conceivable fault or failure could possibly gain a working overview of the whole system the fellows eyes are bright and wide as he describes all this to me my head hurts my vision is blurred and i need to relieve myself but i agree quite honestly that it is a considerable work of engineering but dont you see he says dont you see what it is what it is an image of no i dont i confess ears ringing a lock he says triumphantly eyes flashing it is a poem a song in metal and rock a perfect real image of its purpose a lock a safe a set of tumblers a safe place to store evil i see what the man means my head throbs and i black out when i wake up it is on another train and ive peed my pants miocene versions of the truth disseminated to the flock like plastic shrapnel getting under the skin of most and on the nerves of some another chip off the old blastema another symptom of the system the bloom and sump of your diabetical materialism come give us your excuses explain why you did what you had to do tell us of your hurting to be kind you talk of bloody sundays black septembers and all the time youre wasting well smile dissemble case the joint for barricades count the weapons cost the operation and mutter back meantime i believe thats just the way it happened im sure its exactly as you say oh well very radical lot of street cred there stewart nodded ive always said a good poems worth a dozen kalashnikovs he nodded again and drank from his glass look asshole just tell me if you mind the bit about diabetical materialism stewart shrugged reached for another bottle of pils doesnae bother me pal you just go ahead that a new poem no ancient but im thinking i might try to get some printed just thought you might be offended stewart laughed god youre a daft bugger sometimes you know that i know that they were in stewart and shonas house in dunfermline shona had taken the kids to inverness for the weekend hed come over to leave their christmas presents and talk to stewart he needed somebody to talk to he opened another can of export and added the ringpull to the growing pile in the ashtray stewart poured the pils into his glass and took the drink over to the hifi the last record had ended a few minutes earlier how about a blast from the past yeah lets wallow in nostalgia why not he settled back in the seat watching stewart thumb through the collection of records and wishing hed been able to think of something more imaginative than record tokens to give the kids well it was what theyd both asked for ten and twelve he remembered hed bought his first single on his sixteenth birthday these youngsters already had their own album collections oh well good heavens stewart said taking out a blue and grey cover and looking slightly shocked did i really buy deep purple in rock you must have been stoned he told him stewart turned round and winked at him as he took the record out oh eh was that a little flash of wit there merely a scintilla put the goddamn record on well it hasnt been played for a while just let me clean it here stewart cleaned the record put it on cant stand the rezillos my god he thought that was from a blast from the past already indeed stewart nodded in time to the music then sat down in his armchair i like these gentle melodic songs he shouted the track hed put the stylus down on was somebodys gonna get their head kicked in tonight he raised his can to stewart god almighty seven years stewart leaned forward a hand cupped at one ear he pointed at the turntable shouted i said seven years he nodded towards the hifi that seventyeight stewart sat back shaking his head emphatically aw naw thirtythree and a third he shouted i am reduced to telling stories for my living i raid my dreams for tasty morsels to feed my jealous field marshal and his motley band of vapidly murderous ancillaries we hunker down round a fire of fallen flags and precious books flames glinting on their bandoliers and bayonets we eat long pig and drink rough whisky the field marshal boasts of famous battles he has won all the women he has fucked and then when he can think of no more lies he demands a story from me i tell him the one about the small boy whose dad had a pigeon loft and who later as a man never felt happier than when his proposal of marriage was turned down at the top of a pigeonloft folly of monumental proportions the field marshal looks unimpressed so i go back to the beginning by the time i recovered from my melodramatic swoon in the office of the greyhaired man with the tapping key and the grey desk the train id been put on had crossed the rest of the republic steamed across the causeway to the far shore of the nearly circular sea and travelled some way across a cold waste of tundra i had another new set of clothes a uniform for the train i was in a small bunk and id wet my pants i felt terrible my head was pounding i ached in various places and the old circular pain in my chest had returned the train rattled around me i was to be a waiter one who waited the train contained various elderly officials from the republic who were on a peace mission i never did discover exactly who they were or what sort of peace they envisaged and i along with an experienced chief steward was supposed to wait on them in the diningcar serving them drinks taking their orders bringing their food luckily they were drunk for most of the time these ageing bureaucrats and my initial gaffes went mostly unnoticed as the steward trained me sometimes i had to make beds too or sweep and dust and polish in the sleeping compartments and public carriages if this was a punishment i thought then it is very mild i found out later all that had saved me from a much worse fate was the fact that i was to these people illiterate dumb and deaf because i could not understand any conversations i heard or read any papers left lying about in the cars i could be trusted and used of course i did learn something of the language but my vocabulary was mostly limited to table matters and the decoding of signs saying do not disturb and the like i did my job the train rolled through the windswept tundra passing flat towns and camps and army posts the composition of the train gradually changed as we went further from the republic the attitude of the officials on the train gradually moved from drunken relaxation to drunken tension slow columns of smoke climbed blackly on the horizon and occasionally a flight of war planes would swoop sudden and screaming across the train the officials at their tables ducked instinctively when the planes flashed over us then laughed loosened collars and nodded appreciatively at the fastreceding dots of the flight they caught my eye and snapped their fingers commandingly for more drinks first we had a couple of flat cars with two fourbarrel antiaircraft guns on them one just ahead of the engine one at the back of the guards van then later a carriage to accommodate the gun crews and an armoured wagon full of extra ammunition the military tended to keep to their own carriages and i was not called on to serve them later a couple of the public cars were taken off at a small town where sirens and klaxons blared in the distance and a large fire burned near the station the cars were replaced with armoured carriages containing troops their officers took over some of the sleeping cars still the people on the train were mostly bureaucrats the officers were polite the air changed snow fell we passed by the side of gravel roads where burnedout trucks lay at angles in ditches and the trackside and road were pitted with craters lines of troops and poorlooking civilians pushing prams loaded with household goods started to appear the soldiers going in either direction the civilians only in one the opposite to ours several times the train stopped for no apparent reason and often in a siding i would see a train pass us carrying sections of track and cranes and wagons full of small stones often the bridges over the snowcovered tundra were built on the ruins of older bridges and manned by sappers the train crossed these bridges at a crawl i got down and walked alongside to stretch my legs shivering in my thin waiters jacket almost before i realised what was happening there were no more civilians on the train only officers and men and the train crew all the carriages were armoured we had three armourplated diesel locomotives in front and another two behind there were antiaircraft flat cars every three or four carriages covered wagons holding field guns and howitzers a radio car with its own generator several flat cars with tanks and staff cars and artillery tractors many conscriptcrammed barrack cars and a dozen or so wagons full of oil drums i now served only officers they drank more and tended to damage things but were less likely to throw cutlery if one dropped dirty plates the sunlight grew less the winds colder the clouds darker and thicker we passed no more refugees only the ruins of towns and villages they looked like charcoal sketches the black of sootcovered stones and the empty white of clinging snow there were army camps sidings full of trains like ours or trains with hundreds of tanks on flat cars or gigantic guns on articulated manyaxled cars the length of half a dozen ordinary wagons we were attacked by planes the antiaircraft platforms crackled with noise and sent clouds of acrid smoke drifting down the side of the train the planes attacked with cannon shell smashing windows bombs missed us by a hundred yards i lay on the floor of the galley with the chief steward hugging a box of finest crystal glasses while the windows splintered around us we both stared in horror as a wave of red liquid spilled from round the galley door thinking one of the chefs had been hit it was only wine the damage was repaired the train rolled on into low hills under dark clouds the hills were blown clear of snow in places and though the sun now never rose very far in the sky the air became warmer i thought i could catch the breath of the ocean sometimes there was a smell of sulphur the army camps grew larger the hills gradually became mountains and i saw the first volcano one night while serving dinner i mistook it for some terrible night attack in the distance the soldiers gave it only the most cursory glance and told me not to spill the soup there were distant explosions all the time now sometimes volcanic sometimes manmade the train rolled and whined over newly repaired track crawling past long lines of greyfaced men with sledgehammers and long shovels we ran from attacking planes dashing along straights hurtling round bends carriages tipping sickeningly then plunging into tunnels braking furiously everything clattering and crashing the tunnel walls flashing with the light from our howling brakes we offloaded tanks and staff cars we took on wounded the debris of war was scattered over these hills and valleys like rotting fruit in an abandoned orchard once at night i saw the glowing remains of tanks caught in a rubyred flow the lava rolled down the valley below us like burning mud and the wrecked tanks tracks undone gun barrels tilted crazily into the air were borne down on that incandescent tide like strange products of the earth itself infernal antibodies in that red stream i still served the officers their meals though we had no wine left and our supplies of food were reduced both in quantity and quality many of the officers who had joined the train after we entered the battle zone would stare at their plates for minutes at a time gazing incredulously at what wed put before them as confused and disturbed as if wed just ladled a bowlful of nuts and bolts onto their plates our lights blazed all day the dark clouds the vast rolling billows of volcanic smoke the low sun which we could go days at a time without seeing all consipired to turn the wreckagestrewn mountains and valleys into a land of night all was uncertainty a horizon of deeper darkness might be raincloud or smoke a layer of white on a hillside or plain might be snow or ash fires above us might be burning hill forts or the side vents of great volcanoes we travelled through darkness dust and death after a while it began to seem quite natural i believe that if we had gone on the train lavaspattered dustcaked dented and patched would have accumulated so much cooled lava on its carriage roofs that from above at least it would have had a form of natural camouflage of rock an evolved skin a protective layer grown in this harsh place as though the metals of the trains own articulated body were spontaneously returning to their original forms the attack came in the midst of fire and steam the train was descending from a mountain pass in a shallow valley to one side a loose lava flow ran rapidly almost keeping pace with the train as we approached a tunnel through a spur of rock a vast rising veil of steam reared in front of us and a sound like a gigantic waterfall slowly drowned out the noise of the train on the far side of the mistfilled tunnel we saw that a glacier was blocking the lava flows way the ice sheet extended from a side valley its soiled meltwaters feeding a broad lake the lava had spilled into the lake forcing a huge steaming wave of watercooled debris in front of it the train rolled hesitantly forward towards another bank of thick mist i was making beds in one of the sleeping cars when the first small rocks started to roll down the mountainside i left that side of the carriage and watched through an open door as larger and larger boulders came crashing down the mistshrouded slope into the train bouncing up to break through windows or battering against the carriage sides one vast boulder headed straight towards me i ran down the corridor the air was full of crashes and thuds and the sound of distant confused undirected gunfire i felt the train shake then a tremendous bang obliterated every other noise the lava vaporising the lake the gunfire the small rocks whacking onto the sides and roof the entire carriage flicked to one side dashing me against the window and then over on my back as the car lights flickered and went out a breaking smashing sound seemed to come from all directions at once and the buckling carriage roof and walls batted me between them like a ball later i discovered that the carriage had broken free from the rest of the stricken train and rolled down the slope of scree towards the boiling waters of the lake the field marshals men looting and murdering their way through the cars came upon me mumbling to myself in the wreckage and so they tell me though theyd say anythingattempting to put the chief stewards head back onto what was left of his shoulders i had stuck an apple in his mouth language saved me again the men speak the same tongue as i do they took me to the field marshal he was in a small train just up the line the field marshal is very tall and heavy with long disproportionate legs and a huge backside he has a broad round face and lank hair dyed black he favours garish uniforms with a very high albedo he was sitting at a desk in his carriage listening to music on the radio and eating crystallised quinces from a small plate when i was ushered before him still half unconscious he asked me where i came from i vaguely recall telling him the truth which he found extremely funny youll be my valet he told me i like a good story at dinner i was locked in a small cell in one of the carriages while the field marshals men completed their looting and killing when i was searched my handkerchief was taken from me i saw the field marshal blowing his nose on it some days later i watched the bloodsplashed irregulars of the field marshals force come back from my old train carrying weapons and valuables a wind came up and stirred the steam in the valleys cauldron the lake was almost dry lava flow and glacier finally met in a series of tremendous explosions which sent chunks of ice and rock hundreds of feet into the air our small train escaped clanking and clattering away from the wreck on the track behind us and the elemental cataclysm beyond the field marshals train was shorter and less well equipped than the one his men had ambushed we moved only at night unless there was heavy cloud cover hiding in tunnels during the day or covering the train with camouflage netting for the first few days there was an air of tension in the train but despite a narrow escape from a strafing fighterbomber and a hairraising traverse of a great curved viaduct which was already damaged and under continuing heavyartillery attack the atmosphere amongst the motleyuniformed rabble perceptively lightened as we moved away from the scene of the ambush the volcanic activity also decreased now there were only fumeroles and geysers and small lakes of boiling mud to betray the depths of fire beneath these freezing lands it was the field marshals conceit to house the dozen or so pigs he possessed in fine state carriages while quartering his human captives in a couple of muckfilled cattle trucks at the rear of the train the pigs were bathed every week in the field marshals own whirlpool bath which took up a large part of his own carriage two soldiers were on permanent pighusbanding detail employed to keep clean the nest of sheets and blankets which the animals made of their beds bring them their meals they ate the same food as the rest of us and generally look after their welfare throwing captured soldiers into pools of boiling mud was a comparatively common occurrence and done just for sport the field marshal could tell i found these practices distressing ore he would say tjiis was how he pronounced my name ore dont you like our little games i would smile dissemble the days grew lighter dormant volcanoes gave way to low hills and savannah deprived of his boiling mud the field marshal devised a new sport he tied a short rope to a mans neck and made him run in front of the train the field marshal took the controls giggling as he opened the throttle and chased his quarry they usually lasted a half mile or so before they tripped and fell across the sleepers or tried to jump to one side in which case the field marshal just opened the throttle and dragged them along the edge of the track at the last pool of boiling mud he had a rope put round the victim and once he was cooked dragged him out covered in a baked layer of mud he had his men shovel more mud over the twisted figure then when it had dried left the resulting gnarled statue standing on the ash shore of a salty foulsmelling inland sea we were crossing the floor of a drained sea towards a city set on a great circular cliff when the bombers appeared the train increased speed heading for a tunnel set underneath the ruined city the trains few antiaircraft guns were manned three medium bombers flew straight up the track towards us not a hundred feet above the rails they started dropping their bombs trailing plane first when they were quarter of a mile away i was watching from the protruding perspex roof of the field marshals observation car where id been opening a bottle of eiswein the driver braked throwing us forward the field marshal pushed past me kicked open an emergency exit and threw himself out i followed him thudding into the side of a dusty embankment as the line of bombs stamped down the carriages like a soldiers boots on a train set the embankment bounced like a trampoline stones and fragments of train showered from the sky i lay curled up fingers in my ears we are in the abandoned city now the field marshal myself and another ten men all that survived some weapons we have and one pig the ruined city is full of echoing flag hung halls and tall stone spires we camp in a library because it is the only place we can find anything which will burn the city is built of stone or a dark heavy wood which refuses to do more than glow dull red even if ignited with powder extracted from rifle cartridges we get our water from a rusty cistern on the roof of the library and catch and eat some of the citys paleskinned nocturnal animals who flit like ghosts through the ruins looking for something they never seem to find the men complain that these shy but gullible creatures make for poor hunting we finish our meal the men pick at their teeth with bayonets one of them goes to a booklined wall and knocks down some ancient tomes from this productive face he brings them back to the fire twisting their spines and ruffling their pages so that theyll burn better i tell the field marshal about the barbarian and the enchanted tower the familiar and the wizard and the witch queen and the mutilated women he likes that one later the field marshal retires with two of his men and his last pig to his private room i clean the dishes and listen to the men complain about the monotonous diet and dull sport they might mutiny soon the field marshal has had no good ideas about what to do next i am called in to the field marshals quarters an old study i believe it contains many tables and one bed the two men leave grinning at me they close the door put this on the field marshal says smiling it is a dress a black dress he shakes it at me wiping his nose on the handkerchief he took from me when i was first captured put it on he says the pig is lying bellydown on his bed snorting and squealing its legs tied with rope to each of the beds four posts there is perfume in the air put this on the field marshal tells me i watch him put my handkerchief away i put the dress on the pig grunts the field marshal undresses he throws his uniform into an old chest he takes a large machinegun from a bookcovered table and shoves it into my hands he holds up the long chain of cartridges as though it is a thick gold necklace to go with my long black dress look at these bullets i look at the bullets they are not blanks see see how much i trust you ore do just as i say the field marshal tells me his broad face is slicked in sweat his breath is fetid i am to poke the machinegun between the cheeks of his bum while he mounts the pig this is what he wants he is already excited just at the thought he covers one hand in gun oil and climbs onto the bed over the squealing pig which he slaps between the legs with his oily hand i stand at the foot of the bed gun ready i detest this man but neither of us is stupid there were faint regular scoremarks round the shoulders of the brass cartridges they have been held in the jaws of a wrench opened and emptied of their powder probably the caps have been fired off too there is a pillow by the pigs head the field marshal lowers himself over the animal they grunt together one of his hands rests near the side of the pillow there is another gun under there i think now he says grunting i grasp the gun barrel with both hands lift it overhead and in the same movement bring it down like a sledgehammer on the field marshals head my hands my arms and my ears tell me he is dead even before my eyes do i have never felt or heard a skull smash before but the signal came quite distinctly through the metal of the gun and the perfumed air of the room the field marshals body still moves but only because the pig is jerking about i look under the pillow where human blood and pig spittle combine and find a long very sharp knife there i take it and open the chest the field marshal put his uniform in i take the pearlhandle revolver and some ammunition check the door is locked then change back into my waiters uniform i take one of the field marshals great coats as well then head for the window the windows rusty frame squeaks but not as loudly as the pig i have both feet on the windowsill when i remember the handkerchief i take that from the dead mans uniform too the city is dark and the confused wandering men who inhabit it bolt for cover as i run softly through the ruins pliocene she came back so did mrs cramond looking smaller and older he had expected mrs cramond to sell the house but she didnt instead andrea moved in with her selling the flat in comely bank which had been let out to students in the intervening years mother and daughter got on remarkably well certainly the house was big enough for them both they sold off the large basement as a selfcontained flat it was a good time after she came back hed stopped worrying about his bald patch work was going well he was still thinking about joining the other two in a partnership and his father seemed quite happy on the west coast spending most of his time at a club for pensioners where he apparently attracted the attentions of several widows it was only with the greatest reluctance he could be tempted to edinburgh for even a weekend and once there would sit looking at his watch and complaining that now he was missing his card game with the lads and now his bingo or the oldtime dancing he would look down his nose at the best food edinburghs top chefs could provide and pine volubly for the mince and tatties the others would he having and edinburgh might start to be a capital albeit in a limited way once again devolution was in the air he noticed a little excess weight just a slight jiggling at waist and upper chest whenever he ran upstairs but something that had to be dealt with he started playing squash he didnt like it though he preferred to have his own territory in a game he told people besides andrea kept beating him he took up badminton and went swimming at the commonwealth pool two or three times a week he refused to go jogging though there were limits he went to concerts andrea had returned from paris with catholic tastes she would drag him to the usher hall to listen to bach and mozart play jaque brel records when he stayed at the house in moray place buy him bessie smith albums as presents he preferred the motels and the pretenders martha davis singing total control and chrissie hynde saying fffuckoff he thought the classical stuff was having no effect until one day he found himself trying to whistle the overture to the marriage of figaro he developed a taste for complicated harpsichord pieces they made good driving music providing you played them loud enough he heard warren zevon for the first time and wished hed heard the mans album when it first came out and he found himself jumping and pogoing like a teenager to the rezillos at parties you what andrea said im going to get a hangglider youll break your neck the hell with it it looks like fun what being in an iron lung he didnt buy a hangglider he decided they werent safe enough yet he went parachuting instead andrea spent a couple of months refurbishing the house at moray place overseeing decorators and carpenters and doing a lot of the painting herself he enjoyed helping her working late into the night in old clothes covered in paint listening to her whistling in another room or talking to her while they both painted there was one night of panic when he felt a tiny lump in her breast but it proved to be harmless his eyes got tired sometimes at work looking at plans and drawings and he was putting off going to the optician because he suspected hed be told he needed glasses stewart had a brief affair with a student at the university which shona found out about she talked about leaving stewart virtually threw him out stewart came to stay at his place worried regretful he went to see shona driving to dunfermline to try to smooth things over describe stewarts distress and the way he himself had always admired them and even envied the air of calm steady affection they gave off when together it felt strange sitting there trying to persuade shona not to leave her husband because hed slept with another woman almost unreal almost comical at times it seemed ridiculous to him andrea was in paris that weekend doubtless shacked up with gustave and hed be seeing a tall blonde parachutist in edinburgh that night was it the slip of paper that made the difference the living together the children or just the belief in the vows the institution in a religion probably no thanks to him they patched it up shona would only mention it occasionally when she was drunk and with less and less bitterness over the years still it proved to him how fragile even the most secureseeming relationship would be if you went against whatever rules youd agreed oh what the hell he thought and went into partnership with the other two they found offices in pilrig and he had to find an accountant he joined the labour party he took part in letterwriting campaigns for amnesty international he sold the saab and bought a yearold gold gti he mortgaged the flat when he was cleaning out the saab before taking it to the dealer he found the white silk scarf they had used that day at the tower he hadnt wanted to leave it lying around for somebody to find so hed rinsed it in a burn when they got back down but then lost it he thought it must have fallen out of the car it turned up crumpled and grubby beneath the passenger seat he washed it and managed to get all the footprints off but the blood stain dried in a rough circle like some incompetent piece of tiedying wouldnt shift he offered it to her anyway she told him to keep it then changed her mind took it away and returned it a week later spotless nearly as good as new and monogrammed with his initials he was impressed she wouldnt tell him how she and her mother had cleaned it family secret she said he kept the scarf carefully and never wore it when he knew hed be getting really drunk in case he left it lying in some bar fetishist she told him the fabulous makeyourmindup referendum was effectively pochled rigged in english a lot of carpentry work in the old high school went to waste andrea was translating russian texts and writing articles about russian literature for magazines he knew nothing about this until he read something of hers in the edinburgh review a long piece on both sofia tolstoy and nadezhda mandelstam he was confused almost dizzy when he read it it must be the same andrea cramond she wrote as she talked and he could hear the rhythm of her speech as he read the printed words why didnt you ever tell me he asked her feeling hurt she smiled shrugged said she didnt like to boast shed written a few pieces for magazines in paris too just a sideline she was taking piano lessons again after giving them up in high school and going to night classes to study drawing and painting she was also in a partnership of sorts shed put some money into a feminist bookshop a couple of her old friends had started other women had come in on the project and now there were seven of them in a collective financial madness her brother called it she helped out in the shop sometimes he would go there first when he wanted to buy a particular book but he always felt vaguely uncomfortable in the place and rarely browsed one of the women denounced andrea at a meeting for kissing him goodbye once after hed bought some books andrea just laughed at her then felt very unsisterly she apologised for the laugh but not the kiss after shed told him this he was careful not to kiss or touch her when he visited the shop oooohh shit he said as they sat up in bed in the small hours watching the election results come in andrea shook her head reached for the black label on the bedside cabinet never mind kid have a whisky and try not to think about it think about your top rate of tax fuck that id rather have a clear conscience than a healthy bank balance tut youll have your accountant turning in his filing cabinet another returning officer announced another tory win the yahoos yahooed he shook his head the country really is going to the dogs he breathed certainly gone to the bitch andrea said swirling her whisky round in her glass and looking at the television through it brows creased well at least shes a woman he said glumly she may be a woman andrea said but she aint no fuckin sister scotland voted for labour with the snp a close third what it actually got was the right honourable margaret thatcher mp he shook his head again oooohh shit the business did well they had to turn contracts away within a year his accountant was telling him to buy a bigger house and another car but i like my little flat he complained to andrea so keep it but buy another house she told him but i can only live in one at a time anyway ive always thought it was immoral to have two houses when theres folk going homeless andrea was exasperated with him so let somebody live in the flat or in this house youre going to buy but remember wholl get all those extra taxes youll be paying if you dont do what your accountant says oh he said he sold the flat and bought a house in leith near the links and with a view of the forth from the top storey it had five bedrooms and a big double garage he bought a new gti and a range rover to keep his accountant happy and fill up the garage the fourwheel drive was useful on business trips when they had to visit sites they were doing a lot of work with firms in aberdeen that year and he dropped in on stewarts people on a later trip he ended up in bed with stewarts sister a divorced teacher he didnt ever tell stewart not absolutely certain whether he might mind or not he did tell andrea a school teacher she grinned an educational experience he told her about not wanting to say anything to stewart kid she said taking his chin in her hand and looking at him very seriously youre an idiot she helped him decorate the house bullying him into a complete new scheme he was up a ladder painting an elaborate ceiling rose one evening when he felt a sudden dizzying surge of déjà vu he put the brush down andrea was in the next room whistling away to herself he recognised the tune the river he stood on the ladder in the echoing empty room and remembered standing in a wide room full of sheetdraped furniture in the house in moray place a year earlier dressed in the same paintspotted clothes listening to her whistle in another room and feeling enormously simply happy i am a lucky bastard he thought i have so much so much around me that is good not everything i still want more i probably want more than i could handle in face i probably want things that would only make me unhappy if i had them but even thats ok thats still part of the contentment if my life was a film he thought id roll the credits now fade on this beatific smile in an empty room the man on a ladder making things better renovating improving cut print the end well he told himself it isnt a film laddie he was filled with a surge of pure joy simple delight at being where and who he was and knowing the people he did he threw the paint brush into one corner of the room jumped off the ladder and ran through to andrea she was rolling paint onto a wall god i thought youd fallen off the ladder whats the cheesy grin for i just remembered he said taking the roller out of her hand and chucking it behind him we havent christened this room well neither we have must remember the smell of paint does this to you they screwed up against the wall just for a change her shirt stuck to the wet paint she laughed until the tears ran down her face he had become a film buff during the last festival theyd both gone to more films than plays or concerts and he suddenly realised hed missed out on hundreds of films hed heard of and wanted to see he joined a film society he bought a video recorder and scoured video shops for films whenever business took him down to london hed try to cram in as many cinema visits as possible he liked almost everything he just liked going to the cinema a scottish group called the tourists had some chart success their lead singer went on to become half of the eurythmics people would ask if he was related to her no such luck he sighed there were soft voices nice bums andrea had her various flings and he tried not to feel jealous it isnt jealousy he told himself its more like envy and fear one of them may be a nicer kinder better man that i am and more loving she was out of circulation for almost two weeks once having some sort of timelapse relationship with a young lecturer from heriot watt which went from loveatfirstsight to slammed doors thrown ornaments and smashed windows over the space of twelve days he missed her while all this was going on he took the second week off and headed northwest the range rover and gti had been supplemented by a ducatti he had a oneman tent a himalayan standard sleeping bag and all the best hiking gear he took the bike roaring up to the western highlands and spent days walking alone in the hills when he got back shed finished with the lecturer he talked to her on the phone but she seemed curiously reluctant to see him he worried he didnt sleep well when he did see her a week later there was a fading yellow stain round her left eye he only noticed it because she forgot to keep her dark glasses on in the pub ah she said is that why you wouldnt see me he asked her dont do anything she said please its all over and i could happily throttle him but you lay a finger on him and ill never speak to you again we do not all he told her coldly resort to violence quite that quickly you might have trusted me ive been worried sick the past week then he wished he hadnt said that because she broke down and hugged him and cried and he realised something of what she must have gone through he felt mean and selfish for adding to her cares he stroked her hair while she sobbed into his chest come on home lass he said to her he took to the hills a few more times using the occasions when she went to paris to get away from edinburgh and out to islands and the mountains stopping off to see his father on the way there and back he was camped one sunset on the slopes of beinn a chaisgein mor there was a bothy nearby but he preferred to pitch the tent if it was good weather looking out over fionn loch and the small causeway hed be crossing tomorrow to the mountains on the far side when he suddenly thought just as he hadnt been to paris in all these years neither had gustave ever visited edinburgh ahhh maybe it was just the effects of the last joint but in that instant though they were a thousand miles apart and all those unshared years away he felt curiously close to the frenchman hed never met he laughed into the cool highland air the breeze moved the flanks of the tent like breath one of his earliest memories was of mountains and an island his mum and dad his youngest sister and he had gone to arran for their holidays he had been three years old as the steamer paddled down the glittering river towards the distant blue mass of the island his dad had pointed out the sleeping warrior the way the mountain range at the north end of the island looked like a helmed soldier lying over the landscape mighty and fallen hed never forgotten that sight or the medley of accompanying sounds calling gulls the slapslap of the steamers paddles an accordion band playing somewhere aboard people laughing it also gave him his first nightmare his mum had to wake him up in the bed he was sharing with his sister in the guest house hed been crying and whimpering in his dream the great stone warrior had woken up and come slowly terribly crushingly to kill his parents mrs and ms cramond made the most of their big house they had social evenings they entertained their parties became moderately celebrated they would put people up poets giving readings at the university a visiting painter trying to sell some work to a gallery a writer the book shop had invited to a signing session some evenings there would be a whole circle of people he didnt recognise at the place they usually looked less welloff than andreas friends and tended to eat and drink a lot more mrs cramond spent half the day it seemed baking cakes and quiches and bread he worried that even in her widowhood mrs cramond was still spending all her time in her kitchen making things for people but andrea told him not to be stupid her mother loved seeing people enjoy something shed made he accepted this but watched some of the itinerant denizens of the house stuff cakes and the odd bottle of wine into coat pockets with a nagging sense of vicarious exploitation these people are intellecutals he told andrea once youre starting a salon youre becoming a goddamned blue stocking she just smiled andrea bought a litter of four siamese cats from a friend one died she renamed the two males franklin and phineas and the sleek female fat freddie damned nostalgia he called it somebody gave mrs cramond a king charles spaniel she called it cromwell just getting ready to go round to the house was enough to make him feel good driving there would produce an almost childlike thrill in him the house was another home a warm and hospitable place sometimes especially when hed had a few to drink he had to fight an absurd feeling of sentimentality at the bond between mother and daughter he added a citroen cx to the gti and the range rover then sold all three and bought an audi quattro he went out to yemen on business and stood once in the ruins that had been mocha on the shore of the red sea he saw the warm wind from africa move the sand grains round his feet and sensed the steady harsh indifference of the desert its calm continuance the spirit of those ancient lands he stroked his hand over the ageworn pitted stones and watched where the waves fell blue exploding white fists of silk thunder on the open golden palm of the shore things went on lennon got shot dylan got religion he could never decide which depressed him most he was working in yemen when the israelis invaded southern lebanon because a man was shot in london and when the argentinians went ashore at port stanley he didnt learn that his brother sammy was with the task force until after it had sailed when he got back to edinburgh he argued with his friends sure the argentinians ought to have the bloody islands he said but how the hell could revolutionary parties support a fascist juntas own little piece of imperialism why did there always have to be a right side and wrong one why not just say a curse on both your houses his brother came back unhurt he still had arguments about the war with sammy his dad his radical friends by the time the next election came round he was starting to think maybe his pals had been right after all awww come on he said despairing another healthy labour majority wiped out votes leeched by the sdp another surprise conservative win the pundits were predicting the tories would get less of the vote than last time but increase their majority by a hundred seats perhaps more aww fuck this is becoming monotonous andrea said reaching for the whisky margaret thatcher appeared on the television screen glowing with victory off he screamed hiding under the sheets andrea stabbed at the remote control unit the screen went dark oh god he said from beneath the sheets and dont talk to me about my top rate of tax never said a word kid tell me its all just a bad dream its all just a bad dream really is it hell no its real i was just telling you what you wanted to hear those idiots he fumed to stewart another four years with that dingbat in charge christ alfuckingmighty a senile clown surrounded by a gang of xenophobic reactionaries unelected xenophobic reactionaries stewart pointed out ronald reagan had just been elected for another term half the people who could have voted in the election hadnt why dont i get a vote he raged my dad lives spitting distance from coulport faslane and the holy loch if that buffoons liverspotted finger hits the button my old mans dead probably all of us are you me andrea shona and the kids everybody i love so why the fuck dont i get a vote no annihilation without representation stewart said thoughtfully then still on the subject of unelected reactionaries what dyou think the politbureau is a fucking sight more responsible than that squad of gungho shitheads aye fair enough your round the house at moray place residence of mrs and ms cramond was now quite well known especially at festival time you couldnt walk into the place without tripping over some upandcoming artist or an authoritative new voice in scottish fiction or some moody kids with acne who dragged synths and practice amps from room to room and commandeered the revox for days at a time the last chance salon he called it andrea had settled down to a life she found thoroughly fine still working in the shop translating russian books writing articles playing the piano drawing and painting socialising and partying visiting pals holidaying in paris going to films and concerts and plays with him and to the opera and ballet with her mother meeting her one day at the airport after another jaunt to paris he watched her she walked confidently head up out of customs she wore a broad bright red hat brilliant blue jacket red skirt blue tights and shiny red leather boots her eyes sparkled her skin glowed her face broadened into a wide smile when she saw him she was thirtythree years old and she had never looked better he felt at that instant an odd amalgam of emotions love certainly but also envious admiration he envied her her happiness her assurance her calm way with the troubles and traumas of life the way she treated everything as one might treat a child making up a story the child really believed in not patronisingly but with the same mockserious frown the same mixture of ironic detachment and affection even love he remembered his talks with the advocate and could see something of the old mans personality in andrea youre a lucky woman andrea cramond he thought as she took his arm there in the airport lounge not because of me and not as lucky as me in one way because i have more of your time than anybody else but otherwise let it go on he thought dont let the idiots blow up the world and dont let anything else terrible happen steady kid who are we talking to here he sold the bike soon afterwards his father fell and broke his hip that winter he looked very small and frail when he visited him in hospital and much older in the spring he needed a hernia operation and fell again not long after hed left hospital he broke a leg and a collar bone have tae take mair waiter with it he told his son and refused to come and live with him in edinburgh because his friends were here morag and her husband also offered to take him in and jimmy wrote from australia to say why didnt he come out for a few months but the old man didnt want to move from his own area he was in hospital for longer this time and when they let him out he couldnt put back on the weight hed lost a homehelp came round every morning she found him apparently asleep by the fire one day a small smile on his face it had been his heart too the doctor said he probably hadnt felt a thing he found himself organising everything not that there was very much to do his brothers and sisters all made it to the funeral even sammy on compassionate leave and jimmy all the way from darwin he had asked andrea if she minded not coming she said no and understood once it was all over it was good to go back to her back to edinburgh and work he never did entirely lose the feeling of numbness which crept over him when he thought about the old man and though he shed no tears he knew hed loved him and did not feel guilty about that dry grief ah my poor orphan andrea said and was his comfort the company expanded more people joined they bought grand new offices in the new town he argued with the others about their employees salaries they should all have a share he said they should all be partners what the other two said a workers collective they smiled tolerantly why the hell not he said they were both sdp supporters worker participation was one of the ideas the alliance liked they said no but started a bonus scheme then one day andrea got off a paris flight and she wasnt smiling and his guts seemed to lurch oh no he thought what is it whats wrong she wouldnt talk about it whatever it was she said there was nothing wrong but she looked very solemn and thoughtful most of the time laughed little and would often look up distracted say sorry and have to have repeated to her the last thing somebody had said he worried he thought about phoning gustave in paris and asking what the hell was wrong with her what had happened there he didnt call he fretted and tried to entertain her taking her out to dinner to see a film or over to see stewart and shona he tried to organize a nostalgic evening eating at the loon fung near his old flat in canonmills then taking a taxi to the canny mans but nothing worked he couldnt decide what it was mrs cramond and he worried together and individually tried to get the truth out of her it was the mother who did though only after three months and another two visits to paris andrea told her mother what was wrong then went back to france again mrs cramond rang him up ms she told him gustave had multiple sclerosis why didnt you tell me he asked her i dont know she said listlessly eyes dull voice flat i dont know and i dont know what to do hes got nobody to look after him not properly when he heard those words a chill settled in him poor guy he thought and meant it but once found himself thinking its so slow why couldnt he die quickly and hated himself for the thought another argument during the strike he refused to cross a miners picket line the company lost a contract andrea spent more and more time in paris less people came to the house at moray place now she looked tired whenever she came back from france and though she was still slow to anger and still easy with people she was slow to laugh now as well and guarded about taking any enjoyment at face value when they made love he thought he could detect an extra tenderness in her and a sense of how precious and impermanent such moments were it was less fun than it used to be but somehow the act had gained an extra resonance become in itself a sort of language sometimes when she was away in paris he would get lonely sitting in the big house by himself reading or watching the television or working at the drawing board if hed had less than the legal limit to drink he would take the quattro out and drive to north queensferry to sit beneath the great dark bridge listening to the water lap against the stones and the trains rumble overhead he would smoke a joint or just breathe the fresh air if he felt pity for himself it was only one timid tentative part of his mind that felt so there was another part of him which seemed like a hawk or an eagle hungry and cruel and fanatically keeneyed selfpity lasted a matter of seconds in the open then the bird of prey fell on it tearing it ripping it the bird was the real world a mercenary dispatched by his embarrassed conscience the angry voice of all the people in the world that vast majority who were worse off than he was just common sense he discovered to his knowing almost righteous dismay that the bridge was not painted endtoend over a neat threeyear period it was done piecemeal and the cycle lasted anything between four and six years another myth bites the dust he thought par for the course andrea was away in paris almost half the time now she had another life there another set of friends hed met some of them when theyd come over to edinburgh a magazine editor a woman who worked in unesco a lecturer who taught at the sorbonne nice people they were all friends of gustave too i should have gone over he told himself i ought to have gone made friends too late why am i so stupid i can design you a structure to withstand hundredfoot waves for thirty years or more and make it as sturdy and safe as any other designer could for the weight and the budget but i cant see my hand in front of my face when it comes to doing sensible things with my own life if there is a design to my own existence it escapes me what was that old family song the weavers answer yeah well wheres mine jimmy he bought a toyota mr as well as the latest model quattro he started flying lessons he built up a sound system based on scottishmade components he bought the minolta camera as soon as it came out added a cd player to the hifi and thought about buying a power boat he went sailing with some of andreas old pals from the marina at port edgar on the south bank of the forth upstream from the two great bridges he grew restless with the quattro and the mr there was always some better car a ferrari or an aston or a lambo or some limited edition porsche or whatever he decided to stop competing and go for timeless elegance instead he found a welllookedafter mk ii jaguar through a local dealer he sold the audi and the toyota he had the jag reupholstered in red connelly leather a specialist tuner dismantled the engine blueprinted it changed the cams pistons valves and carbs and fitted electronic ignition they completely revised the suspension fitted beefier brakes new wheels and asymmetric tyres plus a new gearbox to handle all the extra torque he had it fitted with four new seat belts a laminated windscreen more powerful lights electric windows tinted glass a sunroof and antitheft devices hed have trusted a chieftain tank to but which he kept forgetting about the car spent three days at another specialist firm having a new sound system installed complete with cd player it can make your ears bleed he told people i havent even found all the speakers yet half the boot seems to be amplifier i dont know which is going to give way under the vibration first my ear drums or the outside paint job hed had it rustproofed and repainted twelve coats handpainted good heavens stewart said when he told him how much the ice equipment had cost to install you can buy a new car for that i know he agreed you could buy a new car for the cost of a years insurance and a new set of tyres for the thing as well more money than sense nothing seemed to work quite perfectly the car had annoying rattles the house cd player had an intermittent fault the camera had to be replaced and almost all of the records he bought seemed to have scratches on them his dishwasher kept flooding the kitchen he found himself becoming short tempered with people and traffic jams infuriated him a sort of pervasive impatience seemed to fill him and a callousness he could not evade he gave money to live aid all right but his first thought when he heard of the band aid record had been about the revolutionary adage which compared giving to charity under capitalism to putting a bandaid on a cancer the festival couldnt even revive his spirits andrea was there for part of it but even when she was with him in the next seat at a hall or cinema or in the passengers seat in the car or beside him in bed she wasnt really with him not all of her part of the womans thoughts were not free not for him she still didnt want to talk about it he heard circuitously that there were complications to gustaves ms he tried to bring the subject up but she would not cooperate it dismayed him there were things they could not talk about it was his own fault he never had wanted to talk about gustave you couldnt change the rules now he had dreams about the dying man in the other city and sometimes thought he could see him lying in a hospital bed surrounded by machines andrea went back to paris halfway through the festival he couldnt face the cultural equivalent of a thousandbomber raid alone so he borrowed a friends bonneville and took off for skye it rained the company went from strength to strength but he was starting to lose interest what in the end am i really doing he asked himself just another fucking brick in the wall just another cog in the machine if a little better oiled than most i make money for oil companies and their shareholders and for governments that spend it on weapons that can kill us all a thousand times over instead of just five hundred i dont even operate at the level of an ordinary decent worker like my dad did im a fucking boss i employ i have real drive and initiative or i used to i actually make it all run just that little bit better than it might if i wasnt here he cut the whisky out again spent some time drinking only mineral water he gave up dope almost completely once he realised he wasnt enjoying it any more the only time he did smoke was when he went over to see stewart then it was like old times he started to take coke regularly it got to be a monday morning ritual and the natural start to an evening out until one night he was watching the television news and cutting up a couple of generous lines before he went out drinking there was a followup report on the african famine being shown he looked away from a child with dead eyes and skin like a bats wing he looked down to the mirror on the table he was hunkered over and saw his own face looking back at him through the shining granules of white powder hed stuffed three hundred pounds worth of this stuff up his nose the previous week he threw the razor down shit he said to himself a bad year he told himself just another bad year he started smoking cigarettes he finally accepted he needed glasses the bald patch on his head was the size of a bath plughole he seemed to feel the restlessness of youth and the lastchance urgency of age at the same time he was thirtysix years old but he felt like eighteen going on seventytwo in november andrea told him she was thinking of going to stay in paris to look after gustave they might have to get married if his family insisted she hoped he understood im sorry kid she said dull voiced yeah he said me too ah shit i suppose i canny really complain ive had a good innings and all that stuff but jeez i dont feel like giving it all up right now once a swordsman always a swordsman i gess bloody few get to this age let me tell ye im ecxeptional its a fact suppose i might no have made it without the wee bam on the showlder but i dont let him know that hes uppity enough without me swelling his head even more so still he didnt come up with a solution for our little problem though namely growing old wee bugger wasnt that clever anyway here i am sitting up in the bed watching the closedcircuit tv screens and thinking dirty thoughts trying to get a hardon im remembering angharienne and what we used to do the stuff we used to get up to yed hardly credit it but when youre young youll try anything ah well youre only young once like they say the wee familiar disagrees with this but hes yet to prove otherwise i suppose three hunner odd years is no a bad score but bugger it i still dont feel ready to die but it looks like ive got no choyce in the matter the familiar tried a few things no choyce for him either hes stuck with me but nothings worked so far and i think the wee bastards run out of ideas trust him to bugger things up now when i could really do with his help he says hes still got some irons in the fire whitever thats supposed to mean either giving up golf or thinking about torchering somebody wee barns sitting on the table by my bed all shrivelled up and grey looking so he is he hasnt sat on my showlder since we got the flying castle he calls it a ship but then he likes confusing things calls the bedroom the ships bridge too what happened was we got back to the sorcerer whod helped me get into the underworld and the two of them the sorcerer and the wee familiar had a battle hammer and tongs stuff it was and i had to watch from on corner frozen stiff from some spell the bloody familiar had cast over us eventually the familiar won but then just when i might have got rid of the wee bugger he found he couldnt do what he wanted to which was take over the body of the sorcerer seems that wasnt possible against the rules sort of thing i could bring him out of the underworld but he couldnt take over a living body had to stay in an inannimate object that was him totally scunnered and bombedout trapped in the wee familiarbody so he was and no way out of it he got all upset and started breaking up the sorcerers magic celler and i thought he might start on me for a while but he didnt he calmed down after a while like and came back to my showlder and released me from the spell explained that we really were stuck with each other for good or ill and wed both just have to make the best of it this time maybe it was for the best you never know doubt id have lived this long without him some of his ideas were pretty smart his first was to go back to see that young witch id been doing the business with no long before i rescued the familiar from hades angharienne that was her name the familiar thought me and her might be able to come to some sort of arrangement he said she was pretty duebious at first thought the familiar was trying to pull a fast one going to try and take over her body or something like that but they had this dead complicated talk and they both did some magic and went into one of them trances dead bloody boring that was they woke up all smiles and agreement familiar told me that we were going to have a trial troylistic arrangement ok i said as long as theres nothing dirty involved anyway i gess that was how i got be an old swordsman what are you doing trying to raise the dead already shut up you none of your business of course it is my business what if you have a heart attack or something well why no magic up one of them whouris for me then certainly not youd be sure to peg out then just stop that its so unseemly in a man of your age your brain may still be retarded but your years are advanced its my willy and its my life its my life too and you cant play with one if it means playing with the other as well have a sense of proportion man och im no really wanting a wank just to see if i can get it up still go on show us a dirty video eh no keep watching the screens what for just keep watching you never know what might happen all is not yet lost we should have kept looking for that fountain of youth so we should ah youd probably just have pissed in it aw fuck i says and just lie there with the arms folded feeling sorry for myself the flying castle is sitting on this hillside we landed it here weeks ago after visiting this planit where they claim to be able to make people live for ever whatever they did it didnt work on me and the wee familiar they said theyd no ecxperience with something like us a swordsman and a familiar i wanted to go to one of these fancy cities here on earth and take some of those magic drugs theyve got nowdays a few weeks of fun burning yourself up like a young man then you pop your clogs quick and painless and youve had a lot of fun in the innterim but the familiar wasnt having it pilated the castle here to the middle of nowhere on this cold and windy hillside and dismissed all the guards and servants and that and even shooed offa couple of the greatgrandchildren and gave away half the magic gear that we had crystal balls that fortel the future enchanted submachineguns magic missiles and that sort of stuff seemed to want to give everybody the impression we were getting ready to die but didnt give all the good stuff away kept the flying castle itself and some bits and pieces like a jacket that flies the universal translator and a few tonnes of invisible platinum in the hold even found some new batteries for the old dirk the knife missile as the familiar calls it its batteries ran out about a century ago and it was just a no very sharp knife after that what i kept for sentimental reasons wee familiar was dead snooty about it at the time just a cheap copy i told you so it said but it found new batteries for it just reently and put it in charge of security guarding the flying castles door fuck knows why maybe the familiars getting ecsentric in its old age still canny stop thinking about the wife popped her clogs nearly half a century ago but i can still see her bonny face like shed just croaked yesterday turned out she wasnt as young as she looked never did find out how old she was but the familiar thinks she was a thousand or so at least she wouldnt grow old slowly like even witches are meant to did the magic on herself so that she stayed looking just out of her teens until right to the end burned herself out staying young cant say i blamed her but it catches up on ye in the end she became a statue a wee dark wooden carving all hard and dark and oldlooking left instructions she was to be planted in this forest near where she was born where shes become a wee tree no long since the familiar says the tree will probably go from being wee and shrivelled to big and tall and younger and then shrink like its going back in time until it becomes a sede and after that even it doesnt know whatll happen it seems sad when it tells me all this because it knows that when i die when we both die because it cant live without me itll just disinntigrate into dust and thatll be that no even an existence in the underworld for it after that tough titty ill probably no even be allowed in to hell after what happened the last time i was there the wee familiar still chuckles when we talk about the old days and me rescuing him seems they had to alter the whole rejeem down there after that bloke charon turned into stone couple of characters called virgil and danty took over temperarily and theyre still there fuck knows what sort of receptcion ill get when i turn up at the perilly gates or whatever it is theyve got now probably let me in all right but have something really nasty arranged ill bet ye can see why im no so keen on kicking the bucket anyway ahha ahha whit i thought you were supposed to be watching the screens i am i am i just aw wait a minute who the fucks that no one who wishes us well thats for sure aw shite coming down the hillside theres this muscley punter with blond hair and a fucking great sword bloody great broad shoulders and sort of metal straps all over his body big boots and a wee sort of loin cloth thing some sort of helmet on his head with a wolves head on it snarling like i sit up in bed feeling scared already im dead stiff these days all ecsept the bit id like to be and what with the roomatism and that and the way my hand shakes nowdays and needing glasses and so on i really dont fancy squaring up to some young fit warrior with a dirty great sword whit happened to the fucking total exclusion zone then eh i thought people were meant to fall asleep if they tried to come up to the flying castle hmm the familiar says must be that helmet hes wearing probably contains some neuroscreening device lets see if the laser can deal with the fellow the big berr with the muscles marches on down the slope staring up at the castle big blond brows knitted together muscles rippling the big muckle sword swinging suddenly he looks surprised and starts swinging the sword even faster so its a blur all around him next thing i know theres a flash and the screen goes dead aw naw whit now im trying to get out of bed but my old muscles seem to have turned to jeely or something and im sweating like a pig the screen comes alive again showing the door of the castle from the inside hmm the wee familiar says again as though its dead impressed or something not bad some sort of limited prescience involved there ill warrant he knew the laser was about to fire on him probably only a few seconds into the future but enough hes going to be difficult to stop nice trick with the laser too probably some sort of mirrorfield in the sword reflecting the light back into the cameras might have been coincidence but if not then it was very cheeky quite an adversary what i canny move do something fuck being a wonderful bloody adversary get us away from that bastard get the castle moving not enough time im afraid the wee familiar says calm as ye like lets see if the knife missile can stop him fuckin marvellous is that all weve got between us and him im afraid so that and a couple of not very intelligent or strong airlocks is that it you stupid bastard why the fuck did you let all the guards go and the error of judgement i suppose old son the wee familiar says and yawns he hops onto my shoulder and we both watch the inside of the castle door the tip of a sword appears through the metal and cuts a circle out of it it falls to the floor and the big blond bastard steps through fields the familiar says quietly nodding by my ear that airlock door had monofilament reinforcing cutting it cold like that would need some pretty neat bladefields quite some weapon the lads equipped himself with though it could be the other round of course wheres that wee bastard of a dirk im shouting now bloody petrified ready to shite the bed so i am the big blond bastard is tramping down the castle hallway looking dead wary but all determined like and swinging the sword like he means business he looks to one side and glowers the wee dirk comes at him but far too slow almost like it was hesitating blondy keeps glowering at it the dirk stops in mid air then just falls to the floor and rolls away into a corner aw naw im shouting told you it was a cheap copy they had to equip it with an iff circuit probably our chums sword or that helmet fed it a fake friend signal the real things are free agents smart enough to make up their own minds which is why theyre quite useless for the likes of you or me of course stop talkin like a fuckin arms salesman and dae something i scream at the wee familiar but it just shrugs its wee grey shoulders and sighs too late old son im afraid youre afraid i yell at it shouting into its face youre no the one theyre waiting fur doon in hades pal three hunner years theyve had to think up somethin really sore and nasty fur me three hunner fuckin years oh calm down man cant you face death with some dignity bugger dignity ah want tae live hmm good the wee familiar says as the big blond bastard disappears from the screen theres a banging noise somewhere outside the door of the bedroom and the floor shakes aw naw i wet the bed just like that canny stop myself mammy daddy the door bursts open the big blond bastard stands there filling the doorway hes even bigger than he looked on the screen fucking sord must be nearly as long as i am i cringe doon in the bed whole body shaking the warrior has to duck as he comes through the door to avoid banging the wolfhead helmet on the roof whwhwhats yer problem big filla i says now problem moy son the bloke says and comes up to the bed bloody manmountain he raises the sord up over me aw geese a brek pal please ye can have anythin ye wallip shock like nothing ive ever felt in my life before like god slappin ye or a billion volts going through ye stars and light and dizzyness i can see that sword falling towards me flashing in the light see the look on the big bastardin warriors face and hear a wee noise at

library of a mind having been faithfully transmitted there is even the remotest possibility that your pamphlet of a consciousness hasnt come through undamaged anyway back to business the ships circuits have finally woken up to the fact that theres an interloper aboard they wont accept that youre the rightful owner and i still need a little more time to rearrange the telepathic circuits in this ridiculous helmet so lets depart before the ship scuttles itself that involves a thermonuclear explosion as i recall which i doubt even i or that wonderful sword youre holding can protect you

realised fay fifes name was a pun you know where are you from ahm fay fife he told stewart shaking his head aye stewart said ah ken god im so stupid sometimes he breathed gazing sadly at his can of export aye steward noded ah ken he said and rose to turn the album over he looked out through the window to the view of the town and the distant bare trees of the glen his watch said it was getting dark already he supposed they were near the solstice now he drank some more hed had five or six cans and it looked like hed have to stay over with stewart or get a train back to edinburgh a train he thought he hadnt been on one for years it would be good to take a train from dunfermline and go over the old bridge he could throw out a coin and wish that gustave would kill himself or that andrea would find herself pregnant and want to bring her child up in scotland or cut it out you idiot he told himself stewart sat down again they had talked about politics theyd agreed if they were sincere about what they said they believed in theyd be out in nicaragua fighting for the sandinistas theyd talked about old times old music old friends but never about her theyd talked about star wars sdi which britain had just signed up for it wasnt that distant a subject for them they both knew people at the university who were working on optical computer circuits the pentagon was interested theyd talked about the new koestler chair of parapsychology at the university and about a programme theyd both seen on television a few weeks earlier on lucid dreaming and also about the hypotheses of causative formation he said sure it was interesting but he could remember when von danikens theories had been interesting theyd talked about a story mentioned on television and in the press that week about an émigré russian engineer living in france whod crashed his car in england a lot of money had been found in the car and he was under suspicion of having committed a crime in france he had apparently gone into a coma but the doctors seemed to think he was faking devious bastards us engineers he told stewart they had talked in fact about almost everything except what he really wanted to talk about stewart had tried to bring the subject up but each time he had found himself sliding away from it the programme on lucid dreaming had come up because it was the last thing he had had an argument with andrea about the causative formation hypothesis because it was probably the next thing theyd argue about stewart hadnt pressed him on the subject of andrea and gustave maybe he just needed to talk about anything howre the kids anyway he asked stewart had something to eat and asked him if he wanted anything but he didnt feel hungry they had another joint he had another can they talked the afternoon darkened stewart felt tired after a while and said hed have a snooze hed set the alarm and be up to make the tea later they could head out for a pint after theyd eaten something he listened to some old jefferson airplane on the headphones but the record was scratched he looked through his friends collection of books drinking from the can and finishing off the last joint finally he went and stood by the window looking out across the slates to the park the glen the ruined palace and the abbey the light was slowly going from the halfclouded sky streetlights were on and the roads were filled with parked or slowly moving cars doubtless full of christmas shoppers lightsapped skies hung over the glen he wondered what this place looked like when the palace was still a place for kings and the kingdom of fife a small place now but big enough then rome had been small too to start with and it hadnt stopped her what would the world have been like if some part of scotland before such a state existed had blossomed the way rome did no there wasnt the background the legacy of history here at that time athens rome alexandria they had libraries when all we had were hill forts not savages but not civilised either by the time we were ready to play our part it was already too late we were always too soon or too late and the best things weve done have been for other people well sentimental scottishism he guessed what about class consciousness rather than nationalism well indeed how could she do it never mind that this was her home that this was where her mother lived her earliest friends where she had so many of her earliest memories formed and her character how could she leave what she had now forget about him he would willingly leave himself out of the equation but she had so much to do and to be how could she do it selfsacrifice the woman behind the man looking after him putting herself second it went against all she believed in he still hadnt been able to talk to her properly about it his heart beat faster he put the can down thinking he didnt really know what it was he wanted to say only that he wanted to talk to her to hold her to just be with her and tell her everything he felt for her he ought to tell her all hed ever felt about gustave about her about himself he should be totally honest with her so that at least she would know exactly what he felt be under no illusions about him it was important damn it he finished the can put the roach into it then folded the red tin neatly a little beer dribbled onto his hand from the folded corner of aluminium he wiped his hands i ought to tell her i ought to talk to her now what was she doing this evening they were at home werent they yes they both are something i was invited to but i wanted to see stewart ill call her he went to the phone engaged probably another hourlong call to gustave even when she was here she still seemed to spend half her time with him he put the phone down and paced the room his heart thumping his hands sweating he needed a pee he went to the bathroom washed his hands afterwards gargled with some mouthwash he felt all right he didnt even feel stoned or drunk he tried the phone again same signal he stood at the window the jag was visible if he stood close to the glass and looked right down a white curved ghost on the dark street he looked at his watch again he felt fine perfectly straight just ready for a drive why not he thought take the albino jaguar off into the gloaming head for the motorway and blast over the road bridge with the sounds cranked up high as theyll go an arrogant grin and a blast of aural pain for whatever poor bastard takes your toll sheeit very fear and loathing very hunter s thompsonish belay that laddy damn book always did make you drive just that little bit faster afterwards your own fault for listening to white rabbit a few minutes ago thats whats done it no forget about driving youve had too many aw hell everybody does it at this time of year damn it i drive better drunk than most people do sober just take it easy you can make it isnt as though you dont know the road after all drive real careful in the town just in case some kid runs out in front of you and your reactions are affected then nice and easy on the motorway legal limit or even less none of this blowing away the local boyracer in his capri or giving nasty surprises to glassyeyed bmw drivers just dont get intimidated just maintain concentration dont think about red sharks or white whales testing the suspension over concrete walls or controlled drifts round an entire clover leaf just take it easy listen to the sounds auntie joanie maybe something soothing not soporific but steady not too exciting not the sort of the thing the right foot just hears and floors on nothing like that he tried the phone one last time he went through to see stewart he was sleeping quietly and rolled over when he looked in away from the hall lights glow he wrote him a note and left it by the alarm clock he took up his old biking jacket and the monogrammed scarf and let himself out of the flat getting out of town took a while there had been a shower the streets were wet he was playing steeltown by big country as he edged the jaguar through the traffic it seemed appropriate in carnegies birthplace he still felt fine he knew he ought not to be driving and he dreaded to think what hed register on a breathlyser but one undrunk part of him was watching and evaluating his driving and hed do hed get by providing his concentration didnt slip and he wasnt unlucky he wouldnt do it again he told himself as he at last found a clear stretch of road heading for the motorway just this time because it is important after all and ill be very careful it was dual carriageway here he let the car leap forward grinning as his back pressed into the seat oh i just love to hear that engine snarl he murmured to himself he ejected the big country tape from the nakamichi frowning at himself for exceeding the speed limit he let the cars nose drop again slowed something not too raucous and adrenalinencouraging for the approach and traverse of the great grey bridge bridge over troubled water he thought to himself grinning havent had that in the car for yonks jimmy he had lone justice and los lobos how will the wolf survive on the other side of the tape he picked it up glanced at it as he approached the motorway itself no he wanted the texican boys right now and he didnt want to wait for it to spool back just have to be the pogues then rum sodomy the lash fuck nice steady driving tunes nothing wrong with a bit of raucousness keeps you awake better just dont try to keep pace with the music all the time there we go he joined the m heading south the sky was dark blue above the patchy clouds a very mild evening hardly even cool the road was still wet he sang along to the pogues and tried not to go too fast he felt thirsty there was usually a can of coke or irn bru in the door pocket but hed forgotten to replace the last one he was forgetting too much these days he put his main lights on after a few people flashed him the motorway crested a hill between inverkeithing and rosyth and he could see the road bridges aircraft lights sudden white flashes on the spires of the two great towers shame really hed preferred the old red lights he pulled over into the nearside lane to let a sierra past and watched the taillights disappear thinking you wouldnt get away with that normally chum he settled back in the seat his fingers on the small steering wheel beating in time to the music the road headed for a stepped cutting through the rocks which formed the small peninsula the sign for north queensferry flashed by he might have gone down there to stand under the rail bridge again but there was no point in making this journey any longer than it had to be that would be tempting fate or irony at least what am i doing this for he thought will this really make any difference i hate people who drunkdrive why the hell am i doing it he thought about heading back taking the road down to north queensferry after all there was a station there he could park take the train in either direction but hed passed the last turnoff before the bridge the hell with it maybe hed stop on the far side at dalmeny park there rather than risk this expensive paint job in the prechristmas edinburgh rush come back for the damn thing in the morning and remember to set all the alarms the road cleared the cutting through the hills he could see south queensferry the marina at port edgar the vat sign of the distillery there the lights of hewlett packards factory and the rail bridge dark in the evenings last skyreflected light behind it more lights the hound point oil terminal theyd had a subcontract on and further away the lights of leith the old rail bridges hollow metal bones looked the colour of dried blood you fucking beauty he thought what a gorgeous great device you are so delicate from this distance so massive and strong closeup elegance and grace perfect form a quality bridge granite piers the best shipplate steel and a neverending paint job he glanced back at the roadway of the bridge as it rose slowly to its gentle suspended summit the surface was a little damp but nothing to worry about no problems he wasnt going all that fast anyway staying in the nearside lane looking over at the rail bridge downstream a light winked at the far end of the island under the rail bridges middlesection one day though even youll be gone nothing lasts maybe thats what i want to tell her maybe i want to say no of course i dont mind you must go i cant grudge the man that youd have done the same for me and i would for you just a pity thats all go well all survive maybe some good he was aware of the truck in front pulling out suddenly he looked round to see a car in front of him it was stopped abandoned in the nearside lane he sucked his breath in stamped on the brakes tried to swerve but it was too late there was an instant when his foot was jammed down as hard as it would go on the brake and when hed pulled the wheel over as far as it would go in one twist and he knew there was nothing else he could do he would never know how long that instant was only that he saw the car in front was an mg and that there was nobody in it a ripple of relief on a tsunami of fear and that he was going to hit it hard he caught a glimpse of the number plate vs something wasnt that a west coast number the octagonal mg sign on the boot of the brokendown car floated closer to the jaguars mascotless snout as it dipped dug in and started to skid all at once he tried to go limp to relax and just go with it but with his foot jamming the brake to the floor that wasnt possible he thought you foo the customised white jaguar registration number fs smashed into the rear of the mg the man driving the jaguar was thrown forward and up as it somersaulted the seat belt held but the small steering wheel came pistoning up to meet his chest like a circular sledgehammer low rolling hills under a dark sky the undersurface of the lowering ruddy clouds seems to mirror the gentle contours of the land below the air is thick and heavy it smells of blood it is soggy underfoot but not with water whatever great battle was fought here over these hills that seem to stretch for ever it drenched the land with blood there are bodies everywhere of every animal and every colour and race of human and many others besides i find the small dark man eventually attending the corpses he is dressed in rags we last met in mocca occam something like that when he was beating the waves with his iron flail now it is bodies dead bodies a hundred lashes each if theres anything left to lash i watch him for a while he is calm methodical beating each body exactly one hundred times before proceeding to the next one he shows no preference concerning species sex size or colour he beats each with the same determined vigour on the back if possible but otherwise just as they lie only if they are fully armoured does he touch them bending stiffly to pull back a visor or disconnect a cheststrap hello he says i stand some distance away in case he is under orders to whip everybody on the field regardless remember me i ask him he strokes his bloody lash cant say i do he says i tell him about the city by the sea he shakes his head no not me he says he digs into his filthy robes for a moment then comes out with a small rectangle of card he wipes it with one strip of his rags then holds it out i step forward warily take it he nods i was told to give it to you here he leans forward i take the card step back it is a playing card the three of diamonds whats this for i ask him he just shrugs wipes his flailhand on one tattered sleeve dont know who gave it to you how did they know is it really necessary to ask all these questions he says shaking his head i am shamed i suppose not i hold up the playing card thanks youre welcome he says i had forgotten how soft his voice was i turn to go then look back at him just one more thing i nod at the bodies littering the ground like fallen leaves what happened here what happened to all these people he shrugs they didnt listen to their dreams he says then turns back to his task i set off again for the distant line of light which fills the horizon like a streak of white gold i left the city in the dried sea basin and walked the railway track away from it heading in the same direction as the field marshals train before it was attacked there was no pursuit but i heard the sound of distant gunfire coming from the city as i walked the landscape changed gradually to become less harsh i found water and after a while fruit on trees the climate grew less bleak i saw people sometimes travelling alone like me or in groups i stayed away from them and they avoided me once i found i could walk without danger and find food and water the dreams came every night it was always the same nameless man and the same city the dreams came and went repeating and repeating i saw so much but nothing clearly twice i think i almost had the mans name i started to believe that my dreams were the genuine reality and woke each morning beneath a tree or in the lee of some rocks fully expecting to wake into another existence a different life just a nice clean hospital bed would be a start but no i was always here on temperate downlands that eventually became a battlefield and where i have just met the man with the flail still there is light at the end of the horizon i head for that light it looks like the edge of these dank clouds a long lidded eye of gold at the top of a hill i look back on the small misshapen man he is still there whipping at some fallen warrior perhaps i ought to have lain down and let him lash me could death be the only way i might awake from this terrible enchanted sleep that would require faith i do not believe in faith i believe it exists but i do not believe it works i dont know what the rules are here i cant risk throwing everything away on a long shot i come to the place where the clouds end and the dark downs give way to a low cliff beyond there is sand an unnatural place i think looking up at the edge of dark cloud it is too distinct too uniform the boundary between the shadowy downs with their fallen armies of dead and the golden waste of sand too precisely defined a hot breath from off the sand blows away the stale thick smells of the battlefield i have a bottle of water and some fruit my waiters jacket is thin the field marshals old coat dirty i still have the handkerchief like a favour i jump from the last hill over the hot sand down into the golden slope ploughing and sliding towards the floor of the desert the air is hot and dry devoid of the corrupting odours of the rolling battlefield behind me but full of another sort of death its promise in the very dryness of that air moving above a place where there is no water no food no shade i start walking once i thought i was dying i had walked and crawled finding no shade finally i fell down the slip face of a dune and knew i could not rise from there without water without liquid without something the sun was a white hole in the sky so blue it had no colour i waited for clouds to form but none came eventually dark widewinged birds appeared they started to wheel above me riding an unseen thermal waiting i watched them through halfglued eyes the birds flew in a great spiral over the desert as though there was some immense invisible bolt suspended over me and they were just scraps of black silk stuck to its spiralled plane moving slowly as that vast column turned then i see another man appear at the top of the dune he is tall and muscular and dressed in some savages light armour his golden arms and legs are bare he carries a huge sword and a decorated helmet which he holds in the crook of one arm he looks transparent and unsubstantial for all his bulk i can see through his body perhaps he is a ghost the sword glitters in the sunlight but dully he sways as he stands there not seeing me he puts one hand shakily to his brown then seems to talk to the helmet he holds he halfwalks halfstaggers down the slip face towards me his booted feet and thickly muscled legs plunging through the baking sand still he does not appear to notice me his hair is bleached by the sun peeling skin covers his face and arms and legs the sword drags in the sand behind him he stops at my feet staring into the distance swaying has he come to kill me with that great sword at least it might be quick he stands still swaying eyes fixed on the hazy distance i would swear he is standing too close to me too close to my feet as though his own feet were somehow inside mine i lie waiting he stands above struggling to keep on his feet one arm going out suddenly as he tries to balance himself the helmet in the crook of his arm falls to the sand the helmets decoration a wolfs head cries out the warriors eyes turn up into his head going white he crumples falling towards me i close my eyes ready to be crushed i feel nothing i hear nothing either he does not fall onto the sand beside me and when i open my eyes there is no trace of him or the helmet he dropped i stare into the sky again at the entwined doublespiral of circling birds that are death i used the last of my strength to peel open my coat and jacket and bare my chest to the invisible turning bolt in the sky i lay spreadeagled for some time two of the birds landed near me i did not stir one of them swiped at my hand with its hooked beak then jumped back i lay still waiting when they came for my eyes i took them by their necks their blood was thick and salty but like the taste of life to me i see the bridge at first i am certain it is a hallucination then i believe it might be a mirage something which looks like the bridge reflected in the air and to my parched obsessed eyes taking on its form i walk closer through the heat and the slopes of clinging flowing grains i have the handkerchief over my head shading me the bridge shimmers in the distance a long rough line of summits i come slowly closer to it throughout the day resting only for a short while when the sun is at its height sometimes i climb to the tops of the long dunes to reassure myself it is there i am within a couple of miles before my confused eyes admit the truth to me the bridge is in ruins the main sections are largely intact though damaged but the linking sections those spans those little bridges within bridges they have collapsed or been destroyed and large parts of the section extremities have disappeared along with them the bridge looks less like a succession of laterally stretched hexagons and more like a line of isolated octagons its feet still stand its bones still rise but its linking arms its connections they have gone i see no movement no sudden glints of light the wind sighs sand over the edges of dunes but no sound comes from the tall ochre skeleton of the bridge it stands blanched and gaunt and jagged in the sand slow golden waves lapping at its granite plinths and lower buildings i enter its shadow at last gratefully the burning wind moans between the towering girders i find a staircase start to climb it is hot and i am thirsty again i recognise this i know where i am everywhere is deserted i see no skeletons but i find no survivors the train deck holds a few old carriages and locomotives rusted to the rails they stand upon finally part of the bridge sand has blown up even here shading yellowgold into the edges of the rails and points my old haunt indeed i find dissy pittons it is a fallen place the ropes which used to attach tables and chairs to ceiling have mostly been cut the couches and seats and tables lie sprawled over the dusty floor like bodies from long ago a few hang by one edge or corner cripples among the dead i walk to the sea view lounge i sat here once with brooke right here we looked out and he complained about the barrage balloons then the planes flew past the desert is bright under the high sun dr joyces office not his i do not recognise any of this furniture but then he was always moving the blinds blowing in and out gently behind the broken windows look the same a long walk takes me to the arrols abandoned summer apartment it is halfsubmerged in the sand the door is open only the tops of the still sheetcovered pieces of furniture are visible the fire is buried beneath the waves of sand so is the bed i climb slowly back to the train deck and stand looking out over the shimmering sands which surround the bridge an empty bottle lies at my feet i take it by the neck and throw it from the train deck it curves end over end glinting in the sunlight towards the sand a wind comes up later screaming through the bridge scouring me flailing me i hug myself in a corner watching the edge of the wind strip paint from the bridge like some endless rasping tongue i give in i tell it the sand seems to fill my brain my skull feels like the bottom of an hourglass i give in i dont know thing or place you tell me i think this is my own voice the wind blows harder i cannot hear myself speak but i know what i am trying to say i am suddenly certain that death has a sound a word which anybody may utter which will cause and be their death i am trying to think of this word when something grates and swivels in the distance and hands lift me away from this place lets get one thing absolutely straight its all a dream either way whatever we both know that i have a choice however i am in a long hollow echoing place lying in bed there are machines around me drips into me people come and look at me occasionally the ceiling sometimes looks like white plaster sometimes like grey metal sometimes like red brick sometimes like riveted sheets of steel painted the colour of blood finally i realise where i am inside the bridge within its hollow metal bones fluid seeps into me through my nose and out again via a catheter i feel more like a plant than an animal a mammal an ape a human part of the machine all the processes have slowed i have to find a way back blow the tanks pull the cord floor the throttle some of these people look familiar dr joyce is here he wears a white coat and he makes notes on a clipboard im sure i saw abberlaine arrol just fleetingly a while ago but she was dressed in the uniform of a nurse this place is long and echoing sometimes i smell iron and rust and paint and medicines they took away the card i was given and the scarf i mean the handkerchief ah coming round are we dr joyce smiles at me i look up at him try to speak who am i where am i what is happening to me we have a new treatment the doctor says to me as though to a particularly dim child would you like us to try it would you it might make you better sign this gimme gimme in blood if you like give you my soul if i thought i had one but never mind how about a tranche on a few billion neurons nicely runin brain here doc one careful owner ahem didnt even take it to church on sundays bastards its a machine i have to tell everything i can remember to a machine which looks like a metal suitcase on a spindly trolley it takes a while just me and the machine now there was a sallowfaced lad in here for a while and the nurse and even the dear good old doctor but theyve gone now only me and the machine left it starts to speak well it says look anybody can make a mistake isnt this meant to be the season of naa forget it ok already i was wrong mea fuckin culpa joe contrite here you want blood well it says your dreams were right in the end those last ones after you left here that really is you i dont believe you i tell it you will why because im a machine and you trust machines you understand them and they dont frighten you they impress you you feel differently about people i think about this then try another question where am i the machine says your real self your physical body is now in the neurosurgical unit at the southern general hospital glasgow you were moved from the royal infirmary in edinburgh some time ago the machine seems uncertain you dont know i ask it you dont know it tells me they moved you thats all we both know might have been three months ago might have been five or even six whenever in your dream it was about twothirds of the way through the treatments and drugs theyve been trying out on you have scrambled your sense of time do you do i have any idea what date it is how long have i been under thats a little easier seven months the last time andrea cramond visited you she mentioned something about it being her birthday in a week and if you were to wake up it would be the best ok i tell the machine that makes it early july her birthdays on the th well then hmm and i suppose you dont know my name do you correct i say nothing for a while so the machine says you going to wake up then i dont know im not sure what the alternatives are whats the choice stay under or surface the machine says simple as that but how do i surface i was trying to do that on the way here before i reached the desert i tried to wake up into i know im afraid i cant help you with that one i dont know how you do it i just know you can if you want to hell i dont know do i want to your idea the machine points out is as good as mine i dont know what theyre pumping into me but everythings hazy at the moment the machine seems real when its here but the people dont its as though theres a fog inside my eyes as though the fluid in them has darkened as though they have finally silted up my other senses are similarly affected everything i hear sounds mushy distorted nothing smells or tastes of anything very much i think even my thoughts are slowing down i lie a shallow man breathing shallowly and trying to think deeply after a while nothing no people no machine no sight or sound or taste or smell or touch no awareness of my own body greyness everywhere only memories i fall asleep i wake up in a small room with one door there is a screen set in one wall the room is cubical finished in grey windowless i am sitting in a large leather armchair the chair looks familiar there is one like it in the house in leith in the study there should be a tiny burn on the right arm where a bit of dope fell out of no not there must be a new chair i look at my hands a little scar tissue on the right one im wearing mephisto shoes lee jeans a checked shirt i have no beard i feel thinner than i remember i get up and look round the room blank screen no controls concealed lighting round the top of the walls everything in grey concrete feels warm no seams in the concrete not a bad pouring job at all i wonder vaguely who the contractors were the door is ordinary made of wood i open it there is a similar room on the other side of the door it has no screen and no armchair just a bed it is a hospital bed empty crisp white sheets and a single grey blanket pulled back at one corner as though in invitation a noise comes from the room ive just left if i go through there i think and find an old guy who looks like me im going to get out of there somehow and find that machine and complain i go through to the room with the armchair i do not find keir dullea in makeup the room is empty but the screen has come to life i sit down in the armchair and watch its the man in the bed again only this time everythings in colour i can see him better he is lying on his front for a change in a different bed in a different room a small ward in fact with three other beds two of them occupied by older men with bandaged heads there are screens round my mans bed but i am above him looking down his bald spot is quite visible i reach up to my own head a bald patch sure enough the hairs on my arms are not black but muddy brown shit it all looks more cosy that i remember there are yellow flowers in a vase on the small bedside cabinet theres no chart hanging on the bottom of the bed maybe they dont do that these days theres a plastic bracelet on the mans wrist i cant read what it says noises in the distance people talking a little female laughter bottles or maybe something metallic clinking and what might be a set of wheels squeaking on a floor two nurses appear they go inside the screens and turn the man over they plump up his pillows and sit him up a little chatting to each other most of the time infuriatingly i cant hear what theyre saying the nurses leave people start to drift into the picture approaching the other two occupied beds ordinary people a young couple for one elderly man an old woman talking quietly to the other old chap nobody for my man yet doesnt look as though he cares then andrea cramond appears she looks odd from this raised vantage point but its her all right she wears a white trouser suit of raw silk red high heels red silk blouse she puts the jacket didnt i buy that for her in jenners last year down at the foot of the bed then she goes to the man and bends to kiss him on the forehead then lightly on the lips her hand stays a little while stroking hair back from his brow she sits in a chair on one side of the bed legs crossed at the knee elbow on thigh chin in hand she stares at the man i stare at her a few more lines on that calm but troubled face just starting maybe those little crinkles under her eyes are still there but there are slight shadows underneath them now her hair is longer than i recall i cannot see her eyes properly but those cheekbones that elegant nose the wide dark eyebrows the strong jaw and soft mouth those i can see she leans forward and takes his hand still gazing at him why is she here why isnt she in paris scuse me darlin you come her oftin is this now is this in the past after a little while still holding his hand and staring at his white expressionless face she slowly lowers her head to the white turnedover sheet near the mans hand and buries her face in its starched whiteness her shoulders shake once twice the screen in here goes dark and then the lights go off the lights in the room next door with the bed in it stay on my subconscious i suspect is trying to tell me something subtlety never was its strong suit i sigh put my hands on the arms of the leather chair and slowly rise i dump my clothes on the floor by the bed there is a short rearfastening cotton nightgown laid out on the pillow i put it on climb into bed fall asleep coda fool idiot what the hell do you think youre doing you were happy there think of the control the fun the possibilities and what are you going back to probably chucked out of the partnership certain to be tried for drunk driving no more flash cars for you for a while lad getting older and less happy all the time losing her to another illness another bedside you always did what she wanted she used you not the other way round it was rolereversal all right and you got screwed she turned you down dont forget she rejected you she went on rejecting you and if you show signs of recovery shell be off again dont do it you idiot what else can i do for one thing they might just turn me off no doubt my brain shows signs of life so they know im not braindead but if i just lie here showing no other signs of life they might decide to take the drips away stop the water and liquid foods and let me die so for selfpreservation isnt that meant to be the most important principle anyway you cant leave her like that you cant do that to the woman she doesnt deserve it nobody does you dont belong to her and she doesnt belong to you but youre both part of each other if she got up and left now and walked away and you never saw each other again for the rest of your lives and you lived an ordinary waking life for another fifty years even so on your deathbed you would still know she was part of you you have left your marks on each other you have helped to shape one another you have each given the other an accent to their life which they will never quite lose no matter you have a greater call on her than the other one only while you are so much closer to death if you recover she may well go back to him well tough you had decided you didnt grudge him that or was that just the drink talking no it louder i said no it wasnt the drink still cant hear you man speak up ok i meant it i meant it damn it i did too and another thing she still thinks things happen in threes there was her father dying in the car then gustave under sentence slowly deteriorating then me another car another car crash another man she loved oh i dont doubt now that gustave and i are very similar and that we both might like each other and im sure he would have got on with the advocate just as i did and for the same reason but if i can stop the similarities there by god i will i will not be the third man pale fingers rise from the screens black grating trembling in the night wind like white tubers damn things sticked again the monochrome image peels and bursts white light behind too late again the sniper first sees then aims then fires and the third no this little sequence ends at two if ive got anything to do with it and another slightly sneaky thought occurs now that ive realised how alike gustave and i might be i know what id tell andrea if i was the one slowly deteriorating and she wanted to martyr herself looking after me ill go to that other city i always wanted to really i want to meet this man damn it i wanna do things i want to travel the transsiberian go to india stand on ayers rock get sodden wet in machupicchu i want to surf i will get a hangglider i want to go back to the grand canyon and get further than just the rim rock this time i want to see the aurora borealis from svalbard or greenland i want to see a total eclipse i want to watch pyroclastic displays i want to walk inside a lava tunnel i want to see the earth from space i want to drink chang in ladakh i want to cruise down the amazon and up the yangtze and walk the great wall i want to visit azania i want to watch them push helicopters off the aircraft carriers again i want to be in bed with three women at once oh god back to thatchers britain and reagans world back to all the usual bullshit at least the bridge was predictable in its oddness at least it was comparatively safe well maybe not i dont know i know one thing i dont need the machine to tell me the choice the choice is not between dream and reality it is between two different dreams one is my own the bridge and all i made of it the other is our collective dream our corporate imagery we live the drean call it american call it western call it northern or call it just that of all we humans all life i was part of one dream for good or ill and it was half nightmare and i almost let it kill me but it hasnt yet anyway whats changed not the dream not the result of our dreams which we call the world not our hitech life me then maybe who knows could be anything inside here just wont be able to tell until i get back out again and start living the shared dream abandoning my own of a thing become place a means become end a route become destination three of diamonds indeed and a quality bridge an everlasting bridge a neverquitethesame bridge its vast and ruddy frame forever sloughing off and being replaced like a snake constantly shedding metamorphosing insect which is its own cocoon and alway changing all those trains going to be on a few more in the future too sure to get banned from driving stupid bastard writing the car off drunkdriving just before christmas how embarrassing to have to come back to that at least there wasnt anybody else involved just me and the two cars not sure id have wanted to come back if id killed somebody or even injured them badly hope whoever owned the mg didnt dote on it too much poor jaguar after all that time and money after all the careful crafted work people put into it maybe just as well i didnt have it very long before i wrecked it might have got sentimental about it might have come to feel something for it were you very attached to the car mr x attached to it i was jammed inside the bastard for three hours and that bridge the bridge have to make a pilgrimage to it once im better if i can walk over the water assuming i can walk cross the river throw a coin for luck ha ha sections three first second third forth firth loco me loco there were great grey xs in the road bridge towers too i remember now three big xs one above the other like laces or ribbons and also and also what else oh yeah and i didnt get to hear all the pogues tape either missed a man you dont meet every day fave track that sing it kid had the eurythmics on the other side furra bitta contrast like young annie beltin out wiff auntie aretha doin it for themselves and why not and singin better to have lost in love than never to have loved at all so its a cliché clichés have feelings too i want to come back can i come back beep beep beep this is a recording your conscious mind is out at the moment but if youd care to clunk can i can i please i want to come back now now we try sleep wake do it now lets go there very soon waking before that a word from our sponsors but first three little asterisks i was on the beach at valtos once one rainy and not too warm summer i was with her and we were camping and we took a chemical which altered reality rain pattered softly on the tent she wanted to stay in looking at a book of dalis paintings but didnt mind if i went out i walked along the edge of the curving tide where the waves ate into the golden crescent of sand i was alone with a warm damp breeze and a mile or two of beach rain smirring from the greyly wisping clouds i found razor shells like fragments of a broken rainbow and watched rain drops fall on some still dry sand as the wind blew over it the whole beach seemed to heave and flow like something living i remember my delight my childish touching of that sand and its dark spots the feel of the grains blown across my fingers i was on the outer edge of the outer isles rough sea to newfoundland and greenland and iceland and the skull cap of rotating ice above the pole there at the end of the long isle which is many isles a curve of broken land lying hard against the sea like a column of spine like a blossoming of brain above a central system my mind was that isle bared to the sweep of sea and weather by the cutting edge of the drug a wide escape i thought i saw it all then the way the brain flowers at the end of its articulated stalk the way our roots in the soil we grow and become it meant everything and nothing at the time and still and to myself i said ive been away a far place because i was my own father and my own child and i went away for a while but i came back child your fathers been away a far place that was what i said to myself as i headed back child your fathers been away a far place yeah sure but that was long ago what about now i mean good grief six months without a drink or a smoke ive probably been healthier lying here unconscious than ive been in the rest of my adult life not much exercise maybe but nothing more dangerous to ingest than whatever it is they shove down this tube in my nose how the hell has my body survived six months without drink and drugs maybe ill become a reformed character maybe ill stop drinking and never smoke or snort or chew anything else ever again and when i do get my driving licence back ill never exceed the speed limit again and in future ill never never say anything nasty about our legally and democratically elected representatives or those of our allies and ill have a lot more time and respect for other

careful in future child your fathers yeah i know so we heard i think we got that message thank you anybody else our revels now are ended thanx bill these proceedings are closed ta mac brammer wakes can we get that right please brahma wakes thank you sokay shut up and get on with it blackness no not blackness something a dark almost brown red everywhere i try to look away but i cant so it isnt just the colour of the wall or the ceiling is this behind my eyes dont know dinnae ken sound i can hear something its like having dived into a pool floating back up towards the surface again that sound a sort of bubbling white noise slowly altering in pitch from very low to high and bursting like a bubble itself to conversation a woman laughing clinks and rattles a wheel or a chairleg squeaking smell oh yes very medicinal no doubt where we are now something flowery too i can smell two scents here one crude but fresh one much more i dont know i cant describe it ah the first one must be the bedside flowers the ones in the vase on the cabinet the second is her still wearing joy it would seem must be her stuff doesnt smell like that on anybody else even her mother shes here is this the same day will i get to see her oh dont leave yet stay dont go move something go on shift totally disorganised here cant see a damn thing and im like a dozy puppeteer caught napping stumbling around behind the scenes trying to find the right lengths of string getting all in a tangle arms legs tootsies which bit works which wheres the instruction manual oh god we arent going to have to learn all this stuff again are we eyes open dammit twitch hands feet come on do your stuff somebody anybody take it easy lie back and think of scotland just calm down laddie breathe feel your blood pump feel the tuckedin weight of the blanket and sheets feel the tickle where the tube goes in through your nose all there cant hear anybody talking nearby just the hushed rumble of building and city slight breeze has taken the smell of joy away probably not here at all still the colour of dried blood behind here slight draught again feels funny on my cheek and the little bit of skin between nose and lip havent felt a breeze there since i was a student covered by beard all those years grow the thing back if i ever get out of here i sigh i really do sigh i feel the resistance of the tuckedin bedclothes as my chest rises higher than normal the tube which enters me through one nostril slides across the fabric over my shoulder then slips back as i relax and breathe out i sighed im so surprised i open my eyes the left lid trembles gummedup then clears within seconds though it all looks a bit shaky and bright for a while everything settles down andrea is sitting less than a metre away her legs drawn under the small seat one hand rests on her thigh the other is holding a small styrofoam cup to her mouth which is open those lips parted i can see her teeth she is staring at me i blink so does she i waggle my toes and glancing down to the bottom of the bed see the white jacket move up and down as i do so i flex my hands damn rough blankets they have here i am hungry andrea puts the cup down leans forward a little as though she does not believe what she is seeing she looks from one of my eyes to the other apparently checking for signs of sense in both not an unreasonable precaution ill admit i clear my throat andreas whole body relaxes i once watched a chiffon scarf drop from her fingers and i do not recall that it flowed more gracefully her face loses a whole layer of worry just like that i i have remembered my name am almost embarrassed she nods slowly welcome back she says smiling oh yeah end
