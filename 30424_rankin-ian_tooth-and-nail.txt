ian rankin tooth and nail how many wolves do we feel on our heels while our real enemies go in sheepskin malcolm lowry under the volcano introduction i lived in london for four years from to during which time my home was a maisonette in tottenham not far from the river lea when i left for france in the summer of some friends took on the maisonette we kept in touch tooth nail was eventually published in the spring of only it wasnt called tooth nail it was called wolfman the name of the serial killer who stalks the book a few months after publication my friends in tottenham sent me a photo theyd taken of a subway between my old home and the river wherethefirst murder in the book takes place the subways gloomy interior comprised white tiles and on this surface in six foothigh black capitals someone had painted the name wolfman i keep the photo close at hand even now to remind myself that there are some fans an author just doesnt want to meet ever it was my editor in the usa who mentioned that wolfman made my story sound like a horror novel and it was his idea to rename the book tooth nail for the american audience the title seemed resonant and chimed with my first two rebus adventures when my current publisher orion got hold of the rights to the book i persuaded them that it should become tooth nail in the uk too the book is set in london the only rebus novel so far to take place outside scotland basically i wanted rebus to be more of an outsider than ever in london hes a fish out of water he cant begin to comprehend the city doesnt even know what a bagel is and no one around him understands his accent and dialect to such an extent that passages from the book have become teaching aids in some scottish primary schools in essence i was using rebus to explore my own feelings about the london i had known just at a time when i was preparing to leave the place from the early s until may id kept a pageaday diary for whatever reason i stopped soon after arriving in france however an entry for march that year reads ive started halfheartedly a new rebus novel though iknow i should plan more and research more before i really get into it its going to be called wolfman if it ever gets off the ground i think some of the impetus for the book came from the spectacular success of the american author thomas harris id spent a sleepless night reading the silence of the lambs from cover to cover the man had a huge talent and sales to match and i wanted some of the latter the serial killer was in vogue and there seemed an endless fascination with the psychology and pathology of evil it was fortunate for me that my editor euan cameron was not as easily seduced by trends i remember that when i sent him the first version of the manuscript he told me there was far too much sex and violence in the story and asked for cuts in both departments id learned a valuable lesson that the two can be suggested without having to show either graphic and voyeuristic detail during my time in london id served jury duty at the old bailey a bizarre and unsatisfactory experience which was to provide me with an abundance of detail and anecdotes for the old bailey scenes in tooth nail the trial id attended had been full of farcical moments starting with an arresting officer called death a prosecutor who didnt know the difference between and and a juror who said i think he done it but i dont want him going to prison for it then voted not guilty leading to the prisoner escaping sentence the police foulup in the book which allows tommy watkiss to go free actually happened during my trial but in real life no one noticed except we jurors i took lots of notes about the old bailey its interior layout security issues the route from the courtroom to the jury room and was stopped one day by a security guard as i left the building he asked to see my notes seemed horrified by them and tore them up in front of me i thanked him and stepped outside where i proceeded to write them all down again as he watched helplessly through a window tooth nail is notable for introducing the character of morris gerald cafferty aka big ger the gangsterwho runs edinburgh in this book he has a cameo only but it was enough to persuade me that i could do more with him i also started to introduce scottish words into the text perhaps to ensure that i wouldnt lose them entirely after all living in rural southwest france i had few opportunities to say things like wersh meaning sour winching going steady and hoolit drunk in time some of these words would even start to creep into the oxford english dictionary with the rebus novels cited for reference criwens having said in the diary entry quoted above that i should plan more and research more i should confess here that the lengthy list of acknowledgements at the end of tooth nail is actually an extended joke each recipient is a friend of mine and i just wanted to sneak as many of their names into the book as i could steve adams and fiona campbell for example were our nextdoor neighbours in tottenham while tee macgregor and don nichol had been literature postgrads during my own time at the university of edinburgh professor j curt however deserves special mention hes my mate jon curt i shared a flat with him for an intensely boozy year when i was a postgrad and he was finishing his ma as well as being a student jon was parttime barman at the oxford bar without him i might never have found what was to become rebuss favourite wateringhole i rewarded jon with a professorship in tooth nail and would later turn him into dr curt pathologist and friend of rebus in many of the later novels the book also contains one of my favourite oneliners in any of my novels i wont give the game away here but watch out for the mention of a nudist beach prologue she drives home the knife the moment she knows from past experience is a very intimate one her hand is gripped around the knifes cool handle and the thrust takes the blade into the throat up to the hilt until her hand meets the throat itself flesh upon flesh jacket first or woollen jersey cotton shirt or tshirt then flesh now rent the knife is writhing like an animal sniffing warm blood covering hilt and hand the other hand covers the mouth stifling screams the moment is complete a meeting touching the body is hot gaping warm with blood seething inside as insides become outsides boiling the moment is coming to an end all too soon and still she feels hungry it isnt right isnt usual but she does she removes some of the clothing in fact removes quite a lot of it removes more perhaps than is necessary and she does what she must do the knife squirming again she keeps her eyes screwed tightly shut she does not like this part she has never liked this part not then not now but especially not then finally she brings out her teeth and sinks them into the white stomach until they grind together in a satisfying bite and whispers as she always does the same four words its only a game it is evening when george flight gets the call sunday evening sunday should be his blessed relief beef and yorkshires feet up in front of the television papers falling from his lap but hes had a feeling all day in the pub at lunchtime hed felt it a wriggling in his gut like there were worms in there tiny blind white worms hungry worms worms he could not hope to satisfy he knew what they were and they knew what they were and then hed won third prize in the pub raffle a threefoot high orange and white teddy bear even the worms had laughed at him then and hed known the day would end badly as it was doing now the phone as insistent as last orders ringing with whatever bad news couldnt wait until the morning shift he knew what it meant of course hadnt he been expecting it these past weeks but still he was reluctant to pick up the receiver at last he did flight speaking theres been another one sir the wolfman hes done another flight stared at the silent television highlights of the previous days rugby match grown men running after a funnyshaped ball as though their lives depended on it it was only a bloody game after all and propped up against the side of the tv that smirking prize the teddy bear what the hell could he do with a teddy bear okay he said just tell me where after all it is only a game rebus smiled and nodded at the englishman across the table then he stared out of the window pretending once more to be interested in the blur of dark scenery if the englishman had said it once he had said it a dozen times and during the trip he had said little else he also kept stealing precious legroom from rebus while his collection of empty beer cans was creeping across the table invading rebuss space pushing against the neatly folded stack of newspapers and magazines tickets please yelled the guard from the other end of the carriage so with a sigh and for the third time since leaving edinburgh rebus sought out his ticket it was never where he thought it was at berwick hed thought it was in his shirt pocket it was in the outer top pocket of his harris tweed jacket then at durham hed looked for it in his jacket only to find it beneath one of the magazines on the table now ten minutes out of peterborough it had moved to the back pocket of his trousers he retrieved it and waited for the guard to make his way forward the englishmans ticket was where it had always been halfhidden beneath a beer can rebus although he knew every word almost by heart glanced again at the back page of one of his sunday papers he had kept it to the top of the pile for no reason other than a sense of devilment enjoying the thick black letters of the headline scots wha hae beneath which was printed the story of the previous days calcutta cup clash at murrayfield and a clash it had been no day for weak stomachs but a day for stout hearts and determination the scots had triumphed by thirteen points to ten and now here rebus was on a late evening sunday train packed with disappointed english rugby supporters heading towards london london never one of rebuss favourite places not that he was a frequent visitor but this was not pleasure this was strictly business and as a representative of the lothian and borders police he was to be on best behaviour or as his boss had put it so succinctly no fuckups john well he would do his best not that he reckoned there was much he could do right or wrong but he would do what he could and if that meant wearing a clean shirt and tie polished shoes and a respectable jacket then so be it all tickets please rebus handed over his ticket somewhere in the corridor up ahead in the nomansland of the buffet car between first and second class a few voices were raised in a verse of blakes jerusalem the englishman across from rebus smiled only a game he said to the tins in front of him only a game the train pulled in to kings cross five minutes late it was a quarter past eleven rebus was in no hurry a hotel room had been booked for him in central london courtesy of the metropolitan police he carried a typed list of notes and directions in his jacket pocket again sent up from london he had not brought much luggage with him feeling that the courtesy of the met would extend only so far he expected the trip to last two or three days at most after which time even they would realise surely that he was not going to be of much help to them in their investigations so one small suitcase one sports bag and one briefcase the suitcase contained two suits a change of shoes several pairs of socks and underpants and two shirts with matching ties in the sports bag were a small washbag towel two paperback novels one partly read a travel alarm clock a thirtyfive millimetre camera with flashgun and film a tshirt retractable umbrella sunglasses transistor radio diary bible a bottle containing ninetyseven paracetamol tablets and another bottle protected by the tshirt containing best islay malt whisky the bare essentials in other words the briefcase contained notepad pens a personal tape recorder some blank tapes and prerecorded tapes and a thick manila file filled with photocopied sheets of metropolitan police paper tenbyeight inch colour photographs held together in a small ringbinder affair and newspaper clippings on the front of this file was a white sticky label with one word typed upon it the word was wolfman rebus was in no hurry the night what was left of it was his he had to attend a meeting at ten on monday morning but his first night in the capital city could be spent however he chose he thought he would probably choose to spend it in his hotel room he waited in his seat until the other passengers had left the train then slid his bag and briefcase from the luggage rack and made for the sliding door to the carriage beside which in another luggage rack sat his suitcase manoeuvring these out of the train door and onto the platform he paused for a moment and breathed in the smell was not quite like any other railway station certainly it was not like waverley station in edinburgh the air wasnt quite foetid but it did seem to rebus somehow overused and tired he felt suddenly fatigued and there was something else in his nostrils something sweet and revolting at the same time he couldnt quite think what it reminded him of on the concourse instead of making directly for the underground he wandered over to a bookstall there he purchased an az of london slipping it into his briefcase the next mornings editions were just arriving but he ignored them this was sunday not monday sunday was the lords day which was perhaps why he had packed a bible long with his other possessions he hadnt been to a church service in weeks maybe even months not since hed tried the cathedral on palmerston place in fact it had been a nice place light and bright but too far from his home to make for a viable proposition and besides it was still organised religion and he had not lost his mistrust of organised religion if anything he was warier these days than ever before he was also hungry perhaps he would grab a bite on the way to the hotel he passed two women having an animated discussion i heard it on the radio just twenty minutes ago done another has he thats what theyre saying the woman shivered dont bear thinking about did they say it was definitely him not definitely but you just know dont you there was truth in that so rebus had arrived in time for another small piece of the drama to unfold around him another murder making four in all four in the space of three months he was a busy little man this killer they had named the wolfman they had named him the wolfman and then they had sent word to rebuss boss lend us your man they had said lets see what he can do rebuss boss chief superintendent watson had handed the letter over to him better take some silver bullets with you john he had said it looks like youre their only hope and then he had chuckled knowing as well as rebus knew himself that he could be of little help in the case but rebus had gnawed on his bottom lip silent in front of his deskbound superior he would do what he could he would do everything he could until they saw through him and sent him back home besides perhaps he needed the break watson seemed glad to be rid of him too if nothing else itll keep us out of one anothers hair for a while the chief superintendent an aberdonian had carried the nickname farmer watson a nickname every police officer beneath him in edinburgh understood but then one day rebus a nip of malt too many beneath his belt had blurted out the nickname in front of watson himself since when he had found himself assigned to more than his fair share of tedious details desk jobs lookouts and training courses training courses at least watson had a sense of humour the most recent had been termed management for senior officers and had been a minor disaster all psychology and how to be nice to junior officers how to involve them how to motivate them how to relate to them rebus had returned to his station and tried it for one day a day of involving of motivating of relating at the end of the day a dc had slapped a hand onto rebuss back smiling bloody hard work today john but ive enjoyed it take your hand off my fucking back rebus had snarled and dont call me john the dcs mouth fell open but you said he began but didnt bother finishing the brief holiday was over rebus had tried being a manager tried it and loathed it he was halfway down the steps to the underground when he stopped put down his suitcase and briefcase pulled open the zip on his sports bag and found the transistor radio switching it on he held it to his ear with one hand while the other turned the tuning dial eventually he found a news bulletin listening as the other travellers passed him a few of them staring but mostly ignoring him at last he heard what he had been waiting for then switched off the radio and threw it back into the sports bag now he released the two catches on his briefcase and brought out the az flipping through the pages of street names at the back he remembered just how large london really was large and populous something like ten million was it wasnt that twice the population of scotland it didnt bear thinking about ten million souls ten million and one rebus whispered to himself finding the name he had been looking for the chamber of horrors not a pretty sight looking around him detective inspector george flight wondered whether the sergeant had been referring to the body or to the surrounding area you could say what you liked about the wolfman he wasnt choosy about his turf this time it was a riverside path not that flight had ever really thought of the lea as a river it was a place where supermarket trolleys came to die a dank stretch of water bordered on one side by marshland and on the other by industrial sites and torise housing apparently you could walk the course of the lea from the thames to up past edmonton the narrow river ran like a mottledblack vein from east central london to the most northerly reaches of the capital and beyond the vast majority of londoners didnt even know it existed george flight knew about it though he had been brought up in tottenham hale not far from the lea his father had fished on the navigation section between stonebridge and tottenham locks when he was young he had played football on the marshes smoked illicit cigarettes in the long grass with his gang fumbled with a blouse or a brassiere on the wasteland just across the river from where he now stood he had walked along this path it was popular on warm sunday afternoons there were riverside pubs where you could stand outside supping a pint and watching the sunday sailors plying their crafts but at night only the drunk the reckless and the brave would use the quiet and illlit path the drunk the reckless the brave and the locals jean cooper was a local ever since the separation from her husband she had lived with her sister in a small recentlybuilt estate just off the towpath she worked in an offlicence on lea bridge road and finished work at seven the riverside path was a quick route home her body had been found at nine fortyfive by a couple of young lads on their way to one of the pubs they had run back to lea bridge road and flagged down a passing police car the operation thereafter had about it a fluid easy movement the police doctor arrived to be met by detectives from stoke newington police station who recognising the modus operandi contacted flight by the time he arrived the scene was organised but busy the body had been identified questions asked of nearby residents the sister found scene of crime officers were in discussion with a couple of people from forensics the area around the body had been cordoned off and nobody crossed the tape without first of all donning polythene coverails for their feet and hair two photographers were busy taking flash photographs under portable lighting powered by a nearby generator and next to the generator stood an operations van where another photographer was trying to fix his jammed video camera its these cheap tapes he complained they look like a bargain when you buy them but then halfway through you find theres a twist or a snag in them so dont buy cheap tapes flight had advised thank you sherlock had been the cameramans ill meant response before once again cursing the tapes the seller of the tapes and the sellers market stall in brick lane hed only bought the tapes that day meantime having discussed their plan of attack the forensic scientists moved in towards the body armed with sticky tape scissors and a pile of large polythene bags then with extraordinary care they began to tape the body in the hope of lifting hairs and fibres from the clothing flight watched them from a distance the portable lights cast a garish white glow over the scene so that standing further back in unlit gloom flight felt a bit like someone in a theatre watching a distant play unfold by god you had to have patience for a job like this everything had to be done by the book and had to be done in meticulous detail he hadnt gone near the body yet himself his chance would come later perhaps much later the wailing started again it was coming from a police ford sierra parked on lea bridge road jean coopers sister being comforted in the back of the car by a wpc being told to drink the hot sweet tea knowing she would never see her sister alive again but this was not the worst flight knew the worst was still to come when the sister would formally identify jeans body in the mortuary jean cooper had been easy enough to identify her handbag lay beside her on the path apparently untouched in it were letters and house keys with an address tag attached flight couldnt help thinking about those house keys it wasnt very clever to put your address on your keys was it a bit late for that now though a bit late for crime prevention the crying started again a long plaintive howl reaching into the orange glow of the sky above the river lea and its marshes flight looked towards the body then retraced the route jean had taken from lea bridge road she had walked less than fifty yards before being attacked fifty yards from a welllit and busy main thoroughfare less than twenty from the back of a row of flats but this section of path depended for light upon a street lamp which was broken the council would probably get round to fixing it now and from whatever illumination was given from the windows of the flats it was dark enough for the purpose all right dark enough for murder most foul he couldnt be sure that the wolfman was responsible not completely and utterly sure at this early stage but he could feel it like a numbing injection in his bones the terrain was right the stab wounds reported to him seemed right and the wolfman had been quiet for just under three weeks three weeks during which the trail had gone stone cold as cold as a canal path the wolfman had taken a risk this time however striking in late evening instead of at the dead of night someone might have seen him the need for a rapid escape might have led him to leave a clue please god let him have left a clue flight rubbed at his stomach the worms were gone consumed by acid he felt calm utterly calm for the first time in days excuse me the voice was muffled and flight halfturned to let the diver past him this diver was followed by another both of them holding powerful torches flight did not envy the police frogmen their job the river was dark and poisonous chilled and most probably the consistency of soup but it had to be searched now if the killer had dropped something into the lea by mistake or had thrown his knife into the river it had to be recovered as soon as possible silt or shifting rubbish might cover it before daybreak simply they couldnt afford the time and so he had ordered a search just after hearing the news before he had even left his warm and comfortable home to hurry to the scene his wife had patted him on the arm try not to be late both knew the words were meaningless he watched the first frogman slip into the water and stared entranced as the water began to glow from the torchlight the second diver followed the first into the water and disappeared from view flight checked the sky a thick layer of cloud lay still and silent above him the weather report was for early morning rain it would dissolve footprints and wash fibres bloodstains and hair into the hardpacked soil of the path with any luck they would complete the initial scene of crime work without the need for plastic tents george flight turned to greet the newcomer the man was in his midfifties tall with cadaverous features lit up by a wide grin or as wide as the long and narrow face would allow he carried a large black bag in his left hand and stretched out his right for flight to shake by his side walked a handsome woman of flights own age in fact as far as he could recall she was exactly one month and a day younger than him her name was isobel penny and she was in a euphemistic phrase the cadaverous mans assistant and secretary that they had been sleeping together these past eight or nine years was something nobody really discussed though isobel had told flight all about it for no other reason than that they had been in the same class together at school and had kept in touch with one another ever since hello philip said flight shaking the pathologists hand philip cousins was not just a home office pathologist he was by far the best home office pathologist with a reputation resulting from twentyfive years worth of work twentyfive years during which to flights knowledge the man had never once got it wrong cousinss eye for retail and his sheer bloody doggedness had seen him crack or help crack several dozen murder investigations ranging from stranglings in streatham to the poisoning of a government official in the west indies people who did not know him said that he looked the part with his dark blue suits and cold grey features they could not know about his quick and ready humour his kindness or the way he thrilled student doctors at his packed lectures flight had attended one of those lectures something to do with arterial sclerosis and hadnt laughed so much in years i thought you two were in africa he said now pecking isobel on the cheek by way of greeting cousins sighed we were but penny got homesick he always called her by her surname she gave him a playful thump on his forearm you liar then she turned her pale blue eyes to flight it was philip she said he couldnt bear to be away from his corpses the first decent holiday weve had in years and he says hes bored can you believe that george flight smiled and shook his head well im glad you were able to make it looks like another victim of the wolfman cousins looked over flights shoulder towards where the photographers were still photographing the crouched scientists still stickytaping like so many flies about to settle on the corpse he had examined the first three wolfman victims and that sort of continuity helped in a case it wasnt just that he would know what to look for what marks were indicative of the wolfman he would also spot anything not in keeping with the other killings anything that might hint at a change of modus operandi a different weapon say or a new angle of attack flights mental picture of the wolfman was coming together piece by tiny piece but cousins was the man who could show him here those pieces fitted inspector flight yes a man in a tweed jacket was approaching carrying several cases and trailing a uniformed constable behind him he placed the bags on the ground and introduced himself john rebus flights face remained blank inspector john rebus the hand shot out and flight accepted it feeling his grip strongly returned ah yes he said just arrived have you he glanced meaningfully towards the bags we werent expecting you until tomorrow inspector well i got into kings cross and heard about rebus nodded towards the illuminated towpath so i thought id come straight over flight nodded trying to appear preoccupied in fact he was playing for time while he tried to come to grips with the scotsmans thick accent one of the forensic scientists had risen from his squatting position and was coming towards the group hello dr cousins he said before turning to flight were pretty much finished if dr cousins wants to take a look flight turned to philip cousins who nodded gravely come on penny flight was about to follow them when he remembered the new arrival he turned back to john rebus his eyes immediately drifting down from rebuss face to his loud and rustic jacket he looked like something out of drfinlays casebook certainly he looked out of place on this urban towpath at the dead of night do you want to take a look flight asked generously he watched as rebus nodded without enthusiasm okay leave your bags where they are then the two men started forward together cousins and isobel a couple of yards in front flight pointed towards them dr philip cousins he said youve probably heard of him but rebus shook his head slowly flight stared at him as though rebus had just failed to pick out the queen from a row of postage stamps oh he said coldly then pointing again and thats isobel penny dr cousinss assistant hearing her name isobel turned her head back and smiled she had an attractive face round and girllike with a shiny glow to her cheeks physically she was the antithesis of her companion though tall she was wellbuilt what rebuss father might have called big boned and she boasted a healthy complexion to balance cousinss sickly colour rebus couldnt recall ever having seen a really healthy looking pathologist he put it down to all the time they spent standing under artificial light they had reached the body the first thing rebus saw was someone aiming a video camera towards him but the camera moved away again to focus on the corpse flight was in conversation with one of the forensics team neither looked at the others face but concentrated instead on the strips of tape which had been carefully lifted from the corpse and which the scientist now held yes said flight no need to send them to the lab yet well do another taping at the mortuary the man nodded and moved away there was a noise from the river and rebus turned to watch as a frogman broke the surface looked around him and then dived again he knew a place like this in edinburgh a canal running through the west of the city between parks and breweries and stretches of nothingness hed had to investigate a murder there once the battered body of a tramp found beneath a road bridge one foot in the canal the killer had been easy to find another tramp an argument over a can of cider the court had settled for manslaughter but it hadnt been manslaughter it had been murder rebus would never forget that i think we should wrap those hands up right away dr cousins was saying in a rich home counties voice ill have a good look at them at the mortuary right you are said flight going off to fetch some more polythene bags rebus watched the pathologist at work he held a small tape recorder in one hand and talked into it from time to time isobel penny meantime had produced a sketchpad and was drawing a picture of the body poor woman was probably dead before she hit the ground cousins was saying little signs of bruising hypostasis seems consistent with the terrain id say she certainly died on this spot by the time flight returned with some bags cousins watched intermittently by rebus had taken readings of the air temperature and of internal temperature the path on which they all stood was long and reasonably straight the killer would have had ample visual warning of any approach at the same time there were homes and a main road nearby so any screams would surely have been heard tomorrow there would be housetohouse enquiries the path near the body was littered with rubbish rusting drinks cans crisp packets sweet wrappers torn and faded sheets of newsprint in the river itself floated more rubbish and the red handle of a supermarket shoppingtrolley broke the surface another diver had appeared head and shoulders bobbing above the water where the main road crossed over the river a crowd had gathered on the bridge looking down towards the murder scene uniformed officers were doing their best to move the sightseers on cordoning off as much of the area as they could from the marks on the legs dirt some grazing and bruising continued the voice i would say the victim fell to the ground or was pushed or lowered to the ground on her front only later was she turned over dr cousinss voice was level disinterested rebus took in a few deep breaths and decided he had postponed the inevitable long enough he had only come here to show willing to show that he wasnt in london on a joyride but now that he was here he supposed he should take a good close look at the body for himself he turned away from the canal the frogmen the sightseers and all the police officers standing behind the cordon he turned away from the sight of his baggage standing all alone at the end of the path and gazed down on the corpse she was lying on her back arms by her sides legs together her tights and knickers had been pulled down to knee level but her skirt was covering her though he could see it was rucked up at the back her bright skistyle jacket was unzipped and her blouse had been ripped open though her bra was intact she had long straight black hair and wore large circlet earrings her face might have been pretty a few years ago but life had ravaged it leaving its marks the killer had left marks too there was blood smeared across the face and matting the hair the source of the blood was a gaping hole in the womans throat but there was also blood lying beneath her spreading out from under the skirt turning her over said dr cousins to his tape recorder he did so with flights help and then lifted the womans hair away from the nape of her neck puncture wound he said into his tape recorder consistent with larger wound to the throat an exit wound id say but rebus wasnt really listening to the doctor any longer he was staring in horror at where the womans skirt was rucked up there was blood on the body a lot of blood staining the small of the back the buttocks the tops of the thighs from the reports in his briefcase he knew the cause of all this blood but that didnt make it any easier to face the reality of it the cold clear horror of it all he took in more deep breaths he had never yet vomited at a murder scene and he wasnt about to start now no fuckups his boss had told him it was a matter of pride but rebus knew now that the purpose of his trip to london was very serious indeed it wasnt to do with pride or putting up a good show or doing his best it was to do with catching a pervert a horrifically brutal sadist and doing so before he could strike again and if it took silver bullets by god silver bullets there would be rebus was still shaking when at the operations van someone handed him a plastic beaker of tea thanks he could always blame his gooseflesh on the cold not that it was cold not really the cloud cover helped and there was no wind of course london was usually a few degrees warmer than edinburgh at any time of year and there wasnt the same wind that bitter and biting wind which whipped across the streets of edinburgh in summer as well as winter in fact if rebus were asked to describe the weather on this night the word he would use would be balmy he closed his eyes for a moment not tired just trying to shut out the sight of jean coopers cooling body but she seemed etched onto his eyelids in all her grim glory rebus had been relieved to note that even inspector george flight was not unmoved his actions movements and speech had become somehow damped or more muted as though he were consciously holding back some emotion the urge to scream or kick out the divers were coming up from the river having found nothing they would look again in the morning but their voices betrayed a lack of hope flight listened to their report and nodded all the time watched from behind his beaker of tea by rebus george flight was in his late forties a few years older than rebus he wasnt short yet he had an appearance best described as stocky there was the hint of a paunch but a much greater hint of muscle rebus didnt rate his own chances against him in a clinch flights wiry brown hair was thin at the crown but thick elsewhere he was dressed in a leather bomber jacket and denims most men in their forties looked stupid in denims but not flight they fitted his attitude and his brisk businesslike walk a long time before rebus had graded cid men into three sartorial groups the leatheranddenim brigade who wanted to look as tough as they felt the suitandtie dapper merchants who were looking for promotion and respect not necessarily in that order and the nondescripts men who wore anything that came to hand of a morning their years fashions usually the result of an hours shopping in a bigname department store most cid men were nondescripts rebus reckoned he himself fell into that group yet catching a glimpse of himself in a wingmirror he noticed that he had a dapper look suitandties never got on with leatheranddenims now flight was shaking hands with an important looking man who other than for the handshake kept his hands in his pockets and listened to flight with head angled downwards nodding occasionally as though deep in thought he wore a suit and a black woollen coat he couldnt have been more crisply dressed if it had been the middle of the day most people were beginning to look fatigued their clothes and faces crumpled there were only two exceptions this man and philip cousins the man was shaking hands with dr cousins now and even extended a greeting to dr cousinss assistant and then flight gestured towards the van no towards rebus they were coming towards him rebus brought the beaker away from his face and swapped it from his right to his left hand just in case a handshake was in the offing this is inspector rebus flight said ah our man from north of the border said the important looking man with a wry rather superior smile rebus returned the smile but looked to flight inspector rebus this is chief inspector howard laine how do you do the handshake howard laine it sounded like a streetname so said chief inspector laine youre here to help us with our little problem well said rebus im not sure what i can do sir but rest assured ill do what i can there was a pause then laine smiled but said nothing the truth hit rebus like lightning splitting a tree they couldnt understand him they were standing there smiling at him but they couldnt understand his accent rebus cleared his throat and tried again whatever i can do to help sir laine smiled again excellent inspector excellent well im sure inspector flight here will show you the ropes settled in all right have you well actually flight himself interrupted inspector rebus came straight here sir as soon as he heard about the murder hes only just arrived in london is that so laine sounded impressed but rebus could see that the man was growing restless this was smalltalk and he did not like to think he had time for smalltalk his eyes sought some escape well inspector he said im sure well meet again and turning to flight id better be off george everything under control flight merely nodded good fine well and with that the chief inspector started back towards his car accompanied by flight rebus exhaled noisily he felt completely out of his territory here he knew when he was not wanted and wondered just whose idea it had been to second him to the wolfman case someone with a warped sense of humour that was for sure his boss had passed the letter over to him it seems he had said youve become an expert on serial killers john and theyre a bit short on those in the met just now theyd like you to go down to london for a few days see if you can come up with anything maybe give them a few ideas rebus had read the letter through in growing disbelief it referred to a case from a few years before the case of a child murderer a case rebus had cracked but that had been personal not really a serial killer at all i dont know anything about serial killers rebus had protested to his boss well then it seems like youll be in good company doesnt it and now look at him standing on a stretch of ground in northeast london a cup of unspeakably bad tea nursed in both hands his stomach churning nerves buzzing his bags looking as lonely and out of place as he felt here to help solve the insoluble our man from north of the border whose idea had it been to bring him here no police force in the country liked to admit failure yet by lugging rebus down here the met was doing precisely that laine had gone and flight seemed a little more relaxed he even found time to smile reassuringly across to rebus before giving orders to two men who rebus knew would be from a funeral parlour the men went back to their vehicle andreturned with a large folded piece of plastic they crossed the cordon and stopped at the body laying the plastic out beside it it was a translucent bag over six feet long with a zip running from head to toe dr cousins was in close attendance as the two men opened the bag and lifted the body into it closing the zipper one photographer had decided to shoot off a few more flash photographs of the spot where the body had lain while the attendants carried the corpse back through the cordon and up to their vehicle rebus noticed that the crowd of onlookers had disappeared and only a few curious souls remained one of them a young man was carrying a crash helmet and wore a shiny black leather jacket with shinier silver zips a very tired constable was trying to move him on rebus felt like an onlooker himself and thought of all the tv dramas and films hed seen with detectives swarming over the murder site in minute one destroying any forensic evidence in the process and solving the murder by minute fiftynine or eightynine laughable really police work was just that work relentless routine dull frustrating and above all timeconsuming he checked his watch it was exactly am his hotel was back in central london tucked somewhere behind piccadilly circus it would take another thirty to forty minutes to get back there always supposing a spare patrol car was available coming it was flight standing a few yards in front of him might as well said rebus knowing exactly what flight was talking about or more accurately where he was talking about flight smiled ill give you this inspector rebus you dont give up the famous tenacity of the scots said rebus quoting from one of sundays newspaper rugby reports flight actually laughed it didnt last long but it made rebus feel glad that hed come here tonight the ice hadnt been broken completely perhaps but an important chunk had been chipped away from one corner of the berg come on then ive got my car ill get one of the drivers to put your bags in his boot the locks stuck on mine somebody tried to crowbar it open a few weeks back he glanced towards rebus a rare moment of eye contact nowhere is safe these days he said nowhere there was already a lot of commotion up at road level voices and the slamming shut of car doors some officers would stay behind of course guarding the site and a few might be going back to the warmth of the station or luxury hardly to be imagined their own beds but a few of the cars would be following the funeral van following it all the way to the mortuary rebus travelled in the front of flights own car both men spent the journey in desperate pursuit of a conversational opening and as a result said very little until they were near their destination do we know who she was asked rebus jean cooper said flight we found id in her handbag any reason for her to be on that path she was going home from work she worked in an offlicence nearby her sister tells us she finished work at seven when was the body found quarter to ten thats a fair gap weve got witnesses who saw her in the dog and duck thats a pub near where she works she used to go in there for a drink some evenings the barmaid reckons she left at nine or thereabouts rebus stared out of the windscreen the roads were still fairly busy considering the time of night and they passed groups of youthful and raucous pedestrians theres a club in stokie flight explained very popular but the buses have stopped by the time it comes out so everyone walks home rebus nodded then asked stokie flight smiled stoke newington you probably passed through it on your way from kings cross god knows said rebus it all looked the same to me i think my taxi driver had me down as a tourist we took so long from kings cross i think we might have come via the m rebus waited for flight to laugh but all he raised was a sliver of a smile there was another pause was this jean cooper single rebus asked at last married she wasnt wearing a wedding ring flight nodded separated she lived with her sister no kids and she went drinking by herself flight glanced towards rebus what are you saying rebus shrugged nothing its just that if she liked a good time maybe thats how she met her killer its possible at any rate whether she knew him or not the killer could have followed her from the pub well be talking to everybody who was there dont worry either that said rebus thinking aloud or the killer was waiting by the river for anyone who happened along somebody might have seen him well be asking around said flight his voice had taken on a much harder edge sorry said rebus a severe case of teaching my granny to suck eggs flight turned to him again they were about to take a left through some hospital gates i am not your granny he said and any comments you have to make are welcome maybe eventually youll come up with something i havent already thought of of course said rebus this couldnt have happened in scotland oh flight had a halfsneer on his face whys that then too civilised up there in the frozen north i remember when you had the worst football hooligans in the world maybe you still do only these days they look like butter wouldnt melt in their underpants but rebus was shaking his head no it wouldnt have happened to jean cooper thats all i meant our offlicences dont open on sunday rebus fell silent and stared fixedly at the windscreen keeping his thoughts to himself thoughts which ran along a very simple plane fuck you too pal over the years those four words had become his mantra fuck you too pal fytp it had taken the londoner only the length of a twentyminute car ride to show what he really thought of the scots as rebus got out of the car he glanced in through the rear window and saw for the first time the contents of the back seat he opened his mouth to speak but flight raised a knowing hand dont even ask he growled slamming shut the driversside door and listen im sorry about what i said rebus merely shrugged but his eyebrows descended in a private and thoughtful frown after all there had to be some logical explanation as to why a detective inspector would have a huge stuffed teddy bear in the back of his car at the scene of a murder it was just that rebus was damned if he could think of one right this second mortuaries were places where the dead stopped being people and turned instead into bags of meat offal blood and bone rebus had never been sick at the scene of a crime but the first few times he had visiteda mortuary the contents of his stomach had fairly quickly been rendered up for examination the mortuary technician was a gleeful little man with a livid birthmark covering a full quarter of his face he seemed to know dr cousins well enough and had prepared everything for the arrival of the deceased and the usual retinue of police officers cousins checked the postmortem room while jean coopers sister was taken quietly into an anteroom there to make the formal identification it took only a tearful few seconds after which she was escorted well away from the scene by consoling officers they would take her home but rebus doubted if she would get any sleep in fact knowing how long a scrupulous pathologist could take he was beginning to doubt that any of them would get to bed before morning eventually the body bag was brought into the postmortem room and the corpse of jean cooper placed on a slab beneath the hum and glare of powerful strip lighting the room was antiseptic but antique its tiled walls were cracking and there was a stinging aroma of chemicals voices were kept muffled not so much out of respect but from a strange kind of fear the mortuary after all was one vast memento mori and what was about to happen to jean coopers body would serve to remind each and every one of them that if the body were a temple then it was possible to loot that temple scattering its treasures revealing its precious secrets a hand landed gently on rebuss shoulder and he turned startled towards the man who was standing there man was by way of simplification this tall and unsmiling individual had cropped fair hair and the acneridden face of an adolescent he looked about fourteen but rebus placed him in his midtwenties youre the jock arent you there was interest in the voice but little emotion rebus said nothing fytp yeah thought so cracked the case yet have you the grin accompanying this question was threequarters sneer and onequarter scowl we dont need any help ah said george flight i see youve already met d c lamb i was just about to introduce you delighted said rebus gazing stonily at the jointhedots pattern of spots on lambs forehead lamb no surname in history rebus felt had ever been less deserved less accurate over by the slab dr cousins cleared his throat noisily gentlemen he said to the room at large it was little more than an indication that he was about to start work the room fell quiet again a microphone hung down from the ceiling to within a few feet of the slab cousins turned to the technician is this thing on now the technician nodded keenly from between arranging a row of clanging metallic instruments along a tray rebus knew all the instruments had seen them all in action the cutters and the saws and the drills some of them were electrical some needed a human force to drive them home the sounds the electrical ones made were horrible but at least the job was over quickly the manual tools made similarly revolting sounds that seemed to last forever still there would be an interval before that particular shop of horrors first of all there was the slow and careful business of removing the clothing and bagging it up for forensics as rebus and the others watched the two photographers clicked away one taking black and white shots and the other colour recording for posterity each stage of the process the video cameraman had given up however his equipment having jammed irreparably on one of the bargain tapes or at least that was the story which kept him away from the mortuary finally when the corpse was naked cousins pointed to a few areas meriting particular closeup shots then the forensics men moved in again armed with more lengths of sticky tape now that the body was unclothed the same process as was carried out on the towpath had to be gone through again not for nothing were these people known as sellotape men cousins wandered over towards the group where rebus flight and lamb stood id kill for a cup of tea george ill see what i can do philip what about isobel cousins looked back towards where isobel penny stood making another drawing of the corpse despite the welter of camera shots penny he called care for a cuppa her eyes opened a little and she nodded enthusiastically right said flight moving towards the door rebus thought the man seemed more than a little relieved to be leaving albeit temporarily nasty little chap cousins commented rebus wondered for a moment if he were talking about george flight but cousins waved a hand towards the corpse to do this sort of thing time after time without motive out of some need for well pleasure i suppose theres always a motive sir said rebus you just said so yourself pleasure thats his motive but the way he kills what he does theres some other motive there its just that we cant see it yet cousins stared at him rebus could see a warm light in his deep eyes well inspector let us hope somebody spots whatever it is before too long four deaths in as many months the mans as constant as the moon rebus smiled but we all know that werewolves are affected by the moon dont we cousins laughed it was deep and resonant and sounded extraordinarily out of place in this environment lamb wasnt laughing wasnt even smiling he was following little of this conversation and the realisation pleased rebus but lamb wasnt going to be left out i reckon hes barking mad hee get it well said cousins as though this joke was too wellworn even to merit acknowledgment must press on he turned towards the slab if youve finished gentlemen the forensics men nodded in unison jewellery removed they nodded again good then if you are ready i suggest we begin the beginning was never too awful measurements a physical description five feet and seven inches tall brown hair that sort of thing fingernail scrapings and clippings were deposited in yet more polythene bags rebus made a note to buy shares in whichever company manufactured these bags hed seen murder investigations go through hundreds of them slowly but determinedly things got worse swabs were taken from jean coopers vagina then cousins got down to some serious work large puncture wound to the throat from size of wound id say the knife itself had been twisted in the wound a small knife from the extent of the exit wound i would say the blade was about five inches long perhaps a little less and about an inch deep ending in a very fine point the skin surrounding the entry wound shows some bruising perhaps caused by the hiltguard or handle this would seem to indicate that the knife was driven in with a certain amount of force the hands and arms show no signs of defence wounding so the victim had no time in which to defend herself the possibility exists that she was approached from behind there is some colouring around the mouth and the victims lipstick had been slightly smeared across her right cheek if she was approached from behind a possible scenario would be that the attackers left hand closed over her mouth to stop her from screaming thus smearing the lipstick while the attacker stabbed with the right hand the wound to the throat shows a slight downward angle which would indicate someone taller than the victim cousins cleared his throat again well thought rebus so far they could strike the mortuary attendant and one of the photographers off the possible list of suspects everyone else in the room was five feet eight or over the pause in proceedings gave the onlookers a chance to shuffle their feet clear their own throats and glance at each other taking note of how pale this or that face was rebus was surprised at the pathologists scenarios that was supposed to be their job not his all the pathologists rebus had ever worked with had given the bare facts leaving the deductions to rebus himself but cousins obviously did not work that way perhaps he was a frustrated detective rebus still found it hard to believe that people came to pathology through choice tea appeared carried in three beakers on a plastic tray by inspector flight cousins and isobel penny took a cup each and flight himself took the other there were jealous stares from a few drymouthed officers rebus was among them now said cousins between sips im going to examine the anal wound it just kept on getting worse rebus tried to concentrate on what cousins was saying but it wasnt easy the same knife had been used to make several stabs to the anus there were friction marks on the thighs from where the tights had been roughly pulled down rebus looked over to isobel penny but apart from some slight heightening of the colour in her cheeks she seemed dispassionate a cool customer and no mistake but then shed probably seen worse in her time no no she couldnt possibly have seen worse than this could she the stomach is interesting cousins was saying the blouse has been torn away to expose the stomach and there are two lines of curved indentations in the skin enough to have bruised and broken the skin but there is little actual marking of the skin and no blood from which i would say that this act was perpetrated only after the stabbings after in fact the victim was dead there are a few dried stains on the stomach near these bite marks without prejudging past evidence from three very similar cases showed these stains to be saline in natureteardrops or perhaps beads of sweat im now going to take a deep body temperature rebus felt parched he was hot and the tiredness was seeping into his bones lack of sleep giving everything a hallucinatory quality there were halos around the pathologist his assistant and the technician the walls seemed to be moving and rebus dared not concentrate on them for fear that he would lose his balance he happened to catch lambs eye and the detective constable gave him an ugly grin and an uglier wink the body was washed now washed for the first time freed from a staining of light brown and black from the pale matt covering of blood cousins examined it again finding nothing new after which another set of fingerprints was taken then came the internal examination a deep incision was made down the front of the body blood samples were taken and handed to the forensics team as were samples of urine stomach contents liver body hair eyebrows included and tissue the process used to make rebus impatient it was obvious how the victim had died so why bother with everything else but he had learned over the years that what you could see the external injuries often wasnt as important as what you couldnt see the tiny secrets only a microscope or a chemical test could reveal so he had learned patience and exercised it now stifling a yawn every half minute or so not boring you am i cousinss voice was a polite murmur he looked up from his work and caught rebuss eyes then smiled not a bit said rebus thats all right then im sure wed all rather be at home tucked up in bed in than in this place only the birthmarked technician seemed doubtful as to the truth of this statement cousins was reaching a hand into the corpses chest ill be out of here as soon as i can it wasnt the sight of this examination rebus decided that turned men pale it was the accompanying sound effects the tearing of flesh as though a butcher were yanking meat from a flank the bubbling of liquids and the soft rasping of the cutting tools if he could somehow block up his ears maybe everything would be bearable but on the contrary his ears seemed extraordinarily sensitive in this room next time hed bring plugs of cotton wool with him next time the chest and abdominal organs were removed and taken to a clean slab where a hose was used to wash them clean before cousins dissected them the attendant meantime was called into action removing the brain with the help of a tiny powered circularsaw rebus had his eyes shut now but the room seemed to swirl all the same not long to go now though not long thank god but it wasnt just the sounds now was it it was the smell too that unmistakable aroma of raw meat it clung to the nostrils like perfume filling the lungs catching the back of the throat and clinging there so that eventually it became a tang in the mouth and he found himself actually tasting it his stomach moved momentarily but he rubbed it gently surreptitiously with a hand not surreptitiously enough if youre going to throw up it was lamb again like a succubus over his shoulder hissing go outside and then the chuckle throaty and slow like a stalled engine rebus halfturned his head and gave a dangerous smile soon enough the whole mess of matter was being put together again and rebus knew that by the time any grieving relatives viewed the mortal remains of jean cooper the body would look quite natural as ever by the end of the autopsy the room had been reduced to silent introspection each man and woman present was made of the same stuff as jean cooper and now they stood momentarily stripped of their individual personalities they were all bodies all animals all collections of viscera the only difference between them and jean cooper was that their hearts still pumped blood but one day soon enough each heart would stop and that wouldbe an end of it save for the possibility of a visit to this butchers shop this abattoir cousins removed his rubber gloves and washed his hands thoroughly accepted from the attendant a proffered sheaf of paper towels thats about it then gentlemen until penny can type up the notes murdered between nine oclock and ninethirty id guess same modus operandi as our socalled wolfman i think ive just examined his fourth victim ill get in anthony morrison tomorrow let him have a look at the teeth marks see what he says since everyone seemed to know except rebus rebus asked whos anthony morrison flight was first to answer a dentist a dental pathologist corrected cousins and quite a good one hes got details of the other three murders his analyses of the bite marks have been quite useful cousins turned to flight for confirmation of this but flights eyes were directed towards his shoes as if to say i wouldnt go that far well said cousins seeming to take the silent hint at any rate you know my findings its down to your lab chaps now theres precious little there cousins nodded back towards the scoopedout husk of the corpse to help with your investigation that being so i think ill go home to bed flight seemed to realise that cousins was displeased with him thank you philip and the detective lifted a hand to rest it against the pathologists arm cousins looked at the hand then at flight and smiled the performance at an end the audience began to shuffle out into the cold still darkness of an emerging day by rebuss watch it was four thirty he felt completely exhausted could happily have lain down on the lawn in front of the main building and taken a nap but flight was walking towards him carrying his bags come on he said ill give you a lift in his fragile state rebus felt this to be the nicest kindest thing anyone had said to him in weeks are you sure you have room he said i mean with the teddy bear and all flight paused or if youd prefer to walk inspector rebus threw up his hands in surrender then when the door was unlocked slipped into the passenger seat of flights red sierra the seat seemed to wrap itself around him here said flight handing a hip flask to rebus rebus unscrewed the top of the flask and sniffed it wont kill you flight called this was probably true the aroma was of whisky not great whisky not a smoky island malt but a decent enough proprietary brand well it would help keep him awake perhaps until they reached the hotel rebus toasted the windscreen and let the liquid trickle into his mouth flight got behind the steeringwheel and started the car then as the car idled accepted the flask from rebus and drank from it greedily how far to the hotel from here rebus asked about twenty minutes at this time of night said flight screwing tight the stopper and replacing the flask in his pocket thats if we stop for red lights you have my permission to run every red light you see flight laughed tiredly both men were wondering how to turn the conversation around to the autopsy best leave it until morning eh said rebus speaking for them both flight merely nodded and moved off waving to cousins and isobel penny who were about to get into their car rebus stared out of his side window to where dc lamb stood beside his own car a flash little sports model typical thought rebus just typical lamb stared back at him and then gave that threequarters sneer again fytp rebus mentally intoned fytp then he turned in his seat to examine the teddy bear behind him flight was resolutely refusing to take the hint and rebus though curious wasnt about to jeopardise whatever relationship he might be able to strike up with this man by asking the obvious question some things were always best left until morning the whisky had cleared his nostrils lungs and throat he breathed deeply seeing in his mind the little mortuary attendant that livid birthmark and isobel penny sketching like any amateur artist she might have been in front of a museum exhibit for all the emotion she had shown he wondered what her secret was the secret of her absolute calmness but thought he probably knew in any case her job had become merely that a job maybe one day rebus would feel the same way but he hoped not if anything flight and rebus said less during the drive to the hotel than they had done on the way to the mortuary the whisky was working on rebuss empty stomach and the interior of the car was oppressively hot he tried opening his window a quarter of an inch but the blast of chill air only made things worse the autopsy was being played out again before him the cutting tools the lifting of organs out of the body the incisions and inspections cousins s face peering at spongy tissue from no more than an inch away one twitch and his face would have been smothered in isobel penny watching all recording all the slice from throat to pubis london sped past him flight true to his word was cruising through some red lights and slowing merely for others there were still cars on the streets the city never slept nightclubs parties drifters the homeless sleepless dogwalkers all night bakeries and beigel shops some spelt beigel and some spelt bagel what the hell was a beigel wasnt that what they were always eating in woody allen films samples from her eyebrows for christs sake what use were samples from her eyebrows they should be concentrating on the attacker not the victim those teeth marks what was the dentists name again not a dentist a dental pathologist morrison yes that was it morrison like the street in edinburgh morrison street not too far from the brewery canal where the swans lived a single pair of swans what happened when they died did the brewery replace them so damned hot in this shiny red car rebus could feel his insides wanting to become his outsides the knife twisted in the throat a small knife he could almost visualise it something like a kitchen knife sharp sour taste in his mouth nearly there said flight just along shaftesbury avenue thats soho on the right by god weve cleaned that den up this past few years you wouldnt believe it you know ive been thinking where the body was found its not so far from where the krays used to live somewhere on lea bridge road i was just a young copper when they were on the go please said rebus they did somebody in stokie jack mcvitie i think it was jack the hat they called him can you stop here rebus blurted out flight looked at him whats up i need some air ill walk the rest of the way just stop the car please flight began to protest but pulled over to the kerb stepping out of the car rebus immediately felt better there was cold sweat on his forehead neck and back he breathed deeply flight deposited his bags on the pavement thanks again said rebus sorry about this just point me in the general direction just off the circus flight said rebus nodded i hope theres a night porter yes he was feeling much better its a quarter to five said flight youll probably catch the day shift coming on he laughed but the laugh died quickly and he gave rebus a serious nod of his head you made your point tonight john okay rebus nodded back john another chip from the iceberg or just good management thanks he said they shook hands are we still on for a meeting at ten lets make it eleven eh ill have someone pick you up from your hotel rebus nodded and picked up his bags then bent down again towards the cars back window good night teddy he said watch you dont get lost flight called to him from the car then the car moved off making a screeching uturn before roaring back the way they had come rebus looked around him shaftesbury avenue the buildings seemed about to swamp him theatres shops litter the debris from a sunday night out a dull roar preceded the arrival from one of the misty side streets of a dustcart the men were dressed in orange overalls they paid no attention to rebus as he trudged past them how long was this street it seemed to follow a vast curve longer than he had expected bloody london then he spotted eros atop his fountain but there was something wrong the circus was no longer a circus eros had been paved in so that traffic had to sweep past it rather than around it why the hell had anyone decided to do that a car was slowing behind him coming parallel with him white car with an orange stripe a police car the officer in the passenger seat had wound down his window and now called out to him excuse me sir do you mind telling me where youre going what the question stunned rebus stopped him in his tracks the car had stopped too and both driver and passenger were emerging are those your bags sir rebus felt it rise within him a shining hard steel pole of anger then he happened to catch sight of himself in the window of the patrol car a quarter to five on the streets of london a dishevelled unshaven man aman obviously without sleep carrying a suitcase a bag and a briefcase a briefcase who the hell would be carrying a briefcase around at this time of the morning rebus put down his luggage and rubbed at the bridge of his nose with one hand and before he knew what was happening his shoulders began moving his body convulsing with laughter the two uniformed officers were looking at one another rebus sniffed back the laughter and reached into his inside pocket one of the officers stepped back a pace take it easy son rebus said he produced his id im on your side the less cagey officer the passenger took the id from rebus examined it then handed it back youre a long way off your patch sir you dont have to tell me that said rebus whats your name son the constable was wary now bennett sir joey bennett i mean joseph bennett all right joey would you like to do me a favour the constable nodded do you know the prince royal hotel yes sir bennett began to point with his left hand its about fifty yards all right rebus interrupted just show me will you the young man said nothing will you do that constable bennett yes sir rebus nodded yes he could handle london he could take it on and win right he said moving off towards the prince royal oh he said turning back and taking in both men with his glance and bring my bags will you rebus had his back to them again but he could almost hear the sound of two jaws dropping open or he called back shall i just inform chief inspector laine that two of his officers harassed me on my first night as his guest in this fine city rebus kept on walking hearing the two officers pick up his luggage and hurry after him they were arguing as to whether or not they should leave the patrol car unlocked he was smiling despite everything a small victory a bit of a cheat but what the hell this was london after all this was shaftesbury avenue and that was showbiz home at last she had a good wash and after that she felt a little better she had brought in a black binliner from the boot of her car it contained the clothes she had been wearing cheap flimsy things tomorrow evening she would tidy the back garden and light a bonfire she wasnt crying any more she had calmed down she always calmed down afterwards from a polythene shopping bag she removed another polythene bag from which she removed the bloodied knife the kitchen sink was full of boiling soapy water the polythene bags went into the binliner with the clothes the knife went into the sink she washed it carefully emptying and refilling the washing bowl all the time humming to herself it wasnt a recognisable song nor even really a tune but it calmed her it soothed her the way her mothers hummed lullabies always had there all done it was hard work and she was pleased to be finished with it concentration was the key a lapse in concentration and you could make a slip then fail to spot that slip she rinsed the sink three times sluicing away every last speckle of blood and left the knife to dry on the drainingboard then she walked out into the hallway and paused at one of the doors while she found the key this was her secret room her picture gallery inside one wall was all but covered by oil and watercolour paintings three of these paintings were damaged beyond repair a pity since all three had been favourites her favourite now was a small countryside stream simple pale colours and a naive style the stream was in the foreground and beside it sat a man and a boy or it could have been a man and a girl it was hard to tell that was the problem with the naive style it was not as though she could even ask the artist for the artist had been dead for years she tried not to look at the other wall the wall directly opposite it was a horrid wall she didnt like what she could see there from the corner of one eye she decided that what she liked about her favourite painting was its size it was about ten inches by eight excluding the rather baroque gilt frame which did not suit it at all her mother had never had much taste in frames these petite dimensions added to the washed colours gave the whole a subtlety and a lack of vision a humility a gentleness which pleased her of course it depicted no great truth this painting in fact it was a monstrous lie the absolute opposite of the facts there had been no stream no touching scene of father and child there had been only horror that was why velazquez was her favourite painter shadowplay rich shades of black skulls and suspicion the dark heart exposed the dark heart she nodded to herself she had seen things felt things which few were ever privileged to witness this was her life this was her existence and the painting began to mock her the stream turning into a cruel turquoise grin calmly humming to herself again she picked up a pair of scissors from a nearby chair and began to slash at the painting with regular vertical strokes then horizontal strokes then vertical again tearing and tearing its heart out until the scene disappeared forever underground and this said george flight is where the wolfman was born rebus looked it was a depressing location for a birth a cobblestoned alley a culdesac the buildings three storeys high every window either boarded up or barred and grilled the black bags of rubbish looked to have been languishing by the side of the road for weeks a few had been impaled on the steel spiked fencing in front of the shutup windows and these bags leaked their rank contents the way a cracked sewage pipe would nice he said the buildings are mainly disused local bands use the basement of one of them as a practice room and make quite a racket while theyre about it flight pointed to a barred and grilled window and i think thats a clothing manufacturer or distributor anyway he hasnt been back since we started taking an interest in the street oh rebus sounded interested but flight shook his head nothing suspicious in that believe me these guys use slave labour bangladeshis mostly illegal immigrants the last thing they want is policemen sniffing around theyll move the machines and set up again somewhere else rebus nodded he was looking around the culdesac trying to remember from the photographs he had been sent just where the body had been found it was there flight was pointing to a gate in the iron railings ah yes rebus remembered now not at street level but down some stone steps leading to a basement the victim had been found at the bottom of the steps same modus operandi as last night down to the bite marks on the stomach rebus opened his briefcase and brought out the manila folder opening it at the sheet he needed maria watkiss age thirtyeight occupation prostitute body found on tuesday th january by council workmen estimated that victim had been murdered two to three days prior to being discovered rudimentary attempt had been made to conceal body flight nodded towards one of the impaled binliners he emptied a bag of rubbish out over her it pretty well covered the body the rats alerted the workmen rats dozens of them from all accounts theyd had a bloody good feed had those rats rebus was standing at the top of the steps we reckon said flight the wolfman must have paid her for a kneetrembler and brought her down here or maybe she brought him she worked out of a pub on old street its a five minute walk we interviewed the regulars but nobody saw her leave with anyone maybe he was in a car its more than possible judging by the physical distance between the murder sites he must be pretty mobile it says in the report that she was married thats right her old man tommy he knew she was on the game it didnt bother him so long as she handed over the cash and he didnt report her missing flight wrinkled his nose not tommy he was on a bender at the time practically comatose with drink when we went to see him he said later that maria often disappeared for a few days told us she used to go off to the seaside with one or two of her regular johns i dont suppose youve been able to find these clients leave it out flight laughed as though this were the best joke hed heard all week for the record tommy thought one of them might be called bill or will does that help it narrows things down rebus said with a smile in any event said flight i doubt tommy would have come to us for help if she hadnt come back hes got form as long as your inside leg to tell you the truth he was our first suspect it follows every policeman knew it as a universal truth most murders happen in the family a couple of years back flight was saying maria was beaten up pretty badly a hospital case in fact tommys doing shed been seeing another man and he hadnt been paying for it if you understand my meaning and a couple of years before that tommy served time for aggravated assault it would have been rape if we could have got the woman into the witness box but she was scared seven colours shitless there were witnesses but we were never going to pin rape on him so aggravated assault it was he got eight months a violent man then you could say that with a record of particular violence against women flight nodded it looked good at first we thought we could pin marias murder on him and make it stick but nothing added up he had an alibi for openers then there were the bite marks not his size according to the dentist you mean dr morrison yes thats right i call him the dentist to annoy philip flight scratched at his chin the elbow of his leather jacket gave a creak anyway nothing added up and then when the second murder came along well we knew we were working in a different league from tommy youre absolutely sure of that john im not absolutely sure what colour of socks ive put on in the morning im sometimes not even sure that ive put socks on at all but im fairly sure this isnt tommy watkisss work he gets his kicks from watching arsenal not mutilating dead women rebuss eyes had not left flights your socks are blue he said flight looked down saw that this was indeed the case and smiled broadly theyre also different shades rebus added bloody hell so they are id still like to talk to mr watkiss rebus continued no hurry and if its all right with you flight shrugged whatever you say sherlock now shall we get out of this shithole or is there anything else you want to see no said rebus lets get out of here they started back towards the mouth of the culdesac where flights car waited whats this part oftowncalled again shoreditch remember your nursery rhymes when i am rich say the bells of shoreditch yes rebus had a vague memory a memory of his mother holding him on her knee or maybe it was his father singing him songs and bouncing the knee in time it had never happened that way but he had a memory of it all the same they were at the end of the culdesac now a larger road flowed past busy with daytime traffic the buildings were black with grime windows thick with the stuff offices of some kind warehouses no shops save one selling professional kitchenware no houses or even flats in the upper storeys by the look of it no one to hear a muffled scream at the dead of night no one to see from an unwashed window the killer slinking away dappled with blood rebus stared back into the culdesac then up at the corner of the first building where a barely legible plaque bore the culdesacs name wolf street el this was the reason why the police had come to call the killer wolfman nothing to do with the savagery of his attacks or the teeth marks he left at the scene but simply because as flight had said this was so far as they could know his place of birth the place where he had defined himself for the very first time he was the wolfman he could be anywhere but that was relatively unimportant what was more important was that he could be anyone anyone at all in this city of ten million faces ten million secret lairs where next he said opening the passenger door kilmore road said flight he exchanged a glance with rebus acknowledging the irony kilmore road it is said rebus getting into the car the day had started early rebus waking after three hours sleep and unable to drop off again switched on the radio in his room and listened to the morning news programme as he dressed not knowing exactly what the day would bring he dressed casually caramel cord trousers light jacket shirt no tweeds or tie today he wanted a bath but the facilities on his floor of the hotel were locked he would have to ask in reception near the stairs there stood an automatic shoeshine machine he polished the toes of both wellworn black shoes before starting down to breakfast the restaurant area was busy most of the customers looking like businessmen or tourists the days newspapers had been arranged across one vacant table and rebus lifted a guardian before being directed to a table laid for one by the harassed waitress breakfast was mainly help yourself with juices cereals and fruit crammed onto a large central display a pot of coffee appeared unasked for on his table as did a toastrack filled with cool half slices of lightly tanned bread not so much toasted as wafted in front of a lightbulb rebus thought to himself as he smeared a portion of butter across one pitiful triangle the full english breakfast consisted of one slice of bacon one warm tomato from a tin three small mushrooms a sickly egg and a curious little sausage rebus wolfed down the lot the coffee wasnt quite strong enough but he finished the pot anyway and asked for a refill all the time he was flicking through the paper but only on a second examination did he find anything about the previous nights murder a short barebones paragraph near the foot of page four bare bones he looked around him an embarrassed looking couple were trying to hush their two vociferous children dont thought rebus dont stifle them let them live who could know what might happen tomorrow they might be killed the parents might be killed his own daughter was here in london somewhere living in a flat with his exwife he should get in touch he would get in touch a businessman at a corner table rustled his tabloid noisily drawing rebuss attention towards the front cover wolfman bites again ah that was more like it rebus reached for a final halfslice of toast only to find that hed run out of butter a hand landed heavily on his shoulder from behind causing him to drop the toast startled he turned to see george flight standing there morning john hello george sleep okay flight pulled out the chair across from rebus and sat down heavily hands in his lap not really what about you i managed a few hours rebus was about to turn his neararrest on shaftesbury avenue into a morning anecdote but decided to save it there might come a time when they would need a funny story do you want some coffee flight shook his head he examined the food on display some orange juice wouldnt go amiss though rebus was about to rise but flight waved him down and rose himself to fetch a glassful which he promptly downed he squeezed his eyelids together tastes like powdered he said better give me some of that coffee after all rebus poured another cup seen that he said nodding towards the corner table flight glanced at the tabloid and smiled well its their story now as much as ours only difference is well keep things in perspective im not sure just what that perspective is flight stared at rebus but said nothing he sipped at the coffee theres a conference in the murder room at eleven oclock i didnt think wed be able to make it so i left laine in charge he likes being in charge and what are we going to be doing well we could go up to the lea and check on the housetohouse or we could visit mrs coopers place of employment rebus didnt look enthusiastic or i could give you a tour of the other three murder scenes rebus perked up okay said flight the scenic route it is drink up inspector theres a long day ahead just one thing said rebus lifting the cup halfway to his mouth why the nursemaid treatment id have thought youd have better things to do with your time than act as my chauffeur flight examined rebus closely should he tell rebus the real reason or invent some story he opted for invention and shrugged just easing you into the case thats all rebus nodded slowly but flight knew he didnt wholly believe him out at the car rebus glanced in through the back window seeking the teddy bear i killed it flight said unlocking the drivers door the perfect murder so whats edinburgh like rebus knew flight wasnt talking about the tourist edinburgh home to the festival and the castle he was talking about criminal edinburgh which was another city altogether well he replied weve still got a drug problem and loan sharks seem to be making a comeback but other than that things are fairly quiet at the moment but flight reminded him you did have that child killer a few years back rebus nodded and you solved it rebus made no reply to this theyd managed to keep out of the media the fact that it had been personal had not exactly been serial thousands of man hours solved it he said casually thats not what the chiefs think said flight they think youre some kind of serial killer guru theyre wrong said rebus im just a copper the same as you are so who exactly are the chiefs whose idea was it but flight shook his head im not exactly sure i mean i know who the chiefs are laine chief superintendent pearson but not which one of them is responsible for your being here it was laines name on the letter said rebus knowing this didnt really mean anything then he watched the midday pedestrians scurrying along the pavements the traffic was at a standstill he and flight had come just over three miles in the best part of half an hour roadworks double and triple parking a succession of traffic lights and pedestrian crossings and some maddening tactics from selfish drivers had reduced their progress to a crawl flight seemed to read his mind well be out of this in a couple of minutes he said he was thinking over what rebus had said just a copper the same as you are but rebus had caught the child killer hadnt he the files on the case credited him with the collar a collar which had earned him the rank of inspector no rebus was just being modest that was it and you had to admire him for that a couple of minutes later they had moved a further fifteen yards and were about to pass a narrow junction with a no entry sign at its mouth flight glanced up this sidestreet time to take a few liberties he said turning the steeringwheel hard one side of the street was lined with marketstalls rebus could hear the stallholders sharpening their patter against the whetstone of passing trade nobody paid the slightest attention to a car travelling the wrong way down a oneway street until a boy pulling a mobile stall from one side of the road to the other halted their progress a meaty fist banged on the drivers side window flight rolled down the window and a head appeared extraordinarily pink and round and totally hairless oi whats your fucking game then the words died in his throat oh its you mister flight didnt recognise the motor hello arnold flight said quietly his eyes on the ponderous movement of the stall ahead hows tricks the man laughed nervously keeping me nose clean mister flight only now did flight deign to turn his head towards the man thats good he said rebus had never heard those two words sound so threatening their road ahead was now clear keep it that way flight said moving off rebus stared at him waiting for an explanation sex offender flight said two previous children the psychiatrists say hes okay now but i dont know with that sort of thing one hundred percent sure isnt quite sure enough hes been working the market now for a few weeks loading and unloading sometimes he gives me good gen you know how it is rebus could imagine flight had this huge stronglooking man in the palm of his hand if flight told the markettraders what he knew about arnold not only would arnold lose his job but hed be in for a good kicking as well maybe the man was all right now maybe he was in psychiatric parlance a fully integrated member of society he had paid for his crimes and now was trying to go straight and what happened policemen men like flight and like rebus himself if he was being honest used his past against him to turn him into an informant ive got a couple of dozen snitches flight went on not all like arnold some are in it for the cash some simply because they cant keep their gobs shut telling what they know to somebody like me makes them feel important makes them feel like theyre in the know a place this size youd be lost without a decent network of snitches rebus merely nodded but flight was warming to his subject in some ways london is too big to take in but in other ways its tiny everyone knows everyone else theres north and south of the river of course those are like two different countries but the way the place divides the loyalties the same old faces sometimes i feel like a village bobby on his bicycle because flight had turned towards him rebus nodded again inside he was thinking here we go the same old story london is bigger better rougher tougher and more important than anywhere else he had come across this attitude before attending courses with yard men or hearing about it from visitors to london flight hadnt seemed the type but really everybody was the type rebus too in his time had exaggerated the problems the police faced in edinburgh so that he could look tougher and more important in somebodys eyes the facts still had to be faced police work was all about paperwork and computers and somebody stepping forward with the truth nearly there said flight kilmore roads the third on the left kilmore road was part of an industrial estate and therefore would be deserted at night it nestled in a maze of back streets about two hundred yards from a tube station rebus had always looked on tube stations as busy places sited in populous areas but this one stood on a narrow back street well away from high road bus route or railway station i dont get it he said flight merely shrugged and shook his head anyone coming out of the tube station at night found themselves with a lonely walk through the streets past netcurtained windows where televisions blared flight showed him that a popular route was to cut into the industrial estate and across the parkland behind it the park was flat and lifeless boasting a single set of goalposts two orange traffic cones substituting for the missing set on the other side of the park three hirise blocks and some lorise housing sprang up may jessop had been making for one of those houses where her parents lived she was nineteen and had a good job but it kept her late at her office so it wasnt until ten oclock that her parents started to worry an hour later there was a knock at the door her father rushed to answer relieved only to find a detective there bearing the news that mays body had been found and so it went there seemed no connection between the victims no real geographical link other than that as flight pointed out all the killings had been committed north of the river by which he meant north of the thames what did a prostitute an office manageress and the assistant in an offlicence have in common rebus was damned if he knew the third murder had taken place much further west in north kensington the body had been found beside a railway line and transport police had handled the investigation initially the body was that of shelley richards fortyone years old unmarried and unemployed she was the only coloured victim so far as they drove through notting hill ladbroke grove and north ken as flight termed it rebus was intrigued by the scheme of things a street of extraordinarily grand houses would suddenly give way to a squalid rubbishstrewn road with boardedup windows sand benchbound tramps the wealthy and the poor living almost cheek by jowl it would never happen in edinburgh in edinburgh certain boundaries were observed but this this was incredible as flight put it race riotsone side diplomats the other the spot where shelley richards had died was the loneliest the most pathetic so far rebus clambered down from the railway line down the embankment lowered himself over the brick wall and dropped to the ground his trousers were smeared with green moss he brushed them with his hands but to little effect too get to the car where flight was waiting he had to walk under a railway bridge his footsteps echoed as he tried to avoid the pools of water and the rubbish and then he stopped listening there was a noise all around him a sort of wheezing as if the bridge itself were drawing its dying breath he looked up and saw the dark outlines of pigeons still against the supporting girders cooing softly that was what he could hear not wheezing at all there was a sudden rumble of thunder as a train passed overhead and the pigeons took to the wing flapping around his head he shivered and walked back out into sunlight then finally it was back to the murder room this was in fact a series of rooms covering most of the top floor of the building rebus reckoned there to be about twenty men and women working flat out when flight and he entered the largest of the rooms there was little to differentiate the scene from that of any murder investigation anywhere in the country officers were busy on telephones or working at computer terminals clerical staff moved from desk to desk with seemingly endless sheafs of paper a photocopier was spewing out more paper in a corner of the room and two deliverymen were wheeling a new fivedrawer filing cabinet into position beside the three which already stood against one wall on another wall was a detailed street map of london with the murder sites pinpointed coloured tapes ran from these sites to spaces on the wall where pictures details and notes had been pinned a duty roster and progress chart took up what space was left all very efficient but the faces told rebus their own story everyone here working hard as they were was waiting for the lucky break flight was immediately in tune with the glaze of efficiency in the office firing off questions how did the meeting go any word from lambeth he explained to rebus that the police lab was based there any news on last night what about housetohouse well does anyone know anything there were shrugs and shakes of the head they were simply going through the motions waiting for that lucky break but what if it didnt come rebus had an answer to that you made your own luck a smaller room off this main office was being used as a communications centre keeping the murder room in touch with the investigation and off this room were two smaller offices yet each crammed with three desks this was where the senior detectives worked both were empty sit down flight said he picked up the telephone on his desk and dialled while he waited for an answer he surveyed with a frown the fourinch high pile of paper which had appeared in his intray during the morning hello gino he said into the mouthpiece george flight here can i order some sandwiches salami salad he looked to rebus for confirmation that this would be acceptable on brown bread please gino better make it four rounds thanks he cut the connection and dialled again only two numbers this time an internal call gino has a cafe round the corner he explained to rebus he makes great sandwiches and he delivers then oh hello inspector flight here can we have some tea a decent sized pot should do it were in the office is it wet milk today or that powdered crap great thanks he dropped the receiver back into its cradle and spread his hands as if some feat of magic had just been performed this is your lucky day john weve got real milk for a change so what now flight shrugged then slapped a hand on the bulging intray you could always read through this little lot keep yourself uptodate with the investigation reading about it isnt going to do any good on the contrary said flight it helps you answer any awkward questions that may be asked by those on high how tall was the victim what colour was her hair who found her its all in there she was five feet seven and her hair was brown as to who found her i dont give a tinkers cuss flight laughed but rebus was being serious murderers dont just appear he continued theyre created to create a serial killer takes time its taken this guy years to make himself what he is whats he been doing during that time he may well be a loner but hes probably got a job maybe even a wife and kids somebody must know something maybe his wife wonders where he goes at night or how blood got onto the tips of his shoes or where her kitchen knife disappeared to all right johnflight spread his hands again this time in a gesture of peacemaking rebus realised that his voice had been gettinglouder calm down a little for a start when you go on like that i can hardly make out a word youre saying but i get your point so what are we supposed to do publicity we need the publics help we need anything theyve got we already get dozens of calls a day anonymous tipoffs nutters who want to confess people snitching on their next door neighbour people with grudges maybe even a few with genuine suspicions we check them all out and weve got the media on our side the chief super will be interviewed a dozen times today newspapers magazines radio tv we give them what we can and we tell them to spread the word weve got the best bloody liaison officer in the country working round the clock to make sure the public knows what were dealing with here there was a knock on the already open door and a wpc carried a tray into the room and left it on flights desk ill be mother shall if he said already starting to pour the tea into two plain white mugs whats the liaison officers name rebus asked he knew a liaison officer himself she too was the best there was but she wasnt in london she was back in edinburgh cath farraday said flight detective inspector cath farraday he sniffed the milk carton before pouring a dollop into his tea if you stick around long enough youll get to meet her shes a bit of a cracker is our cath mind you if she heard me talking about her like that shed have my head on a plate flight chuckled and salad on the side came a voice from just outside the door flight flinching spilt tea down his shirt and jumped to his feet the door was swinging open now to reveal a platinum blonde woman leaning against the jamb her arms folded one leg casually crossed over the other rebuss gaze was drawn to her eyes which were slanted like a cats they made her whole face seem narrower than it was her lips were thin lined with a thin coat of bright red lipstick her hair had a hard metallic look to it reflecting the look of the woman herself she was older than either of the men in the room by several years and if age hadnt withered her the frequent use of cosmetics had her face was lined and puffy rebus didnt like a lot of makeupon a woman but plenty of men did hello cath said flight trying to regain at least an outer shell of composure we were just talkingabout me i know she unfolded her arms and took a couple of steps into the room extending a hand to rebus you must be inspector rebus she said ive heard all about you oh rebus looked to flight whose attention however was fixed on cath farraday i hope george here is giving you an easy ride rebus shrugged ive had worse her eyes became more feline still ill bet she said she lowered her voice but watch your back inspector not everyones as nice as george how would you feel if someone from london suddenly started to poke his nose into one of your cases hmm cath said flight theres no need for she raised a hand silencing him just a friendly warning george one inspector to another weve got to look after our own havent we she glanced at her watch must be going ive a meeting with pearson in five minutes nice to have met you inspector bye george and then she was gone the door left wide open a strong perfume lingering in the room both men were silent for a moment rebus was the first to speak i believe your description was a cracker george remind me never to let you arrange a blind date for me it was late afternoon and rebus sat in flights office alone a pad of paper in front of him on the desk he tapped his pen like a drumstick against the edge of the table and stared at the two names he had written so far dr anthony morrison tommy watkiss these were people he wanted to see he drew a thick line beneath them and wrote two more names rhona samantha these too were people he wanted to see though for personal reasons flight had gone off to see chief inspector lame on another floor of the building the invitation did not extend to rebus he picked up the last remaining quarter of his salami sandwich but thought better of it and tossed it into the offices metal bin too salty and what kind of meat wassalami anyway he now had a craving for more tea he thought flight had dialled to order up the first pot but decided against trying it he didnt want to make a fool of himself did he it would be just his luck to get through to chief superintendent pearson just a friendly warning the point was not lost on rebus he crumpled up his list and threw that in the bin too then got up out of his chair and made for the main office he knew he should be doing something or should at least seem to be doing something they had brought him four hundred miles to help them but he couldnt for the life of him see any gaps in their investigation they were doing everything they could but to no avail he was just another straw to be clutched at just another chance for that elusive lucky break he was studying the wallmap when the voice sounded behind him sir he turned to see one of the murder room team standing there yes someone to see you sir me well youre the most senior detective around at the moment sir rebus considered this who is it the officer checked the scrap of paper in his hand a dr frazer sir rebus considered a moment longer all right he said turning back towards the tiny office give me a minute and then send him in he stopped oh and bring some tea will you yes sir said the officer he waited until rebus had left the room then turned to the others seated at their desks and smiling at him the cheek of these fucking jocks he said loud enough for everyone to hear remind me to piss in the teapot before i take it in dr frazer turned out to be a woman what was more as she entered the office she was attractive enough to have rebus halfrise from his desk in welcome inspector rebus thats right dr frazer i presume yes she showed a row of perfect teeth as rebus invited her to take a seat though id better explain rebus fixed his eyes on her own and nodded he kept his eyes fixed on hers for fear that otherwise they would be drawn down to her slim tanned legs to that point where an inch above the knee her cream skirt began hugging her thighs he had taken her body in with single sweeping glance she was tall almost as tall as him her legs were bare and long her body supple she was wearing a jacket to match the skirt and a plain white blouse set off by a single string of pearls there was a slight exquisite scar on her throat just above the pearls and her face was tanned and without makeup her jaw square her hair straight and black tied back with a black band so that a shock of it fell onto one shoulder she had brought a soft black leather briefcase into the room which she now held up in her lap running her fingers around the handles as she spoke im not a medical doctor rebus registered slight surprise im a doctor courtesy of my phd i teach psychology at university college and youre american said rebus canadian actually yes he should have known there was a soft lilt to her accent something few americans possessed and she wasnt quite as nasal as the tourists who stopped in princes street to get a picture of the scott monument im sorry he said so what can i do for you dr frazer well i did talk to someone on the telephone this morning and i told them of my interest in the wolfman case rebus could see it all now another nutter with some crazy idea about the wolfman thats probably what the murder room had thought so theyd decided to play a joke on him arranged a meeting without letting him know and then flight forewarned had made himself scarce well the joke was on them rebus could always find time for an attractive woman crazy or not after all he had nothing better to do had he go on he said id like to try to put together a profile of the wolfman a profile a psychological profile like an identikit but building up a picture of the mind rather than the face ive been doing some research on criminal profiling and i think i can use similar criteria to help you come to a clearer understanding of the killer she paused what do you think im wondering whats in it for you dr frazer perhaps im just being public spirited she looked down into her lap and smiled but really what im looking for is validation of my methods so far ive been experimenting with old police cases now i want to tackle something real rebus satback in his chair and picked up the pen again pretending to study it when he looked up he saw that she was studying him she was a psychologist after all he put down the pen it isnt a game he said and this isnt a lecture theatre four women are dead a maniac is loose somewhere and right now were quite busy enough following up all the leads and the false trails weve got why should we make time for you dr frazer she coloured her cheekbones blushed a deep red but she seemed to have no ready answer rebus hadnt much to add so he too sat in silence his mouth was sour and dry his throat coated in a layer of resin where was the tea eventually she spoke all i want to do is read through the material on the case rebus found some spare sarcasm thats all he tapped the mound of paperwork in the intray no problem then itll only take you a couple of months she was ignoring him fumbling with the briefcase she produced a slim orange folder here she said stonily just read this itll only take you twenty minutes its one of the profiles i did of an american serial killer if you think it has no validity in helping to identify the killer or target where he might have struck next fair enough ill leave rebus took the file oh god he thought not more psychology relating involving motivating hed had his fill of psychology on the management training courses but then again he didnt want her to leave he didnt want to be left sittinghere on his own with everyone in the murder room smirking at their little trick he opened the folder drew out a typed and bound thesis about twentyfive pages long and began to read she sat watching him waiting for a question perhaps rebus read with his chin held up so that she wouldnt see the sagging folds of flesh on his neck and with his shoulders back making the best of his admittedly not very muscular chest he cursed his parents for not feeding him up as a child he had grown skinny and when eventually he had started to put weight on it had been to his gut and his backside not his chest and arms backside chest arms he gazed hard at the words in front of him but aware of her body resting in his line of peripheral vision just above the top edge of the paper he didnt even know her first name perhaps he never would he frowned as though deep in thought and read through the opening page by page five he was interested and by page ten he felt there might be something in it after all a lot of it was speculative be honest john it was almost all conjecture but there were a few points where she made a telling deduction he saw what it was her mind worked in a different orbit from a detectives they circled the same sun however and now and thenthe satellites touched and what harm could come from letting her do a profile for the wolfman at worst it would lead them up another dead end at best he might enjoy some female company during his stay in london yes some pleasant female company which reminded him he wanted to telephone his exwife and arrange a visit he read through the final pages quickly all right he said closing the thesis very interesting she seemed pleased and useful he hesitated before replying perhaps she wanted more from him than that but worth letting me have a go on the wolfman he nodded slowly ruminatively and her face lit up rebus couldnt help returning her smile there was a knock at the door come in he called it was flight he was carrying a tray swimming with spilt tea i believe you asked for some refreshment he said then he caught sight of dr frazer and rebus delighted in the stunned look on his face christ said flight looking from woman to rebus to woman before realising that he had somehow to justify his outburst they told me you were with someone john but they didnt i mean i didnt know he tumbled to a halt mouth still open and placed the tray on the desk before turning towards her im inspector george flight he said reaching out a hand dr frazer she replied lisa frazer as their hands met flight looked towards rebus from the corner of his eye rebus beginning to feel a little more at home in the metropolis gave him a slow cheerful wink christ she left him a couple of books to read one the serial mind was a series of essays by various academics it included sealing the bargain modes of motivation in the serial killer by lisa frazer university of london lisa nice name no mention of her doctorate though the other book was an altogether heavier affair dense prose linked by charts and graphs and diagrams patterns of massmurder by gerald q macnaughtie macnaughtie that had to be a joke of some kind but on the dustjacket rebus read that professor macnaughtie was canadian by birth and taught at the university of columbia nowhere could he find out what the q stood for he spent what was left of the office day working through the books paying most attention to lisa frazers essay which he read twice and to the chapter in macnaughties book concentrating on patterns of mutilation he drank tea and coffee and two cans of fizzy orange but the taste in his mouth was sour and as he read on he began to feel physically dirty made grubby by tale after tale of casual horror when he got up to visit the bathroom at a quarter to five everyone in the outer office had already quit for the day but rebus hardly registered the fact his mind was elsewhere flight who had left him to his own devices for most of the afternoon came into the office at six fancy a jar rebus shook his head flight sat down on the edge of the chair whats the matter rebus waved a hand over the books flight examined the cover of one oh he said not exactly bedtime reading i take it not exactly its just evil flight nodded got to keep a perspective though john eh otherwise theyd go on getting away with it if its so horrible we all shy away from the truth then everybody gets away with murder and worse than murder rebus looked up whats worse than murder lots of things what about someone who tortures and rapes a sixmonth old child and films the whole thing so he can show it to similarly minded individuals rebuss words were barely audible youre kidding but he knew flight was not happened three months ago flight said we havent caught the bastard but scotland yard have got the video and a few more besides ever seen a thalidomide porn film rebus shook his head wearily flight leaned down so that their heads were nearly touching dont go soft on me john he said quietly thats not going to solve anything youre in london now not the highlands the top deck of a midday bus isnt safe here never mind a towpath after dark nobody sees any of it london gives you a thick skin and temporary blindness you and i cant afford to be blind but we can afford the occasional drink coming he was on his feet now rubbing his hands lecture over rebus nodded and rose slowly to his feet only a quick one though he said ive got an appointment this evening an appointment reached by way of a packed tube train he checked his watch pm did the rush hour never stop the compartment smelt of vinegar and stale air and three notsopersonal stereos battled it out above the roar of speeding and juddering the faces around rebus were blank temporary blindness flight was right they shut it all out because to acknowledge what they were going through was to realise the monotony the claustrophobia and the sheer agony of it all rebus was depressed and tired but he was also a tourist so it had to be savoured thus the tube journey instead of a closeted taxi ride besides hed been warned about how expensive the black cabs were and he had checked in his az and found that his destination was only a quarter of an inch from an underground station so rebus travelled through the underground and tried hard not to look out of place not to gawp at the buskers and the beggars not to pause in a busy conduit the better to read this or that advertising poster a tramp actually entered his carriage at one stop and as the doors closed and the train pulled away again he began to rave but his audience were deaf and dumb as well as blind and they successfully ignored his existence until the next stop where daunted he slouched from the carriage onto the platform as the engine pulled away rebus could hear his voice again coming from the next carriage along it had been an astonishing performance not by the tramp but by the passengers they had closed off their minds refusing involvement would they do the same if they saw a fight taking place saw a thickset man stealing a tourists wallet yes they probably would this wasnt an environment of good and evil it was a moral vacuum and that frightened rebus more than anything else but there were compensations of a sort every beautiful woman he saw reminded him of lisa frazer squeezed into one compartment on the central line he found himself pressed against a young blonde girl her blouse was undone to the cleft of her breasts giving the taller rebus an occasionally breathtaking view of slopes and swells she glanced up from her paperback and caught him staring he looked away quickly but felt her cold gaze focusing on the side of his head every man is a rapist hadnt someone said that once traces of salt bite marks on the the train slowed into another station mile end his stop the girl was getting out too he lingered on the platform until she was gone without really knowing why then headed up towards ground level and a taste of fresh air taste of monoxide more like three lanes of traffic were jammed in either direction the result of an articulated lorry failing to reverse through the narrow gates of some building two exasperated constables were trying to untie this gordian knot and for the first time it struck rebus how silly their tall rounded hats looked the scottishissue flat caps were more sensible they also made less of a target at football matches rebus wished the constables a silent good luck and made for gideon park not a park but a road and for number a threestorey house which according to the front doors entry system had been split somehow into four flats he pressed the secondfrombottom buzzer and waited the door was opened by a tall skinny teenage girl her long straight hair dyed black three earrings in each ear she smiled and gave him an unexpected hug hello dad she said samantha rebus led her father up a narrow staircase to the firstfloor flat she shared with her mother if the change in his daughter was striking then the change in rebuss exwife was doubly so he had never seen her looking so good there were strands of grey in her hair but it had been cut fashionably short and there was a healthy suntanned look to her face a gleam to her eyes they studied one another without words then embraced quickly john rhona she had been reading a book he looked at its cover to the lighthouse virginia woolf tom wolfes more my style he said the livingroom was small cramped even but a lot of clever work with shelves and wallmirrors gave the impression of space it was a strange sensation seeing things he recognised that chair a cushioncover a lamp things from his life with rhona now transported to this pokey flat but he praised the interior decoration the snug feel of the place and then they sat down to drink tea rebus had brought gifts record tokens for samantha chocolates for rhona received with a knowing coded look between the two women two women samantha was no longer a child her figure might retain a childs suppleness but her way of moving her actions her face were all fully formed and adult you look good rhona she paused accepting the compliment thank you john she said at last he noted her inability to say the same of him mother and daughter shared another of their secret looks it was as though their time together had led to a kind of telepathy between them so that during the course of the evening rebus was to do most of the talking nervously filling the many silent gaps in the conversation none of it was very important anyway he spoke of edinburgh without going into detail about his work this wasnt easy since work apart he did very little rhona asked about mutual friends and he had to admit that he saw none of the old crowd she talked about her teaching of property prices in london rebus heard nothing in her tone to suggest that he should pay something towards a bigger place for his kin after all it had been her idea to leave him no real grounds except as shed put it that shed loved a man but married a job then samantha told him about her secretarial course secretarial said rebus trying to sound enthusiastic samanthas reply was cool i told you about it in one of my letters oh there was another break in the conversation rebus wanted to burst out i read your letters sammy i devour your letters and im sorry i so seldom write back but you know what a lousy letterwriter i am how much effort it takes how little time and energy i have so many cases to solve so many people depending on me but he said nothing of course he said nothing instead they played out this little sham scenario polite chitchat in a tiny livingroom off bow road everything to say saying nothing it was unbearable truly unbearable rebus moved his hands to his knees spreading the fingers ready to rise to his feet in the expected manner of one about to leave well its been nice seeing you but theres a starched hotel bed waiting for me and a machine to dispense ice and another to shine shoes he started to rise and the buzzer sounded two short two long samantha fairly flew to the stairs rhona smiled kenny she explained oh samanthas current gentleman rebus nodded slowly the understanding father sammy was sixteen shed left school a secretarial course at college not a boyfriend a gentleman what about you rhona he said she opened her mouth forming a reply when the thump of feet climbing the stairs closed it for her samanthas face was flushed as she led her gentleman by his hand into the room instinctively rebus stood up dad this is kenny kenny was clad in black leather zipup jacket and black leather trousers with boots reaching almost to his knees he squeaked as he moved and in his free hand he carried an upturned crashhelmet from which poked the fingers of a pair of black leather gloves two fingers were prominent and appeared to be pointing directly at rebus kenny removed his hand from samanthas grip and held it out towards her father wotcher the voice was abrupt the tone deep and confident he had lank black hair almost parted at centre some residual acne on cheeks and neck a days growth of stubble rebus shook the hot hand with little enthusiasm hello kenny rhona said then for rebuss benefit kennys a motorcycle messenger oh said rebus taking his seat again yeah thats right kenny enthused down the city he turned to rhona made a fair old packet today rhona he said winking rhona smiled warmly this young gentleman this lad of eighteen or so so much older so much more worldly than samantha had obviously charmed his way into mothers heart as well as daughters he turned now to rebus with that same winning way i make a hundred quid on a good day course it used to be better back at big bang there were a lot of new companies then all of them trying to show off how much dosh they had still theres a killing to be made if youre fast and reliable a lot of the customers ask for me by name now that shows im getting somewhere he sat down on the sofa beside samantha and waited as did they all for rebus to say something he knew what was expected of him kenny had thrown down a gauntlet and the message was just you dare disapprove of me now what did the kid want a pat on the ego rebuss permission to deflower his daughter a few tips on how to avoid speedtraps whatever rebus wasnt about to knuckle under cant be good for your lungs he said instead all those exhaust fumes kenny seemed perplexed by this turn in the conversation i keep myself fit he said sounding slightly piqued good thought rebus i can nettle this little bastard he knew rhona was warning him to lay off warning him with her piercing eyes but rebus kept his attention on kenny must be a lot of prospects for a lad like you kenny cheered up immediately yeah he said i might even set up my own fleet all you needs he fell silent as he belatedly noticed that use of lad as though he were dressed in shorts and schoolcap but it was too late to go back and correct it way too late he had to push on but now it all sounded like pipedreams and playground fantasies this rozzer might be from jockland but he was every bit as oily as an east end oldtimer hed have to watch his step and what was happening now this jock this roughlooking tosser in the illfitting gear the completely uncoordinated gear this man at c a type was reminiscing about a grocery shop from his youth for a time rebus had been the grocers message boy he explained that in scotland messages meant groceries hed run about on a heavyframed black bicycle with a metal rectangle in front of the handlebars the box of groceries would be held in this rectangle and off he would pedal to do his deliveries i thought i was rich rebus said obviously coming to a punch line but when i wanted more money there wasnt any to be had i had to wait till i was old enough to get a proper job but i loved running around on that bike doing errands and delivering messages to the old folk sometimes theyd even give me a tip a piece of fruit or a jar of jam there was silence in the room a police siren sped past outside rebus sat back and folded his arms a sentimental smile spread across his face and then it dawned on kenny rebus was comparing the two of them his eyes widened everyone knew it rhona knew it sam knew it for tuppence hed get up and stick the nut on the copper sams dad or not but he held back and the moment passed rhona got up to make more tea and the big bastard got up and said he had to be going it had all happened so fast kenny was still trying to unravel rebuss story and rebus could see it the poor halfeducated runt was trying to work out just how far rebus had put him down rebus could answer that as far as was necessary rhona hated him for it of course and samantha looked embarrassed well to hell with them hed done his duty hed paid his respects he wouldnt bother them any more let them live in the cramped flat visited by this gentleman this mock adult rebus had more important things to do books to read notes to make and another busy day ahead it was ten oclock he could be back at his hotel by eleven an early night thats what was needed eight hours sleep in the last two days no wonder he was ratty looking for a fight he began to feel a little bit ashamed kenny was too easy a target hed crushed a tiny fly beneath a towerblock o resentment resentment john or plain jealousy that was not a question for a tired man not a question for a man like john rebus tomorrow tomorrow he might start getting some answers he was determined to pay for hi keep now that he had been brought to london tomorrow the task began in earnest he shook kennys hand again and gave him a manto man halfwink before leaving the flat rhona offered to see him to the door they went into the hall leaving samantha and kenny in the livingroom behind a closed door its okay rebus said quickly ill see myself out h started downstairs aware that to linger was to invite an argument with rhona what was the point better go keep an eye on lothario he called unable to resist the parting shot outside he remembered that rhona liked her loves young too perhaps she but no that thought w unworthy of him sorry god he said turning with steady stride back towards the underground something is going wrong after the first killing she had felt horror remorse guilt she had begged forgiveness she would not kill again after a month a month of not being found she grew more optimistic and grew hungry too so she killed again this had satisfied for another month and so it had gone on but now only twentyfour hours after the fourth time she had felt the urge again an urge more powerful and focused than ever she would get away with it too but it would be dangerous the police were still hunting time had not elapsed the public was wary if she killed now she would break her patternless pattern and perhaps that would give the police some clue that she could not predict there was only one solution it was wrong she knew it was wrong this wasnt her flat not really but she did it anyway she unlocked the door and entered the gallery there tied up on the floor lay the latest body she would store this one keep it out of sight ofthe police examining it she realised that now she would have more time with it more time in which to play yes storage was the answer this lair was the answer no fear of being found after all this was a private place not a public place no fear she walked around the body enjoying its silence then she raised the camera to her eye smile please she says snapping her way through the film then she has an idea she loads another film cartridge and photographs one of the paintings a landscape this is the one she will carve just as soon as she has finished playing with her new toy but now she has a record of it too a permanent record she watches the photograph develop but then starts to scratch across the plate smearing the colours and the focus until the picture becomes a chemical swirl seemingly without form god her mother would have hated that bitch she says turning from the wall filled with paintings her face is creased with anger and resentment she picks up a pair of scissors and goes to her plaything again kneels in front of it takes a firm hold of the head and brings the scissors down towards the face until they hover a centimetre away from the nose bitch she says again then carefully snips at the nostrils her hand shaking long nosehairs she wails are so unbecoming so unbecoming at last she rises again and crosses to the opposite walllifts an aerosol and shakes it noisily this wall she calls it her dionysian wall is covered in spraypainted black slogans death to art killing is an art the law is an arse fuck the rich feel the poor she thinks of something else to say something worth the diminishing space she sprays with a flourish this is art she says glancing over her shoulder towards the apollonian wall with its framed paintings this is fucking art this is fuck art she sees that the dolls eyes are open and throws herself down to within an inch of those eyes which suddenly screw themselves shut carefully she uses both hands to prise apart the eyelids faces are close now so intimate the moment is always so intimate her breath is fast so is the dolls the dolls mouth struggles against the tape holding it shut the nostrils flare fuck art she hisses to the doll this is fuck art she has the scissors in her hand again now and slides one blade into the dolls left nostril long nosehairs johnny are so unbecoming in a man so unbecoming in a man she pauses as though listening to something as though considering this statement then she nods good point she says smiling now good point catching a bite the telephone woke rebus he could not locate it for a moment then realised that it was mounted on the wall just to the right of his headboard he sat up fumbling with the receiver hello inspector rebus the voice was full of zest he didnt recognise it took his longine his fathers longine actually from the bedside table and peered through the badly scratched face to find that it was seven fifteen did i wake you up sorry its lisa frazer rebus came to life or rather his voice did he still sat slumped and jangling on the edge of the bed but heard himself say a bright hello dr frazer what can i do for you ive been studying the notes you gave me on the wolfman case working through most of the night to be honest i just couldnt sleep i was so excited by them ive made some preliminary observations rebus touched the bed feeling its residual warmth how long since hed slept with a woman how long since hed woken up the following day regretting nothing i see he said her laughter was like a clear jet of water oh inspector im sorry ive wakened you ill call back later no no im fine honestly a bit startled but fine can we meet and talk about what youve found of course but im a bit tied up today he was trying to sound vulnerable and thought on the whole that it was probably working so he played his big card what about dinner that would be nicer where he rubbed at a shoulderblade i dont know this is your town not mine im a tourist remember she laughed im not exactly a local myself but i take your point well in that case dinners on me she sounded set on this and i think i know just the place ill come to your hotel seven thirty i look forward to it what a very pleasant way to start the day thought rebus lying down again and plumping up the pillow hed just closed his eyes when the telephone rang again yes im in reception and youre a lazy git come down here so i can put my breakfast on your tab clichick brrrr rebus slapped the receiver back into its cradle and got out of bed with a growl what kept you i didnt think theyd appreciate a stark naked guest in the diningroom youre early flight shrugged things to do rebus noticed that flight didnt look well the dark rings around his eyes and his pale colouring were not due simply to lack of sleep his flesh had a saggy quality as though magnets on the floor were drawing it down but then he wasnt feeling so great himself he thought hed probably picked up a bug on the tube his throat was a little sore and his head throbbed could it be true that cities made you sick in one of the essays lisa frazer had given him someone had made that very claim stating that most serial killers were products of their environment rebus couldnt really comment on that but he did know that there was more mucus in his nostrils than usual had he brought enough handkerchiefs with him things to do flight repeated they sat at a table for two the diningroom was quiet and the spanish waitress took their order briskly the day not yet having had enough time to wear her down what do you want to do today flight seemed to be asking this only in order to get the conversation rolling but rebus had specific plans for the day and told him so first off id quite like to see maria watkisss man tommy flight smiled at this and looked down at the table just to satisfy my own curiosity rebus continued and id like to talk to the dental pathologist dr morrison well i know where to find both of them said flight go on thats about it im seeing dr frazer this evening flight looked up at this news his eyes widening in appreciation to go over her findings on the killers profile uh huh flight sounded unconvinced ive been reading those books she lent me i think there may be something in it george rebus used the christian name carefully but flight seemed to have no objections the coffee had arrived flight poured and drank a cup of it then smacked his lips i dont he said dont what dont think theres anything in all this psychology stuff its too much like guesswork and not enough like science i like something tangible a dental pathologist now thats tangible thats something you can get your teeth into rebus smiled the puns bad enough but i dont agree anyway when was the last time a pathologist gave you a precise time of death they always hedge their bets but they deal in facts in physical evidence not in mumbojumbo rebus sat back he was thinking of the character in a dickens book hed read a long time ago a schoolteacher who wanted facts and nothing but come on george he said this is the twentieth century thats right said flight and we dont believe in soothsayers any more he looked up again or do we rebus paused to pour some coffee he felt his cheeks tingling probably they were turning red arguments did that to him even casual disagreements like this were sometimes enough he was careful to make his next utterance in a soft reasonable voice so what are you saying im saying policework is plodding john still on first name terms thought rebus thats good and shortcuts seldom work im saying dont let your hampton do your thinking for you rebus thought about protesting but realised he wasnt exactly sure what flight meant flight smiled rhyming slang he explained hampton wick prick or maybe its dick anyway im just warning you not to let a good looking woman interfere with your professional judgment rebus was still about to protest but saw that there was little point having voiced his thoughts flight seemed content whats more maybe he was right did rebus want to see lisa frazer because of the case or because she was lisa frazer still he felt the need to defend her listen he said like i say ive been reading the books she gave me and there are some good things in them flight looked unconvinced goading rebus into ploughing on and as he fell for it beginning to speak he saw that flight had played the same trick on him as he himself had played on the motorcycle messenger last night too late he had to defend lisa frazer and himself even though everything he now said sounded stupid and halfbaked to his own ears never mind to flights what were dealing with is a man who hates women flight looked at him in amazement as though this were too obvious to need saying or rebus went on quickly who has to take out his revenge on women because hes too weak too scared to take it out on a man flight admitted this possibility with a twitch of the head a lot of socalled serial killers continued rebus his hand unconsciously grasping the butterknife are very conservative small c very ambitious but thwarted they feel rejected from the class immediately above them and they target this group what a prostitute a shop assistant an office worker youre saying theyre the same social group youre saying the wolfmans social group is lower than a tarts leave off john its just a general rule rebus persisted wishing hed never started this conversation he twisted the knife in his hand mind you one of the earliest serial killers was a french nobleman his voice fell away flight was looking impatient all im saying is whats in those books some of it may make sense its just that we dont have enough on the wolfman yet to allow us to see what sense its all making flight finished another cup of coffee go on he said without enthusiasm what else do the books say some serial killers crave publicity said rebus he paused thinking of the killer who had taunted him five years ago who had led them all a merry chase if the wolfman gets in touch with us weve a better chance of catching him perhaps so what are you saying im saying we should set some snares and dig some pits get inspector farraday to pass on a few tidbits to the press all about how we suspect the wolfmans gay or a transvestite it can be anything so long as it jars his conservatism and maybe itll force him into the open rebus let go of the knife and waited for flights response but flight wasnt about to be rushed he ran a finger around the rim of his cup not a bad idea that he said at last but im willing to bet you didnt get it from your books rebus shrugged maybe not exactly i thought not well lets see what cath says to it flight rose from his chair meantime on a less lofty plane of existence i think i can take you straight to tommy watkiss come on and by the way thanks for breakfast my pleasure said rebus he could see flight was unconvinced by his defence such as it had turned out to be of psychology but then was it flight he was trying to convince or himself was it flight he was trying to impress or dr lisa frazer they were passing through the foyer now rebus carrying his briefcase flight turned to him do you he said know why were called the old bill rebus shrugged offering no answer some say its because were named after a certain london landmark you can try guessing on the way there and with that flight pushed hard at the rotating door which served as the hotels entrance the old bailey was not quite what rebus had expected the famous dome was there atop which blindfolded justice held her scales but a large part of the court complex was of much more modern design security was the keynote xray machines cubiclestyle doors which allowed only one person at a time into the body of the building and security men everywhere the windows were coated with adhesive tape so that any explosion would not send lethal shards of glass flying into the concourse inside ushers all of them women dressed in flapping black cloaks ran around trying to gather up stray juries any jurors for court number four jurors for court number twelve please all the time a pa system announced the names of missing single jurors it was the busy beginning of another judicial day witnesses smoked cigarettes worriedlooking barristers weighed down by documents held whispered dialogues with dulleyed clients and police officers waited nervously to give evidence this is where we win or lose john said flight rebus couldnt be sure whether he was referring to the court rooms or to the concourse itself on floors above them were administrative offices robing rooms restaurants but this floor was where cases were held and decided through some doors to their left was the older domed part of the old bailey a darker more forbidding place than this bright marbled gallery the place echoed with the squealing of leather soled shoes the clackclackclacking of heels on the solid floor and the constant murmur of conversation come on said flight he was leading them towards one of the courtrooms where he had a word with the guard and one of the clerks before ushering rebus into the court itself if stone and black leather predominated in the concourse then the courtroom belonged to wood panelling and green leather they sat on two chairs just inside the door joining dc lamb already seated there unsmiling arms folded he did not greet them but leaned across to whisper were going to nail the cunt before stiffening into his former position on the other side of the room sat the twelve jurors looking bored already faces numb and unthinking to the back of the court stood the defendant hands resting on the rail in front of him a man of about forty with short wiry silver and black hair his face like something hewn from stone his opennecked shirt a sign of arrogance he had the dock to himself there being no police officer on guard some distance in front of him the lawyers sorted through their papers watched by assistants and solicitors the defence counsel was a thickset and tiredlooking man his face grey as was his hair gnawing on a cheap ballpoint the prosecutor however was much more confident looking tall if stout dressed immaculately and with the glow of the righteous upon him his penwas an intricate fountain affair and he wrote with a flourish his mouth set as defiantly as any churchill impersonator he reminded rebus of how television liked to think of qcs rumpole aside directly overhead was the public gallery he could hear the muffled shuffling of feet it had always worried rebus that those in the public gallery had a clear view of the jury here the court had been designed in such a way that they stared directly down and onto the jurors making intimidation and identification that much easier hed dealt with several cases of jurors being approached at days end by some relative of the accused ready with a wad of notes or a clenched fist the judge looked imperious as he pored over some papers in front of him while just below him the clerk of court spoke in hushed tones into a telephone receiver from the time it was taking to begin proceedings rebus realised two things one was that the case was continuing not beginning the other was that some point of law had been placed before the judge which the judge was now considering here seen this lamb was offering a tabloid to flight the newspaper had been folded to quarter of its size and lamb tapped one column as he passed it to his superior flight read quickly glancing up at rebus once or twice then handed the paper to rebus with a hint of a smile here you go expert rebus read through the unattributed piece basically it concerned itself with the progress or lack of it on the jean cooper murder inquiry but the closing paragraph was the killer the team investigating what have come to be known as the wolfman murders are being assisted by an expert on serial killers drafted in from another police force rebus stared at the newsprint without really seeing it surely cath farraday wouldnt have but then how else had the newspaper got to know he kept his eyes on the page aware that both flight and lamb were looking at him he couldnt believe it him an expert whether it was true or not and it wasnt didnt really matter now what mattered was that results would be expected from him results above the norm yet he knew he couldnt deliver and in not delivering he would be made to look a laughing stock no wonder those two pairs of eyes burned into his head no hardworking policeman liked to be usurped by experts rebus didnt like it himself he didnt like any of it flight saw the pained expression on rebuss face and felt sorry for the man lamb however was smirking enjoying rebuss agony he accepted his newspaper from rebus and stuffed it into his jacket pocket thought youd be interested he said the judge finally looked up his attention fixed on the jury members of the jury he began it has been brought to my attention in the case of crown versus thomas watkiss that the evidence of police constable mills contained a passage which may have lodged in your minds influencing your objectivity so the man in the dock was tommy watkiss marias husband rebus studied him again shaking his mind clear of the news story watkisss face was a curious shape the top half much wider than the cheekbones and jaw which fell almost to a point he had the look of an old boxer who had suffered one dislocated jaw too many the judge was going on about some cockup in the police case the arresting constable had given evidence stating that his first words on reaching the accused had been hello tommy whats going on here by giving this in evidence he had let the jury know that watkiss was well known to the local constabulary something which might well influence their judgment the judge was therefore ordering the jury to be dismissed good on ya tommy came a cry from the public gallery quickly silenced by a glare from the judge rebus wondered where he had heard the voice before as the court rose rebus stepped forward a few paces and turned to look up at the balcony the spectators had risen too and in the front row rebus could see a young man dressed in bike leathers and carrying a crashhelmet grinning towards watkiss he raised his fist in a gesture of triumph then turned and began to climb the steps to the gallerys exit it was kenny samanthas boyfriend rebus walked back to where flight and lamb were standing watching him curiously but rebus directed his attention towards the dock the look on watkisss face was one of pure relief dc lamb on the other hand seemed ready to kill luck of the fucking irish he spat tommys no more irish than you are lamb flight said phlegmatically what was the charge rebus asked his mind still confused by the newspaper story by kennys presence in this place and by his actions the judge was leaving by a green paddedleather door to the side of the jury box the usual said lamb calming quickly rape when his old woman snuffed it he needed somebody else on the game so he tried to persuade a girl on his street that she could make a few bob when that didnt work he lost his rag and had a go at her bastard well get him at the retrial i still think he did for his old woman then find the evidence said flight meantime i can think of a certain police constable who needs a good kick up the arse yeah said lamb he was grinning evilly at the thought then took the hint and left the courtroom in search of the unfortunate pc mills inspector flight it was the prosecuting counsel striding briskly towards them with documents and books cradled in his left arm his right arm outstretched flight took the wellgroomed hand and shook it hello mr chambers this is inspector rebus hes come down from scotland to help us on the wolfman investigation chambers looked interested ah yes the wolfman i look forward to prosecuting that particular case i just hope we can give you the opportunity said rebus well said chambers meanwhile its tricky enough landing the little fish like our friend he glanced back in the direction of the dock which now stood empty but we try he said with a sigh we try then he paused and added in an undertone directed at flight get this george i dont like being royally shafted by my own team okay flight blushed chambers had dressed him down in a way no superintendent or chief constable could ever have done and he knew it good day gentlemen he said moving away and good luck inspector rebus thanks rebus called to the retreating figure flight watched as chambers pushed open the doors of the court the tail of his wig flicking from side to side robes flapping behind him when the doors were closed flight chuckled arrogant prick but hes the best there is rebus was beginning to wonder if anyone in london was secondrate hed been introduced to the top pathologist the best prosecuting counsel the crack forensic team the finest police divers was it part of the citys own arrogance i thought the best lawyers all went in for commercial work these days rebus said not necessarily its only the really greedy bastards who go in for city work besides this sort of stuff is like a drug to chambers and his ilk theyre actors bloody good ones at that yes rebus had known a few oscarwinning advocates in his time and had lost a few cases more to their technique than to the strength of their defence they might earn a quarter of the riches earned by their brothers in the commercial sector might take home a scant each year but they endured for the sake of their public flight was moving towards the doors whats more he said chambers studied for a time in the usa they train them to be actors over there they also train them to be hardnosed bastards im told he came out top of his class thats why we like having him on our side flight paused do you still want a word with tommy rebus shrugged why not out in the concourse watkiss was standing by one of the large windows relishing a cigarette and listening to his solicitor then the two men started to walk away tell you what said rebus ive changed my mind lets skip watkiss for the moment okay said flight youre the expert after all he saw the sour look on rebuss face and laughed dont worry about it he said i know youre no expert thats very reassuring george rebus said without conviction he stared after watkiss thinking and im not the only one leaving court without conviction flight laughed again but behind his smile he was still more than a little curious about rebuss action in the courtroom walking out into the court like that to peer up at the public gallery but if rebus didnt want to talk about it then that was his privilege flight could bide his time so what now he asked rebus was rubbing his jaw my dental appointment he said anthony morrison who insisted that they call him tony was much younger than rebus had been anticipating no more than thirtyfive he had an underdeveloped body so that his adult head seemed to have outgrown the rest of him rebus was aware that he was staring at morrison with more than common interest the scrubbed and shiny face the tufts of bristle on chin and cheekbone where a razor had failed to fulfil its duties the trimmed hair and keening eyes in the street he would have taken morrison for a sixthyear pupil certainly for a pathologist albeit a dental pathologist the man was in stark contrast to philip cousins on learning that rebus was scottish morrison had started on about the debt modernday pathology owed to the scots men like glaister and littlejohn and sir sydney smith though the latter morrison had to admit had been born in the antipodes he then said that his own father had been a scotsman a surgeon and asked if rebus knew that the earliest british chair of forensic medicine had been founded in edinburgh rebus swept away by the welter of facts said that this was news to him morrison showed them into his office with an enthusiastic bounce to his walk once inside however the dentists demeanour changed from social to professional hes been busy again he said without preamble leading them to the wall behind his desk where several ten by eight colour and black and white photographs had been pinned they showed precise closeups of the bite marks left on jean coopers stomach arrows had been drawn in leading from particular spots on certain photographs out to where pinned notes gave morrisons technical summary of his findings i know what to look for now of course he said so it didnt take long to establish that these are probably the same teeth used in the previous attacks a pattern is also emerging however perhaps a disturbing one he went to his desk and returned with more photographs these are from victim number one youll notice that the indents left by the teeth are less marked they grow a little more marked by victims two and three and now he pointed to the current crop of pictures theyve got even deeper rebus answered morrison beamed at him quite right so hes becoming more violent if you can term an attack made on someone whos already dead violent then yes inspector rebus hes getting more violent or perhaps more unstable would be a better way of phrasing it rebus and flight exchanged a glance apart from the change in the relative depth of the bite marks theres little i can add to my previous findings the teeth are quite likely to be prosthetic rebus interrupted you mean false morrison nodded how can you tell morrison beamed again the prodigy who liked to show off in front of his teachers how can i best explain this to a layman he seemed to consider his own question for a moment well ones own teeth your own for example inspector rebus and by the way you should get them seen to they get a little ragged over time the cutting edge gets chipped and worn the edge on false teeth is more likely to be smoother more rounded less of an edge to the front teeth especially and less chips and cracks rebus lips closed was running his tongue over his teeth it was true they had the serrated feel of a workmans saw he hadnt visited a dentist in ten years or more had never felt the need but now morrison had commented on them did they really look so awful so morrison continued for that reason as well as for several others i would say the killer has false teeth but he also has very curious teeth indeed oh rebus tried to speak without showing morrison any more of his own decaying mouth ive already explained this to inspector flight morrison paused so that flight could nod agreement of this but briefly the upper set has a greater biting curve than the lower set from my measurements i conclude that the person in possession of these teeth must have quite a strangely shaped face i did draw some sketches but ive managed to come up with something better im glad youve come this afternoon he walked over to a cupboard and opened it rebus looked to flight who merely shrugged morrison was turning towards them again his right hand supporting a large object covered by an inverted brownpaper bag behold he said lifting the bag from the object i bring you the head of the wolfman there was silence in the room so that the traffic noise from outside became conspicuous neither rebus nor flight could think of anything immediately to say instead they walked across to meet with the chuckling morrison who was regarding his creation with a measure of glee there was a squeal of suddenly braking tyres outside the wolfman morrison repeated he was holding the cast of a human head constructed so far as rebus could ascertain from pale pink plaster you can ignore the idea from the nose upwards if you prefer said morrison its fairly speculative based on mean measurements taking into account the jaw but the jaw itself is i believe pretty accurate and a strange jaw it was the upper teeth jutted out from the mouth so that the lips over them and the skin below the nose was stretched and bulging the lower jaw seemed tucked in beneath in what seemed to rebus a neanderthal display to the extent that it almost disappeared the chin had a narrow pinched look and the cheekbones were swollen in a line with the nose but concave as the face extended downwards it was an extraordinary face the like of which rebus could not recall having encountered in the real world but then this was not the real world was it it was a reconstruction depending upon a measure of averages and guesswork flight was staring at it in fascination as though committing the face to memory rebus had the chilling notion that flight would release a photograph to the papers and charge the first poor soul he came across possessing such a physiognomy would you call that deformed rebus asked heavens no said morrison with a laugh you havent seen some of the medical cases ive had to deal with no this couldnt be termed deformed looks like my idea of mr hyde commented flight dont mention hyde to me rebus thought to himself perhaps said morrison laughing again what about you inspector rebus what are your thoughts rebus examined the cast again it looks prehistoric ah said morrison enthusiastically that was what i thought at first the jutting upper jaw especially how do you know that is the upper jaw asked rebus couldnt it be the other way round no im pretty sure this is correct the bites are fairly consistent apart from victim three that is oh yes victim three was a strange one the lower set that is the smaller set seemed more extended than the upper set as you can see from this cast the killer would have had to make an extraordinary contortion of his face to produce such a bite he mimed the bite for them opening his mouth wide lifting his head and pushing out his lower jaw then making a biting motion the lower jaw doing most of the work in the other bites the killer has bitten more like this again he put on a dumb show this time drawing his lips back from his upper jaw and biting down sharply so that the upper teeth closed over the lower teeth the teeth themselves snapping together rebus shook his head this wasnt making things clearer if anything he was growing more confused he nodded towards the cast you really believe the man were looking for looks like this the man or woman yes of course i may have exaggerated a little with this cast but im more or less convinced rebus had stopped listening after the first sentence what do you mean or woman he asked morrison shrugged his shoulders theatrically again this is something ive discussed with inspector flight it just seemed to me that purely on the dental evidence you understand this head could as easily belong to a woman as to a man the large upper set of teeth seems to me very male judging from size and what have you but the lower set just as equally seems very female a man with a womans chin or a woman with a masculine upper jaw he shrugged again take your pick rebus looked to flight who was shaking his head slowly no flight said its a man rebus had never considered the possibility that a woman might be behind the killings it had never entered his head until now a woman improbable but why impossible flight was dismissing it out of hand but on what grounds rebus had read last night that a growing number of multiple murderers were women but could a woman have stabbed like that could a woman so completely have overwhelmed victims of similar height similar strength id like to get some photographs of this flight was saying he had taken the cast from morrison and was studying it again of course morrison said but remember its only my idea of the look of the killers head we appreciate it tony thanks for all your work morrison shrugged modestly he had fished for a compliment and had hooked one rebus could see that flight was convinced by this whole piece of theatre the unveiling of the head and so on to rebus it was more showmanship than tangible truth more the stuff of courtroom melodrama he still felt that to trap the wolfman they had to get inside his head not play with plaster mockups of it his or her head would the bite marks be enough to identify the killer morrison considered this then nodded i think so yes if you can bring me the suspect i think i can show that he or she is the wolfman rebus persisted but would it stand up in court morrison folded his arms and smiled i could blind the jury with science his face became serious again no on its own i dont think my evidence would ever be enough to convict but as part of a larger body of such evidence we might be in with half a chance always supposing the bastard makes it to trial flight added grimly accidents have been known to happen in custody always supposing rebus corrected we catch him in the first place that gentlemen said morrison i leave entirely in your capable hands suffice to say i look forward to introducing my friend here to the real thing and he tipped the plaster head backwards and forwards and backwards again until it seemed to rebus that the head was mocking them laughing and rolling its sightless eyes as morrison showed them out he rested a hand on rebuss forearm im serious about your teeth he said you should get them seen to i could look at them myself if you like when he returned to headquarters rebus went straight to the washroom and in front of a soapspattered mirror examined his mouth what was morrison talking about his teeth looked fine okay one of them had a dark line running down it a crack perhaps and a few were badly stained from too many cigarettes and too much tea but they looked strong enough didnt they no need for drills and piercing grinding implements no need for a dentists chair sharp needles and a spitting out of blood back at his designated desk he doodled on his notebook was morrison just the nervous type or was he hyperactive was he perhaps mad or was he merely dealing with the world in his own idiosyncratic way so few serial killers were women statistically it was unlikely since when had he believed in statistics since he had started to read psychology textbooks last night in his hotel room after the disastrous visit to rhona and samantha kenny what the hell was kenny doing running around with tommy watkiss his daughters gentleman a smiling villain forget it john you dont control that part of your life any more he had to smile at this what part of his life did he control his work gave his life what meaning it had he should admit defeat tell flight he could be of no help and return to edinburgh where he could be sure of his villains and his crimes drug pedlars protection racketeers domestic violence fraud a murder each month regular as the moon it was only a saying wasnt it regular as the moon he unhooked a calendar from the wall portraits of italy donated to the station by ginos sandwich bar time of the month had there been a full moon around th january when maria watkiss was found no but then they reckoned she might have lain undiscovered for two or three days thursday th january had been the full moon the full moon affected the wolfman in the movies didnt it but they had named the killer wolfman after wolf street not because he or she killed by the light of the full moon rebus was more confused than ever and werent women supposedly affected by the moon something to do with their time of the month may jessop had died on monday th february four days before another full moon shelley richards had died on wednesday th february nowhere near a full moon morrison had said her case was unusual the bites had seemed different and then jean cooper had died on the night of sunday th march two days before the vernal equinox he threw the calendar onto the desk there was no pattern no neat mathematical solution who was he trying to kid this wasnt the movies the hero didnt stumble upon the answer there were no shortcuts maybe flight was right it was all plodding routine and forensic evidence psychology was no shortcut barking at the moon was no shortcut he couldnt know when the wolfman would strike again he knew so little flight wandered exhaustedly into the room and fell onto a chair causing it to creak in protest i finally got through to cath he said i put your idea to her and shes giving it some thought thats big of her flight gave him a warning look and rebus raised his hands in apology flight nodded towards the calendar what are you up to i dont know nothing much ithought there might be some pattern to the dates when the wolfman struck you mean like the stages of the moon the equinox that sort of thing flight was smiling rebus nodded slowly hell john ive been through all that and more he went to a particular manila folder and tossed it towards rebus take a look ive tried number patterns distance between murder sites possible means of transport the wolfmans pretty mobile you know i think he must have a car ive tried linking the victims checking which school they went to which libraries they used whether they liked sports or discos or classical bloody music know what they dont have anything in common not a single thing linking the four of them save the fact that they were women rebus flicked through the file it was an impressive amount of slogging all to no end save that of clarification flight hadnt climbed the ladder to his present rank by a fluke or by keeping in with his superiors or by signifying greatness he had got there bysheer hard work point taken said rebus then because this didnt seem quite enough im impressed have you shown this lot to anyone else flight shook his head its guesswork john strawclutching thats all it would just confuse the issue besides do you remember the story of the boy who cried wolf one day there really was a wolf there but by then no one believed him because hed given them so much crap before rebus smiled still its a lot of work what did you expect flight asked a chimpanzee in a whistle im a good copper john i may be no expert but id never claim to be rebus was about to remonstrate then frowned whats a whistle he said flight threw back his head and laughed a suit you plonker whistle and flute suit rhyming slang god sakes john were going to have to educate you tell you what why dont we go out for a meal ourselves tonight i know a good greek restaurant in walthamstow flight paused a gleam in his eye i know its good he said cos ive seen a lot of bubbles coming out of it his smile was inviting rebus thought quickly bubbles was the food gassy did they serve champagne rhyming slang bubbles bubble and squeak he said then a pause greeks right right said flight youre catching on fast so what about it or indian thai italian you decide but rebus was shaking his head sorry george prior engagement flight pulled his head back no he said youre seeing her arent you that bloody psychiatrist i forgot you told me at breakfast you bloody jocks you dont waste any time do you coming down here stealing our women flight sounded in good humour but rebus thought he detected something a little deeper down a genuine sadness that the two of them couldnt get together for a meal tomorrow night eh george yeah said flight tomorrow night sounds fine one word of advice though what dont let her get you on the couch no said dr lisa frazer shaking her head vigorously thats psychiatrists psychiatrists have couches not psychologists were like chalk and cheese she looked stunning yet there was no alchemy involved in the process she was dressed simply and wore no makeup her hair had been brushed straight back and tied with a band still casually elegantly simply she was stunning she had been dead on time at the hotel and had walked with him her arm linked in his along shaftesbury avenue past the scene of his runin with the patrol car the early evening was warm and rebus felt good walking with her men were glancing towards them okay be honest towards her there might even have been a wolf whistle or two it made rebus feel good all the same he was wearing his tweed jacket with an opennecked shirt and had the sudden fear that she would lead him to some fancy restaurant where men were not admitted without ties that would be just his luck the city teemed with nightlife teenagers mostly drinking from cans and calling to each other across the busy road the pubs were doing good business and buses chugged grime into the air grime which would be falling unseen on lisa frazer rebus felt valiant he felt like stopping all the traffic confiscating all the keys so that she couldwalk unsullied through the streets since when did he think like that where had this tiny unpolished stone of romance come from what desperate corner of his soul selfconscious john youre becoming too selfconscious and if a psychologist didnt spot it nobody would be natural be calm be yourself she brought him into chinatown a few streets off shaftesbury avenue where the telephone boxes were shaped like oriental temples supermarkets sold fifty year old eggs gateways were decorated like relics from hong kong and the street names were given in chinese as well as english there were a few tourists about but mainly the pedestrianised walkway was filled with scuttling chinese their voices shrill it was a different world like something you would expect to find in new york but never dream of finding in england yet he could look back along the street and still see the theatres on shaftesbury avenue the red buses chugchugging the punks yelling obscenities at the tops of immature voices here we are she said stopping outside a restaurant on the corner of the street she pulled open the door gesturing for him to precede her into the airconditioned chill a waiter was upon them at once showing them to a dimlylit booth a waitress smiled with her eyes as she handed them each a menu the waiter returned with a wine list which he placed beside rebus would you like a drink while you are deciding rebus looked to lisa frazer for guidance gin and tonic she said without hesitation and the same for me said rebus then regretted it he wasnt all that keen on gins chemical smell im very excited about this case inspector rebus please call me john were not in the station now she nodded id like to thank you for giving me the chance to study the files i think im already forming an interesting picture she reached into her clutchpurse and produced a collection of a dozen index cards held together with an outsize paperclip the cards were covered in lines of tiny neat handwriting she seemed ready to start reading them shouldnt we at least order first rebus asked she appeared not to understand then grinned sorry she said its just that im very excited yes you said dont policemen get excited when they find what they think is a clue almost never said rebus appearing to study the menu were born pessimists we dont get excited until the guilty party has been sentenced and locked up thats curious she held her own menu still closed the index cards had been relegated to the tabletop id have thought to enjoy police work you would need a level of optimism otherwise youd never think you were going to solve the case still studying the menu rebus decided that hed let her order for both of them he glanced up at her i try not to think about solving or not solving he said i just get on with the job step by step the waiter had returned with their drinks you are ready to order not really said rebus could we have a couple more minutes lisa frazer was staring across the table at him it wasnt a large table her right hand rested on the rim of her glass barely an inch from his left hand rebus could sense the presence of her knees almost touching his own under the table the other tables in the restaurant all seemed larger than this one and the booths seemed better lit frazers a scottish name he said it was as good a line as any thats right she replied my great grandfather came from a place called kirkcaldy rebus smiled she had pronounced the word the way it looked he corrected her then added i was born and brought up not far from there five or six miles to be precise really what a coincidence ive never been there but my grandaddy used to tell me it was where adam smith was born rebus nodded but dont hold that against it he said its still not a bad wee town he picked up his glass and swirled it enjoying the sound of the ice chinking on the glass lisa was at last studying her menu without looking up she spoke why are you here the question was sudden catching rebus offbalance did she mean here in the restaurant here in london here on this planet im here to find answers he was pleased with this reply it seemed to deal with all three possibilities at once he lifted his glass heres to psychology she raised her own glass ice rattling like musical chimes heres to taking things one step at a time they both drank she studied her menu again now she said what shall we have rebus knew how to use a pair of chopsticks but perhaps tonight had just been the wrong time to try he suddenly found himself unable to pick up a noodle or a sliver of duck without the thing sliding out of his grasp and falling back to the table splashing sauce across the tablecloth the more it happened the more frustrated he became and the more frustrated he became the more it happened finally he asked for a fork my coordinations all gone he explained she smiled in understanding or was it sympathy and poured more tea into his tiny cup he could see that she was impatient to tell him what she thought she had discovered about the wolfman over a starter of crabmeat soup the talk had been safe guarded had been of pasts and futures not the present rebus stabbed his fork into an unresisting slice of meat so what have you found she looked at him for confirmation that this was her cue when he nodded she put down her chopsticks then pushed aside the paperclip from her index cards and cleared her throat not so much reading from the cards more using them as occasional prompts well she said the first thing i found revealing was the evidence of salt on the bodies of the victims i know some people think it may be sweat but im of the opinion that these are tear stains a lot can be learned from any killers interpersonal relationship with his or her victim there it was again his or her her to me the tear stains indicate feelings of guilt in the attacker guilt felt moreover not in reflection but at the actual time of the attack this gives the wolfman a moral dimension showing that he is being driven almost against his will there may well be signs of schizophrenia here the wolfmans dark side operating only at certain times she was about to rush on but already rebus needed time to catch up he interrupted youre saying most of the time the wolfman may seem as normal as you or me she nodded briskly yes exactly in fact im saying that between times the wolfman doesnt just seem as normal as anyone else he is as normal which is why hes been hard to catch he doesnt wander around the streets with the word wolfman tattooed across his forehead rebus nodded slowly he realised that by seeming to concentrate on her words he had an excuse for staring at her face consuming it with eyes more proficient than any cutlery go on he said she flipped one card over and moved to the next taking a deep breath that the victim is abused after death indicates that the wolfman feels no need to control his victim in some serial killers this element of control is important killing is the only time when these people feel in any kind of control of their lives this isnt the case with the wolfman the murder itself is relatively quick occasioning little pain or suffering sadism therefore is not a feature rather the wolfman is playing out a scenario upon the corpse again the rush of words her energy her eagerness to share her findings all swept past rebus how could he concentrate when she was so close to him so close and so beautiful what do you mean itll become clearer she stopped to take a sip of tea her food was barely touched the mound of rice in the bowl beside her hardly dented in her own way rebus realised she was every bit as nervous as he was but not for the same reasons the restaurant though hectic might have been empty this booth was their territory rebus took a gulp of the stillscalding tea tea he could kill for a glass of cold white wine i thought it interesting she was saying now that the pathologist dr cousins feels the initial attack comes from behind this makes the attacks nonconfrontational and the wolfman is likely to be like this in his social and working life theres also the possibility that he cannot look his victims in the eye out of fear that their fear would destroy his scenario rebus shook his head it was time to own up youve lost me she seemed surprised simply hes taking out revenge and to him the victims represent the individual against whom hes taking his revenge if he confronted them face to face hed realise theyre not the person he bears the grudge against in the first place rebus still felt a little bit lost then these women are standins substitutes yes he nodded this was getting interesting interesting enough for him to turn his gaze from lisa frazer the better to concentrate on her words she was still only halfway through her cards so much for the wolfman she said flipping to the next card but the chosen location can also say a lot about the inner life of the attacker as can age sex race and class of the victims youll have noticed that they are all women that they are mostly older women women approaching middle age and that three out of four have been white ill admit that i cant make much out of these facts as they stand in fact it was just the failure of pattern that made me think a little harder about location you see just when a pattern looks to be emerging an element arises that destroys the precision the killer attacks a much younger woman or strikes earlier in the evening or chooses a black victim or rebus was thinking kills outside the pattern of the full moon lisa continued i started to give some consideration to the spatial pattern of the attacks these can determine where the killer may strike next or even where he lives rebus raised his eyebrows its true john its been proved in several cases i dont doubt it i was raising my eyebrows at that phrase spatial pattern a phrase hed heard before on the loathed management course she smiled jargon yes theres a lot of it about what i mean is the pattern of the murder sites a canal path a railway line the vicinity of a tube station three out of four take place near travel systems but again the fourth case defeats the pattern all four take place north of the river at least theres some evidence of a pattern there but and this is my point the nonemergence of a pattern seems to me in itself a conscious act the wolfman is making sure you have as little as possible to go on this would indicate a high level of psychological maturity yes hes as mature as a hatter all right she laughed im being serious i know you are there is one other possibility whats that the wolfman knows how not to leave a trail because he is familiar with police work familiar with it she nodded especially the way you go about investigating a series of murders youre saying hes a copper she laughed again shaking her head im saying he may have prior convictions yes well he thought of the file george flight had shown him a few hours earlier weve checked on over a hundred exoffenders already no luck there but you cant possibly have talked to every man who has ever been convicted of rape violent assault or the like agreed but theres something you seem to have overlooked the teeth marks those are very palpable clues if the wolfman is being so clever why does he leave us a neat set of bite marks every time she blew on her tea cooling it maybe she said the teeth are a what do you call it a red herring rebus thought about this its possible he conceded but theres something else i visited a dental pathologist today from the marks made by the teeth he said he couldnt rule out the possibility that the wolfman is a woman really her eyes opened wide thats very interesting id never even considered it neither had we he scooped more rice into his bowl so tell me why does he or she bite the victims ive given that a lot of thought she flipped to her final card the bite is always on the stomach the female stomach carrier of life maybe the wolfman has lost a child or maybe he was abandoned and consequently adopted and resents the fact i dont know a lot of serial killers have fragmented upbringings mmm i read all about it in those books you gave me really you read them last night and what did you think i thought they were clever sometimes ingenious but do you think the theories are valid rebus shrugged ill tell you if and when we catch the wolfman she toyed with her food again but ate nothing the meat in her bowl had a cold gelatinous look what about the anal attacks john do you have any theories there rebus considered this no he said finally but i know what a psychiatrist might say yes but youre not with a psychiatrist remember im a psychologist how can i forget you said in your essay that there are thirty known serial killers active in the usa is that true i wrote that essay over a year ago by now there are probably more frightening isnt it he shrugged the shrug disguising a shiver hows the food he asked what she looked at her bowl oh im not really very hungry to tell you the truth i feel a little bit deflated i suppose i was so excited at what i thought id managed to piece together but in telling it all to you i see that really theres not very much there at all she was thumbing through the index cards theres plenty there said rebus im impressed honest every little bit helps arid you stick to the known facts i like that i was expecting more jargon he remembered the terms from one of her books the one by macnaughtie latent psychomania oedipal urgings gobbledygook i could give you plenty of that stuff she said but i doubt it would help exactly besides thats more in line with psychiatry psychologists prefer drive theories social learning theory multiphasic personalities rebus had clamped his hands over his ears she laughed again he could make her laugh so easily once upon a time hed made rhona laugh too and after rhona a certain liaison officer back in edinburgh so what about policemen he asked closing off the memory what can psychologists tell about us well she said relaxing into her seat youre extrovert toughminded conservative conservative with a small c i read last night that serial killers are conservative too she nodded still smiling oh yes she said youre alike in a lot of ways but by conservative i mean specifically that you dont like anything that changes the status quo thats why youre reticent about the use of psychology it interferes with the strict guidelines youve set yourselves isnt that so well i suppose i could argue but i wont so what happens now youve studied the wolfman oh all ive done so far is scratch the surface her hands were still on the index cards there are other tests to be done character analyses and so on itll take time she paused what about you well well plod along checking examining taking it step by step she interrupted thats right step by step whether ill be on the case much longer or not i cant say they may send me back to edinburgh at the end of the week why did they bring you to london in the first place the waiter had come to clear away their dishes rebus sat back wiping his lips with the serviette any coffees or liqueurs sir rebus looked to lisa i think ill have a grand marnier she said just coffee for me said rebus no hold on what the hell ill have the same the waiter bowed and moved off his arms heavy with crockery you didnt answer my question john oh its simple enough they thought i might be able to help i worked on a previous serial killing up in edinburgh really she sat forward in her chair the palms of her hands pressed to the tablecloth tell me so he told her it was a long story and he didnt know exactly why he gave her as many details as he did more details than she needed to know and more perhaps than he should be telling to a psychologist what would she make of him would she find a trace of psychosis or paranoia in his character but he had her complete attention so he spun the tale out in order to enjoy that attention the more it took them through two cups of coffee the paying of the bill and a balmy nighttime walk through leicester square across charing cross road up st martins lane and along long acre towards covent garden they walked around covent garden itself rebus still doing most of the talking he stopped by a row of three telephone boxes curious about thesmall white stickers covering every available inch of space on the onside of the booths stern corrective measures french lessons o and a specialist tv trudy nymphet spank me sm chamber busty blonde all of them accompanied by telephone numbers lisa studied them too every one a psychologist she said then thats quite a story youve just told john has anyone written it up rebus shrugged a newspaper reporter wrote a couple of articles jim stevens christ hadnt he moved to london too rebus thought again of the newspaper story lamb had shown him the unattributed newspaper story yes lisa was saying but has anyone looked at it from your point of view no she looked thoughtful at this you want to turn me into a case study not necessarily she said ah here we are she stopped they were standing outside a shoe shop in a narrow pedestrianised street above the rows of shops were two storeys of flats this is where i live she said thank you for this evening ive enjoyed it thank you for the meal it was great not at all she fell silent they were only two or three feet apart rebus shuffled his feet will you be able to find your way back she asked should i point you in the right direction rebus looked up and down the street he was lost he had not been keeping track of their meanderings oh ill be all right he smiled and she smiled back but did not speak so this is it then he persisted no offer of a coffee she looked at him slyly do you really want a coffee he returned the look no he admitted not really she turned from him and opened the door to the side of the shoe shop the shop claimed to specialise in handmade and nonleather shoes beside the door to the flats was an entryphone boasting six names one of them read simply l frazer no dr but then he supposed she wouldnt want to be disturbed by people needing a medical doctor would she there were times when a qualification was best kept under wraps lisa drew the mortice key out of the lock the stairwell was brightly lit its plain stone painted cornflower blue she turned back towards him well she said since you dont want a coffee youd better come on up she later explained running a hand over his chest as they lay together in bed that she saw no point in the little games people played the slow edging towards a moment when both would admit that what they really wanted was to make love so instead she led rebus up to her first floor flat took him into the darkened room undressed and got into bed sitting with her knees tucked up in front of her well she said so he had undressed too and joined her she lay now with her arms reaching behind her to grab at the bedposts her body dusky in the light cast from a street lamp outside rebus ran his tongue back up along the inside of her leg the inner thigh her legs supple she smelt of jasmine tasted of flowers more pungent still rebus was selfconscious at first his own body had become an embarrassment while hers was in fine toned condition squash and swimming she told him later and a strict diet he ran his fingers over the ripples the corrugations in her flesh there was some sagging to the skin above her stomach some creasing to the sides of her breasts and to her throat he looked down and saw his own distended chest there was still some muscle to his stomach but there was also excessive fleshiness not supple tired and ageing squash and swimming he would take up some exercise join a health club there were enough of them in edinburgh he was eager to please her pleasure became his only goal and he worked tirelessly there was sweat in the room now a lot of sweat they were working well together moving fluidly each seeming to sense what the other was about to do when he moved slightly too quickly and bumped his nose on her chin they laughed quietly rubbing foreheads and when later he went in search of her fridge and cold liquid she came too popping an ice cube into her mouth before kissing him the kiss extending downwards as she sank to her knees in front of him back in bed they drank chill white wine from the bottle and kissed some more then began all over again the air between them had lost its nervous charge and they were able to enjoy themselves she moved on top rearing above him her rhythm increasing until all he could do was he back and watch with his eyes closed imagining the room in diffuse light a cold spray of water a smoothness of skin or a woman the wolfman could be a woman the wolfman was playing with the police seemed to know the way they thought and worked a woman a woman officer cath farraday came to mind with her teutonic face that wide but angular jaw jesus here he was with lisa thinking of another woman he felt a sudden pang of guilt hitting him in the stomach a moment before a very different reaction arched his back and his neck while her hands pressed down upon his chest her knees clamped to his hips or a woman why the teeth leaving not a single clue except those bites why why not a woman why not r a policeman or or yes yes her breath escaped with a hiss the word losing all meaning as she repeated it ten twenty thirty times yes what yes john yes john yes yes it had been another busy day for her a day spent pretending to be what shes not but now she was out again prowling she is beginning to like the way she can move so smoothly through the two worlds earlier this evening she was the guest at a dinner party in blackheath mockgeorgian elegance stripped pine doors talk of school fees and fax machines of interest rates and foreign property and the wolfman they asked for her opinion her opinion was reasoned intelligent liberal there was chilled chablis and an exquisite bottle of chateau montrose the she could not choose between the two so enjoyed a glass of both one guest was late arriving a journalist on one of the better dailies heapologised they asked for tidbits from the next days news and he supplied them generously the sister paper to his own was a downmarket tabloid he told them the next days front page would have a headline reading secret life of gay wolfman of course as the journalist knows this is nothing more than a ruse to try to bait the killer and she knows too naturally they smile at one another across the table as she lifts more pasta expertly with her fork how stupid of them to run a story like that gay wolfman indeed she chuckles into her oversized wine glass the conversation turns to motorway traffic wine acquisition the state of blackheath common blackheath of course is where they buried the plague victims piling the corpses high black death black heath one letter separates the two she smiles at this too discreetly the meal over she took a taxi back across the river and got out at the beginning of her street she intended to go straight home but walked past her door and kept on walking she shouldnt be doing this shouldnt be out here but it feels right after all the toy in the gallery must be lonely its always so cold in the gallery so cold jack frost could bite off your nose her mother must have told her that her mother long nosehairs johnny are so unbecoming in a gentleman or her father singing nonsense songs while she hid herself in the garden fuck art she hisses quietly to herself she knows where to go too not far the intersection of one road with a much larger one there are many like it in london traffic lights and a few women wandering back and forth sometimes crossing at the lights so that the drivers can see them can see their legs and their white bodies if a car window is rolled down a woman may lean down close to the driver so that they can discuss terms professional but not very discreet she knows that sometimes the police will make a rudimentary attempt to close down business knows too that policemen are among the whores best customers thats why its dangerous for her to come here dangerous but necessary she has an itch and women like these go missing all the time dont they no one gets suspicious no one starts alarm bells ringing alarm bells are the last thing you need in this part of the city like with her first victim by the time they got to her she was a meal for rats animal feed she chuckles again and makes to walk past one of these women but stops hello love says the woman anything you want how much for the night for you love a hundred very well she turns and starts back towards her own street her own house so much safer there than out here the woman follows noisily a yard or two behind seeming to understand she does not let the woman catch up until she is at the front door and the key is in the lock the gallery beckons only it doesnt look like a gallery any more it looks like a butchers block nice place youve got love she puts a finger to her lips no talking the woman begins to look suspicious looks as though shes thinking twice about being here so she goes to her and grabs at a breast planting a clumsy smeared kiss across puffy lips the prostitute looks startled for a second then manages a rehearsed smile well youre certainly not a gentleman she says she nods pleased with this remark the front door is locked now and she goes to the door of the gallery slips the key in unlocks it in here love the woman is removing her coat as she walks across the threshold the coat is down past her shoulders by the time she sees the room itself but by then of course its too late far too late she moves in on her like a trained worker on a production line hand over the mouth good pressure on the knife and a quick backward arc before the thrust she has often wondered if they see the knife or are their eyes closed in terror by then she imagines them with eyes bulging open focussing on the knife as point directed towards them it swings back and then flies forward towards their face she can find out cant she all she needs is a strategically placed wallmirror must remember that for next time gurgle gurgle the gallery is such a marvellous setting poised between apollo and dionysus the body slips to the floor time for the real work now her brain is humming mummydaddymummydaddy mummydaddymummydaddy as she crouches to her task its only a game she whispers her voice a mere tremble at the back of her throat only a game she hears the womans words again certainly not a gentleman no certainly not her laughter is harsh and abrupt suddenly she feels it again no not already next time the knife twitches she hasnt even finished with this one she cant possibly do another tonight it would be madness sheer madness but the craving is there an absolute and unappeasable hunger this time with a mirror she covers her eyes with a bloodstained hand stop she cries stop it daddy mummy make it stop please make it stop but thats the problem as she knows only too well nobody can make it stop nobody will make it stop on it must go night after night now night after night no letting up no pausing for breath night after night after night fibs youve got to be kidding rebus was too tired to be truly angry but there was enough exasperation in his voice to worry the caller on the other end of the telephone delegated to order rebus to glasgow that case isnt supposed to be heard until the week after next they moved it says the voice rebus groaned he lay back on his hotel bed with the receiver pressed to his ear and checked his watch eight thirty hed slept soundly last night waking at seven dressed quietly so as not to disturb lisa and had left her a note before making his exit his nose had led him to the hotel with only a couple of wrong turnings along the way and now he had walked into this telephone call they brought it forward the voice is saying it starts today they need your testimony inspector as if rebus didnt know he knows that all he has to do is go into the witness box and say he saw morris gerald cafferty known in the protection game as big ger accept one hundred pounds from the landlord of the city arms pub in grangemouth its as easy as that but he needs to be there to say it the case against cafferty boss of a thuggish protection and gaming racket is not airtight in fact its got more punctures than a blind dressmakers thumb he resigns himself to it must it be yes it must be but there was still the problem of logistics its all been taken care of says the voice we did try phoning you last night but you were never there catch the first available shuttle from heathrow well have a car meet you and bring you into glasgow the prosecution reckons hell call you about half past three so theres time enough with any luck you can be back in london by tonight gee thanks says rebus voice so thick with irony the words hardly escape into the air youre welcome says the voice he found that the piccadilly line went to heathrow and piccadilly circus tube was right outside the hotel so things started well enough though the tube ride itself was slow and stifling at heathrow he picked up his ticket and had just enough time for a dash into the skyshop he picked up a glasgow herald then saw the row of tabloids on another shelf secret life of gay wolfman sick killer needs help say police catch this madman cath farraday had done well he bought a copy of all three papers as well as the herald and made for the departure lounge now that his mind was working he saw all around him people reading the same headlines and the stories below them but would the wolfman see the stories and if so would he or she make some kind of move hell the whole thing might be about to crack open and here he was heading four hundred miles north damn the judicial system the judges and advocates and solicitors and all the cafferty case had probably been brought forward so that it would not interfere with a golf game or a school sports day some spoilt childs involvement with an eggandspoon race might be behind this whole breathless journey rebus tried to calm down sucking in gulps of air and releasing them slowly he didnt like flying as it was never since his days in the sas when they had dropped him from a helicopter jesus that was no way to calm yourself will passengers for british airways super shuttle flight the voice was cool and precise triggering a mass movement people rose to their feet checked their baggage and made for the gate just mentioned which gate hed missed the announcement was it his flight maybe he should phone ahead so they would have the car waiting he hated flying that was why he had come down by train on sunday sunday and today was wednesday it felt like over a week had passed in fact hed been in london only two full days boarding oh christ where was his ticket hed no luggage nothing to worry about there the newspapers wriggled beneath his arm trying to break free and fall in a mess on the floor he pushed them back together again squeezing them tightly with his elbow he had to calm down had to think about cafferty had to get everything straight in his mind so that the defence could find no chink in his story keep to the facts forget about the wolfman forget about lisa rhona sammy kenny tommy watkiss george flight flight he hadnt notified flight they would wonder where he was hed have to phone when he landed he should phone now but then he might miss the shuttle forget it concentrate on cafferty they would have his notes ready for him when he arrived so he could go through them before he entered the witness box there were only the two witnesses werent there the frightened publican whom they had more or less coerced into giving evidence and rebus himself he had to be strong confident and believable he caught sight of himself in a fulllength mirror as he made for the departure gate he looked like hed spent a night on the tiles the memory of the night made him smile everything would be all right he should phone lisa too just to say what thank you he supposed up the ramp now the narrow doorway in front of him flanked by smiling steward and stewardess good morning sir good morning he saw they were standing by a stack of complimentary newspapers christ he could have saved himself a few bawbees the aisle was narrow too he had to squeeze past businessmen who were stuffing coats briefcases and bags into the luggage lockers above their seats he found his own window seat and fell into it wrestling with the seatbelt and securing it outside the groundcrew were still working a plane took off smoothly in the distance the dull roar perceptible even from here a plump middleaged woman sat beside him spread her newspaper out so that half of it fell onto rebuss right leg and began to read she had offered no greeting no acknowledgment of his existence fyt madam he thought to himself still staring out of the window but then she gave a loud tsk prompting him to turn towards her she was staring at him through thicklensed spectacles staring and at the same time rapping a finger against the newspaper nobodys safe these days she said as rebus examined the news story and saw that it was some fanciful piece about the wolfman nobody i wont let my daughter out these nights a nine oclock curfew i told her until they catch him even then you can never be sure i mean he could be anybody her look told rebus that he too was not beyond suspicion he smiled reassuringly i wasnt going to go she went on but frank thats my husband he said it was all booked so i should visiting glasgow are you not exactly visiting my son lives there hes an accountant in the oil industry he paid for my ticket so i could see how hes getting on i worry about him what with being so far away and everything i mean its a rough place glasgow isnt it you read about it in the papers anything could happen up there yes thought rebus his smile fixed so unlike london there was a sound like an electronic doorbell and the fasten seatbelts sign came on next to where the no smoking sign was already lit jesus rebus could kill for a cigarette was he in smoking or no smoking he couldnt make out and couldnt remember which hed plumped for at the ticket desk was smoking allowed on airplanes these days anyway if god had meant man to smoke at feet wouldnt he have given us all longer necks the woman next to him looked to have no neck at all pity the poor serial killer who tried cutting his way through that throat that was a terrible thing to think god please forgive me as penance he began to concentrate on the womans conversation right up until takeoff when even she was forced to stop talking for a moment or two rebus taking advantage of the situation tucked his newspapers into the pocket on the back of the seat in front of him leaned his head against the back of his own seat and promptly fell asleep george flight tried rebuss hotel again from the old bailey only to be told that rebus had left in a hurry earlier in the morning after asking how best to get to heathrow looks like hes done a runner dc lamb commented frightened off by our consummate professionalism i shouldnt wonder leave off lamb growled flight mind you it is a bit mysterious why would he leave without saying anything because hes a jock with all due respect sir he was probably worried you were going to drop a bill into his lap flight smiled obligingly but his thoughts were elsewhere last night rebus had been seeing that psychologist dr frazer and now he was in a hurry to leave london what had happened flights nose twitched he liked a good honest mystery he was in court to have a quiet word with malcolm chambers chambers was prosecuting counsel in a case involving one of flights snouts the snout had been incredibly stupid had been caught redhanded flight had told the man there was little he could do but he would do what he could the snout had given him a lot of very useful tips in the past year helping put a few fairly nasty individuals behind bars flight guessed he owed the man a helping hand so he would talk to chambers not to influence the prosecutor that was unthinkable naturally but to fill in some details on the snouts useful contribution to police work and to society a contribution which would come to a sad end should chambers push for the maximum sentence et cetera dirty job but someone had to do it and besides flight was proud of his network of informers the idea of that network suddenly splintering was well best not to consider it he wasnt looking forward to going to chambers begging bowl in hand especially not after the farce involving tommy watkiss watkiss was back out on the street probably telling the story in pubs up and down the east end to a laughing chorus of hangerson all about how the arresting constable had said hello tommy whats going on here flight doubted chambers would ever forget it or let flight forget it what the hell best get the begging over and done with hello there it was a female voice close behind him he turned to face the cat like eyes and bright red lips of cath farraday hello cath what are you doing here she explained that she was at the old bailey to meet with the influential crime reporter from one of the more upmarket dailies hes halfway through covering a fraud case she explained and never strays too far from the courtroom flight nodded feeling awkward in her presence from the corner of his eye he could see that lamb was enjoying his discomfort so he tried to be brave and steeled himself to meet the full force of her gaze i saw the pieces you placed in todays press he said she folded her arms i cant say im optimistic about their chances of success do the reporters know were spinning them a yarn one or two were a bit suspicious but theyve got a lot of hungry readers out there starving for want of another wolfman story she unfolded her arms and reached into her shoulderbag ergo theyve got a lot of hungry editors too i think theyll take any tidbit we throw them she had brought a pack of cigarettes from her bag and without offering them out lit one dropped the pack back into her bag and snapped the bag shut well lets hope something comes of it you said this was all inspector rebuss idea thats right then im doubtful having met him i wouldnt say psychology was his strong point no flight sounded surprised he doesnt have a strong point broke in lamb i wouldnt go that far said flight protectively but lamb merely gave that insolent grin of his flights was part embarrassed partfurious he knew exactly what lambs grin was saying dont think we dont know why youre sticking so close to him why you two are so chummy cath had smiled at lambs interruption but when she spoke her words were directed at flight she did not deign to consort with the lower ranks is rebus still around flight shrugged i wish i knew cath ive heard he was last seen heading off towards heathrow but he didnt take any luggage with him oh well she didnt sound disappointed flight suddenly shot a hand into the air waving malcolm chambers acknowledged the signal and came towards them walking as though no effort whatsoever was involved flight felt the need for introductions mr chambers this is inspector cath farraday shes the press liaison officer on wolfman ah said chambers taking her hand momentarily in his the woman responsible for this mornings lurid headlines yes said cath her voice had taken on a new soft feminine edge an edge flight couldnt recall having heard before sorry if they spoiled your breakfast the impossible happened chamberss face cracked into a smile flight hadnt seen him smile outside of the courtroom in several years this really was a morning for surprises they did not spoil my breakfast chambers was saying i found them highly entertaining he turned to flight indicating by this that cath was dismissed inspector flight i can give you ten minutes then im due in court or would you prefer to meet for lunch ten minutes should suffice excellent then come with me he glanced towards lamb who was still feeling slightly snubbed by cath and bring your young man with you if you must then he was gone striding on noisy leather soles across the floor of the concourse flight winked at cath then followed lamb silent and furious behind him cath grinned enjoying lambs discomfort and the performance chambers had just put on shed heard of him of course his courtroom speeches were reckoned to be just about the most persuasive going and he had even collected what could only be described as groupies people who would attend a trial no matter how convoluted or boring just to hear his closing remarks her own little coterie of news reporters seemed bland by comparison so rebus had scuttled off home had he good luck to him excuse me a short blurred figure stood before her she narrowed her eyes until they were the merest slits and peered at a middleaged woman in a black cloak the woman was smiling youre not on the jury for court eight by any chance cath farraday smiled and shook her head oh well sighed the usher moving off again there was such a thing in law as a hung jury but there were also ushers who would happily see some individual jurors the rogue jurors hung cath turned on her pointed heels and went off to fulfil her appointment she wondered if jim stevens would remember he was meeting her he was a good journalist but his memory was like a sieve at times and seemed especially bad now he was to be a father rebus had time to kill in glasgow time to visit the horseshoe bar or walk through kelvinside or even venture down to the clyde time enough to look up an old friend always supposing hed had any glasgow was changing edinburgh had grown corpulent these past few years during which time glasgow had been busy getting fit it had a toned muscular look to it a confident swagger rather than the drunken stagger which had been its public perception for so long it wasnt all good news some of the citys character had seeped away the shiny new shops and wine bars the bright new office blocks all had a homogenous quality to them go to any prosperous city in the world and you would find buildings just like them a golden hue of uniformity not that rebus was grieving anything was better than the old swampland glasgow had been in the s s and early s and the people were more or less the same blunt yet wonderfully dry in their humour the pubs too had not changed very much though their clientele might come more expensively and fashionably dressed and the menu might include chilli or lasagne along with the more traditional fare rebus ate two pies in one pub standing at the bar with his left foot resting on the polished brass rail he was biding his time the plane had landed on schedule the car had been waiting the journey into glasgow had been fast he arrived in the city centre at twenty minutes past twelve and would not be called to give his evidence until around three time to kill he left the pub and took what he hoped might be a shortcut though he had no ready destination in mind down a cobbled lane towards some railway arches some crumbling warehouse buildings and a rubblestrewn wasteland there were a lot of people milling about here and he realised that what he had thought were piles of rubbish lying around on the damp ground were actually articles for sale he had stumbled upon a flea market and by the look of the customers it was where the down and outs did their shopping dank unclean clothes lay in bundles thrown down anywhere near them stood the vendors shuffling their feet saying nothing one or two stoking up a makeshift fire around which others clustered for warmth the atmosphere was muted people might cough and hack and wheeze but they seldom spoke a few punks their resplendent mohicans as out of place as a handful of parrots in a cage of sparrows milled around not really looking like they meant to buy anything the locals regarded them with suspicion tourists the collective look said just bloody tourists beneath the arches themselves were narrow aisles lined with stalls and trestle tables the smell in here was worse but rebus was curious no outoftown hypermarket could have provided such a range of wares broken spectacles old wireless sets with this or that knob missing lamps hats tarnished cutlery purses and wallets incomplete sets of dominoes and playing cards one stall seemed to sell nothing but pieces of used soap most of them looking as though they had come from public conveniences another sold false teeth an old man hands shaking almost uncontrollably had found a bottom set he liked but could not find a top set to match rebus wrinkled his face and turned away the mohicans had opened a game of cluedo hey pal they called to the stallholder theres nae weapons here wheres the dagger an the gun an that the man looked at the open box you could improvise he suggested rebus smiled and moved on london was different to all this it felt more congested things moved too quickly there seemed pressure and stress everywhere driving a car from a to b shopping for groceries going out for the evening all were turned into immensely tiring activities londoners appeared to him to be on very short fuses indeed here the people were stoics they used their humour as a barrier against everything londoners had to take on the chin different worlds different civilisations glasgow had been the second city of the empire it had been the first city of scotland all through the twentieth century got a fag mister it was one of the punks now up close rebus saw she was a girl hed assumed the group had been all male they all looked so similar no sorry im trying to give up but she had already started to move away in search of someone anyone who could immediately gratify he looked at his watch it was gone two and it might take him half an hour to get from here to the court the punks were still arguing about the missing cluedo pieces i mean how can you play a game when theres bits missing know what i mean pal like wheres colonel mustard an the boards nearly torn in half by the way how much dye want for it the argumentative punk was tall and immensely thin his size and shape accentuated by the black he wore from tip to toe twa ply o reek rebuss father would have called him was the wolfman fat or thin tall or short young or old did he have a job a wife a husband even did someone close to him know the truth and were they keeping quiet when would he strike next and where lisa had been unable to answer any of these questions maybe flight was right about psychology so much of it was guesswork like a game where some of the pieces are missing and nobody knows the rules sometimes you ended up playing a game completely different to the original a game of your own devising that was what rebus needed a new set of rules in his game against the wolfman rules which would be to his benefit the newspaper stories were the start of it but only if the wolfman made the next move maybe cafferty would get off this time but thered always be another the board was always prepared for a fresh start rebus gave his evidence and was out of the court by four he handed the file on the case back to his driver a balding middleaged detective sergeant and settled into the passenger seat let me know what happens he said the driver nodded straight back to the airport inspector funny how a glaswegian accent could be made to sound so sarcastic the sergeant had managed somehow to make rebus feel his inferior then again there was little love lost between east and west coasts there might have been a wall dividing the two such was their own abiding cold war the driver was repeating his question a little louder now thats right said rebus just as loudly its a jetsetting life in the lothian and borders police his head was fairly thrumming by the time he got back to the hotel in piccadilly he needed a quiet night a night alone he hadnt managed to contact flight or lisa but they could wait until tomorrow for now he wanted nothing nothing but silence and stillness lying on the bed and staring at the ceiling his mind nowhere it had been one hell of a week and the week was only halfway through he took two paracetamol from the bottle he had brought and washed them down with half a glass of tepid tapwater the water tasted foul was it true that london water had passed through seven sets of kidneys before reaching the drinker it had an oily quality in his mouth not the sharp clear taste of the water in edinburgh seven sets of kidneys he looked at his cases thinking of the amount of stuff he had brought with him useless stuff stuff he would never use even the bottle of malt sat more or less untouched there was a telephone ringing somewhere his telephone but he managed to ignore the fact for fully fifteen seconds he growled and clawed at the wall with his hand finally finding the receiver and dragging it to his ear this had better be good where the fuck have you been it was flights voice anxious and angry good evening to you too george theres been another killing rebus sat up and swung his legs off the bed when the body was discovered an hour ago theres some thing else he paused we caught the killer now rebus stood up what we caught him as he was running off rebuss knees almost failed him but he locked them his voice was unnaturally quiet is it him could be where are you im at hq weve brought him here the murder took place in a house off brick lane not too far from wolf street in a house that was a surprise the other murders had all taken place out of doors but then as lisa had said the pattern kept changing yes said flight and thats not all the killer was found with money on him stolen from the house and some jewellery and a camera another break in the pattern rebus sat down on the bed again i see what youre getting at he said but the method similar to be sure philip cousins is on his way he was at a dinner somewhere im going to the scene george ill come to see you afterwards fine flight sounded as though he had hoped for this rebus was scrabbling for paper and a pen whats the address copperplate street rebus wrote the address on the back of his travel ticket from the trip to glasgow john yes george dont go off again without telling me okay yes george rebus paused can i go now go on then bugger off ill see you here later rebus put down the telephone and felt an immense weariness take control of him weighting his legs and arms and head he took several deep breaths and rose to his feet then walked to the sink and splashed water on his face rubbing a wet hand around his neck and throat he looked up hardly recognising himself in the wallmounted mirror sighed and spread his hands either side of his face the way hed seen roy scheider do once in a film its showtime rebuss taxi driver was full of tales of the krays richardson and jack the ripper with brick lane their destination he was especially vociferous on the subject of old jack done his first prossie on brick lane richardson though he was evil used to torture people in a scrapyard you knew when he was electrocuting some poor bastard cos the bulb across the scrap yard gates kept flickering then a low chuckle a sideways flick of the head krays used to drink in that pub on the corner my youngest used to drink in there got in some terrible punchups so i banned him from going he works in the city courier sort of stuff you know motorbikes rebus who had been slouching in the back seat now gripped the headrest on the front passenger seat and yanked himself forward motorbike messenger yeah makes a bleeding packet twice what i take home a week ill tell you that hes just bought himself a flat down in docklands only they call them riverside apartments these days thats a laugh i know some of the guys who built them every bloody shortcut in the book hammering in screws instead of screwing them plasterboard so thin you can almost see your neighbours never mind hear them a friend of my daughter works as a courier in the city yeah maybe i know him whats his name kenny kenny he shook his head rebus stared at where the silvery hairs on the drivers neck disappeared into his shirt collar nah i dont know a kenny kev yes and a couple of chrisses but not kenny rebus sat back again it struck him that he didnt know what kennys surname was are we nearly there he asked two minutes guv theres a lovely shortcut coming up should save us some time takes us right past where richardson used to hang out a crowd of reporters had gathered outside in the narrow street housefront pavement then road where the crowd stood held back by uniformed constables did nobody in london possess such a thing as a front garden rebus had yet to see a house witha garden apart from the millionaire blocks in kensington john a female voice escaping from the scrum of newsmen she pushed her way towards him he signalled for the line of uniforms to break momentarily so as to let her through what are you doing here lisa looked a little shaken heard a newsflash she gasped thought id come over im not sure thats such a good idea lisa rebus was thinking of jean coopers body if this were similar any comment to make yelled one of the newsmen rebus was aware of flashguns of the bright homing lamps attached to video cameras other reporters were shouting now desperate for a story that would reach the first editions come on then said rebus pulling lisa frazer towards the door of number philip cousins was still dressed in dark suit and tie suitably funereal isobel penny was in black too a full length dress with long tight sleeves she did not look funereal she looked divine she smiled at rebus as he entered the cramped livingroom nodding in recognition inspector rebus said cousins they said you might drop by never one to miss a good corpse rebus replied drily cousins stooping over the body looked up at him quite the smell was there clogging up rebuss nostrils and lungs some people couldnt smell it but he always could it was strong and salty rich clotting cloying it smelt like nothing else on earth and behind it lurked another smell more bland like tallow candlewax cold water the two contrasting smells of life and death rebus was willing to bet that cousins could smell it but he doubted isobel penny could a middleaged woman lay on the floor an ungainly twist of legs and arms her throat had been cut there were signs of a struggle ornaments shattered and knocked from their perches bloody handprints smeared across one wall cousins stood up and sighed very clumsy he said he glanced towards isobel penny who was sketching on her notepad penny he said you look quite delightful this evening have i told you she smiled again blushed but said nothing cousins turned to rebus ignoring lisa frazers silent presence its a copycat he said with another sigh but a copycat of little wit or talent hes obviously read the descriptions in the newspapers which have been detailed but inaccurate id say it was an interrupted burglary he panicked went for his knife and realised that if he made it look like our friend the wolfman then he might just get away with it he looked down at the corpse again not terribly clever i suppose the vultures have gathered rebus nodded when i came in there were about a dozen reporters outside probably double that by now we know what they want to hear dont we i fear they are going to be disappointed cousins checked his watch not worth going back to dinner weve probably missed the port and cheese damned fine table too such a pity he waved his hand in the direction of the body anything youd like to see or shall we wrap this one up as it were rebus smiled the humour was as dark as the suit but any humour was welcome the smell in the air had been distilled now to that of raw steak and brown sauce he shook his head there was nothing more to be done in here but outside outside he was about to create an outrage flight would hate him for it in fact everybody would hate him for it but hate was fine hate was an emotion and without emotion what else was left lisa had already staggered out into the tiny hallway where a police officer was trying awkwardly to comfort her as rebus came out of the room she shook her head and straightened up im fine she said the first one always hits you hard said rebus come on im going to try out a spot of psychology on the wolfman the huddle of reporters and cameramen had become a sizeable crowd now including the interested and the curious amateurs the line of uniformed policemen had locked arms in a small but unbreakable chain the questions began over here can we ask you who you are you were at the canal werent you a statement anything to say wolfman is it the wolfman is it just a few words if rebus had walked to within a few inches of them lisa by his side one of the reporters had leaned close to lisa asking for her name lisa lisa frazer are you working on the case lisa im a psychologist rebus cleared his throat noisily the reporters were like mongrels in a dogs home calming quickly when they realised it was their turn at last for the feeding bowl he raised his arms and they fell quiet a short statement gentlemen said rebus can we just ask who you are first but rebus shook his head it didnt matter did it they would know soon enough how many scottish coppers were working on wolfman flight would know cath farraday would know and the journalists would find out that didnt matter then one of them unable to hold back asked the question have you caught him rebus tried to catch the mans eye but every eye was silently asking the same thing is it the wolfman and this time rebus nodded yes he said emphatically its the wolfman weve caught him lisa looked at him in dumb surprise more questions yelled now screeched but the chain in front of them would not break and somehow they did not think simply to walk around it rebus had turned away and saw cousins and isobel penny standing just outside the door of the house rigid unable to believe what they had just heard he winked at them and walked with lisa to where his cab still waited the driver folded his evening paper and stuck it down the side of his seat you fairly got them going guv what did you say nothing much said rebus settling back in his seat and smiling towards lisa frazer just a few fibs fibs so this was what flight looked like when he was angry fibs he seemed unable to believe what he was hearing you call that a few fibs cath farradays going apeshit trying to calm those bastards down theyre like fucking animals half of them are ready to go to print on this and you call it fibs youre off your trolley rebus so it was back to rebus was it well then so be it rebus remembered that theyd promised theyd have dinner together this evening but somehow he doubted the invitation still stood george flight had been interviewing the murderer his cheeks were veined with blood his tie unknotted and hanging loose around his half unbuttoned shirt he paced what floor there was in the small office rebus knew that outside the closed door people were listening in a mixture of fear and amusement fear at flights anger amusement that rebus was its sole recipient youre the fucking limit flights anger had peaked his voice had dropped by half a decibel what gives you the right rebus slapped the desk with his hand hed had enough of this ill tell you what gives me the right george the mere fact of the wolfman gives me the right to do anything i think best best flight sounded freshly outraged now ive heard it all giving the papers a crock of shit like that is supposed to be best by christ id hate to see your idea of worst rebuss voice was every bit the equal of flights now and rising hes out there somewhere and hes laughing his head off at us because he seems to know how well play every round hes knocking hell out of us rebus grew quiet flight was listening now and that was what he wanted we need to get him riled get him to lift his head over the trench hes hiding in so he can see what the fuck is going on we need him angry george not angry at the world angry at us because when he raises his head well be ready to bite it off weve already accused him of being everything from gay to a cannibal from pluto now were telling everyone hes been caught rebus was reaching his point his defence he lowered his voice still further i dont think hell be able to take that george really i dont i think hell have to make contact maybe with the papers maybe directly with us just to let us know or kill again countered flight that would let us know rebus shook his head if he kills again we keep it quiet total media blackout he gets no publicity everybody still thinks hes been caught sooner or later hell have to show himself rebus was completely calm now and so was flight flight rubbed both hands over his cheeks and down to his jaw he was staring into space thinking it over rebus did not doubt the plan would work it might take time but it would work basic sas training if you cant locate your enemy make the enemy come to you besides it was the only plan they had john what if the publicity doesnt bother him publicity or the lack of it rebus shrugged he had no answer to that all he had were case histories and his own instincts finally flight shook his head go back to edinburgh john he said tiredly just do it rebus stared at him not blinking willing him to say something else but george flight simply walked to the door opened it and closed it behind him that was it then rebus released his breath in a long hiss go back to edinburgh wasnt that what everyone had wanted all along laine lamb and the rest of them flight too maybe even rebus himself hed told himself he could do no good here well he was doing no good so why not go home the answer was simple the case had grabbed him by the throat there was no escaping it the wolfman faceless bodiless had pressed a blade to rebuss ear and was holding it there ready to slice and besides there was london itself full of its own stories rhona sammy sammy and kenny rebus had to remind himself that he was still interested in kenny and lisa above all there was lisa the taxi had dropped her off at her flat she had been quite pale but insisted she was all right insisted he go on without her he should ring her check she really was okay what and tell her he was leaving no he had to confront flight he opened the door and went into the murder room flight was not there the curious faces looked at him from their desks their telephones their wallcharts and photographs he looked at no one but especially not at lamb who was grinning from behind a manila file his eyes peering over at rebus flight was in the hallway outside deep in discussion with the duty sergeant who nodded and moved off rebus saw flight sag leaning his back against the wall rubbing his face again he approached slowly giving george flight an extra moment or two of peace and quiet george he said flight looked up smiled weakly you never give up john do you im sorry george i should have checked with you before i pulled a stunt like that block the story if you want flight gave a short humourless laugh too late its been on the local radio news already the other stations cant just sit back itll be on every local news report by midnight its your snowball john you started it running down the hill all we can do now is watch it getting bigger and bigger he stabbed a finger into rebuss chest cath is going to be after your guts lad shes the one theyll blame the one wholl have to apologise wholl have the job of gaining their trust all over again flight now wagged the finger backwards and forwards then grinned and if anyone can do it inspector cath farraday can he checked his watch right ive let the bugger stew long enough time to get back to the interview room hows it going flight shrugged singing like gracie fields we couldnt stop him if we wanted to he thinks were going to pin all the wolfman killings on him so hes telling us everything he knows and some things hes probably making up besides cousins said it was a copycat done to disguise a cocked up burglary flight nodded i sometimes think philips in the wrong game this guys a petty thief not the bloody wolfman but ill tell you what is interesting hes told us he sells the stuff on to a mutual friend who tommy watkiss well well coming flight pointed along the corridor towards the stairwell rebus shook his head i want to make a couple of phone calls i might catch you up later suit yourself rebus watched flight go sometimes it was only brute stubbornness that kept humans going long after their limbs and intellect had told them to quit flight was like a footballer playing in extra time rebus hoped he could see the game out to its end they watched him as he walked back through the murder room lamb in particular seemed to peer at him from behind a report eyes gleaming with amusement there was a noise coming from his office a strange tapping noise he pushed open the door and saw on his desk a small toy a grotesque plastic jaw atop two oversized feet the jaw was bright red the teeth gleaming white and the feet walked to a clockwork whirr while the jaws snapped shut then open shut then open snap snap snap snap snap snap rebus furious at the joke walked to the desk lifted the contraption and pulled at it his own teeth bright and gritted until it snapped in two but the feet kept on moving stopping only when the spring had run down not that rebus was noticing he was staring at the two halves the upper and lower jaws sometimes things werent what they seemed the punk at the glasgow flea market had turned out to be a girl and at the flea market they had been selling teeth false plastic teeth like a supermarket picknmix counter any size you liked christ he should have seen it sooner rebus walked quickly back through the murder room lamb doubtless responsible for the joke seemed ready to say something until he saw the look on rebuss face an urgent dontmesswithme look he ran along the corridor and down the stairs down towards the euphemism known as an interview room a man is helping police with their enquiries rebus loved those euphemisms he knocked and entered a detective was changing the tape in a recording machine flight was leaning across the table to offer a cigarette to a dishevelled young man a young man with yellow bruising on his face and skinned knuckles george rebus tried to sound composed could i have a word flight pushed back his chair noisily leaving the cigarette packet with the prisoner rebus held open the door indicating for flight to move outside then he thought of something and caught the prisoners eye do you know somebody called kenny he asked loads rides a motorbike the young man shrugged again and reached into the packet for a cigarette there was no answer forthcoming and flight was outside waiting so rebus closed the door what was that all about asked flight maybe nothing said rebus do you remember when we went to the old bailey how someone shouted out when the case was stopped someone in the public gallery thats right well i recognised the voice its a teenager called kenny hes one of those motorcycle messengers so hes going out with my daughter ah and that bothers you rebus nodded yes a bit and thats what you want to see me about rebus managed a weak smile no no nothing like that so whats on your mind i was in glasgow today giving evidence i had a bit of free time and went to a flea market the sort of place tramps go to do their messages messages their shopping rebus explained and and there was a stall selling false teeth odds and sods top sets and bottom sets not necessarily matching he paused to let those final three words sink home is there someplace like that in london george flight nodded brick lane for one theres a market there every sunday the main road sells fruit veg clothes but there are streets off where they sell anything theyve got bricabrac old rubbish it makes for an interesting walk but you wouldnt buy anything but you could buy false teeth there yes said flight after a moments thought i dont doubt it then hes been cleverer than we thought hasnt he youre saying the bite marks arent real im saying theyre not the wolfmans teeth the lower set smaller than the upper you end up with a pretty strange jaw as doctor morrison showed us remember how can i forget i was going to feed the pictures to the press which is probably exactly what the wolfman wanted he goes to brick lane market or at least to somewhere like it and buys any upper and lower set they dont match but that doesnt matter and he uses them to make those damned bite marks flight seemed dismissive but rebus knew the man was hooked he cant be that clever yes he can persisted rebus hes had everything worked out from the start from before the start hes been playing with us like we were clockwork george then we have to wait until sunday flight said thoughtfully search every stall at every market find the ones selling false teeth there cant be many and ask about the person who bought a set of teeth without trying them for size rebus burst out laughing it was ridiculous it was absolutely mad but he was sure it was true and he was sure the stallholder would remember and would give a description surely most of the customers would try for size it was the best lead theyd had so far and it might just be the only one theyd need flight was smiling too shaking his head at the dark comic reality of it rebus held a closed fist in front of him and flight brought his open palm to rest beneath it when rebus opened his hand the plastic chattering teeth fell into flights palm just like clockwork said rebus whats more weve got lamb to thank he thought about this but id rather he didnt get to know flight nodded anything you say john anything you say back at his desk rebus sat in front of a fresh sheet of paper the wolfman had been too clever too clever by half he thought of lisa of her notion that the killer might have a criminal record it was possible possible too that the wolfman simply knew how the police worked so he might be a policeman or work in forensics or be a journalist a civil rights campaigner work in the law or write bloody scripts for television he might just have done his reading there were plenty of case histories in libraries and bookshops plenty of biographies of murderers tracing how they were caught by studying them you could learn how not to get caught however hard rebus tried he just couldnt whittle away at the list of possibilities the teeth might be yet another dead end that was why they had to make the wolfman come to them he threw down his pen and reached for the telephone trying lisas number but the phone just rang and rang and rang maybe shed taken a couple of sleeping pills or gone for a walk or was a heavy sleeper you stupid prick he looked towards the open door cath farraday was standing there in her favourite position against the jamb arms folded as if to let him know shed been there for some time you incredibly stupid little man rebus pinned a smile to his face good evening inspector how can i help you well she said coming into the room you can start by keeping your gob shut and your brain in gear you never speak to the press never she was rearing over him now looking ready to butt him in the face he tried to avoid her eyes eyes sharp enough to cut a man open and found himself staring instead at her hair it too looked dangerous do you understand me fytp said rebus speaking without thinking what loud and clear he said yes loud and clear she nodded slowly not seeming completely convinced then threw a newspaper onto the desk he hadnt noticed the paper till now and glanced towards it there was a photograph on the front not large but large enough it showed him talking to the reporters lisa standing nervously by his side the headline was larger wolfman caught cath farraday tapped the photograph whos the bimbo rebus felt his cheeks growing red shes a psychologist shes helping on the case cath farraday looked at rebus as though he were something more than merely stupid then shook her head and turned to leave keep the paper she said there are plenty more where it came from she sits with the newspaper in front of her there are several more piled on the floor she has the scissors in her hand one of the reports mentions who the policeman is inspector john rebus the report calls him an expert of serial murders and another report mentions that standing to his left is a police psychologist lisa frazer she cut around the photograph then cuts another line splitting rebus from frazer time and again she does this until she has two new neat piles one of john rebus one of lisa frazer she takes one of the photographs of the psychologist and snips off her head then smiling she sits down to write a letter a very difficult letter but that doesnt matter she has all the time in the world all the time churchill rebus woke to his radioalarm at seven sat up in bed and rang lisa no reply maybe something was wrong over breakfast he skimmed the newspapers two of the quality titles carried bold front page stories recounting the capture of the wolfman but they were couched in speculative prose police are believed it is thought that police may have already captured the evil cutthroat killer only the tabloids carried pictures of rebus at his little press conference even they despite the shouting headlines were being cagey probably they didnt believe it themselves that didnt matter what mattered was that somewhere the wolfman might be reading about his capture his there was that word again rebus couldnt help but think of the wolfman as a man yet part of him was wary of narrowing the possible identity in this way there was still nothing to indicate that it could not be a woman he needed to keep an open mind and did the sex of the beast really matter actually yes probably it did what was the use of women waiting hours just so that they could travel home from a pub or party in a minicab driven by another woman if the killer they were so afraid of turned out to be a woman all over london people were taking protective measures housing estates were patrolled by neighbourhood vigilantes one group had already beaten up a completely innocent stranger whod wandered onto the estate because he was lost and needed directions his crime the estate was white and the stranger was coloured flight had told rebus how prevalent racism was in london especially the southeast corner go into some of those estates with a tan and youll end up being nutted rebus had encountered it already thanks to lambs own particular brand of xenophobia of course there wasnt nearly so much racism in scotland there was no need the scots had bigotry instead he finished the papers and went to hq it was early yet a little after half past eight a few of the murder team were busy at their desks but the smaller offices were empty the office rebus had taken over was stuffy and he opened the windows the day was mild a slight breeze wafting in he could hear the distant sound of a computer printer of telephones starting to ring outside the traffic flowed in slow motion a dull rumbling nothing more without realising he was doing it rebus rested his head on his arms this close to the desk he could smell wood and varnish mixed with pencillead it reminded him of primary school a knock echoing somewhere jarred his sleep then a cough not a necessary cough a diplomatic cough excuse me sir rebus lifted his head sharply from the desk a wpc was standing her head around the door looking at him he had been sleeping with his mouth open there was a trail of saliva on the side of his mouth and a tiny pool of the stuff on the surface of the desk yes he said still muzzy what is it a sympathetic smile they werent all like lamb he had to remember that on a case like this you became a team came to feel as close to the others as you would to your best friend closer than that even sometimes someone to see you sir well she wants to speak to someone about the murders and youre about the only one here rebus looked at his watch eight fortyfive he hadnt been asleep long then good he felt he could confide in this wpc how do i look he asked well she said one side of your face is red from where youve been lying on it but otherwise youll do then the smile again a good deed in a naughty world thanks he said okay send her in please right you are the head disappeared but only momentarily can i get you a coffee or something coffee would hit the spot said rebus thanks milk sugar just milk the head disappeared the door closed rebus tried to look busy it wasnt difficult there was a mound of fresh paperwork to be gone through lab reports and the like results negative from doortodoor on the jean cooper murder from the interviews with everyone whod been in the pub with her that sunday night he picked up the first sheet and held it in front of him there was a knock on the door so soft that he only just caught it come in he called the door opened slowly a woman was standing there looking around her as though her timidity might be about to turn to fright she was in her late twenties with closely cropped brown hair but other than that she defied description she was more a collection of hots than anything else not tall but not exactly short not slim but by no means overweight and her face lacked anything approaching a personality hello rebus said halfrising to his feet he indicated a chair on the other side of the desk and watched as with breathtaking slowness she closed the door testing it afterwards to make sure it was going to stay shut only then did she turn to look at him or at least towards him for she had a way of focusing just to the side of his face so that her eyes never met his hello she said she seemed ready to stand throughout proceedings rebus who had seated himself again gestured once more with his hand please sit down at last she poised herself above the chair and lowered herself into it rebus had the feeling that he was the boss at some job interview and that she wanted the job so much shed worked herself into a good and proper state about it you wanted to speak to someone he said in what he hoped were soft and sympathetic tones yes she said well it was a start my name is inspector rebus and yours is jan crawford okay jan now how can i help you she swallowed gazing at the window behind rebuss left ear its the killings she said they call him the wolfman rebus was undecided maybe she was a crank but she didnt seem like one she just seemed jumpy perhaps she had good reason thats right he cajoled the papers call him that yes they do she had become suddenly excitable the words spilling from her and they said last night on the radio this morning in the paper she pulled a newspaper clipping from her bag it was the photograph of rebus and lisa frazer this is you isnt it rebus nodded then youll know i mean you must the paper says hes done it again theyre saying youve caught him or maybe youve caught him nobodys sure she paused breathing heavily all the time her eyes were on the window rebus kept his mouth shut letting her calm down her eyes were filling becoming glossy with tears as she spoke one droplet squirmed out from the corner of an eye and crept down towards her lips her chin nobodys sure whether youve caught him but i could be sure at least i think i can be sure i didnt get i mean ive been scared so long now and i havent said anything i didnt want anybody to know my mum and dad to know i just wanted to shut it out but thats stupid isnt it when he could do it again if hes not caught so i decided to i mean maybe i can she made to stand up thought better of it and squeezed her hands together instead can what miss crawford identify him she said her voice almost a whisper now she searched in the sleeve of her blouse found a tissue and blewher nose the tear dripped onto one knee identify him she repeated if hes here if youve caught him rebus was staring hard at her now and at last his eyes found hers her brown eyes covered with a film of liquid hed seen cranks before plenty of them maybe she was and maybe she wasnt what do you mean jan she sniffed again turned her eyes to the window swallowed he almost got me she said i was the first before all the others he almost got me i was almost the first and then she lifted her head at first rebus couldnt understand why but then he saw under her right ear running in a crescent shape towards her white throat there was a dark pink scar no more than an inch long the kind of scar you made with a knife the first intended kill of the wolfman what do you think they faced one another across the desk four inches of fresh paperwork had appeared in the intray threatening to overbalance the pile and send it slewing down across the floor rebus was eating a cheese and onion sandwich from ginos comfort food one of the nice things about being a bachelor was that you could eat without fear of regrets onions branston pickle huge sausage egg and tomato sauce sandwiches curried beans on toast and all the other delicacies favoured by the male what do you think then flight sipped from a can of cola giving slight closedmouth burps between times he had listened to rebuss story and had met with jan crawford she had now been taken to an interview room to be fed tea and sympathy by a wpc while a detective took her statement flight and rebus both hoped she would not have to deal with lamb well flight rubbed a knuckle against his right eye i dont know john this case has gone gaga youre off telling porkies to the press your pictures all over the front pages weve got our first maybe not our last copycat killing then you come up with some idea of flea markets and false teeth and now this he opened his arms wide pleading for help to put his world back into some semblance of order its all a bit much rebus bit into the sandwich chewing slowly but it fits the pattern doesnt it from what ive read about serial killers the first attempt is often botched theyre not quite ready they havent planned well enough somebody screams they panic he didnt have his technique honed he didnt go for the mouth so she was able to scream then he found that human skin and muscle is tougher than it looks hed probably seen too many horror films thought it was like cutting through butter so he scraped her but not enough to do serious damage maybe the knife wasnt sharp enough who knows the point is he got scared and he ran flight merely shrugged and she didnt come forward he said thats what bothers me shes come forward now tell me this george how many rape victims do we actually see i heard tell somebody reckons its less than one in three jan crawford is a timid little woman scared half to death all she wanted to do was forget about it but she couldnt her conscience wouldnt let her her conscience brought her to us i still dont like it john dont ask me why rebus finished the sandwich and made a show of wiping his handstogether your coppers instinct he suggested just a little sarcastically maybe said flight appearing to miss or at least to ignore rebuss tone theres just something about her trust me ive talked to her ive been through it all with her and george i believe her i think it was him twelfth of december last year that was his first time maybe not said flight maybe there are others who havent come forward maybe what matters is one did i still dont see what good this does us flight picked up a sheet of paper from the desk and read the scribbled details he was about six feet tall white and i think he had brown hair he was running away with his back to me so i couldnt see his face flight put down the paper that narrows things down nicely doesnt it yes rebus wanted to say it does because now i think im dealing with a man and before this i wasnt sure but he kept that particular thought to himself hed given george flight enough grief in the past few days thats still not the point he said instead then what in gods name is the point flight had finished the can of cola and now tossed it into a metal wastepaper bin where it rang against the side the reverberation lasting for what seemed like an age when all was quiet again rebus spoke the point is the wolfman doesnt know she didnt get a good look at him weve got to persuade miss crawford to go public let the tv cameras feast on her the one who got away then we say that shes given us a good description if that doesnt panic the bastard nothing will panic everything you do is designed to panic him what good does that do what if it simply frightens him off what if he just stops killing and we never find him hes not the type rebus said with authority hell go on killing because its taken him over havent you noticed how the murders are coming at shorter and shorter intervals he may even have killed again since lea bridge we just havent found the body yet hes possessed george flight looked at him as though seeking a joke but rebus was in deadly earnest i mean it flight stood up and walked to the window it might not even have been the wolfman maybe not rebus conceded what if she wont go public it doesnt matter we still issue the news story we still say weve got a good description flight turned from the window you believe her you dont think shes a crank its possible but i really dont think so shes very plausible she kept the details just vague enough to be convincing it was three months ago we can check on her if you like yes id like that very much the emotion had left flights voice this case was draining him of every reserve he had i want to know about her background her present her friends her medical records her family i could even get lisa frazer to give her some psychological tests rebus suggested not altogether without tongue in cheek flight smiled faintly no just the checks ive mentioned get lamb onto it itll keep him out of our hair you dont like him then whatever gives you that idea funny he says youre like a father to him the moment of tension was over rebus felt he had won another small victory they both laughed using their dislike of lamb to strengthen the link between them youre a good policeman john flight said rebus despite himself blushed sod off you old fart he replied that reminds me said flight i told you yesterday to go home have you any intention of doing so none at all said rebus there was a pause before flight nodded good he said thats good he walked to the door for now he turned back towards rebus just dont go rogue on me john this is my turf i need to know where you are and what youre up to he tapped at his own head i need to know whats going on up here okay rebus nodded fine george no problem but the fingers behind his back were crossed he liked to work alone and had the feeling flight wanted to stick close to him for reasons other than traditional cockney chumminess besides if the wolfman did turn out to be a policeman nobody could be discounted nobody at all rebus tried lisa again but without success at lunchtime he was wandering around the station when he bumped into joey bennett the constable who had stopped him on shaftesbury avenue that first night in london bennett was wary at first then he recognised rebus oh hello sir was that your picture i saw in the papers rebus nodded this isnt your patch is it he asked no not exactly sir just passing through you might say dropping off a prisoner that woman in the photo with you she looked a bit of all do you have your car with you bennett was wary again yes sir and youre going back into town now to the west end yes sir good then you wont mind giving me a lift will you er no sir of course not sir bennett broke into the least convincing smile rebus had seen outside a synchronised swimming event on their way out to the car they passed lamb teeth stopped chattering yet he asked but rebus was in no mood to respond lamb undaunted tried again going somewhere he managed even to make this simple question sound like a threat rebus stopped turned and walked up to him so that their faces were a couple of inches apart if thats all right with you lamb yes im going somewhere then he turned away again and followed bennett lamb watched them go half his teeth showing in a parody of a grin mind how you go he called shall i phone ahead and get the hotel to pack your bags rebuss reply was a twofingered salute a more determined stride and a whispered fytp bennett heard him sorry sir nothing said rebus nothing at all it took them half an hour to reach bloomsbury every second building seemed to sport a blue circular plaque commemorating some writers having lived there rebus recognised few of the names finally he found the building he was looking for and waved bennett goodbye it was the psychology department of university college in gower street the secretary who appeared to be the only living soul around at one oclock asked if she could help him i hope so he said im looking for lisa frazer lisa the secretary seemed unsure oh lisa dear me i dont think i can help i havent seen her in over a week you might try the library or dillons dillons its a bookshop just around the corner lisa seems to spend a lot of her time in there she loves bookshops or theres always the british library its just possible she might be there he left the building with a new puzzle the secretary had seemed very distant very fuzzy maybe it was just him he was starting to read things into every situation he found the bookshop and went inside shop was something of an understatement it was huge he read on a wall that psychology books were to be found three floors up so many books one man could not hope to read them all in a lifetime he tried to walk through the aisles without focusing if he focused he would become interested and if he became interested he would buy he already had over fifty books at home piled beside his bed waiting for that elusive weeklong break when he could concentrate on something other than police work he collected books it was just about his only hobby not that he was precious about it he did not lust after first editions signed copies and the like mostly he bought paperbacks and he was nothing if not catholic in his tastes any subject matter would do so he tried to pretend he was wearing blinkers pondered the essential difference between catholic and catholic and finally reached the psychology section it was a room joined onto other rooms as in a chain but there was no sign of lisa in any of the links he did however find where some of her own library of books had no doubt originated there was a shelf next to the cashiers desk dedicated to crime and violence one of the books she had loaned him was there he picked it up and turned it over to look at the price then blinked twice in astonishment so much money and it wasnt even a hardback still academic books always did carry steep price tickets strange really werent students the intended readership after all least able to afford these titles it might take a psychologist to explain that one or perhaps a shrewd economist next to the criminology section were books on the occult and witchcraft along with various packs of tarot cards and the like rebus smiled at this curious marriage police work and hocuspocus he picked up a book on rituals and flipped through it a young slender woman in billowing satin dress and with long fiery hair paused beside him to lift a tarot set which she took to the cash desk well it took all sorts didnt it she looked serious enough but then these were serious times ritual he wondered if there was an element of ritual to the wolfmans particular spree so far he had been seeking an explanation from the killers psyche what if the whole thing were some kind of rite slaughter and defilement of the innocent that sort of thing charlie manson and his swastikatattooed forehead some said there was a masonic element to jack the rippers methods madness and evil sometimes you found a cause and sometimes you just didnt slash the throat gouge the anus bite the stomach the two ends of the human trunk and something like the midpoint could there be a clue in that particular pattern there are clues everywhere the monster from his past rearing up out of the dark deep waters of memory that case had tied him up all right but not half as much as this he had thought the wolfman might be a woman now a woman had conveniently appeared to tell him the wolfman was a man very conveniently george flight was right to be wary perhaps rebus could learn something from him flight did everything by the book and in scrupulous detail he didnt go running down the bloody hall with a pair of toy false teeth clutched in his sweaty hand he was the type to sit down and think things through that was what made him a good copper better than rebus because he didnt snap at every red herring that came along better because he was methodical and methodical people never let anything escape them rebus left dillons bookshop with his own little thundercloud hanging above his head and a plastic carrierbag full of newly purchased books swinging from his right hand he walked down gower street and bloomsbury street took a fortuitous left at a set of traffic lights and found himself outside the british museum inside which he knew from memory was to be found the british library unless that was theyd already moved it as hed read they were planning to but the british library itself was offlimit to nonreaders rebus tried to explain that he was a reader but apparently what this meant was that he had to be in possession of a readers card with hindsight he supposed he could have flashed his id and said he was on the trail of a maniac but he didnt he shook his head shrugged his shoulders and went instead for a walk around the museum the place seemed full almost to bursting with tourists and school parties he wondered if the children their imaginations still open were as thunderstruck as he was by the ancient egyptian and assyrian rooms vast stone carvings huge wooden gates countless exhibits but the real throng was around the rosetta stone rebus had heard of it of course but didnt really know what it was now he found out the stone contained writing in three languages and thus helped scholars to work out for the first time what egyptian hieroglyphics actually meant he was willing to bet they hadnt solved it overnight or even over a weekend slow painstaking graft just like police work toil as difficult as anything a bricklayer or miner could endure and in the end it usually still came down to the lucky break how many times had they interviewed the yorkshire ripper and let him go that sort of thing happened more often than the public would ever be allowed to know he walked through more rooms rooms airy and light and containing greek vases and figurines then pushing open a glass doubledoor he found himself confronted by the sculptures of the parthenon for some reason they had stopped advertising them as the elgin marbles rebus walked around this large gallery feeling almost as though he were in some modernday place of worship at one end a gabble of schoolkids squatted before some statues trying to draw them while their teacher walked around trying to keep the grudging artists quiet it was rhona even at this distance he recognised her recognised her walk and the slant of her head and the way she held her hands behind her back whenever she was trying to make a point rebus turned away and found himself face to face with a horses head he could see the veins bulging from the marble neck the open mouth with its teeth worn away to an indeterminate smoothness no bite would rhona thank him for walking over and interrupting her class just to make smalltalk no she would not but what if she spotted him if he were to slink away it would look like the action of a coward hell he was a coward wasnt he best to face facts and move back towards the doors she might never spot him and if she did she was hardly likely to announce the fact but then he wanted to know about kenny didnt he who better to ask than rhona there was a simple answer better to ask anyone hed ask samantha yes thats what hed do hed ask samantha he crept back to the doors and walked briskly towards the exit suddenly all the exquisite vases and statues had become ridiculous what was the point in burying them behind glass for people to glance at in passing wasnt it better to look forward forget about ancient history wouldnt it be better if he just took lambs illmeant advice there were too many ghosts in london way too many even the reporter jim stevens was down here somewhere rebus fairly flew across the museum courtyard only pausing when he reached the gates the guards stared at him strangely glancing towards his carrierbag theyre just books he wanted to say but he knew you could hide anything in a book just about anything knew from painful personal experience when feeling depressed be rash he stuck a hand out into the road and at the first attempt managed to stop an empty black cab he couldnt remember the name of the street he wanted but that didnt matter covent garden he said to the driver as the cab did what rebus assumed was a fairly illegal uturn he dipped into his bag to claim the first prize he wandered around covent garden proper for twenty minutes enjoying an openair magic act and a nearby fireeater before moving off in search of lisas flat it wasnt too difficult to find he surprised himself by recalling a kite shop and another shop which seemed to sell nothing but teapots took a left and a right and another right and found himself in her street standing outside the shoe shop the shop itself was busy the clientele like the serving staff was very young probably not yet out of teens a jazz saxophone played a tape perhaps or someone busking in the distance he looked up at the window to lisas flat with its bright yellow roller blind how old was she really it was hard to tell and then only then he went to the door and pressed her buzzer there was noise from the intercom a crackle of movement hello its me john hello i cant hear you its john he said loudly into the door frame looking around him in embarrassment but noone was interested people glanced into the shop window as they passed eating strangelooking snacks vegetablelooking things john as though she had forgotten him already then oh john and the buzzer sounded beside him doors open come on up the door to her flat was open too and he closed it behind him lisa was tidying the studio as she called it in edinburgh it wouldnt have been called a studio it would have been called a bedsit he supposed covent garden didnt have such things as bedsits ive been trying to get in touch he said me too oh she turned to him noting the hint of disbelief in his voice didnt they tell you i mustve left half a dozen messages with what was his name shepherd lamb thats it rebuss hate for lamb intensified about an hour ago she went on i called and they said youd gone back to scotland i was a bit miffed at that thought youd gone without saying goodbye bastards thought rebus they really did hate his guts didnt they our expert from north of the border lisa had finished making a neat stack from the newspapers lying on the floor and the bed she had straightened the duvet and the cover on the sofa and now a little out of breath she was standing close to him he slid his arm around her and pulled her to him hello he murmured kissing her hello she said returning the kiss she broke away from his hug and walked into the alcove which served as a kitchen there was the sound of running tapwater a kettle filling i suppose youve seen the papers she called yes her head came out of the alcove a friend called me up to tell me i couldnt believe it my picture on the front page fame at last infamy more like a police psychologist indeed they might have done their research one paper even called me liz frazier she plugged the kettle in switched it on then came back into the room rebus was sitting on the arm of the sofa so she asked how goes the investigation a few interesting developments oh she sat on the edge of the bed tell me so he told her about jan crawford and about his false teeth theory lisa suggested that jan crawfords memory might be helped by hypnosis lost memory she called it but rebus knew this sort of thing was inadmissible as evidence besides hed experienced lost memory for himself and shivered now at the memory they drank lapsang souchong which he said reminded him of bacon butties and she put on some music something soft and classical and they ended up somehow sitting next to one another on the indian carpet their backs against the sofa shoulders arms and legs touching she stroked his hair the nape of his neck what happened the other night between us she said are you sorry you mean sorry it happened she nodded christ no said rebus just the opposite he paused what about you she thought over her answer it was nice she said her eyebrows almost meeting as she concentrated on each word i thought maybe you were avoiding me he said and i thought you were avoiding me i went looking for you this morning at the university she sat back the better to study his face really he nodded what did they say i spoke to some secretary he explained glasses on a string around her neck hair in a sort of a bun millicent but what did she tell you she just said you hadnt been around much what else that i might find you in the library or in dillons he nodded over towards the door where the carrierbag stood propped against a wall she said you liked bookshops so i went looking there too she was still studying his face then she laughed and pecked him on the cheek millicents a treasure though isnt she if you say so why did her laugh have so much relief in it stop looking for puzzles john just stop it right now she was crawling away from him towards the bag so what did you buy he couldnt honestly remember with the exception of the book hed started reading in the taxi hawksmoor instead he watched her behind and her legs as she moved away from him spectacular ankles slim with a prominent hemisphere of bone well she said lifting one of the paperbacks from the bag eysenck do you approve she thought this question over too not entirely probably not at all in fact genetic inheritance and all that im not sure she lifted out another book and shrieked skinner the beast of behaviourism but what made you he shrugged i just recognised some names from those books you loaned me so i thought id another book was lifted high for him to see king ludd have you read the first two she asked oh he said disappointed is it part of a trilogy i just liked the title she turned and gave him a quizzical look then laughed rebus could feel himself going red at the neck she was making a fool of him he turned away from her and concentrated on the pattern of the rug brushing the rough fibres with his hand oh dear she said starting to crawl back im sorry i didnt mean to im sorry and she placed a hand on either of his legs kneeling in front of him angling her head until his eyes were forced to meet hers she was smiling apologetically sorry she mouthed he managed a smile which said thats okay she leaned across him and placed her lips on his one of her hands sliding up his leg towards the thigh and then a little higher still it was evening before he escaped though escape was perhaps putting it too harshly the effort of easing himself from beneath lisas sleeping limbs was almost too much her body perfume the sweet smell of her hair the flawless warmth of her belly her arms her behind she did not waken as he slid from the bed and tugged on his clothes she did not waken as he wrote her another of his notes picked up his carrierbag of books opened the door cast a glance back towards the bed and then pulled the door shut after him he went to covent garden tube station where he was offered a choice the queue for the elevator or the three hundredodd spiralling stairs he opted for the stairs they seemed to go on forever turning and turning in their gyre his head became light as he thought of what it must have been like to descend this corkscrew during the war years white tiled walls like those of public lavatories rumble from above the dull echo of footsteps and voices he thought too of edinburghs scott monument with its own tightly winding stairwell much more constricted and unnerving than this and then he was at the bottom beating the elevator by a matter of seconds the tube train was as crowded as he had come to expect next to a sign proclaiming keep your personal stereo personal a white youth wearing a green parka with matching teeth shared his musical taste with the rest of the carriage his eyes had a distant utterly vacant look and from time to time he swigged from a can of strong lager rebus toyed with the notion of saying something but held back he was only travelling one stop if the glowering passengers were content to suffer silently that was how it should be he prised himself out of the train at holborn only to squeeze into another compartment this time on the central line again someone was playing a walkman at some dizzying level but they were somewhere over towards the far end of the carriage so all rebus had to suffer was the schhchschchschch of what he took to be drums he was becoming a seasoned traveller now setting his eyes so that they focused on space rather than on his fellow passengers letting his mind empty for the duration of the journey god alone knew how these people could do it every day of their working lives he had already rung the doorbell before it struck him that he did not have a pretext for coming here think quickly john the door was pulled open oh its you she sounded disappointed hello rhona to what do we owe the honour she was standing her ground just inside the front door keeping him on the doorstep she was wearing a hint of makeup and her clothes were not after work work relaxingathome clothes she was going out somewhere she was waiting for a gentleman nothing special he said just thought id pop round we didnt get much of a chance to talk the other night would he mention that he had seen her in the british museum no he would not besides she was shaking her head yes we did it was just that we had nothing to talk about her voice wasnt bitter she was simply stating a fact rebus looked at the doorstep ive caught you at a bad time he said sorry no need to apologise is sammy in shes out with kenny rebus nodded well he said enjoy wherever it is youre going my god he actually felt jealous he couldnt believe it of himself after all these years it was the makeup that did it rhona had seldom worn makeup he half turned to leave then stopped i couldnt use your loo could i she stared at him seeking some trick or plan but he smiled back with his best impersonation of a crippled dog and she relented go on then she said you know where it is he left his carrier at the door squeezed past her and began to climb the steep stairs thanks rhona he said she was lingering downstairs waiting to let him out again he walked across the landing to the bathroom opened and closed the door loudly then opened it again very quietly and crept back across the landing to where the telephone sat on a small and quite grotesque confection of brass green glass and red hanging tassels there were london phone books piled beneath this table but rebus went straight to the smaller telephone addresses book on the top of the table some of the entries were in rhonas writing who he wondered were tony tim ben and graeme but most were in sammys grander more confident script he flipped to the k section and found what he wanted kenny printed in capitals with a seven figure number scribbled below the name the whole enclosed by a loving ellipse rebus took pen and notepad from his pocket and copied down the number then closed the book and tiptoed back to the bathroom where he flushed the toilet gave his hands a quick rinse and boldly started downstairs again rhona was looking along the street no doubt anxious that her beau should not arrive and find him here bye he said picking up the carrier walking past her and setting off in the direction of the main road he was nearly at the end of her street when a white ford escort turned off the main drag and moved slowly past him driven by a cannylooking man with thin face and thick moustache rebus stopped at the corner to watch the man pull up outside rhonas building she had already locked the door and fairly skipped to the car rebus turned away before she could kiss or hug the man called tony tim ben or graeme in a large pub near the tube station a barn of a place with walls painted torrid red rebus remembered that he had not tried the local brews since coming south hed gone for a drink with george flight but had stuck to whisky he looked at the row of pumps while the barman watched him a proprietorial hand resting on one pump rebus nodded towards this resting hand is it any good the man snorted its bloody fullers mate of course its good a pint of that then please the stuff turned out to have a watery look like cold tea but it tasted smooth and malty the barman was still watching him so rebus nodded approval then took his glass to a distant corner where the public telephone stood he dialled hq and asked for flight hes left for the day he was told well then put me through to anyone from cid anyone whos helpful ive got a telephone number i want tracing there were rules and regulations about this sort of thing rules at one time ignored but of late enforced requests had to be made and were not always granted some forces could pull more weight than others when it came to number tracing he reckoned the met and the yard ought to carry more weight than most but just in case he added its to do with the wolfman case it might be a very good lead he was told to repeat the number he wanted tracing call back in half an hour said the voice he sat at a table and drank his beer it seemed silly but it appeared to be going to his head already with only half a pint missing from the glass someone had left a folded smudged copy of the midday standard rebus tried to concentrate on the sports pages and even had a stab at the concise crossword then he made the call and was put through to someone he didnt know who passed him on to someone else he didnt know a boisterous crowd looking like a team of bricklayers had entered the bar one of them made for the jukebox and suddenly steppenwolfs born to be wild was booming from the walls while the men urged the unwilling barman to wick it up a bit if youll just hold a minute inspector rebus i believe chief inspector laine wants a word but christ i dont want to late the voice at the other end had gone rebus held the receiver away from him and scowled eventually howard laine came on the line rebus pushed a finger into one ear pressing his other ear hard against the earpiece ah inspector rebus i wanted a quiet word youre a hard man to catch about that business last night laines was the voice of reasoned sanity youre about a bullockhairs breadth away from an official reprimand understand pull a stunt like that again and ill personally see to it that youre shipped back to jockland in the boot of a national express bus got that rebus was silent listening closely he could almost hear cath farraday sitting in laines office smirking i said have you got that yes sir good a rustling of paper now you want an address i believe yes sir its a lead you say yes sir rebus suddenly wondered if this would be worth it he hoped so if they found out he was abusing the system like this theyd have him in the dole office with prospects roughly equivalent to those of a shoeshine boy on a nudist beach but laine gave him the address and as a bonus supplied kennys surname watkiss said laine the address is pedro tower churchill estate e i think thats hackney thank you sir said rebus oh by the way said laine inspector rebus yes sir from what ive been told of churchill estate if youre intending to visit tell us first well arrange for an spg escort all right bit rough is it then sir rough doesnt begin to tell the story son we train the sas in there pretend its a mockup of beirut thanks for the advice sir rebus wanted to add that hed been in the sas and he doubted pedro tower could throw anything at him that the sas hq in hereford hadnt all the same it paid to be cautious the brickies were playing pool their accents a mix of irish and cockney born to be wild had finished rebus finished his pint and ordered another kenny watkiss so there was a connection and rather a large one at that between tommy watkiss and samanthas boyfriend how was it that in a city of ten million souls rebus had suddenly begun to feel an overwhelming sense of claustrophobia he felt like someone had wrapped a muffler around his mouth and pulled a balaclava down over his head id be careful mate said the barman as rebus took delivery of his second pint that stuff can kill you not if i kill it first said rebus winking as he raised the glass to his lips the taxi driver wouldnt take him as far as the churchill estate ill drop you off a couple of streets away and show you where to go but theres no way im going in there fair enough said rebus so he took the taxi as far as the taxi would take him then walked the remaining distance it didnt look so bad hed seen worse on the outskirts of edinburgh a lot of dull concrete nuggets of glass underfoot boarded windows and spraypainted gang names on every wall jeez posse seemed to be the main gang though there were other names so fantastically contrived that he could not make them out young boys skateboarded through an arena constructed from milkcrates wooden planks and bricks you couldnt muzzle the creative mind rebus stopped to watch for a moment it only took a moment to appreciate that these boys were masters of their craft rebus came to the entrance of one of the estates four highrises he was busy looking for an identifying mark when something went splat on the pavement beside him he looked down it was a sandwich a salami sandwich by the look of it he craned his neck to look up at the various levels of the tower block just in time to catch sight of something large and dark growing larger and darker as it hurtled towards him jesus christ he leapt into the safety of the blocks entrance hall just as the tv set landed flattening itself with an explosion of plastic metal and glass from their arena the boys cheered rebus moved outside again but more warily now and craned his neck there was no one to be seen he whistled under his breath he was impressed and a little scared despite the thunderous sound nobody seemed curious or interested he wondered which television show had so angered the person somewhere above him everyones a critic he said and then fytp he heard a lift opening a young woman greasy dyedblonde hair gold stud in her nose and three in each ear spiderweb tattoo across her throat she wheeled a pushchair out onto the concrete seconds earlier she would have been beneath the television excuse me said rebus above the noise of her wailing passenger yeah is this pedro tower over there she said pointing a sharpened fingernail towards one of the remaining blocks thank you she glanced towards where the television had landed its the kids she said they break into a flat and throw a sandwich out of the window a dog comes to eat it and they chuck a telly after it makes a helluva mess she sounded almost amused almost lucky i dont like salami rebus said but she was already manoeuvring the pushchair past the fresh debris if you dont shut up ill fucking kill you she yelled at her child rebus walked on unsteady legs towards pedro tower why was he here it had all seemed to make sense had seemed logical but now that he stood in the soursmelling groundfloor hallway of pedro tower he found that he had no reason at all to be here rhona had said that sammy was out with kenny the chances of them choosing to spend the evening in pedro tower must be slim mustnt they even supposing kenny were here how would rebus locate the flat the locals would sniff an enquiring copper from fifty paces questions would go unanswered knocked doors would stay unopened was this what intellectuals called an impasse he could always wait of course kenny would be sure to return at some point but wait where in here too conspicuous too unappealing outside too cold too open too many armchair critics high above him in the now dark sky which left him where precisely yes this probably was an impasse he walked from the block his eyes on the windows above him and was about to make off in the direction of the skateboarders when a scream split the air from the other side of pedro tower he walked quickly towards the source of the sound and was in time to see the buttend of a burning argument the woman no more than a girl really seventeen eighteen hit the bedenimed man with a good righthand sending him spinning then she stalked off as he holding one side of his face tried to hurl obscenities at her while at the same time feeling in his mouth for damaged teeth they did not interest rebus particularly he was looking past them to a lowbuilt dimly illuminated building a prefabricated construction surrounded by grass and dirt a weathered board lit by a single bulb proclaimed it the fighting cock a pub here that was no place for a policeman no place for a scots policeman but what if no it couldnt be so simple sammy and kenny couldnt be in there wouldnt be in there his daughter deserved better deserved the best but then she reckoned kenny watkiss was the best and maybe he was rebus stopped dead just what the hell was he doing okay so he didnt like kenny and when he had seen kenny cheering in the old bailey he had put two and two together and come to the conclusion that kenny was in deep with tommy watkiss but now it turned out the two were related in some way and that would explain the cheer wouldnt it the psychology books told him that coppers read the worst into every situation it was true he didnt like the fact that kenny watkiss was dating his daughter if kenny had been heir apparent to the throne rebus would still have been suspicious she was his daughter hed hardly seen her since she had entered her teens in his mind she was still a child a thing to be cosseted loved and protected but she was a big girl now with ambition drive good looks and a grownup body she was grownup there was no escaping it and it scared him scared him because she was sammy his sammy scared him because he hadnt been there all these years to warn her to tell her how to cope what to do scared because he was getting old there it was out he was growing old he had a sixteen year old daughter and she was old enough to leave school and get a job to have sex to get married not old enough to go into pubs but that wouldnt stop her not old enough for streetwise eighteenyearolds like kenny watkiss but grownup all the same grownupwithout him and now he too was old and by god he felt it he plunged his left hand deep into his pocket his right hand still wrapped around the handle of the carrierbag and turned from the pub there was a bus stop near where the taxi had dropped him hed go where the bus would take him the skateboarders were coming along the path in front of him one of them seemed veryproficient weaving without losing balance as the boy approached he suddenly flipped the board up so that it spun in the air in front of him both hands neatly grabbed the board by its running tail and swung the board itself in a backward arc too late rebus saw the manoeuvre for what it was he tried to duck but the heavy wooden board hit the side of his head with a sharp crack he staggered dropped to his knees they were on him immediately seven or eight of them hands gouging into his pockets fuckin split my board man lookatit fuckin six inch split a training shoe caught rebus on the chin and sent him flying he was concentrating on not losing consciousness so much so that he forgot to fight or to scream or to defend himself then a loud voice oi what the fuck dyou think youre up to and they ran rolling theirboardsuntil they had gained enough speed the hard wheels crackling on the tarmac as they fled like a posse in an old western rebus thought with a smile like a posse you all right mate come on lets get you up the man helped rebus to his feet when his eyes regained their powers of focus he saw blood on the mans lip smeared across his chin the man noticed him looking my bird he said his breath rich with alcohol she fuckin clocked me didnt she got me a good one too couple of loose teeth still they was rotten anyway probably saved me a fortune at the dentists he laughed come on lets get you into the cock a couple of brandiesll see you right took my money rebus said he was clutching the carrierbag to him like a shield never mind that said his samaritan they were kind to him they sat him down at a table and every now and again a drink would appear and someone would say that ones from bill or that ones from tessa or that ones from jackie or that ones from they were kind to him they collected a fiver so he could get a taxi back to his hotel he explained that he was a tourist down here for a bit of sightseeing hed managed to get lost had jumped off a bus and ended up here and they kind souls believed him they didnt bother phoning the police those bastards they spat waste of time wouldnt turn up till tomorrow morning and then theyd do nothing its the cops round here that are behind half the crimes believe me and he did he did believe them and another drink arrived another brandy in a small schooner all the best eh and they were playing cards and dominoes a lively crowd a regular crowd the tv blared a musical quiz show and the jukebox sang and the onearmed bandit bleeped and buzzed and spat out an occasional win he thanked god sammy and kenny werent here how would it have looked to them he dreaded to think at one point he excused himself and went to the toilet there was a jagged triangle of mirror nailed to one wall the side of his head jaw and ear were red and would probably bruise the jaw would ache for some time where the shoe had connected there was already a red and purple welt nothing more nothing worse no knives or razor blades no massed assault it had been a clean professional hit the way that kid had flipped the board caught it and swung it professional an absolute pro if rebus ever caught him he would congratulate him on one of the sweetest moves he had ever seen then hed kick the little bastards teeth so far down his throat theyd bite his small intestine he reached down the front of his trousers and drew out his wallet the warning from laine and the knowledge that he was on uncharted ground had been enough to persuade rebus that he should hide his wallet not to save him from muggers no so that no one would find his id it was bad enough being a stranger in this place but being a copper so he had hidden the wallet id and all down the front of his underpants tucked into the elasticated waistband he slipped it back there now after all he was not yet clear of churchill estate the night might turn out to be a long one he pulled open the door and headed back to his table the brandy was working his head was numb his limbs pleasantly flexible you all right there jock he hates that name absolutely loathes it but he smiles nevertheless im all right oh yes im quite all right great by the way this ones from harry at the bar after she has posted the letter she feels a lot better she does some work but soon begins to twitch inside its like feeding a habit now but its also an art form art fuck art so unbecoming in a man so art unbecoming fuck in a man so fuck a man in unbecoming art they used to quarrel squabble argue all the time no thats not true she remembers it that way but it wasnt that way for a while it was but then they just stopped communicating altogether her mother her father mother strong domineering determined to be a great painters a great watercolourist every day busy at an easel ignoring her child who needed her who would creep into the studio and sit quietly in a corner crouched tryingnot to be noticed if noticed she would be sent out of the room fiercely red hot tears streaming down her face i never wanted you her mother would screech you were an accident why cant you be a proper little girl run run run out of the studio and down the stairs through the morning room and out of the doors father quiet innocuous cultured civilised father reading the newspapers in the back garden one trousered leg crossed over the other as he reclined in his deckchair and hows my little sweet this morning mummy shouted at me did she im sure she didnt mean anything shes a bit crochety when shes painting isnt she come and sit here on my lap you can help me read the news nobody visited nobody came no family no friends at first she went to school but then they kept her at home educating her themselves it was all the rage with a certain section of a certain class her father had been left money by a great aunt enough money for a comfortable life enough to keep the wolf from the door he pretended to be a scholar but then his painstakingly researched essays started to be rejected and he saw himself for what he was the arguments grew worse grew physical just leave me alone will you my arts what matters to me not you art fuck art how dare you a dull solid thump a blow of some kind from anywhere in the house she could hear them anywhere but the attic but she darent go to the attic that was where well she just couldnt im a boy she whispered to herself hiding beneath her bed im a boy im a boy im a boy sweetness where are you his voice all sugar and summery like a slideprojector show like an afternoon car ride they said the wolfman was homosexual it wasnt true they said theyd caught him she almost whooped when she read it wrote them a letter and posted it see what theyd make of that let them find her she didnt care he and she didnt care but he cared that she was taking over his mind as well as his body sweetness oranges and lemons say the bells of so unbecoming in a man long nosehairs her mother had been talking about daddys nosehairs long nosehairs johnny are so unbecoming in a man why did she remember that utterance above all others long nose hairs so unbecoming in a man johnny daddys name johnny her father who had sworn at her mother fuck art fuck was the dirtiest word there was at school it had been whispered a magic word a word to conjure up demons and secrets and shes on the streets now although she knows that really she should do something about the butchers gallery it needs cleaning badly there are torn canvases everywhere torn and spattered it doesnt matter nobody visits no family no friends so she finds another one this ones stupid as long as youre not the wolfman she says with a laugh the wolfman laughs too he she it doesnt matter now he and she are one and the same the wound has healed he feels whole feels complete it is not a good feeling it is a bad feeling but it can be forgotten for a moment back in his house some gaff youve got here she says he smiles takes her coat and hangs it up bit of a smell though you havent got a gas leak have you no not a gas leak but a leak yes he slips his hand into his pocket checks that the teeth are there of course they are theyre always there when he needs them to bite with the way he was bitten only a game sweet only a game bitten in fun on the stomach bitten not hard more like blowing a raspberry but that didnt stop it hurting he touches his gut it still hurts even now where do you want me love in here will do he says taking out the key and beginning to unlock the door the mirror was a bad idea the last one had seen what was happening behind her had almost screamed the mirror has been taken down the door is unlocked keep it locked do you what you got in there the crown jewels and the wolfman showing teeth smiles know this womin he woke up in his hotel room which was something in itself bearing in mind that he had no idea how hed got there he was lying on his bed fully clothed his hands pressed between his legs beside him lay the carrierbag full of books it was seven oclock and by the quality of the light streaming in through the uncurtained window it was morning rather than evening so far so good the bad news was that his head seared with two kinds of pain bad when he opened his eyes unbearable when he closed them with eyes closed the world spun at an awkward tilt with eyes opened it merely floated on a different plane he groaned attempted to unglue his furred tongue from the roof of his mouth staggered to the sink and ran the cold tap for some moments then splashed his face and cupped his hand lapping water from it the way a mongrel might the water was sweet chlorinated he tried not to think of kidneys seven sets of kidneys knelt by the toiletpan and retched the big white telephone receiver to god what was the score seven brandies six dark rums hed lost count after that he squeezed an inchlong strip of toothpaste onto his brush and scrubbed at his teeth and gums then only then did he have the courage to examine himself in the wallmirror there were two kinds of pain one from the hangover the other from the mugging hed lost twenty quid maybe thirty but the loss to his pride was above price he held in his head a good description of a couple of the gang and especially the leader this morning he would give what he knew to the local station his message would be clear seek out and destroy who was he kidding theyd rather protect their own villains than help an intruder from north of the border our man from north of the border jockland jock but to let the gang get away with it was worse what the hell he rubbed his jaw it felt worse than it looked there was a pale mustard bruise down one cheek and a graze on his chin good thing training shoes were all the rage in the early s it would have been a steelcapped airwear boot and he would not have been so chipper he was running out of clean clothes today he would have either to buy some new bits and pieces or else find himself a laundrette he had come to london intending to stay no more than two or three days hed thought that after that the met would come to see that he could add nothing to the case but instead here he was coming up with possible leads making himself useful getting beaten up turning into an overprotective father having a holiday romance with a psychology lecturer he thought about lisa about the way the secretary at university college had acted something jarred about the whole incident lisa who slept so soundly the sleep of a clear conscience what was that smell that smell creeping into his room the smell of cooking fat mingled with toast and coffee the smell of breakfast somewhere downstairs they were busy perspiring over the griddles breaking eggs to sizzle beside thick sausages and greypink bacon the thought sent rebuss stomach on a tiny rollercoaster ride he was hungry but the thought of fried food repelled him he felt his justcleaned mouth turning sour when had he last eaten a sandwich on the way to lisas two packets of crisps in the fighting cock christ yes he was hungry he dressed quickly making a mental note of what needed buying shirt pants socks and headed down to the diningroom clutching three paracetamol tablets in his hand a fistful of dullers they werent quite ready to start serving but when he announced that he needed only cereal and fruit juice the waitress a different face each day relented and showed him to a table set for one he ate two small packets of cereal a cereal killer smiled grimly and went to the trestle table to help himself to more juice lots more juice it had a funny artificial smell to it and a taste best described as wersh but it was cold and wet and the vitamin c would help his head the waitress brought him two daily papers neither contained anything of interest flight had not yet used rebuss idea of the detailed description maybe flight had passed it on to cath farraday would she sit on it out of spite after all she hadnt been too happy about his last little stunt had she maybe she was holding back on this one just to show him that she could well sod them he didnt see anyone coming up with better ideas with any ideas at all come to that nobody wanted to make a mistake theyd all rather sit on their hands than be seen to get it wrong jesus christ when the first customer proper of the morning ordered bacon eggs and tomatoes rebus finished his orange juice and left the restaurant in the murder room he sat at one of the typewriters and prepared detailed descriptions of the gang members his typing had never been proficient at the best of times but todays hangover was compounded by an electronic typewriter of infernal complexity he couldnt get the thing to set a reasonable line length the tabs appeared not to work and every time he pressed a wrong key the thing bleeped at him bleep yourself he said trying again to set it for single space typing eventually he had a typed description it looked like the work of a tenyearold but it would have to do he took the sheets of paper through to his office there was a note from flight on his desk john i wish you wouldnt keep disappearing ive run a check on missing persons five women have been reported missing north of the river in the past fortyeight hours two of these could be explicable but the other three look more serious maybe youre right the wolfmans getting hungrier no feedback from the press stories yet though see you when youve finished shagging the prof it was signed simply gf how did flight know where hed been yesterday afternoon an inspired guess or something more cunning and devious it didnt really matter what mattered were the missing women if rebuss hunch were true then the wolfman was losing some of his previous control and that meant that sometime soon he was bound to make a mistake they need only goad him a little more the jan crawford story might just do that particular trick rebus had to sell the idea to flight and to farraday they had to be made to see that it was the right move at the right time three missing women that would bring the count to seven seven murders there was no telling where it would stop he rubbed at his head again the hangover was returning with a steeltipped vengeance john she was standing in the doorway trembling her eyes wide lisa he rose slowly to his feet lisa what is it whats wrong she stumbled towards him there were tears in her eyes and her hair was slick with sweat thank god she said clinging to him i thought id never i didnt know what to do where to go your hotel said youd already left the sergeant on the desk downstairs let me come up he recognised me from the photo in the papers my photo and then the tears came hot scalding and loud rebus patted her on the back trying to calm her wanting to know just what the hell had happened lisa he said quietly just tell me about it he manoeuvred her onto a chair with his hand rubbing soothingly at her neck every bit of her seemed damp with perspiration she pulled her bag onto her lap opened it and drew from one of the three compartments a small envelope which she handed silently to rebus what is it he asked i got it this morning she said addressed to me by name and sent to my home rebus examined the typed name and address the first class stamp and the postmark london ec the frank stated that the letter had been posted the previous morning he knows where i live john when i opened it this morning i nearly died on the spot i had to get out of the flat but all the time i knew that maybe he was watching me her eyes filled with water again but she threw back her head so that the tears would not escape she fished in her bag and came out with some paper tissues peeling off one so that she could blow her nose rebus said nothing its a death threat she explained a death threat she nodded who from does it say oh yes it says all right its from the wolfman john he says im going to be next it was a rush job but the lab when they heard the circumstances were happy to cooperate rebus stood with hands in pockets watching them at work there was the crackle of paper in his pocket he had folded the description of the gang members and tucked it away perhaps for future use for now there were more important matters to attend to the story was straightforward enough lisa had been scared out of her wits by the letter and more so by the fact that the wolfman knew where she lived she had tried contacting rebus and when that failed had panicked fleeing from her flat aware that he might be watching her might be about to pounce at any moment the pity was as the lab had already explained shed messed upthe letter gripping it in her hand as she fled destroying any fingerprints or other evidence that there might have been on the envelope itself still theyd do their best if the letter was from the wolfman and not from some new and twisted crank then there might well be clues to be had from the envelope and its contents saliva used to stick down both flap and stamp fibres fingerprints these were the physical possibilities then there were more arcane elements the typewriter itself might be traceable were there oddities of speech or misspellings which might yield a clue and what about that postmark the wolfman had outwitted them in the past so was the postal address another red herring the various processes involved would take time the lab was efficient but the chemical analyses could not be hurried lisa had come to the lab too as had george flight they were off in another part of the building drinking tea and going over the details for the fourth or fifth time but rebus liked to watch the lab boys at work this was his idea of sleuthing it also helped calm him to watch someone working in such painstaking detail and he certainly needed calming his plan had worked he had prodded and teased the wolfman into action he should though have realised the danger lisa might be in after all her photo had been in the papers as had her name they had even mistakenly termed her a police psychologist the very people who according to the earlier planted story had come to the conclusion that the wolfman might be gay or transsexual or any of the other barbs they had used lisa frazer had become the wolfmans enemy and he john rebus had led her into it by the nose stupid john oh so very stupid what if the wolfman had actually tracked her to her flat and no no no he couldnt bear to think of it but though lisas name had appeared in the newspapers her address had not so how had the wolfman found out her address that was much more problematic and much more chilling she was exdirectory for a start but as he knew only too well this was no barrier to someone in authority someone like a police officer jesus was he really talking about another police officer there had to be other candidates staff and students at university college other psychologists they would know lisa then there were those groups who could have linked an address to a name civil servants the local council taxmen gas and electricity boards the postman the guy next door numerous computers and mailshot programmes her local public library where could he start here you are inspector one of the assistants handed him a photocopy of the typed letter thanks said rebus were testing the original at the moment scanning for traces of anything interesting well let you know right what about the envelope the saliva tests will take a little longer we should have something for you in the next couple of hours there was also the photograph of course but it wont photocopy too well we know which paper it was from and that it was cut out with a pair off fairly sharp scissors perhaps as small as manicure scissors judging from the length of each cut rebus nodded staring at the photostat thanks again he said no problem no problem that wasnt right there were plenty of problems he read through the letter the typing seemed nice and even as though the typewriter used was a new one or a good quality model something like the electronic machine hed been using this morning as for the content well that was something else again get this im not homosexul ok wolfman is what wolfman does what wolfman does next is this he kills you dont worry it wont hurt wolfman does not hurt just does what wolfman is know this womin wolfman knows you where you live what you look like just tell the truth and no harm can cum to you on a piece of plain asized paper folded in four to get it into the small white envelope the wolfman had cut a picture of lisa from one of the newspapers then he had cut her head off and drawn a dark pencilled circle on her stomach and this photograph of her trunk had accompanied the letter bastard rebus hissed jesus you bastard he took the letter along the corridor and up the stairs to the room where flight was sitting rubbing at his face again wheres lisa ladies room does she seem shes upset but shes coping the doctors given her some tranqs what have you got there rebus handed over the copy flight read through it quickly intently what the hell do you make of it he asked rebus sat himself down on a hard chair still warm from lisas presence he reached out a hand and took the paper from flight then angled his chair so that both men could inspect the letter together well he said im not sure at first sight it looks like the work of a nearilliterate agreed but then again theres something artful about it look at the punctuation george absolutely correct right down to every comma and he uses colons and semicolons what sort of person could spell woman as womin yet know how to use a semicolon flight studied the note intently nodding go on well rhona my exwife shes a teacher i remember she used to tell me how frustrating it was that nowadays no one in schools bothered to teach basic grammar and punctuation she said that kids were growing up now with no need for things like colons and semicolons and no idea at all of how to use them so id say were dealing either with someone who has been well educated or with someone in middle age educated at a time when punctuation was still taught in every school flight gave a halfsmile been reading your psychology books again i see john its not all black magic george mostly its just to do with common sense and how you interpret things do you want me to go on im all ears well rebus was running a finger down the letter again theres something else here something that tells me this letter is genuinely from the killer and not the work of some nutter somewhere oh go on george wheres the clue he held the paper out towards flight flight grinned for a moment then took it i suppose he said youre talking about the way the writer refers to the wolfman in the third person youve just named the tune in one george thats exactly what i mean flight looked up incidentally john what the hell happened to you did you get in a fight or something i thought the scots gave up wearing woad a couple of years back rebus touched his bruised jaw ill tell you the story sometime but look in the first sentence the writer refers to himself in the first person hes taken our homosexual jibe personally but in the rest of the letter he speaks of the wolfman in the third person standard practice with serial murderers what about the misspelling of homosexual could be genuine or it could be to throw us off the scent u and a are at different ends of the keyboard a twofingered typist could miss the a if he was writing fast if he was angry rebus paused remembering the list in his pocket i speak from recent experience fair enough now look at what he actually says wolfman is what wolfman does what the books say is that killers find their identity through killing thats exactly what this sentence means flight exhaled noisily yes but none of this gets us any closer does it he offered a cigarette to rebus i mean we can build up as clear a picture as we like of the bastards personality but it wont give us a name and address rebus sat forward in his chair but all the time were narrowing down the possible types george and eventually well narrow it down to a field of one look at this final sentence just tell the truth and no harm can cum to you flight recited skipping the pun which is intriguing in itself dont you think theres something very i dont know official sounding about that construction something very formal i dont see what youre getting at what im getting at is that it seems to me the sort of thing someone like you or me would say a copper flight sat back in his chair oh come on john what kind of crap is that rebuss voice grew quiet and persuasive someone who knows where lisa frazer lives george think about it someone who knows that kind of information or knows how to get it we cant afford to rule out flight stood up im sorry john but no i simply cant entertain the notion that that someone some copper could be behind all this no its just not on rebus shrugged okay george whatever you say but rebus knew that he had planted a seed now in george flights head and that the seed would surely sprout flight sat down again confident that this time he had won a point from rebus anything else rebus read the letter through yet again sucking on his cigarette he remembered how at school in his english class he had loved writing summaries and close interpretations of texts yes he said eventually actually there is this letter seems to me more of a warning a shot across the bows he starts off by saying that hes going to kill her but by the end of the letter hes tempered that line he says nothing will happen if she tells the truth i think hes looking for a retraction i think he wants us to put out another story saying hes not gay flight checked his watch hes in for another fright how do you mean the lunchtime edition will be hitting the streets i believe cath farradays put out the jan crawford story really rebus revised his idea of farraday maybe she wasnt a vindictive old bat after all so now were saying weve got a living witness and he must realise its a fact i think it might just be enough to blow what final fuses hes got up here rebus tapped his head to send him barking mad as lamb would put it you reckon i reckon george we need everybody at their most alert he could try anything i dread to think rebus was staring at the letter something else george ec wheres that exactly flight thought it over the city part of it anyway farringdon street blackfriars bridge all around there ludgate st pauls hmm hes tricked us before making us see patterns where none exist the teeth for example im sure im right about them but now that weve got him rattled you think he lives in the city lives there works there maybe just drives through there on his way to work rebus shook his head he didnt yet want to share with flight the image which had just passed through his mind the image of a motorcycle courier based in the city a motorcyclist with easy access to every part of london like the man in leathers hed seen on the bridge that first night down by the canal a man like kenny watkiss well he said instead whatever its another piece of the jigsaw if you ask me said flight there are too many pieces they wont all fit agreed rebus stubbed out the cigarette flight had already finished his own and was about to light another but as the picture emerges well know better which bits we can discard wont we he was still studying the letter there was something else what was it something at the back of his mind lurking somewhere in memory something stirred momentarily by the letter but what if he stopped thinking about it maybe it would come to him the way the names of forgotten actors in films did the door opened lisa how are you both men rose to offer her a seat but she lifted a hand to show she preferred to stand all three of them stood a stiff triangle in the tiny box of a room just been sick again she said them she smiled cant be much more to bring up i think im back to yesterdays breakfast already they smiled with her she looked tired to rebus exhausted lucky she had slept so soundly yesterday he doubted shed get much sleep for the next night or ten tranqs or not flight spoke first ive arranged for temporary accommodation dr frazer the less people who know where the better dont worry youll be quite safe well have a guard on you what about her flat asked rebus flight nodded ive got two men there keeping an eye on the place one inside the flat itself the other outside both of them hidden if the wolfman turns up theyll cope with him believe me stop talking as though im not here lisa snapped this affects me too there was a cold silence in the room sorry she said she covered her eyes with her ringless left hand i just cant believe i was so scared back there i feel she tipped her head back again the tears were too precious to be released flight placed a hand softly on her shoulder its all right dr frazer really it is she gave a wry smile at this flight kept on talking feeding her with comforting words but she wasnt listening she was staring at rebus and he was staring back at her rebus knew what her eyes were telling him they were telling him something of the utmost importance catch the wolfman catch him quickly and destroy him utterly do it for me john but just do it she blinked breaking the contact rebus nodded slowly almost imperceptibly but it was enough she smiled at him and suddenly her eyes were dry sparkling stones flight felt the change and lifted his hand away from her arm he looked to rebus for some explanation but rebus was studying the letter concentrating on its opening sentence what was it there was something there something just beyond his line of vision something he didnt get yet two detectives one of them extraordinarily burly like the propforward from a rugby team the other tall and thin and silent came to the labs to take lisa away with them away to a place of safety despite vigorous protests rebus wasnt allowed to know the destination flight was taking all of this very seriously indeed but before lisa could go the lab people needed her fingerprints and to take samples of fibres from her clothes all for the purpose of elimination the two bodyguards went with her rebus and flight exhausted stood together at the drinks machine in the long brightlylit hallway feeding in coins for cups of powdery coffee and powdery tea are you married george flight seemed surprised by the question surprised perhaps that it should come only now yes he said have been the past twelve years marion shes the second the first was a disaster my fault not hers rebus nodded taking hold of the hot plastic beaker by its rim you said youd been married too flight remarked rebus nodded again thats right so what happened im not really sure any more rhona used to say it was like the continental drift so slow we didnt notice until it was too late her on one island me on another and a great big bloody sea between us flight smiled well you did say she was a teacher yes she still is actually lives in mile end with my daughter mile end bloody hell gentrified gangland no place for any coppers daughter rebus smiled at the irony it was time to confess actually george ive found out shes going out with someone called kenny watkiss oh dear who is your missus or your daughter my daughter her names samantha and shes going out with kenny watkiss how old is he older than her eighteen nineteen something like that hes a bike messenger in the city flight nodded understanding now he was the one who shouted from the public gallery flight thought for a moment well from what i know of the watkiss family history id say kenny must be tommys nephew tommys got a brother lenny hes doing time just now lennys a big softie not like tommy hes in for fraud tax evasion clocking cars naughty kites i mean bad cheques its all fourth division stuff but it mounts up and when theres enough of it against you at any one sitting of the bench well its odds on youll go inside isnt it its no different in scotland no i dont suppose it is so do you want me to find out what i can about this bike messenger i already know where he stays churchill estate its a housing estate in flight was chuckling you dont have to tell any copper in greater london where churchill estate is john they use that place to train the sas yes said rebus so laine said laine whats he got to do with it in for a penny thought rebus i had kennys telephone number i needed an address and laine got it for you what did you tell him it was for the wolfman case flight flinched his face creasing you keep forgetting john youre our guest down here you dont go pulling stunts like that when laine finds out if he finds out but flight was shaking his head when he finds out theres no if about it believe me when he finds out he wont bother with you he wont even bother with whos directly above you hell go to your chief super back in edinburgh and give him the most incredible verbals ive seen him do it do as good job john remember youre representing our force down there rebus blew on the coffee the notion of anyone giving verbals to farmer watson was almost amusing i always did fancy getting back into uniform he said flight stared at him the fun was over there are some rules john we can get away with breaking a few but some are sacrosanct carved into stone by god almighty and one of them states that you dont muck around with someone like laine just to satisfy your own personal curiosity flight was angry and trying to make a point but he was also whispering not wanting anyone to hear rebus not really caring any more was halfsmiling as he whispered back so what do i do tell him the truth oh hello there chief inspector my daughters winching with someone i dont like can i have the young mans address please so i can go and belt him is that how i do it flight paused then frowned winching now he too was smiling though trying hard not to show it rebus laughed aloud it means dating he said next youll be telling me you dont know what hoolit means try me said flight laughing too drunk explained rebus they sipped their drinks in silence for a moment rebus thanked god for the linguistic barrier between them for without it there would be no easy jokes jokes which broke the tension there were two ways to defuse tension one was to laugh it away the other was to resort to physical action it was laugh or lash out once or twice now they had come near to trading punches but had ended up trading grins instead praise be for the gift of laughter anyway i went to hackney last night looking for kenny watkiss and you got those for your pains flight was nodding towards the bruises rebus shrugged serves you right someone once told me hackneys french for a nag doesnt sound french does it but i suppose it would explain the hackney carriage hackney nag that horse in the british museum no bite rebus had to talk to morrison about the bite marks flight finished his drink first draining the cup and tossing it into a bin beside the machine he checked his watch i better find a phone he said see whats happening back at base maybe lamb will have found something on that crawford woman that crawford woman is a victim george stop making her sound like a criminal maybe shes a victim said flight lets get our facts straight before we go for the tea and sympathy routine besides when did you join this little victimsupport group of yours you know the way we have to play this sort of thing it isnt nice necessarily but it means we dont get it wrong thats quite a speech flight sighed and examined the tips of his shoes look john has it ever occurred to you that there might be another way the way of zen perhaps i mean a way other than your own or are the rest of us just thick and yourethe only policeman on the planet who knows how to solve a crime id be interested to know rebus desperately did not want to blush which is probably precisely why he did blush he tried to think of a smart answer but none came to mind right that second so he kept silent flight nodded approval lets find that phone he said now rebus found the courage he needed george he said i need to know who brought me here flight stared at him wondering whether or not to answer he pursed his lips as he thought about it and came up with an answer what the hell i did he said it was my idea you rebus seemed puzzled flight nodded confirmation yes me i suggested you to laine and pearson a new head fresh blood that sort of thing but how in gods name did you know about me well flight was beginning to look sheepish he made a play of examining the tips of his shoes again remember i showed you that file the one with all the guesswork in it on top of that i did some background reading on multiple murderers research you could call it and i came across that case of yours in some newspaper clippings from scotland yard i was impressed rebus pointed a disbelieving finger you were reading up on serial killers flight nodded on the psychology of serial killers flight shrugged and other aspects yes rebuss eyes had widened and all this time youve been having a dig at me for going along with lisa frazers no i dont believe it flight was laughing again the apparently arch antipsychologist revealed in his truelight i had to examine every angle he said watching as rebus having finished hiscoffee tossed the cup into a wastebin now comeon we really should make that phone call rebus was still shaking his head as he followed flight down the hall but though he appeared to be in good humour his brain was more active than ever flight had pulled the wool over his eyes with consummate ease how far did the pretence actually stretch was he now seeingthe real flight or yet another mask flight whistled as he walked and kicked at an imaginary football no not george flight rebus decided in an instant never george flight there was a telephone in the admin offices there was also seated at a desk having a conversation with one of the senior staff philip cousins immaculate in grey suit and burgundy tie philip hello theregeorge how are things cousins spotted rebus and inspector rebus too still lending a caledonian hand trying said rebus yes very rejoined flight so what brings you here philip wheres isobel pennys rather tied up im afraid shell be sorry to have missed you george as for my presence here i just wanted to doublecheck some facts on a murder case from last december you might remember it the man in the bathtub the one that looked like suicide thats right philip cousinss voice was as rich and slow as double cream rebus reckoned that the word urbane had been invented with him in mind im in court later today cousins was saying trying to help malcolm chambers pin the deceaseds wife for manslaughter at the very least chambers flight shook his head i dont envy you that but surely rebus interrupted youll be on the same side ah yes inspector rebus said cousins you are quite correct but chambers is such a scrupulous man hell want my evidence to be watertight and if it isnt then hes as likely to undo me as is the defence counsel more likely in fact malcolm chambers is interested in the truth not in verdicts yes said flight i remember him having a right go at me once in the witness box all because i couldnt recall offhand what kind of clock had been in the livingroom the case nearly crumbled there and then flight and cousins shared a comradely smile ive just been hearing said cousins that theres fresh evidence on the wolfman case do tell its beginning to come together philip said flight its definitely beginning to come together due in no small part to my associate here flight laid a momentary hand on rebuss shoulder im impressed said cousins sounding neither impressed nor unimpressed it was luck said rebus as he felt he ought not that he believed what he was saying cousinss eyes on him were like packs of ice so that the room temperature seemed to drop with every glance so what do we have well said flight weve got someone who claims she was attacked by the wolfman but escaped from him fortunate creature said cousins and continued flight one of the people helping us on the case this morning received a letter claiming to be from the wolfman good god we think its kosher flight concluded well said cousins this is something wait till i tell penny shell be thrilled philip we dont want it getting out not a word george not a word you know its all oneway traffic with me but penny should be told oh tell isobel by all means said flight only warn her its not to go any further total secrecy said cousins i quite understand mums the word who was it by the way flight appeared not to understand to whom was this threatening letter addressed flight was about to speak but rebus beat him to it just someone on the case as inspector flight says he smiled trying to alleviate the brusqueness of his response oh yes his mind was working now working in a fever nobody had told cousins the letter was threatening so how did he know it was okay it was simple enough to work out that it wouldnt exactly have been fan mail but all the same well then said cousins choosing not to press for details and now gentlemen he scooped up two manila files from the desk and tucked them under his arm then stood the joints of his knees cracking with the effort if youll excuse me court eight awaits inspector rebus cousins held out his free hand it sounds as though the case may be drawing towards its conclusion should we fail to meet again give my regards to your delightful city he turned to flight see you soon george bring marion round for supper some evening give penny a tinkle and well try to find one night in the calendar when all four of us are free goodbye bye philip goodbye goodbye oh cousins had stopped in the doorway there is just one thing he turned pleading eyes on flightyou dont have a spare driver do you george its going to be hell getting a taxi at this time of day well flight thought hard then had an idea if you can hang on for a couple of minutes philip ive got a couple of men here in the building he turned to rebus whose eyes had widened lisa wont mind will she john i mean if her car drops philip off at the old bailey rebus could do little but shrug excellent said cousins clasping his hands together thank you so much ill take you to them flight said but first i need to make a phone call cousins nodded towards the corridor and i must visit the wc be backin a tick they watched him leave flight was grinning shaking his head in wonderment do you know he said hes been like that ever since i met him i mean the sort of ambassadorial air the aged aristocrat ever since ive known him hes a gentleman all right said rebus but thats just the thing said flight his background is every bit as ordinary as yours or mine he turned to the lab man all right if i use your phone he did not wait for an answer but started dialling straight away hello he said into the receiver when he was finally connected whos that oh hello deakin is lamb there yes put him on will you thanks while he was waiting flight picked invisible threads from his trousers the trousers were shiny from too many wearings everything about flight rebus noticed seemed worn his shirt collar had an edge of grime to it and the collar itself was too tight constricting the loose flesh of the neck pinching it into vertical folds rebus found himself transfixed by that neck by the tufts of grey sprouting hair where the razor had failed in its duty signs of mortality as final as a hand around a throat when flight got off the phone rebus would protest about sending cousins off with lisa ambassadorial aristocrat one of the earlier mass killers had been an aristocrat too hello lamb what have you found on miss crawford flight listened his eyes on rebus ready to communicate anything of interest uhhuh okay mm i see yes right all the time his eyes told rebus that everything was checking out that jan crawford was reliable that she was telling the truth then flights eyes widened a little whats that again and he listened more intently moving his eyes from rebus to study the telephone apparatus itself now that is interesting rebus shifted what what was interesting but flight had again resorted to monosyllables uhhu mmm well never mind i know yes im sure his voice sounded resigned to something okay thanks for letting me know yes no well be back in about i dont know maybe another hour right catch you then flight held the receiver above the telephone but did not immediately drop it back into its cradle instead he let it hang there rebus could contain his curiosity no longer what he said what is it whats wrong flight seemed to come out of his daydream and put down the receiver oh he said its tommy watkiss what about him lamb has just heard that there isnt going to be a retrial we dont know why yet maybe the judge didnt think the charges were worth all the aggro and told the cps so assault on a woman not worth the aggro all thought of philip cousins vanished from rebuss mind flight shrugged retrials are expensive any trial is expensive we cocked it up first time round so we lose a second chance it happens john you know that of course it happens but the idea of a wake like watkiss getting away with something like that dont worry he cant keep his nose clean for long breaking the laws in his blood when he does something naughty well have him and ill see to it there are no ballsups mark my words rebus sighed yes it happened you lost a few more than a few incompetence or a soft judge an unsympathetic jury or a rocksolid witness for the defence and sometimes maybe the procurator fiscal thought a retrial not worth the money you lost a few they were like toothache i bet chambers is fuming rebus said oh yes said flight smiling at the thought i bet hes got steam coming out of his bloody shirtcuffs but one person would be happy at least rebus was thinking kenny watkiss hed be over the moon so said rebus what about jan crawford flight shrugged again she seems straight as a die no previous no record of mental illness livesquietly but the neighbours seem to like her well enough like lamb said shes so clean its frightening yes the squeaky clean ones often were frightening to a policeman the way an unknown species might be to a jungle explorer fear of the new the different you got to suspect that everyone had something to hide the schoolteachers smuggled in porn videos from their holiday in amsterdam the solicitors took cocaine on their weekend parties the happily married mp was sleeping with his secretary the magistrate had a predilection for underage boys the librarian kept a real skeleton hidden in the closet the angelic looking children had set fire to a neighbours cat and sometimes your suspicions were correct and other times they werent cousins was standing at the door now ready to leave flight laid a hand softly on his arm rebus recalled that hed meant to say something to flight but how to phrase it would it do to say that philip cousins seemed almost too clean with his surgeons cold manicured hands and his ambassadorial air rebus was wondering now seriously wondering since flight had gone off with philip cousins to find lisa and her protectors rebus went back to the lab to hear the result of the first saliva test sorry said the whitecoated scientist he looked not yet to be out of his teens beneath his lab coat there lurked a black tshirt decorated with the name of a heavy metal band i dont think were going to have much luck all were finding so far is h tapwater whoever stuck the envelope down must have used a wet sponge or a pad or one of those oldfashioned roller things no traces of saliva at all the breath left rebuss lungs what about fingerprints negative so far all weve found are two sets which look like theyre going to match dr frazers and were not having any better luck with fibres or grease stains id say the writer wore gloves nobody here has seen such a clean speckfree job he knows rebus was thinking he knows everything we might try so damned smart well thanks anyway he said the young man raised his eyebrows and spread his palms i wish we could do more you could start by getting a haircut son he thought to himself you look too much like kenny watkiss he sighed instead just do what you can he said just do what you can turning to walk away rebus felt a mixture of fresh rage and impotence sudden savage frustration the wolfman was too good he would stop killing before they could catch him or he would simply go on killing again and again and again no one would be safe and most of all it seemed lisa would not be safe lisa she was being blamed by the wolfman for the story rebus had invented it had nothing to do with lisa and if the wolfman should somehow get to her it would be rebuss fault wouldnt it where was lisa going rebus didnt know flight thought it was safer that way but rebus couldnt shake off the idea that the wolfman might well be a policeman might well be any policeman might be the brawny detective or the thin and silent detective lisa had gone off with them thinking them her protection what if she had walked straight into the clutches of what if the wolfman knew exactly what if philip cousins a loudspeaker sounded from its recess in the ceiling telephone call for inspector rebus at reception telephone call for inspector rebus rebus walked quickly down the rest of the corridor and through the swingdoor at the end he didnt know if flight was still in the building didnt care his mind was filling with horrors wolfman lisa rhona sammy little sammy his daughter shed seen enough terror in her life hed been responsible before he didnt want her to be hurt ever again the receptionist lifted the receiver as he approached holding it out to him as he grabbed it she pressed a button on the dial connecting him to the caller hello he said breathlessly daddy oh christ it was sammy sammy nearly yelling now what is it whats wrong oh daddy she was crying the memory flashed in front of him scalding his vision phonecalls screams what is it sammy tell me its a sniff its kenny kenny he furrowed his brow whats wrong with him has he been in a crash oh no daddy hes just just disappeared where are you sammy im in a callbox okay im going to give you the address of a police station meet me there if you have to get a taxi thats fine ill pay for it when you arrive understand daddy she sniffed back tears youve got to find him im worried please find him daddy please please by the time george flight reached reception rebus had already left the receptionist explained as best she could while flight rubbed his jaw encountering stubble he had argued with lisa frazer but by christ shed been stubborn attractively stubborn he had to admit shed told him she didnt mind bodyguards but that the idea of a safe location was out of the question she had she said an appointment at the old bailey a couple of appointments actually interviews she was doing in connection with some research its taken me weeks to set them up she said theres no way im going to blow them out now but my dear philip cousins had drawled thats just where were headed he was flight knew keen for a close to proceedings glancing at his watch impatiently and it seemed that lisa and cousins knew one another from the murder at copperplate street that they had things in common things they wanted to talk about that they were keen to be going so flight made a decision what did it matter after all if she did visit the bailey there were few better protected spots in the whole city it was several hours yet until the first of her interviews but that didnt really bother her she did not she said mind hanging around in the courthouse in fact she rather enjoyed the idea the two officers could accompany her wait for her then drive her on to whatever safe location flight had in mind this at any rate was lisa frazers argument an argument defended by philip cousins who could see no flaw in the reasoning mlud so to smiles on their part and a shrug on flights the course of action was decided flight watched the ford granada roll away from him the two officers in the front philip and lisa frazer in the back safe as houses he was thinking safe as bloody houses and now rebus had buggered off oh well hed catch up with him no doubt he didnt regret bringing rebus down here not a bit but he knew it had been his decision not one entirely endorsed by the upper echelons any ballsups and it would be flights pension on the block he knew that only too well as did everyone else which was why hed stuck so close to rebus in the first few days just to be sure of the man was he sure of the man it was a question he would rather not answer even now even to himself rebus was like the spring in a trap likely to jump no matter what landed on the bait he was also a scot and flight had never trusted the scots not since the day theyd voted to stay part of the union daddy and she runs into his arms he hugs her to him aware that he does not have to bend too far to accomplish this yes shes grown and yet she seems more childlike than ever he kisses the top of her head smells her clean hair she is trembling he can feel the vibrations darting through her chest and arms sshh he says ssshhh pet ssshhh she pulls back and almost smiles sniffs then says you always used to call me that your pet mum never called me pet only you he smiles back and strokes her hair yes he says your mum told me off for that she said a pet was a possession and that you werent a possession he is remembering now she had some funny ideas your mum she still does then she remembers why she is here the tears well up anew in her eyes i know you dont like him she says nonsense whatever gives you that but i love him daddy his heart spins once in his chest and i dont want anything to happen to him what makes you think somethings going to happen to him the way hes been acting lately like hes keeping secrets from me mums noticed it too im not just dreaming but she said she thought maybe he was planning an engagement she sees his eyes widen and shakes her head i didnt believe it i knew it was something else i thought i dont know i just he notices for the first time that they have an audience until now they might have been in a sealed box for all the notice he has taken of their surroundings now though he sees a bemused desk sergeant two wpcs clutching paperwork to their bosoms and watching the scene with a kind of maternal glow two unshaven men slumped in seats against the wall just waiting come on sammy he says lets go up to my office they were halfway to the murder room before he remembered that it was not perhaps the most wholesome environment for a teenage girl the photos on the walls were only the start of it a sense of humour was needed on a case like the wolfman and that sense of humour had begun to manifest itself in cartoons jokes and mockups of newspaper stories either pinned to the noticeboards or taped onto the sides of computer screens the language could be choice too or someone might be overheard in conversation with someone from forensics torn ripped her right kitchen knife they reckon slit from eargouged anus nasty bastard makes some of them seem almost human stories were swapped of serial killers past of suicides scraped from railway lines of police dogs playing ball with a severed head no definitely not the place for his daughter besides there was always the possibility that lamb might be there instead he found a vacant interview room it had been turned into a temporary cupboard while the investigation continued filled with empty cardboard boxes unneeded chairs broken desklamps and computer keyboards a heavylooking manual typewriter eventually the computers in the murder room would be packed back into the cardboard boxes the files would be tidied away into dusty stacks somewhere for now the room had a musty barren feel but it still boasted a lightbulb hanging from the ceiling a table and two chairs on the table sat a glass ashtray full of stubs and two plastic coffee cups containing a layer of green and black mould on the floor lay a crushed cigarette packet rebus kicked the packet beneath some of the stacked chairs its not much he said but its home sit down do you want anything she seemed not to understand the question like what i dont know coffee tea diet coke rebus shook his head what about irnbru now he laughed she was joking with him he couldnt bear to see her upset especially over someone as undeserving as kenny watkiss sammy he asked does kenny have an uncle uncle tommy rebus nodded thats the one what about him well said rebus crossing his legs what do you know about him about kennys uncle tommy not a lot what does he do for a living i think kenny said hes got a stall somewhere you know in a market lake brick lane market did he sell false teeth or maybe he just delivers to market stalls i cant really remember delivers stolen goods goods given to him by thieves like the one theyd picked up the one who had pretended to be the wolfman anyway hes got a few bob how do you know that kenny told me at least i think he did otherwise how would i know where does kenny work sammy in the city yes but for which firm firm hes a courier isnt he he must work for a company but she shook her head he went freelance when he had enough regular clients i remember he said that his boss at the old place was pissed off she broke off suddenly and looked up at him her face going red shed forgotten for a moment that she was talking to her father and not just to some copper sorry dad she apologised his boss was angry with him for taking away so much of the trade kenny was good see he knows all the shortcuts knows which buildings are which some drivers get confused when they cant find some tiny alleyway or when the numbers on a street dont seem to make sense yes rebus had noticed that how sometimes the street numbers seemed illogical as though numbers had been skipped but not kenny he knows london like the back of his hand knows london well the roads the shortcuts on a motorbike you could cut across london in a flash towpaths alleys in a flash what kind of bike does he have sammy i dont know a kawasaki somethingorother hes got one that he uses for work because its not too heavy and another he keeps for weekends a really big bike where does he keep them there cant be too many safe places around the churchill estate there are some garages nearby they get vandalised but kennys put a reinforced door on its like fort knox i keep kidding him about it its better guarded than his her voice falls flat how did you know he lives on churchill what her voice is stronger now curious how did you know kenny lives on churchill rebus shrugged i suppose he told me that night i met him round at your place shes thinking back trying to recall the conversation but theres nothing there nothing she can latch onto rebus is thinking too like fort knox a handy place to store stolen gear or a corpse so he says pulling his chair a little further in to the table tell me what you think has happened what do you think hes been keeping from you she stared at the tabletop shaking her head slowly staring shaking until finally i dont know well had you fallen out over anything maybe youd been arguing no maybe he was jealous she gave a desperate laugh no maybe he had other girlfriends no when her eyes caught his rebus felt a stirring of shame inside him he couldnt forget that she was his daughter nor could he forget that he needed to ask her these questions somehow he kept swerving between the two careering into her no she repeated softly id have known if there was someone else friends then did he have any close friends a few not many i mean he talked about them but he never introduced me have you tried calling them maybe one of them knows something i only know their first names a couple of guys kenny grew up with billy and jim then there was someone called arnold he used to mention him and one of the other bike messengers i think his name was roland or ronald something posh like that hold on let me jot these down rebus took notebook and pen from his pocket right he said so that was billy jim what was the other one roland or ronald or something she watched him writing and arnold rebus sat back in his chair arnold yes did you ever meet arnold i dont think so what did kenny say about him she shrugged he was just someone kenny used to bump into i think he worked the stalls too they went for a drink sometimes it couldnt be the same arnold could it flights bald sexoffender snitch what were the chances going for a drink they seemed unlikely supping companions always supposing it was the same arnold all right rebus said closing the notebook do you have a recent photo of kenny a good one onethats nice and sharp i can get one ive got some back at the house okay ill get someone to drive you home give them the picture and theyll bring it back to me lets circulate kennys description thats the first thing to do meanwhile ill do some snooping see what i can come up with she smiled its not really your patch is it no its not my patch at all but sometimes if you look at something or some place for too long you stop seeing whats there sometimes it takes a fresh pair of eyes to see whats staring you in the face he was thinking of flight of the reason flight had brought him down herehewas thinking too of whether he rebus could muster enough clout to organise a search for kenny watkiss maybe not without flight to back him up no what was he thinking of this was a missing person for christs sake it had to be investigated yes but there were ways and ways of investigating and he could count on no preferential treatment no favours when it came to the crunch i dont suppose he asked now you know whether or not his bikes are still in the garage i took a look theyre both still there that was when i started to get worried was there anything else in the garage but she wasnt listening to him he hardly ever goes anywhere without a bike he hates buses and stuff he said hewas going to name his big bike after after me the tears came again this time he let her cry though it hurt him more than he could say better out than in wasnt that how the cliche went she was blowing her nose when the door opened flight looked into the small room his eyes said it all you might have taken her somewhere better than this yes george what can i do for you after you left the lab the pause showed displeasure at not having been informed or left a message they gave me a bit more gen on the letter itself ill be with you in a minute flight nodded but directed his attention to samantha are you okay love she sniffed fine thanks well he said archly if you do want to register a complaint against inspector rebus see the desk sergeant ach get away george said rebus sammy was trying to giggle and blow her nose at the same time and making a bit of a mess of both rebus winked towards flight who having done as much as he could and for which rebus was grateful was now retreating youre not all bad are you said samantha when flight had gone what do you mean policemen youre not all asbad as they say youre a coppers daughter sammy remember that and youre a straight coppers daughter be sureto stick up for your old dad okay she smiled again youre not old dad he smiled too but did not reply in truth he was basking in the compliment whether it was mere flattery or no what mattered was that sammy his daughter sammy had said it right he said at last lets get you into a car and dont worry pet well track down your missing beau you called me pet again did i dont tell your mother i wont and dad what he halfturned towards her just in time to receive her peck on the cheek thanks she said whatever happens thanks flight was in the small office of the murder room after the close confiness of the interview cupboard this space had suddenly taken on a new much larger dimension rebus sat himself down and swung one leg over the other so whats this about the wolfman letter he said so replied flight whats this about kenny watkiss disappearing you tell me yours and ill tell you mine flight picked up a folder opened it tookout three or four closely typed sheets of paper and began to read typeface used is helvetica unusual for personal correspondence though used by newspapers and magazines flight looked up meaningfully a reporter rebus said doubtfully well think about it said flight every crime reporter in england knows about lisa frazer by now they could probably find out where she lives too rebus considered this okay he said at last go on helvetica can be found on some electronic typewriters and electric golfball machines but is more commonly found on computers and word processors flight glanced up this would correlate with density of type the type itself is of very even quality blab blah blah also the letters line up neatly suggesting that a good quality printer has been used probably a daisywheel suggesting in turn the use of a high quality word processor or wordprocessing package however flight went on the letter k becomes faint towards the tips of its stem flight paused to turn the page rebus wasnt really paying a great deal of attention as yet and neither was george flight labs always came up with more information than was useful so far all rebus had really been hearing was the chaff this is more interesting flight went on inside the envelope particles were found which appear to be flecks of paint yellow green and orange predominating perhaps an oilbased paint tests are still continuing so weve got a crime reporter who fancies himself as van gogh flight wasnt rising to the bait he read through the rest of the report quickly to himself thats pretty much it he said whats left is more to do with what they failed to find no prints no stains no hair or fibres no personalised watermark rebus asked in detective novels the personalised watermark would lead to a small family business run by an eccentric old man who would recall selling the paper to someone called and that would be it crime solved neat ingenious but it seldom happened like that he thought of lisa again of cousins no not cousins it couldnt be cousins and besides he wouldnt try anything with those two gorillas in attendance no personalised watermark flight was saying sorry oh well rebus offered with a loud sigh were no further forward are we flight was looking at the report as though willing something some clue to grab his attention then so whats all this about kenny watkiss hes scarpered under mysterious circumstances good riddance id say but its left sammy in a bit of a state i said wed do what we could you cant get involved john leave it to us i dont want to get involved george this ones all yours the voice seemed ingenuous enough but flight was long past being fooled by john rebus he grinned and shook his head what do you want he asked well said rebus leaning forward in his chair sammy did mention one of kennys associates someone called arnold who worked on a market stall at least she thinks he works in or around a market you think its my arnold flight thought it over its possible too much of a coincidence you think not in a city as small as this flight saw the look on rebuss face im being serious actually the smalltime crooks theyre like a little family if this was sicily you could cram every smalltimer in london into a village everybody knows everybody else its the bigtimers we cant pin they keep themselves too much to themselves never go down the pub shooting their mouths off after a couple of navy rums can we talk to arnold what for maybe he knows something about kenny even supposing he does why should he tell us because were police officers george and hes a member of the public were here to uphold law and order and its his duty to help us in that onerous task rebus was reflective plus ill slip him twenty quid flight sounded incredulous this is london john a score can hardly get a round of drinks arnold gives good gen but hell be looking for a pony at least now he was playing with rebus and rebus realising it smiled if arnold wants a pony he said tell him ill buy him one for christmas and a little girl to sit on it just so long as he tells me what he knows fair enough said flight come on then lets go find ourselves a street market the gallery flight was struggling with half a dozen large brownpaper bags the fruits literally of asking for arnold at three or four market stalls so far rebus had refused the offers of free bananas oranges pears and grapes though flight had prodded him to accept its a local custom flight said they get annoyed if you dont accept like a glaswegian offering you a drink would you turn it down no because then youd offend him same with these guys what would i do with three pounds of bananas eat them said flight blandly then cryptically unless you were arnold of course he refused to explain the meaning of this and rebus refused to consider the various possibilities they moved from stall to stall passing most stopping at only a few in their way they were like the women who crushed in all around them feeling this or that mango or aubergine checking prices at the various stalls pausing only at a few to make their final purchases allo george blimey george where you been hiding yourself all right there george hows your love life it seemed to rebus that half the stallholders and most of their box and traycarrying assistants knew flight at one point flight nodded behind one of the stalls where a young man was disappearing rapidly along the street jim jessop he said he skipped bail a couple of weeks back shouldnt we but flight shook his head another time eh john the little bugger was threeas standard in the thousand metres i dont feel like a run today what about you fair enough said rebus aware that here in this place on this patch he was very much the bystander the tourist this was flights territory the man moved confidently through the throng spoke easily with the various vendors was in every way quite at home eventually after a chat with the man behind the fresh fish counter flight returned with a bag of mussels another of scallops and information on where arnold might be found he led rebus behind the market stalls onto the pavement and then into a narrow alleyway moules mariniere he said holding up one of the white polythene bags beautiful easy to cook too its the preparation that takes up all the time rebus shook his head youre full of surprises george id never have taken you for a cordon bleu flight just smiled musing and scallops he said marion loves those i make a sauce with them and serve it with fresh trout again its all preparation the cookings the easy part he enjoyed showing rebus this other side of his personality though he couldnt say why nor could he exactly say why he hadnt told john rebus that lisa had gone to the old bailey had instead mumbled something about seeing her safely on her way he thought probably his reasoning had to do with rebuss springloaded emotions if the scotsman thought lisa frazer was not in flights place of safety hed probably go haring off after her making a fool of himself neath blindfolded justice herself and rebus was still flights responsibility still the liability he always had been if not more so they had come out of the alley onto a smallscale housing estate the houses looked fairly new but already the paint was flaking from the window sills there were cries and squeals from just ahead a kiddies playground concrete surrounded by concrete a huge section of pipe had become a tunnel a den a hiding place there were swings too and a seesaw and a sandpit which had become second home to the areas cats and dogs the childrens imaginations knew few bounds pretend youre in hospital and im the doctor and then the spacemans ship crashed on the planet cowboys dont have girlfriends no youre chasing me because im the soldier and youre the guard pretend there isnt a pipe pretend there was no pretend about the energy they were expending they couldnt stand still couldnt pause for breath they had to yell and jump and get involved it made rebus tired just to look at them there he is said flight he was pointing towards a bench on the edge of the playground arnold was sitting there his back very straight hands clasping his knees he had an intent look on his face neither happy nor unhappy the kind of look you sometimes saw at the zoo when someone was peering into a particular cage or enclosure it was best described as an interested look oh yes arnold was interested it made rebussstomach queasy just to watch him flight seemed to take it all quite casuallyhe walked across to the bench and sat down beside arnold who turned his eyes suddenly taking on a hunted frightened look his mouth creasing into an o then he exhaled noisily its you mister flight i didnt recognise you he gestured towards the bags been shopping thats nice the voice was flat lacking emotion rebus had heard addicts talk like that five percent of their brain was fixed on dealing with the external world the remaining ninetyfive concentrating on other things well he supposed arnold was a kind of addict too yes said flight just buying a few bits you remember inspector rebus arnold followed flights eyes staring up from his bench to where rebus stood his body purposely shielding arnold from the children oh yes arnold said blandly he was in the car with you the other day mr flight well done arnold yes thats right youve got a good memory havent you it pays to have mr flight thats how i remember all the things i tell you actually arnold flight slid along the bench until his thigh was almost touching that of the other man arnold angled his own legs away from the policeman his eyes intent on flights proximity to him speaking of memory maybe you can help me maybe you can help inspector rebus too yes the word was stretched almost to breaking point we were just wondering said flight whether youve seen kenny lately only he doesnt seem to have been around much does he i wondered whether hed maybe gone on holiday arnold gazed up with milky childlike eyes kenny who flight laughed kenny watkiss arnold your mate kenny for a moment rebus held his breath what if it was another arnold what if sammy had got the name wrong then arnold nodded slowly oh that kenny hes not really a mate mr flight i mean i see him now and again arnold stopped but flight was nodding saying nothing expecting more we havea drink together sometimes what do you talk about the question was unexpected what do you mean its a simple enough question said flight with a smile what do you talk about i wouldnt have thought the two of you would have much incommon we just we talk i dont know yes but what do you talk about football sometimes yes what team does he support i dont know mr flight you talk about football with him and yet you dont know what team he supports maybe he told me and i forgot flight looked dubious maybe he agreed rebus knew his part in the drama now let flight do the talking just keep quiet but look ominous standing over arnold like a thundercloud staring down like an avenger onto that gleaming bald dome of a head flight knew exactly what he was doing arnold was growing nervous his body jerking unable to keep his head still his right knee bobbing up and down so whatelse do you talk about he likes motorbikes doesnt he yes arnold answered guardedly now for he knew what was happening to him so do you talk about bikes i dont like bikes too noisy too noisy yes youve got a point there flight nodded towards the play area but this place is noisy too arnold isnt it yet you dont seem tomind the noise here whys that arnold turned on him eyes burning but flight was ready with a smile asmile more serious than any grimace what i mean is he went on you like some noises but not others thats fair isnt it but you dont like motorbikes so what else do you talk about with kenny we just talk said arnold his face creased with anguish gossip how the citys changing the east end this used to be all rows of cottages there was a field and allotments the families all used to have picnics on the field theyd bring tomatoes or potatoes or a cabbage to your mum saying they grew too much and the kids would all play in the street there werent any bangladeshis or what have you just proper east enders kennys mum and dad didnt live far from here two streets away from where i lived course i was older than him we never played together or anything and where did uncle tommy live he was over that way arnold pointed with a finger he had grown a little more confident now reminiscences couldnt do any harm could they and to talk freely came as such a relief after the careful duel hed just gone through so he opened up to them the good old days but between his words rebus could see a truer picture a picture of how the other kids used tobeat him up play tricks on him of how his father used to lock him in his room starve him the family breaking apart drifting into petty crime painfully shy unable to form relationships do you ever see tommy around flight asked suddenly tommy watkiss yes i see him arnold was still basking in the past does kenny see him of course he does he works for him sometimes what deliveries that sort of thing deliveries pickups arnold halted aware of what he was saying this wasnt the past they were talking about any longer this wasnt safe but rebus had replied i do have a grudge george this guy kenny might have been shagging my daughter flight had glanced from the windscreen into rebuss face then had looked away i said leave it to us john if you cant play it that way ill personally see that you go bouncing back down the ranks like a ball down a fucking stairwell got that loud and clear its not a threat john its a promise and you always keep your promises george dont you you seem to be forgetting something its your fault that im down here in the first place you sent for me flight had nodded and i can send you back just as quick is that what you want rebus had stayed silent though he knew the answer flight knew it too and smiled at this small triumph they drove in silence after that both men tainted by the memory of a playground and of a silent man hands clasping his knees staring ahead of him his thoughts sweet with corruption now rebus was thinking of lisa thinking of how it would feel to take a shower with her to scrub away a layer of london from them both maybe he would ask george again for the secret address maybe he could visit her he remembered a conversation theyd had in bed hed asked if he could see her office in university college sometime sometime shed said mind you its not a very nice room nothing like those huge antique oxbridge rooms you see in television dramas its a pokey little hole to be honest i hate it id still like you to show me around and isaid okay she sounded on edge why was that why had she been so nervous of letting him see her room why had the secretary millicent lisa had called her been so vague the day rebus had visited no not just vague uncooperative downright uncooperative now that he thought of it what the hell was it they were keeping from him he knew one way he could find out the answer one sure and certain way what the hell lisa was safe and hed been told to stay out of the watkiss case so what was stopping him from following up this latest mystery he got to his feet the answer was nothing was stopping him nothing at all where are you going it was flight yelling at him from an open door as rebus stalked down the hall its personal rebus called back i warned you john dont get involved its not what you think he stopped turning to face george flight well what is it then like i said george its personal okay no look said rebus his emotions suddenly getting the better of him all those thoughts hed been keeping on a tight rein sammy kenny watkiss the wolfman the threat against lisa all boiling up he swallowed breathing hard look george youve got plenty to keep you busy okay his finger stabbed at flights chest remember what i said it could be a copper why dont you do some of your careful precious nitpicking investigation on that the wolfman could be here in this building he could be working on the bloody case hunting himself rebus heard his voice growing hysterical and calmed quickly regaining control over his vocal chords if nothing else a sort of wolf in the fold you mean im serious rebus paused he might even know where youve sent lisa for christs sake john only three people know where lisas going me and the two men i sent with her now you dont know those guys but i do we go back all the way to training college id trust them with my life flight paused will you trust me rebus said nothing flights eyes narrowed disbelievingly and he whistled well he said that certainly answers my question he shook his head slowly this case john ive been in the force god knows how many years but this case its the worst its like every victim was somebody close to me he paused again gathering strength now his finger jabbed at rebus so dont you dare think what i know youre thinking its the ultimate fucking insult there was a long silence in the corridor typewriters chattered somewhere male voices were raised in laughter a hummed tune floated down the hall towards and past them it was as though the whole world were indifferent to this quarrel and there they stood not quite friends not quite enemies and not quite sure what to do any more rebus studied the scuff marks on the linoleum then lecture over flight seemed pained by this response it wasnt a lecture it was just i want you to see my side of things but i do george i do rebus patted flights arm and turned away from him again he started to walk i want you to stay here john walking do you hear me im ordering you not to go rebus kept walking flight shook his head hed had enough absolutely up to his eyes so that they stung now stung as though he were in a smoky room youre out on your ear rebus he called knowing this to be the final warning if rebus kept walking now flight would be compelled to keep his word or else lose face and he was damned if hed lose face for a hard headed jock copper just keep walking he yelled keep walking and youre finished rebus walked he didnt know exactly why perhaps more out of pride than anything else stupid pride pride he couldnt explain but pride all the same the same emotion that made grown men cry at football matches when flower of scotland was played as the scots national anthem all he knew was that he had something to do and he would do it like the scots knew their job was to be footballers with more ambition than ability yes that was him all right more ambition than ability theyd put it on his gravestone at the end of the corridor he shoved open the swing doors he didnt look back flights voice followed him trailing off as it grew in anger damn you you stupid jock bastard youve bitten off more than you can chew this time do you hear me more than you can bloody well chew fytp rebus was moving through the entrance hall when he came face to face with lamb he made to move past him but lamb placed a hand on rebuss chest wheres the fire he said rebus was trying to ignore him was trying to make lamb invisible the last thing he needed now was this his knuckles tingled with anticipation lamb was still talking apparently oblivious to the danger he was in she found you then your daughter what lamb was smiling she phoned here first and they put her on to me she sounded a bit upset so i gave her the labs number oh rebus could feel himself deflating he managed a grudged thanks and this time succeeded in moving around lamb but then lamb spoke again she sounded a bit tasty though i like them young how old is she again rebuss elbow shot back into lambs unprotected stomach cutting off breath doubling him over rebus studied his work not bad for an old man not bad at all he walked because hes on personal business he stands outside the station and looks for a cab one of the uniformed officers who knows him from the scene of sundays murder offers a lift in a patrol car but rebus shakes his head the officer looks at him as if an insult has just been traded thanks anyway says rebus trying to sound conciliatory but all he sounds is mad mad with lamb with himself mad with the wolfman case mad with kenny bloody watkiss mad with flight with lisa why did she have to be in copperplate street in the first place and most of all mad with london where are all the cabs all the greedy black cabs beetling like insects as they try to pick up fares hes seen thousands of them this past week but now that he needs one theyre all avoiding him he waits anyway eyes slightly unfocused and as he waits he thinks and as he thinks he calms a little what the hell is he doing anyway hes asking for trouble doing this hes begging for it like a blackclothed calvinist pleading to be beaten for his sins a lash across the back rebus had seen them all all the available religions he had tasted them and each one tasted bitter in its own particular way where was the religion for those who did not feel guilty did not feel shame did not regret getting angry or getting even or better yet getting more than even where was the religion for a man who believed that good and bad must coexist even within the individual where was the religion for a man who believed in god but not in gods religion and where were all the bloody taxis sod it then he walked up to the first patrol car he saw and tapped on the window flashing his id inspector rebus he announced can you give me a lift to gower street the building seemed as deserted as ever and rebus feared that on this occasion perhaps even the secretary might have scarpered for an early start to the weekend but no she was there like the retainer of some dusty mansion he cleared his throat and she looked up from her crochet yes she said can help you she appeared not to remember him rebus brought out his id and pushed it towards her detective inspector rebus he said his voice stiff with authority scotland yard i want to ask you a few questions about dr frazer the woman looked frightened rebus feared he had overdone the menace he tried a dontworryitsnotyouwereinterestedin sort of smile a peaceable smile but the woman looked no less afraid and her fear flustered her oh gracious she stammered oh my oh my she looked up at him who did you say dr frazer but theres no dr frazer in the department rebus described lisa frazer the woman suddenly raised her head recognising the description oh lisa you mean lisa but theres some mistake lisa frazer isnt a member of staff here gracious me no though i believe she may have taken a tutorial or two just filling in oh dear scotland yard what i mean surely she hasnt what has she done she doesnt work here rebus needed to be certain then who is she lisa shes one of our research students a student but shes he was about to say old a mature student the secretary explained oh dear is she in trouble i came here before rebus said you didnt tell me any of this then why came here before she studied his face yes i remember well lisa made me promise not to tell anyone why her project she said shes doing a project on now what is it exactly she opened a drawer of her desk and pulled out a sheet of paper ah yes the psychology of the investigation of serious crime she explained it to me how she needed access to a police investigation how she needed to gain trust the courts police and so on she told me she was going to pretend to be a lecturer i told her not to i warned her but she said it was the only way the police wouldnt waste time with a mere student would they rebus was stuck for an answer the answer was no they wouldnt why should they so she got you to cover for her the woman shrugged lisa is quite a persuasive young woman she said probably i wouldnt have to tell lies i could just say things like shes not here shes not teaching today that sort of thing always supposing anyone bothered to check up on her and has anybody checked up on her oh yes why only today i had a telephone call from someone she had arranged to interview he wanted to be sure that she really was part of university college and not just a journalist or a nosey parker today an interview today well that was one appointment she wouldnt be keeping who was this person rebus asked do you remember i think i wrote it down she said she lifted the thick notepad beside her telephone and flipped through it he did say who he was but i cant remember it was at the old bailey yes thats right shed arranged to meet him at the old bailey i usually write these things down as soon as someone mentions their name just in case i forget later no theres no sign of it thats funny perhaps in the bin rebus suggested well perhaps but she sounded doubtful rebus lifted the small wicker paperbasket onto her desk and sifted through it pencil shavings and sweetwrappers an empty polystyrene coffee cup and crumpled bits of paper lots of bits of paper too big she would say as he started to uncrumple one or too small until finally he pulled out a sheet and spread it out on the desk it was like some bizarre work of art filled with doodles and hieroglyphs and little notes phone numbers names addresses ah she said sliding a finger over to one corner where something had been written in very faint wavering pencil is that it rebus looked closer yes that was it that was most definitely it thank you he said oh dear said the secretary have i got her into trouble is lisa in trouble what has she done inspector she lied to us said rebus and because of that shes ended up having to go into hiding hiding gracious she didnt mention anything about that rebus was beginning to suspect that the secretary was a couple of keys short of a typewriter well he said she didnt know she was in trouble until today the secretary was nodding yes but she only phoned a little over an hour ago rebuss face creased into an allover frown what yes she said she was calling from the old bailey she wanted to know if there were any messages for her she told me she had time to kill before her second appointment rebus didnt bother to ask he dialled quickly the receiver gripped in his hand like a weapon i want to talk to george flight just a minute please the chchchch of a rerouting then murder room detective sergeant walsh speaking its inspector rebus here oh yes the voice had become as rudimentary as a chisel i need to speak to flight its urgent hes in a meeting then get him out i told you this is urgent there was doubt cynicism in the sergeants voice everyone knew that the scotsmans urgent wasnt worth its weight in breath i can leave a message dont fuck me around walsh either gethim or put me on to someone with a spare brain theyre not sitting on caclick brrrrr the ultimate putdown the secretary was staring at rebus in horror perhaps psychologists never got angry rebus attempted a reassuring smile but it came out like a clowns drunken greasepaint he made a bowing motion before turning to leave and was watched all the way out to the stairwell by a woman mortified almost to the core of her being rebuss face was tingling with a newly stoked anger lisa frazer had tricked him played him like a fool christ the things hed told hera thinking she wanted to help with the wolfman case not realising he was merely part of her project christ the things he had said what had he said too much to recall had she been taping everything or simply jotting things down after hed left it didnt matter what mattered was that he had seen in her something solid and believable amidst a sea of chaos and she had been janus using him jesus christ she had even slept with him was that too part of the project part of her little experiment how could he ever be sure it wasnt it had seemed genuine enough but he had opened his mind to her as she had opened her body to him it was not a fair exchange the bitch he exploded stopping dead the lying little bitch why hadnt she told him why hadnt she just explained everything he would have helped her he would have found time for her no he wouldnt it was a lie a research student a project he would have shown her the door instead he had listened to her had believed her had learned from her yes it was true he had learned a lot from her about psychology about the mind of the killer had learned from her books yes but that wasnt the point the point was that it had all become crass and diluted now that he knew her for what she was bitch but his voice was softer his throat tightening as though a hand had slid around it and was slowly applying pressure he swallowed hard and began to take deep breaths calm down john what did it matter what did any of it matter it mattered he answered himself because he felt something for her or had felt something for her no still did feel something something he thought might have been returned who are you trying to kid look at him overweight and in his forties stuck at inspector level and going nowhere except if flight carried out his promise down divorced a daughter distraught and mixing with darkness someone in london with a kitchen knife and a secret and a knowledge of lisa it was all wrong hed been clutching at lisa the way drowning men reached out for a thin snap of straw stupid old man he stood at the main door to the building not really sure now should he confront her or let it go never see her again usually he relished confrontation found it nourishing and exciting but today maybe not she was at the old bailey to interview malcolm chambers he too was at this moment being tricked by her mock credentials by that falsely prefixed doctor everyone admired malcolm chambers he was smart he was on the side of the law and he made pots of money rebus had known coppers who were none of these most could score only one out of three a few managed two chambers would sweep lisa frazer off her feet she would loathehim until that loathing mingled with awe and then shed probably think that she loved him well good luck to her hed head back to the station say his farewells pack his bags and head north they could get along without him very well the case was heading nowhere until the wolfman bit again yet they had so much now knew so much about him had come so close to opening him up like a soft fat peach maybe hed bite lisa frazer what the hell was she doing at the old bailey when she should be in hiding he needed to speak to flight what the hell was flight up to anyway ach to hell with the lot of you he muttered plunging his hands into his pockets two students their voices loudly american were heading towards him they seemed excited the way students always did discussing this or that concept ready to change the way the world thought they wanted to get past wanted to go into the building he moved aside for them but they didnt so much move past him as through him as though he were insubstantial as exhaust fumes like yknow i think she likes me but im not sure im ready for something like so much for difficult concepts thought rebus why should students be different from anyone else in the population why should they be thinking and talking about something other than sex yeah said the other one rebus wondered how comfortable he felt in his thick white tshirt and thicker checked lumberjack shirt the day was sticky yeah the american repeated his accent reminded rebus of lisas softer canadian tones but get this continued his companion their voices fading as they moved deeper into the building she says her mother hates americans because one of them near raped her in the war get this where had rebus heard that expression before he fumbled in his jacket pocket and found a folded piece of paper unfolded it and began to read get this im not homosexul ok it was the photocopy of the wolfmans letter to lisa get this it did have a transatlantic ring to it didnt it a curious way altogether of starting a letter get this be warned watch out there were several ways of starting a letter so that the reader knew he was to pay particular attention to it but get this what did they know or what did they suspect about the wolfman he knew about police procedure past offender copper both were possible he was a he if jan crawford were to be believed he was quite tall she thought in the restaurant lisa frazer had added her own ideas he was conservative most of the time he not only seemed normal he was normal he was in her phrase psychologically mature and he had posted a letter to lisa from ec ec wasnt that where the old bailey was he recalled his first and only visit to the building the courtroom and seeing kenny watkiss there thenmeeting malcolm chambers what was it chambers had said to george flight royally shafted own team i dont like flight i dont like being royally shafted own team get this get this george jesus christ every ball on the table suddenly fell into a pocket until only the cue ball and the black were left every single ball get this george i dont like being royally shafted by my own team malcolm chambers had studied in the usa for a while flight had told rebus that you tended to pick up mannerisms when you wanted to fit into a new and strange place get this rebus had tried to avoid the temptation in london but it was strong studied in the usa and now he was with lisa frazer lisa the student lisa the psychologist lisa with her photo in the newspapers get this oh how the wolfman must hate her she was a psychologist after all and the psychologists had pronounced him gay they had insights into what was wrong with him he didnt think anything was wrong with him but something was something that was slowly taking him over old bailey was in ec the wolfman rattled had slipped up and posted his letter from ec it was malcolm chambers malcolm chambers was the wolfman rebus couldnt explain it couldnt exactly justify it but he knew it all the same it was like a dark polluted wave rolling over him anointing him malcolm chambers someone who knew about police procedure someone above suspicion someone so clean you had to scratch beneath the skin to find the filth rebus was running he was running along gower street in what he hoped was the right direction for the city he was running and he was craning his neck to seek out a taxi there was one ahead of him at the corner beside the british museum but it was picking up a fare students or tourists japanese grins and cameras four of them two men two young women rebus stuck his head into the back of the cab where two of them were already seated out he yelled jerking a thumb towards the pavement oi mate whats your game the driver was so fat he could barely turn in his seat i said out rebus grabbed an arm and pulled either the young man was surprisingly light or else rebus had found hidden strength for the body fairly flew from its seat uttering a string of highpitched comment as it went and you the girl followed obligingly and rebus hurled himself into the cab slamming shut the door drive he yelled im not moving till i w rebus shoved his id against the window separating the back seats of the taxi from the front inspector rebus he called this is an emergency i need to get to the old bailey break every traffic law you like ill sort it out later but get your fucking skates on the driver responded by switching his headlights on full beam before setting out into the traffic use your horn rebus called the driver did so a surprising number of cars eased out of his way rebus was on the edge of his seat gripping it with both hands to stop himself being thrown about how long will it take this time of day ten or fifteen minutes whats the matter guv cant they start without you rebus smiled sourly that was just the problem without him the wolfman could start whenever he liked i need to use your radio he said the driver slid his window further open be my guest he said pulling the small microphone up towards rebus hed worked on the cabs for twentyodd years but hed never had a fare like this in fact he was so excited they were halfway there before he remembered to switch on the meter rebus had told flight as much as he could trying not to sound hysterical flight sounded dubious about the whole thing but agreed to send men to the old bailey rebus didnt blame george flight for being wary hard to justify arresting a pillar of society on the strength of a gut feeling rebus remembered what else lisa frazer had said about serial killers that they were products of their environments that their ambitions had been thwarted leading them to kin members of the social group above them well that certainly wasnt true in malcolm chamberss case was it and what had she said about the wolfman his attacks were nonconfrontational so perhaps he was like that in his working life hah so much for theory but now rebus began to doubt his own instincts jesus what if he was wrong what if the theory was right he was going to look more than a little psychologically disturbed himself then he recalled something george flight had said you could build up as neat a picture as you liked of the killer but it wouldnt give you a name and address psychology was all well and good but you couldnt beat a good oldfashioned hunch nearly there guv rebus tried to keep his breathing regular be calm john be calm however there were no police cars waiting by the entrance to the old bailey no sirens and armed officers just people milling around people finishing work for the day people sharing a joke rebus left the cab driver unpaid and untipped ill settle later and pushed open the heavy glass door behind more bulletproof glass stood two security personnel rebus stuck his id in front of their noses one of them pointed towards the two vertical glass cylinders by which people were admitted to the building one at a time rebus went to one cylinder and waited nothing happened then he remembered pushed the heel of his hand against the button and the cylinder door opened he walked in and waited for what seemed an eternity while the door slid shut behind him before the door in front slid just as slowly open another guard stood beside the metal detectionequipment rebus still holding open his id walked quickly past until he found himself behind the bulletproof glass of the reception area can i help said one of the security men malcolm chambers said rebus hes a barrister i need to see him urgently mr chambers hold on ill just check i dont want him to know im here rebus warned i just want to know where i can find him just one moment the guard moved off consulting with one of his companions then slowly going through a sheet of paper attached to a clipboard rebuss heart was pounding he felt like he was about to explode he couldnt just stand here he had to do something patience john less haste more speed as his father had always said but what the hell did that mean anyway surely haste was a kind of speed the guard was coming back yes inspector mr chambers has a young lady with him at present im told theyresitting together upstairs upstairs meant the concourse outside the courtrooms rebus flew up the imposing flight of steps two at a time marble there was a lot of marble around him and wood and glass the windows seemed huge bewigged counsels came down a spiral staircase deep in conversation a frayedlooking woman smoked a cheap cigarette as she waited for someone it was a quiet pandemonium people were moving past rebus moving in the opposite direction from him juries finished for the day solicitors and guiltylooking clients the woman rose to greet her son the sons solicitor had a bored drawn look the concourse was emptying rapidly the stairs taking people down to more glass cylinders and to the outside world about thirty yards from where rebus stood the two men were sitting legs crossed enjoying a cigarette the two men flight had sent with lisa her bodyguards rebus ran to them where is she they recognised him seemed to realise immediately that something was wrong and rose to their feet shes interviewing some barrister yes but where the man nodded towards one of the courtrooms court eight of course hadnt cousins been due to give evidence in court eight and wasnt malcolm chambers the prosecuting counsel rebus pushed through the doors into the courtroom but cleaners apart it was completely empty there had to be another exit of course there was the green padded door to the side of the jurybox the door leading to the judges rooms he ran across the court and up the steps to the door pulling it open finding himself in a bright carpeted corridor a window flowers in a pot on a table a narrow corridor doors only on one side the other wall a blank judges names above the doors the doors themselves locked there was a tiny kitchenette but it too was empty one door eventually gave and he peered into ay jury room empty back into the corridor again hissing now with frustration a court usher cradling a mug of tea was coming towards him no ones allowed inspector rebus he said im looking for an advocate i mean a barrister malcolm chambers he was here with a young woman theyve just left left she gestured along towards the far end ofthe corridor it leads to the underground car park thats where they were headed rebus made to squeeze past her you wont catch them now she said not unless theyre having trouble with the car rebus thought about it gnawing at his bottom lip there wasnt time his first decision had to be the right one decision made he turned from the usher and ran back towards the court back across the court itself and out into the concourse theyve gone he yelled to the bodyguards tell flight tell him theyre in chamberss car and then he was off again down the steps towards the exit pausing only to grab at a security mans sleeve the car park exit where is it round the other side of the building rebus stuck a finger in the guards face buzz down to the car park dont let malcolm chambers leave the guard stood there dumbly staring at the finger do it and then he was off again running taking the stairs down three at a time great leaps which almost sent him flying he pushed his way to the front of the crowd waiting to leave police he said emergency nobody said anything they were like cows patiently waiting to be milked even so it took a silent scream of an age for the cylinder to empty its cargo close its doors then open them again for rebus come on come on and then the door sucked itself open and he was out out in the foyer bursting through the main doors he ran up to the corner took a right and ran again along the face of the building another right he was on the other side of the building now where the car park exit was a slope of road down into darkness the car screeched as it came to the surface hardly slowing as it climbed the hill to newgate street it was a long glossblack bmw and in the passenger seat sat lisa frazer looking relaxed smiling talking to the driver not realising lisa but he was too far away the traffic around him too loud lisa before he could reach it the car had turned into a flow of traffic and disappeared rebus cursed under his breath then looked around him for the first time and saw that he was standing next to a parked jaguar in the front of which sat a liveried chauffeur staring out of the window at him rebus yanked at the doorhandle and threw open the door reaching in with one hand to pull out the bemused driver he was getting to be a dab hand at this relieving people of their vehicles hoi what the bleedin ell the mans cap rolled along the ground given force by a gust of wind for a moment he knelt on the pavement undecided whether to rescue the cap or the car the moment was enough rebus gunned the engine and pulled away from the kerb horns sounding behind him as he did so at the top of the slight incline he pressed his hand hard on the horn and careered left into the main road a squeal of brakes more horns the pedestrians looking at him as though he were mad need lights he said to himself glancing at the dashboard eventually he found the headlamp switch and flipped them to full beam then took a hard right to bring himself into the middle of the road passing the traffic scraping the passenger side against an oncoming red bus clipping a central bollard uprooting the flimsy plastic construction and sending it flying into the path of the oncoming traffic they couldnt be too far ahead of him yes he caught a glimpse of the bmws taillights as it braked to turn a corner hed be damned if theyd lose him excuse me rebus flinched startled and nearly pulled the car onto the pavement he looked in the rearview mirror and saw an elderly gentleman sitting in the back seat arms spread so as to keep himself upright he appeared calm as he leaned forward towards rebus would you kindly mind telling me whats going on am ibeing kidnapped rebus recognised the voice before he remembered the face it was the judge from the watkiss case jesus christ hed run off with a judge only if you are kidnapping me the judge went on perhaps youd allow me to call my wife shell burn the chops otherwise call rebus looked down again below the dashboard between the drivers and front passenger seats there was a neat black carphone do you mind if i use your phone he asked grinning with a face full of adrenalin be my guest rebus grabbed at the contraption and fiddled as he drove his steering becoming more erratic than ever press the button marked trs the judge suggested thank you your honour you know who i am i thought i recognised the face have i had you before me recently but rebus had dialled and was now waiting for the call to be answered it seemed to take forever and meantime the bmw had nipped across an amber traffic light hold tight rebus said baring his teeth the horn was a bansheewail as they pushed past the waiting traffic and flew across the intersection traffic from left and right braking hard one car dented the back of another a motorcycle slewed on the greasy road but they were across the bmw was still in sight less than half a dozen cars ahead now yet still apparently unaware of the pursuing demon finally the call was answered its rebus here then for his passengers sake detective inspector rebus i need to speak to flight is he there there was a long pause the connection crackled wildly as though about to short out altogether rebus gripped the handset between hunched shoulder and angled cheek driving with both hands to take first one bend and then another john where are you flights voice sounded metallic and distant im in a car said rebus a car i commandeered im following chambers hes got lisa frazer with him i dont think she knows hes the wolfman but for christs sake john is he the wolfman ill ask him when i catch him did you send any cars to the old bailey i sent one yes that was generous rebus saw what was ahead oh shit he braked hard but not hard enough the old lady was shuffling slowly across the zebra crossing her shopping trolley a step behind her like a pet poodle rebus swerved but couldnt avoid winging the trolley it flew into the air as though fired from a cannon dispensing groceries as it went eggs butter flour cornflakes raining down on the road rebus heard the woman screaming at worst shed have a broken arm no at worst the shock would kill her oh shit he said again the judge was staring out of the rear window i think shes all right he said john it was flights tincan voice on the line who was that speaking oh said rebus that was the judge its his jaguar ive commandeered he had found the windscreen wiper switch and was letting them deal with the pancake mixture on the windscreen you what so that was what a roar sounded like the bmw was still in sight but it had slowed a little perhaps aware of the incident behind it never mind said rebus look just get some patrol cars up here were on he glanced out of windscreen and side window but could see no street signs high holborn said the judge thanks said rebus were on high holborn george wait a second said flight there was a muffled exchange at his end of the line then he came back on again he sounded tired please john tell me it isnt you behind these reports were getting the switchboards are lighting up like christmas trees thats probably us george we took a bollard out a little way back caused a couple of accidents and now weve just sent an old womans messages flying everywhere yes thats us if flight groaned he did so quietly then what if its not him john what if youre wrong then its all a bit of a ballsup george and ill probably get to see what the inside of a dole office looks like if not a prison cell meanwhile get those coppers down here rebus looked at the handset judge help me how do i just press power rebus did and the illuminated digits faded thanks he said the traffic was slowing a jam of lights up ahead and the judge was saying if you intend using the apparatus again i should probably inform you that it can be used in handsfree mode just dial and leave it in its little compartment there youll be able to hear the caller and theyll be able to hear you rebus nodded his thanks the judges head was close to rebuss ear peering over his shoulder at the road ahead so he said excitedly you think malcolm chambers is behind all these killings thats right and what evidence do you haveinspector rebus laughed and tapped his head just this your lordship just this remarkable said the judge he seemed to be considering something i always thought malcolm was rather an odd young man fine in court ofcourse very much the star prosecutor playing to the gallery and what have you but outside the courtroom he seemed very different oh very different indeed almost sullen as though his mind were wandering his mind had wandered all right thought rebus wandered all the way over the edge would you like to speak to him you think im chasing him for a bet the judge chuckled pointing to the carphone i meant talk to him right now rebus went rigid you mean youve got his number oh yes rebus thought it over but shook his head no he said hes got someone with him an innocent woman i dont want to panic him i see said the judge settling back again yes i suppose youre right i hadnt thought of that and then there was an electric purring inside the car was the phone its display illuminated now and flashing rebus handed the set to the judge probably for you he said drily no said the judge just put it back and press receive rebus did so only then did the judge speak hello the voice was clear the reception signal strong edward is that you following me it was chambers voice sounding amused about some thing the judge stared at rebus who could offer no suggestion for an answer malcolm said the judge his composure intact is that you you should know youre only about twenty yards behind me am i which road are you on the voice altered taking on an edge of sudden viciousness dont fuck with me ted whos driving the fucking car cant be you you havent even got a licence who is it the judge looked to rebus again seeking guidance they listened together in silence and heard lisas faint voice whats going on she was saying whats happening then chamberss voice shut up bitch youll get yours the voice rose a chilling octave sounding like a bad female impersonator making the hairs on rebuss neck bristle youll get yours then it dropped again speaking into the handset hello whos that whos there i can hear you breathing you little shit rebus bit his lip was it better to let chambers know or to stay silent he stayed silent oh well said chambers with a sigh as though resigned to this stalemate out she goes ahead rebus saw the bmws passenger door swing open as the car veered onto the pavement what are you doing screamed lisa no no let me go chambers rebus yelled towards the handset leave her the bmw swerved back into the road the door drifting shut there was a pause hello said chamberss voice to whom am i speaking my names rebus we met at john it was lisas voice very afraid now almost hysterical the sound of the slap was a static crack in rebuss ear i said leave her rebus yelled i know you did said chambers but then youre hardly in a position to give orders anyway now that i know you two know each other that makes things interesting doesnt it inspector you remember me i have an intimate knowledge of everyone on the wolfman case ive taken an interest in it from the start for obvious reasons there was always someone around willing to tell what they knew so you could keep one step ahead one step chambers laughed you flatter yourself so tell me inspector what do we do now do you stop your car edwards car i should say or do i kill your friend here do you know she wanted to ask me about the psychology of court trials she couldnt have picked better could she the little bitch lisa was sobbing rebus could hear her and every sound cut him a little deeper picture in the paper chambers was cooing picture in the paper with the big tough detective rebus knew he had to keep chambers talking by keeping him talking he was keeping lisa alive but the traffic had stalled red lights ahead the bmw only a few cars in front prevented from jumping the lights by another car directly in front of it could he should he even be thinking of it the judge was still gripping rebuss headrest staring out towards the gleaming black car the car that was so close to them so close and so stationary well it was chamberss voice do you pull over inspector or do i kill her rebus was staring hard at chamberss car he could see that lisa was leaning away from chambers as though making to escape but chambers was gripping her with his left arm his right presumably resting on the steeringwheel so the mans attention would be focussed on the passenger side of the car leaving the drivers side unguarded rebus made up his mind and quietly opened his door slipping out onto the reassuringly solid surface of the road horns were sounding around him he paid them no heed the lights were still at red he began to move forward crouching but moving quickly chambers driversside mirrorif chambers looked into it hed have a clear view of rebuss approach make it fast john make it amber shit green he had reached the bmw had gripped the doorhandle chambers looked out at him a stunned expression on his face and then the car in front moved off and chambers gunned the engine the car accelerating forwards tearing itself free of rebus shit car horns all around angry angry drivers rolling down their windows and yelling at him as he ran back to the jaguar started the car moved off the judges hand patted his shoulder good try my boy good try and chambers laughter on the carphone hope i didnt hurt you inspector rebus examined his hand flexed it painfully the fingers had nearly been pulled out of their joints his little finger was swelling already a break perhaps so said chambers for the last time i make you an offer you can hardly refuse stop the car or i kill dr frazer shes not a doctor chambers shes just a student he swallowed now lisa knew that he knew not that it mattered one way or the other not now he took a deep breath kill her he said behind him the judge gasped but rebus shook his head reassuring him what did you say asked chambers i said kill her im not really bothered shes led me a merry little dance this past week its her own fault shes in this deep and after youve killed her ill take great pleasure in killing you mr chambers he heard lisas faint voice again god john please not and then chambers seeming to grow calmer as rebus grew more excited as you wish inspector as you wish the voice was as cold as a mortuary floor any vestige of humanity gone perhaps partly it was rebuss fault taunting him with newspaper stories with fabrications but chambers hadnt picked on rebus he had picked on lisa had rebus arrived a minute later at the old bailey she would be on her way to certain death as it was nothing was certain nothing but the fact of malcolm chamberss madness hes turning onto monmouth street said the judge his voice level he had grasped the fact of chamberss guilt the horror of what had happened and what might still happen rebus heard a flapping sound overhead and glanced up towards where a helicopter was shadowing the chase a police helicopter he could hear sirens too so it seemed could chambers the bmw spurted ahead slashing the side of another car as it squeezed into a space the injured car stopped dead rebus braked pulled on the steeringwheel but still clipped it with his driversside bumper the headlamp shattering sorry about that never mind the car said the judge just dont let him get away he wont get away said rebus with sudden confidence now where the hell had that come from the moment he thought about it it disappeared again leaving behind a quivering vapour they were on st martins lane now people mingling pretheatre or after work the busy west end yet the traffic ahead had thinned for no apparent reason and the crowds gawped as first the bmw then the jaguar sped past as they approached trafalgar square rebus saw to right and left police officers in luminous yellow jackets holding up the traffic in the sidestreets now why would they do that unless road block one entrance to the square left open all exits blocked the square itself kept empty for their arrival in a moment theyd have him god bless you george flight rebus picked up the handset his voice a snarl specks of saliva dotting the windscreen as he spoke stop the car chambers theres no place to go silence they were skidding into trafalgar square now traffic blaring in queues all around them held back by the gloved raised hand of authority rebus was buzzing again the whole west end of london brought to a standstill so that he might race a jaguar against a bmw he could think of friends whod give whole limbs to be in his place yet he had a job to do that was the bottom line it was just another job to be cleared up he might as well have been following teenage cortina thieves through the streets of some edinburgh housingscheme but he wasnt theyd done one full circuit around nelsons column canada house south africa house and the national gallery were just blurs the judge was being thrown n against the door behind rebus hang on rebus called to what pray and rebus laughed he roared with laughter then he realised the line was still open to chamberss bmw he laughed even harder picking up the handset his knuckles white against the steeringwheel left arm aching having fun chambers he yelled like the tv programme used to say theres no hiding place and then the bmw gave a jolt and rebus heard chambers gasp you bitch another jolt and sounds of a struggle lisa was retaliating now that chambers was intent on this speeding circuit without end not get off and a piercing scream two piercing screams both highpitched feminine in their intensity and the black car didnt take the next bend flew straight for the pavement mounted it and bounced into a bus shelter crumpling the metal structure and driving on into the walls of the national gallery itself lisa rebus cried he brought the jaguar to a sudden pivoting stop the drivers door of the bmw creaked open and chambers stumbled out slouching off in a halfrun clutching something in his right hand one leg damaged rebus struggled with his own door finally finding the handle he ran to the bmw and peered in lisa was slumped in the passenger seat a seatbelt passing in a diagonal across her body she was groaning but there were no signs of blood whiplash nothing more serious than whiplash she opened her eyes john youre going to be all right lisa just hang one somebody will be here indeed the police cars were closing in uniforms running into the square rebus looked up from the car seeking chambers there the judge was out of the jaguar and pointing with a rigid arm pointing upwards rebus followed the line to the steps of the national gallery chambers had reached the top step chambers rebus yelled chambers but the body disappeared from view rebus started towards the steps finding his own legs to be less than solid as though rubber instead of bone and cartilage were keeping him upright he climbed the steps and entered the building by its nearest door the exit door a woman in a staff uniform was lying on the ground in the foyer man standing over her the man gestured towards the gallerys interior he ran inside and where malcolm chambers went rebus would surely follow he ran and he ran and he ran the way he used to run from his father running and climbing the steps to the attic hoping to hide but always caught in the end even if he hid all day and half of the night eventually the hunger the thirst would force him back downstairs to where they were waiting his leg hurts and hes cut his face is stinging the warm blood is trickling down his chin down his neck and hes running it wasnt all bad his childhood he remembers his mother delicately snipping away at his fathers nosehairs long nosehairs are so unbecoming in a man it wasnt his fault was it any of it it was theirs theyd wanted a daughter theyd never wanted a son his mother had dressed him in pink in girls colours and girls clothes then had painted him painted him with long blonde curls imagining him into her paintings into her landscapes a little girl running by a riverbank running with bows in her hair running past one guard past two lunging at them the alarm is ringing somewhere maybe its just his imagination all these paintings where have all these paintings come from through one door turn right through another they kept him at home the schools couldnt teach him the way they could home taught home made his father some nights drunk would knock over his mothers canvases and dance on them art fuck art hed do his little dance with a chuckle in his throat and all the time his mother would sit with her face in her hands and cry then run to her room and bolt shut the door those were the nights when his father would stumble through to his bedroom just for a cuddle sweet alcoholic breath just for at cuddle and then more than a cuddle so very much more open wide just like the dentist tells you christ it hurt so much a probing finger tongue the wrenching open and even worse was the noise the dull grunting the loud nasal breathing and thenthe sham pretending it had been just a game that was all and to prove it his father would bend down and take a big soft bite out of his stomach growling like a bear blowing a raspberry on the bare flesh and then a laugh you see it was only a game wasnt it no never a game never running to the attic to the garden to squeeze behind the shed where the stinging nettles were even their bite was not so bad as his fathers had his mother known of course she had known once when he had tried to tell her in a whispered moment she had refused to listen no not your father youre making it up malcolm but her paintings had grown more violent the fields now were purple and black the water bloodred the figures on the riverbank had grown skeletal painted stark white like ghosts hed hidden it all so well for so long but then shed come back to him and now he was mostly she consumed by her and by her need for not revenge it couldnt really be called revenge something deeper than revenge some huge and hungry need without a name without a form only a function oh yes a function this way and that the people in the gallery make way for him the alarm is ringing still theres a hissing in his head like a childs rattle sss ssssss sssssssss these paintings he is running past theyre laughable long nosehairs johnny none mimicked real life and less so the life beneath none could ape the grim caveman thoughts of every human being on the planet but then he pushes open another door and its all so very different a room of darkness and shadowplay of skulls and frowning bloodless faces yes this is how it is velazquez el greco the spanish painters skull and shadow ah velazquez why couldnt his mother have painted like this when they died together in bed agas leak the police said the child was lucky to be alive lucky hisown bedroom window had been open a couple of inches when they had died all hed taken with him from the house had been her paintings every single one of them only a game long nosehairs johnny snipping with the scissors his father asleep hed pleaded with his eyes pleaded with her to stick the point of the scissors into his fathers fleshy noiseless throat shed been so gentle snip so kind and gentle snip the child was lucky what could they know rebus walked up the stairs and through the bookshop other officers were close behind him he motioned for them to spread out there would be no escape but he also warned them to keep their distance malcolm chambers was his the first gallery was large with red walls a guard pointed through the doorway on the right and rebus strode towards it by the side off the doorway a painting showed a headless corpse spouting blood the painting mirrored rebuss thoughts so well that he smiled grimly there were spots of rustcoloured blood on the orange carpet but even without these he would have had no difficulty following chambersstrail the tourists and attendants stood back from him pointing showing him the way the alarm bell was bright and sharp focusing his mind his legs had become solid once again and his heart pumped blood so loudly he wondered if others could hear it he took a right from a small corner room into another large gallery at the far end of which stood a set of hefty wooden and glass doors near them another attendant stood nursing a wounded arm there was a bloody handprint on one door rebus stopped and looked through into the room itself in the furthest corner slouched on the floor sat the wolfman directly above him on the wall was a painting of a monastic figure the face cowled and in shadow the figure looked to be praying to heaven the figure was holding a skull a smear of blood ran down and past the skull rebus pushed open the door and walked into the room next to this painting was another of the virgin mary with stars around what was left of her head a large hole had been punched through her face the figure beneath the paintings was still and silent rebus took a few paces forward he glanced to his left and saw that on the opposite wall were portraits of unhappy looking noblemen they had every right to be unhappy slashes in each canvas almost ripped their heads from their bodies he was close now close enough to see that the painting next to malcolm chambers was a velazquez the immaculate conception rebus smiled again immaculate indeed and then malcolm chamberss head jerked up the eyes were cold the face stippled with glass from the bmws windscreen the voice when it spoke was dull and tired inspector rebus rebus nodded though it had not been a question i wonder chambers said why my mother never brought me here i dont remember being taken anywhere except perhaps madame tussauds have you ever been to madame tussauds inspector i like the chamber of horrors my mother wouldnt even come in with me he laughed and leaned against the footrail behind him ready to push himself to his feet i shouldnt have torn those paintings should i he was saying they were probably priceless silly really theyre only paintings after all why should paintings be priceless rebus had reached out a hand to help him up at the same time he saw the portraits again slashed not torn slashed like the attendants arm not by human hand but with an instrument too late the small kitchenknife in chamberss hand was already pushing through rebuss shirt chambers had leapt to his feet and was propelling rebus backwards back towards the portraits on the far wall chambers was infused with the strength of madness rebus felt his feet catch on the footrail behind him his head fell back against one painting thudding into the wall he had his own right hand clasped around chamberss knifehand now so that the tip of the knife was still gouging at his stomach but could go no deeper he jerked a knee into chamberss groin at the same time jamming the heel of his left hand into chamberss nose there was a squeal as the pressure lessened on the knife rebus twisted chamberss wrist trying to shake free the knife but chamberss grip held fast upright again away from the wall now they wrestled for control of the knife chambers was crying howling the sound chilled rebus even as he grappled with the man it was like fighting with darkness itself unwanted thoughts sped through his mind crammed tube trains child molesters beggars blank faces punks and pimps as everything hed seen and experienced in london washed over him in a final rolling wave he dare not look into chamberss face for fear that he would freeze the paintings all around were blurs of blue black and grey as he danced this macabre dance feeling chambers growing stronger and himself growing more tired tired and dizzy the room spinning a dullness coursing through his stomach towards the hole made by the knife the knife which is moving now moving with newfound power a power rebus feels unable to counter with anything more than a grimace he dares himself to look at chambers does so and sees the eyes staring at him like a bulls the mouth set defiantly the chin jutting there is more than defiance there more than madness there is a resolution rebus feels it as the knifehand turns turns one hundred and eighty degrees and then he is being pushed backwards again chambers is rearing up driving him on powerful as an engine until rebus slams into another wall followed by chambers himself it is almost an embrace the bodies seemingly intimate in their contact chambers is heavy a dead weight his cheek rests against rebuss until rebus recovering his breath pushes the body away chambers staggers backwards into the room the knife buried in his chest all the way up to the hilt he angles his head to look down dark blood dribbling from the corners of his mouth he touches at the handle of the knife then looks up at rebus and smiles almost apologetically so unbecoming in a man then falls to his knees trunk falls forward head hits carpet and stays like that rebus is breathing hard he pushes himself up from the wall walks to the centre of the room and pushes atthe body with the toe of his shoe tipping chambers sideways the face looks peaceful despite the welts of blood rebus touches two fingers to the front of his own shirt they come away moist with blood that didnt matter what mattered was that the wolfman had turned out to be human after all human and mortal mortal and dead if he wanted to rebus knew he could take the credit he didnt want the credit hed get them to take away the knife and check it for fingerprints they would find only chamberss that didnt mean much of course the likes of flight would still think rebus had killed him but rebus hadnt killed the wolfman and he couldnt be sure exactly what had cowardice guilt or something deeper something never to be explained so unbecoming in a man what kind of obituary was that john it was flights voice behind him stood two officers armed with pistols no need for silver bullets george said rebus he stood there surrounded by what he supposed would be millions of pounds worth of damaged works of art alarm bells ringing while outside the traffic in central london would be backed up for miles until trafalgar square could be opened again i told you itd be easy he said lisa frazer was fine shock a few bruises whiplash the hospital wanted to keep her in overnight just to be sure they wanted to keep rebus in too but he refused they gave him painkillers instead and three stitches in his stomach the cut they said was fairly superficial but it was best to be safe the thread they used was thick and black by the time he arrived at chamberss huge twostorey flat in islington the place was crawling with police forensics photographers and the usual retinue the reporters outside were desperate for a quote some recognising him from the impromptu conference he had given outside the house on copperplate street but he pushed past them and into the wolfmans lair john how are you it was george flight looking bemused by the days proceedings he had placed a hand on rebuss shoulder rebus smiled im fine george what have you found they were standing in the main hall flight glanced back into one of the rooms off this hall you wont believe it he said im still not sure i do there was a tang of whisky on flights breath the celebrations had begun already rebus walked to the door and into the room this was where the photographers and forensics people were busiest a tall man rose to his feet from behind a sofa and looked across to rebus it was philip cousins he smiled and nodded near him stood isobel penny sketchbook in hand but rebus noticed that she wasnt drawing and her face had lost all traces of liveliness even she it seemed could still be shocked the scene was certainly shocking but worst of all was the smell the smell and the buzzing of flies one wall was covered in what had been paintings very crudely done paintings as even rebus could tell but now they had been slashed into tatters some of which lay across the floor and on the opposite wall was as much graffiti as would befit any tower block in churchill estate venomous stuff fuck art feel the poor kill pigs the stuff of madness there were two bodies thrown casually behind the sofa and a third lying under a table as though some rudimentary effort had been made to tidy them out of sight carpet and walls were stained with fine sprays of blood and the cloying smell told rebus that at least one of the bodies had been here for several days easy to confront this now now that it was at an end not so easy to work out the why that was what worried flight i just cant find a motive john i mean chambers had everything why the hell did he need to i mean why would he just they were in the flatslivingroom no clues were being offered up chamberss private life seemed as tidy and innocuous as the rest of his home just that one room that one secret corner that apart they might have been in any successful barristers apartment poring over his books his desk his correspondence his computer files it didnt really bother rebus it wouldnt bother him supposing they never found out why he shrugged wait till the biographys published george said rebus maybe then youll get your answer or ask a psychologist he thought to himself he didnt doubt there would be plenty of theories but flight was shaking his head rubbing at his head his face his neck he still couldnt believe it had come to an end rebus touched a hand to his arm their eyes met rebus nodded slowly then winked you should have been in that jag george it was magic flight managed to pull a smile out of the air tell that to the judge he said tell that to the judge rebus ate that night at george flights home a meal cooked by marion so at last they were having the promised dinner together but it was a fairly sombre occasion enlivened only by an interview with some art historian on the latenight news he was talking about the damage to the paintings in the national gallerys spanish room such pointless waste vandalism sheer wanton priceless perhaps irreparable thousands of pounds heritage blab blah blah said flight sneeringly at least you can patch up a bloody painting these people talk half the time out of their arses george sorry marion said flight sheepishly he glanced towards rebus who winked back at him later after she had gone to bed the two men sat together drinking a final brandy ive decided to retire said flight marions been nagging me for ages my healths not what it wasnot serious i hope flight shook his head no nothing like that but theres a security firm theyve offered to take me on more money nine till five you know how it is rebus nodded hed seen some of the best of his elders drawn like moths to a lightbulb when security firms and the like came to call he drained his glass when will you be leaving flight asked i thought id go back tomorrow i can come back down again when they need me to give evidence flight nodded next time you come weve got a spare bedroom here thanks george rebus rose to his feet ill drive you back said flight but rebus shook his head call me a cab he insisted i dont want you done for d and d think what it would do to your pension flight stared into his brandy glass youve got a point he said okay then a cab it is he slipped a hand into his pocket by the way ive got you a little present he held the clenched fist out to rebus who placed his own open palm beneath it a slip of paper dropped from flights hand into his rebus unfolded the note it was an address rebus looked up at flight and nodded his understanding thanks george he said no rough stuff eh john no rough stuff agreed rebus family he slept deeply that night but woke at six the next morning and sat up in bed immediately his stomach hurt a burning sensation as though he had just swallowed a measure of spirits the doctors had told him not to drink alcohol last night he had drunk just the one glass of wine and two glasses of brandy he rubbed the area around the wound willing the ache to go away then took two more painkillers with a glass of tapwater before dressing and putting on his shoes his taxi driver though sleepy was full of tales of yesterdays action i was on whitehall wasnt i an hour and a quarter in the cab before the traffic got moving again hour and a bleedin quarter didnt see the chase either but i heard the smash rebus sat back in silence all the way to the block of flats in bethnal green he paid the driver and looked again at the slip of paper flight had given him number fourth floor flat six the elevator smelled of vinegar a crumpled paper package in one corner was oozing undercooked chips and a tailend of batter flight was right it made all the difference having a good network of informers itmade for quick information but what a good coppers network could get so too could a good villains rebus hoped hed be in time he walked quickly across the small landing from the open lift to the door of one of the flats where two empty milk bottles stood to attention in a plastic holder he picked up one bottle and hurried back to the lift just as its doors were shuddering to a close to place the milk bottle in the remaining gap the doors stayed where they were so did the lift you never knew when a quick getaway would be needed then he walked along the narrow corridor to flat six braced himself against the wall and kicked at the doorhandle with the heel of his shoe the door flew open and he walked into a stuffy hall another door another kick and he was face to face with kenny watkiss watkiss had been asleep on a mattress on the floor he was standing now clad only in underpants and shivering against the furthest wall from the door he pushed his hair back when he saw who it was jee jesus he stammered what are you doing here hello kenny said rebus stepping into the room i thought wed have a little chat what about you didnt get as frightened as kenny watkiss was by having your door kicked in at half past six in the morning you only got that frightened by the idea of who was doing it and why about uncle tommy uncle tommy kenny watkiss smiled unconvincingly he moved back to the mattress and started pulling on a pair of torn denims what about him what are you so scared of kenny whyare you hiding hiding that smile again who said i was hiding rebus shook hishead his own smile one of apparent sympathy i feel sorry for you kenny really i do i see your kind a hundred times a week all ambition and no brain all talk but no guts ive only been in london a week and already i know how to find you when i want you do you think tommy cant you think maybe hell lay off no hes going to nail your head to the wall dont talk daft now that he was dressed having pulled on a black tshirt kennys voice had lost some of its trembling but he couldnt hide the look in his eyes the haunted hunted look rebus decided to make it easy for him he reached into a pocket and brought out a packet of cigarettes offered one to kenny and lit it for him before taking one himself he rubbed at his stomach jesus it was hurting he hoped the stitches were holding youve been ripping him off rebus said casually he handled stolen goods you were his courier passing it down the chain but youve been skimming a little off the top havent you and with each job youd take a little more than he knew about why saving for that docklands flat so you could start your own business maybe you got greedy i dont know but tommy got suspicious you were in court that day because you wanted to see him go down it was the only thing that could have saved you when he didnt you still tried putting one over on him yelling out from the public gallery but by then it was only a matter of time and when you heard that the case had been dropped altogether well you knew hed come straight after you so you ran you didnt run far enough kenny whats it to you the words were angry but it was the anger that came of fear it wasnt directed at rebus he was merely the messenger just this rebus said calmly keep away from sammy dont ever go near her again dont even try to talk to her in fact your best bet right now is to get on a train or a bus or whatever and get the hell out of london dont worry well pin tommy for something sooner or later then maybe you can come back he had slipped a hand into his pocket again it came out holding a fold of ten pound notes four of which he peeled off and threw onto the mattress im offering you a oneway ticket and im suggesting you take it right now this morning the eyes and voice were wary youre not going to take me in why should if the smile this time was more confident still he looked at the money its just family rebus thats all i can take care of myself can you rebus nodded taking in the room with its peeling wallpaper and boardedup window the mattress with its single rumpled sheet fair enough he turned to go it wasnt just me you know rebus stopped but didnt turn what he tried not to sound interested there was a copper too he was on a cut from the robberies rebus sucked in air did he need to know did he want to know kenny watkiss didnt give him the choice a detective called lamb he said rebus exhaled silently but saying nothing showing nothing walked back out of the flat and pulling open the lift doors kicking away the milk bottle pressed the button for the ground floor and waited for the slow descent outside the block he paused to stub out his cigarette he rubbed at his stomach again stupid not to have brought the painkillers with him from the corner of his eye he could see the unmarked transit van in the car park six fortyfive there could be a perfectly rational explanation for it for the fact that two men sat stonily in its front seats they might be about to go to work mightnt they in fact rebus knew damned fine thats what they were doing and he had another choice now he could let them go to work or he could stop them it took him another second or two to decide but finally with a picture of samanthas face in his head he walked across nonchalantly to the van and the men still ignoring his existence thumped hard on the passengerside window the passenger looked at him with undisguised enmity but seeing that rebus was undeterred rolled down the window yeah rebus stuck his id so far into the mans face that the plastic coating brushed against his nose police he snapped now get the fuck out of here and tell tommy watkiss weve got his nephew under twentyfour hour watch anything happens well know where to come and who to charge rebus stood back and looked carefully at the man think you can remember all that or do you want me to write it down the passenger was growling audibly as he rolled the window back up the driver was already starting the van as it began to move off rebus gave its side a farewell kick maybe kenny would leave and maybe hed stay it was up to him rebus had given him a chance whether the young man took it or not was out of rebuss hands like pontius pilate he mumbled to himself as he made for the main road standing by a lamppost waiting and praying for a black cab to come along he saw kenny watkiss emerge from the flats a duffelbag slung across his shoulder and looking around him start to jog towards the far end of the estate rebus nodded to himself thats my boy he said as with protesting brakes a cab slowed to a halt beside him youre in luck mate said the driver im just starting my shift rebus clambered in and gave the name of his hotel then settled back enjoying the city at this quiet hour the driver though was in practice for the day ahead here he said did you hear about that rumpus yesterday at trafalgar square i was in a queue for an hour and a half i mean im all for law and order but there mustve been anotherway of going about it mustnt there john rebus shook his head and laughed his suitcase sat closed on the bed beside the littleused briefcase and the bag of books he was squeezing the last few items into his sports bag when there was a soft tapping at his door come in she did she was wearing a solidfoam neckbrace but grinned it away isnt it stupid they want me to wear it for the next few days but i she saw the cases on the bed youre not leaving already rebus nodded i came here to help with the wolfman case the wolfman case is finished but what about he turned to her what about us he guessed she lowered her eyes thats a good question lisa you lied to me you werent trying to help you were trying to get your bloody phd im sorry she said me too i mean i can understand why you did it why you think you had to do it really i can but that doesnt make it any better she straightened her back and nodded fair enough then she said so inspectorrebus if all i was doing was using you why did i come here straight from the hospital he zipped shut the bag it was a good question because you got found out he said no she said that was bound to happen eventually try again he shrugged his shoulders oh she said sounding disappointed i was hoping you could tell me im not really sure myself he turned towards her again and saw that she was smiling she looked so stupid in the neckbrace that he had to return the smile eventually and when she came towards him he returned her hug too ouch she said not too hard john so he relaxed his muscles a little and they kept on hugging he was actually feeling mellow the painkillers had seen to that anyway he said at last you werent much help she pulled away from him he was still smiling but archly what do you mean i mean all that stuff we talked about in the restaurant all those index cards rebus recited the list thwarted ambition victims from a social class above the killer no confrontation he scratched his chin none of it fits malcolm chambers i wouldnt say that weve still got to look at his home life his background she sounded defiant rather than merely defensive and i was right about the schizophrenia so youll still do your project she tried to nod it wasnt easy of course she said theres plenty of work to be done on chambers believe me there must be clues there somewhere in his past he must have left something well let me know what you find out john before he died did he say anything rebus smiled nothing important he said nothing important after shed gone after the promises of return trips and of weekends in edinburgh promises of postcards and phone calls he took his luggage down to reception george flight was at the desk rebus put his key down next to where flight was signing his name to several forms do you realise how much this hotel costs flight said not looking up next time you visit you really will have to bunk at my place then he glanced towardsrebus but i suppose you were worth it he finished with the forms and handed them to the receptionist who checked them before nodding that everything was in order you know the address to send them to flight called back as the two men started towards the hotels swingdoors i really must get the lock on the boot fixed flight said shutting the cars back door on rebuss luggage then where to kings cross rebus nodded with one slight detour he said the detour in flights words turned out to be more than slight they parked across from rhonas flat in gideon park and flight pulled on the handbrake going in he said rebus had been thinking about it but shook his head what could he tell sammy nothing that would help if he said hed seen kenny shed only accuse him of scaring him off no best leave it george he said could you maybe have someone drop in and tell her kennys left london but stress that hes okay that hes not in trouble i dont want him lingering too long in her memory flight was nodding ill do it myself he said have you seen him yet i went this morning and and i was just in time but i reckon hell be all right flight studied the face next to him i think i believe you he said just one thing yes kenny told me one of your men is involved the babyfaced redneck lamb thats the one hes on tommy watkisss payroll according to kenny flight pursed his lips and was silent for a moment i think i believe that too he said at last very quietly dont worry john ill deal with it rebus said nothing he was still staring out at the windows of rhonas flat willing sammy to come to one of them and see him no not see him just so that he might see her but there was no one at home the ladies were out for the day with tim or tony or graeme or ben and it was none of rebuss business anyway lets go he said so flight drove him to kings cross drove him through streets paved with nothing so very different from any other city streets ancient and modem breathing with envy and excitement and with evil not much evil perhaps but enough evil after all was pretty well a constant he thanked god that it touched so few lives he thanked god that his friends and family were safe and he thanked god he was going home what are you thinking about flight asked as they idled at yet another set of traffic lights nothing said rebus he was still thinking about nothing when he boarded the busy inter city and sat down with his newspapers and his magazines as the train was about to move off someone squeezed into the seat opposite him and deposited four large cans of strong lager on the table the youth was tall and hardlooking with shorn hair he glared at rebus and turned up his personal cassette player tscchhtscchhtscchh it went so loud rebus could almost make out the words the youth was grasping a ticket denoting edinburgh as his destination he put the ticket down and pulled on a ringpull rebus shook his head wearily and smiled his own personal hell as the train pulled away he caught its rhythm and beat that rhythm out silently in his head fytp fytp fytp fytp fytp fytp all the way home the end
