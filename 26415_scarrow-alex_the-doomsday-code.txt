alex scarrow the doomsday code fact the voynich manuscript is a very real document written in an unidentifiable language that dates from the middle ages fact despite numerous attempts by codebreakers and computer decryption software the manuscripts code has yet to be broken fact the source of the robin hood legend remains a mystery fact the true identity of the sheriff of nottingham at the time of king richards return from the crusades is uncertain prologue chicago so ladies and gentlemen said the man this is what you all came to see in just a moment im going to step inside that faraday cage and disappear right so he is just another fruitcake anna lopez shook her head thats all i need her eyes met one or two of the other members of the small audience journalists like her she recognized a few faces a reporter who covered science and environment issues for one of the euro news digistations a science editor for a stamfordbased technology eperiodical theyd all received the small vanillacoloured invitation card last week with just a few words of explanation printed on it an invitation to come down to a place called larkhams gallery to witness the demonstration of a technology that is going to change the lives of every man woman and child on this troubled planet anna lopez sighed the world could sure do with a bit of good news larkhams gallery sounded nice like a nice little boutique gallery where thered hopefully be wine and nice little savoury things on silver trays being offered around instead they were sitting on three rows of uncomfortable plastic school chairs in a grimlooking warehouse with a fizzing strip light overhead and the echoing tap tap tap of rainwater dripping through somewhere the cage itself takes the charge and will distribute it evenly around me creating a space big enough for me to to what make you vanish called out someone from the row behind my kid can do that trick with his old chuckle cheese magic set someone snorted coffee into their styrofoam cup no said the man on the stage anna had forgotten his name again she looked down at the scribbled notes on her tpad waldstein even the name sounded corny no he snapped silencing a ripple of laughter this isnt a party trick anna raised her hand mr waldstein uhh yes you say youre going to vanish waldstein nodded i will be transported elsewhere for a period of no more than a minute uhhuh transported she nodded where exactly he grinned pushing frizzy coils of saltandpeppercoloured hair out of his face to reveal eyes as wide as a childs behind the glint of his glasses another moment in time he announced theatrically behind her she heard a chair scrape the cold concrete floor and someone mutter idiot and the receding clack of footsteps either side of her she could hear and see the other journalists shuffle awkwardly time the poor deluded old fool seemed to be talking about time travel she decided he was clearly in need of some sort of help perhaps he needed to be in a place with padded mintgreen walls and soothing music other chairs began to scrape noisily it looked like this madmans pitiful little charade was over already she almost felt sorry for him dont go waldstein shouted please stop right there the footsteps stopped ill show you right now anna watched him huddle over a wobbly picnic table on his makeshift stage of stacked wooden pallets he tapped the keys of a battered and beaten old laptop beneath the table was something that looked like a copper boiler cables snaking in one end and out the other and over towards a tall wire cage she heard the low hum of power surging inside the copper device and the lights in the warehouse began to dim it was then that it occurred to her the fools little contraption was drawing mains electricity oh my god hes going to fry himself right here right in front of us waldstein stepped smartly over the cables and opened the door of the wire cage just you watch she stood up mr waldstein i think you should waldstein stepped inside and slammed the cage shut with a loud clang that echoed around the warehouse the humming was growing louder ladies and gentlemen waldsteins voice rose to a shout over the noise youre about to witness the very first journey through time mr waldstein anna stepped forward please you should stop this she noticed that one of the digistation journalists had pushed his way through the chairs and was filming the cage with his palmcam she shook her head with disgust no doubt the sicko was hoping to catch the whole thing catch this poor deluded froot loop frying himself like a potato chip jesus waldstein was smiling calmly at her through the wire dont worry my dear im going to be just fine he called out above the increasing hum of power building up towards a discharge please cried anna surprised at the sound of panic in her voice please just get out waldsteins smile was almost reassuring ill be fine my dear im going to see them again im going to see them touch them them who whatre you talking about she shouted but her words were getting lost amid the growing din suddenly sparks began to dance along the wires of the cage stand back shouted someone she realized the charge could quite easily arc across the space towards them instinctively she stumbled backwards several steps bumping into an empty chair barking her ankle painfully the chairs were all empty now everyone was on their feet she could hear someone calling for the police no one came here tonight so they could watch a man voluntarily cook himself not even a crazy and there were enough crazies out there these days sparks sputtered from the cage and showered on to the floor the strip lights across the warehouse ceiling fizzed popped and went out leaving them in a darkness lit only by the strobing flash of waldsteins electrical execution she could still see his silhouette in there perfectly still amid the curtain of sparks still calm not the thrashing and convulsing marionette shed expected to see by now then with a soft pop not a bang but a pop and a gentle puff of displaced air it all stopped the sparks the humming of power the fizz and crackle of raw electrical energy all still and silent in the complete darkness she could hear the ragged breathing of everyone around her somebody better call an ambulance she heard a man utter a torch snapped on and the beam swung round on to the cage my god where is he it was empty just as hed assured them it would be hed vanished anna felt a surge of relief she found herself laughing giddily ill be she shook her head well thats what he said right not everyone else seemed quite so relieved and amused by the spectacle i didnt come here tonight just to see a magic show ive got articles to file ya know real work not this kind of insane crud a ribbon of sparks suddenly flickered along the wire of the cage whoa stand back everyone its still live anna expected a repeat performance to begin to cover his arrival back in the cage smoke and mirrors thats what magicians call it the art of distraction but instead through the wire she could see a faint ghostly glow at first a pinprick but quickly it expanded in diameter to several feet across shimmering and undulating like water how she imagined ghostly ectoplasm might look if that kind of supernatural nonsense was for real what is that someone uttered the torch flicked off allowing them to see the ethereal glow more clearly anna shook her head in the dark as if the question had been addressed to her personally no idea she replied in the faint swirling light she thought she could detect a vaguely human shape perhaps shapes plural something in there someone some people an outline gradually became more distinct as if drawing closer anna had the definite impression that the faint glow was somewhere else as if had the wire mesh not been in the way she could have stepped forward and reached inside and touched another place almost as if it was a shimmering wavering doorway to another she caught herself what really seriously this is insane she whispered to herself the distinct form was human she could see that clearly now it seemed to be shuffling forward towards her beginning to block out the swirling light of this other place then all of a sudden the ghostly light was gone it was dark in the pitchblack she felt a puff of air on her face flicking a tress of hair into her eye she brushed it aside there was something inside the cage she could hear it breathing fluttering irregular gasping coming through the mesh hello she whispered waldstein is is that you in there the breathing remained unchanged whos got that torch said someone behind her get it on the cage she heard someone fussing with something cursing as they fumbled for a switch too subtle for its own good waldstein whispered anna you all right the breathing faltered and stopped in answer to her question get the torch on im trying i cant find the where is it the poor man in the cage started to say something quietly anna leaned forward finally brave enough to press against the wire mesh it was still warm from carrying the electrical charge but not hot and thankfully not live you ok in there i ive sseen it its all right were going to get you out and then well get an ambulance i ive seen it his voice rasped then behind her the torch snapped back on and shadows danced in all directions hes in shock said anna get the light on him the beam swung down over her shoulder casting a gridwork of leaping shadows around the warehouse through the wire she could make out the man shed seen moments ago the man shed thought needed medication and a nice comfortable padded cell in which to live out his delusion no burnt human carcass that much was a relief but his face his face those eyes beneath the frizzy lunatic hair and behind those madman spectacles were still round and wide but not with the childlike wonder and excitement hed been exhibiting before not any more it was terror sheer terror the look of a mind utterly closed down to protect itself from insanity at that moment she realized tonight had been no parlour trick no stage magician looking for an audience looking for publicity hes been somewhere hes actually been somewhere and for some reason she had a feeling hed been gone far longer than a minute what asked anna lopez softly what just happened his gaze faraway perhaps still looking upon another place seemed to gradually return slowly catching up with the rest of his body to arrive back in chicago his eyes focused on her a gradual realization that he wasnt alone that someone was just on the other side of the wire mesh i his mouth opened dry and cracked lips i ive sseen the end behind her she could hear someone making a call phoning an ambulance maybe some of them were hearing him she noticed the sicko with the camera was still filming maybe he was disappointed not to have a smoking corpse to show his editor maybe this mans insane babbling was going to be an even better story to file waldstein uttered anna what do you mean the end she realized he was crying a tear rolled down his cheek and soaked into the bristles of his beard the lost faraway look was finally gone his eyes were on her he suddenly looked around the cage my god this is this has all got to go what you mean your machine he slammed a palm into the wire cage and it rang and rattled echoing around the warehouse this time travel its its going to destroy us chapter new york alone maddy watched a cluster of seagulls picking away at some rubbish tipped on to the lowtide silt of the east river overhead traffic clunked rhythmically across the williamsburg bridge the endofday madhour rush of city workers returning from manhattan back to brooklyn she tossed a small nugget of tarmac into the water and watched the seagulls scatter at the sound of the splash my god her mind was still spinning with the idea my god liam is foster thats what the old man had said wasnt it that he and liam were the same person that he was once liam and now hed said it she could see he was right she could see the likeness in their faces in their mannerisms even in the way they talked time travel did this to me time travel aged me maddy hed said the fact that liam was going to become that poor old man something else for her to keep to herself until she figured that liam was ready to hear it she felt so lonely harbouring secrets like this it separated her from the other two it felt wrong after all theyd been recruited together her liam sal the three of them plucked from different times from the very last seconds of their lives by the old man they should be a team there shouldnt be secrets between them not ones like this youre the team leader now foster had told her its down to you how and when you tell liam about this she watched the seagulls cautiously return to peck and pull at the plastic bags on the silt just great she muttered to herself something else to churn away inside her keep her awake at night because it wasnt just the fosterisliam thing was it oh no there was that other thing that scribbled message shed found at their supply drop point the one for her eyes only maddy look out for pandora were running out of time be safe and tell no one she wondered what she was freakin well supposed to make of that it meant nothing to her pandora what was that apart from being a pretty stupid girls name why does it have to be me her soft voice caused a strutting seagull nearby to pause and cock its head at her im not talking to you dumb bird the seagull resumed its scavenging one beady black eye still warily on her she watched lights flickering on in manhattan as the sun began to settle behind the two tall pillars of the world trade center foster recruited you for a reason foster put you in charge for a reason because he knows youre smart enough to figure things out maddy she sighed shed really like to believe that that she was destined to be a good team leader a good timerider but somehow with the way things had gone so far it all just felt as if shed been winging it hanging in there by the skin of her teeth lucky not to be dead or to have caused the deaths of liam and sal lucky not to have completely messed up the timeline lucky not to have destroyed the world way too much stress for an eighteenyearold girl to have to be burdened with darn right she uttered way too much chapter new york monday time cycle im watching him now floating in that tube of gloopy slimy stuff its bob but not bob yet if you know what i mean its a boy actually completely hairless and curled up like a baby you can see the face is definitely him even though its not finished yet all thick bone and that heavy dumblooking brow the skins not grown on his head just yet its all redraw muscle fibre and teeth and two eyeballs that look huge without eyelids sometimes they seem to shift twitch as if theyre staring at you but i know hes not his baby mind is fast asleep right now dreaming whatever baby brains dream some firstphase skin has grown across his body but i can still see patches where it hasnt theres a bit i can see through just beneath his left arm where i can still see the ribs and i think thats an organ in there is it his heart or something its moving like an animal in a cage actually this is making me feel sick i guess im going back to my bunk speaking of pukemaking liams emptying the toilet right now we got one of these camping toilet things a few days ago the archway has got a little toilet closet with a creaky wooden door and a cracked toilet bowl with no seat its totally pinchudda and its not connected up anyway so thats why we needed the camping toilet it has to be emptied every few days cos it stinks the whole place out when the plastic barrel thing gets pulled out the back of the toilet comes out and all that stuff inside is sloshing around shaddyah my turn next time anyway so were going on a trip soon somewhere special you want to know ill tell you tomorrow were going to sunday thats right were coming out of the loop and going to the sunday before it itll be my first time travel well no i suppose when foster grabbed me from home and took me back here that was my first time but i didnt understand then what was going on and of course every time the field resets im sort of travelling back fortyeight hours in time right but doing this stepping into the portal thats like the real thing really being a time traveller ill be stepping through a hole in space and time through a moment of chaos space liam says its weird like all milky white and foggy and theres creepy movement in there and you cant see what it is but he says it all happens so quickly and youre out the other side before you know it so not to worry great thanks for telling me about the creepymovey things liam so im sort of nervous but excited too cos were going to see this rock band called esszed maddy says they disappeared after just vanished theyre kind of like meant to be famous for that or something so this even though they dont know it this is their last ever gig maddy reckons ill really like them she played some of their tracks on the computer theyre total ripheavy she says liam will probably hate them and moan about it not being real music but just noise not the sort of ditty hes used to lol education a field trip thats what shes calling it useful for becks to get a little more experience playing at being human she needs it shes too serious and robotic whereas bob was dumb you could pretend he was just an idiot but becks is too sortof cold she freaks me a bit when she stares its like shes looking at you and figuring out the three fastest ways to kill you with nothing but her thumb i think i preferred bob chapter new york the portal shimmered in the middle of the archway a perfect sphere of energy and in the middle of it a hint of the ghostly wavering world of a whole fortyeight hours ago sunday night a flickering of neon light and what looked like a twisting undulating stretch of graffiticovered brick wall dancing through a heathaze come on then sal said maddy quickly through sal swallowed back a throatful of nerves and nodded yes all right im ready she stepped forward feeling the energy lift the hairs on her arms lift her fringe like a theatre curtain it tickles stepping inside the sphere of energy she could feel the concrete floor beginning to flex beneath her feet like the canvas of a trampoline somebody else was already jumping up and down on then very quickly it softened and sagged like tissue paper and then all of a sudden the floor was completely gone jahulla im falling she yelped as her arms and legs flailed and she felt herself tumbling through air dont worry about it she heard liams voice say but already it sounded like it had been shouted down a long long tunnel distant echoes fast receding then it was gone liam she cried but her own voice sounded dampened and swallowed up i really am alone just like hed said here she was floating or falling through an ocean of featureless white like a nugget of breakfast cereal seesawing down through an impossibly large bowl of milk stay calm sal swirling featureless white all around her she held her hand up only a dozen inches away from her face and it was so faint fogged by the mist she waved it around and felt the air as thick as liquid resist her movements she looked up hoping to see the faint form of one of the others flailing above her but she saw nothing but more white maybe i am all alone she wondered whether she was in her very own milkcoloured universe or whether the others were out there somewhere perhaps nearby perhaps just beyond sight she wondered if anyone ever got lost in here never to emerge at the other end doomed to spend eternity swirling and flailing youd go insane wouldnt you with nothing to see hear smell or feel youd go completely insane she decided it was probably best not to think about this kind of stuff but then her mind had more unwelcome questions it wanted to ask what if thats what the creepymovey things are other travellers maybe even other timeriders whove lost their way got stuck here for eternity she could all too easily conjure up the image of another girl just like her lost for endless centuries in here eyes fogged by madness opaque like those of a boiled fish and cackling like an old woman a mind rubbed smooth of meaningful thought and left utterly utterly insane this really isnt helping stupid think of something else she decided shed rather she was on her own catching a glimpse of something out there faint and moving was the last thing she needed to see right now so she closed her eyes almost as soon as shed done that she felt the ground suddenly return beneath her feet whuh she opened her eyes to see she was standing in a small car park lit faintly by a neon red budweiser beer sign that buzzed like an angry fly in a bottle she took a step clear of the portal and a moment later liam maddy and becks emerged one after the other that was horrible she gasped under her breath first times the worst so liam grinned apologetically maybe i shouldve warned you she could hear a deep rhythmic pumping sound coming from somewhere beyond the brick wall in front of her to her left the wall continued past an alcove where cars were parked so tightly in a row side by side she wondered how any of the drivers had managed to get out the wall came to an end overlooking a dimly lit backstreet where she could see the impatient shifting outline of a queue of people oh it sounds like theyve started playing already said maddy come on guys lets get inside chapter sherwood forest nottinghamshire snow fell softly and silently on the track ahead of them floating down from a loaded grey sky above like cherry blossom on either side of the forest trail tall thick evergreens sported fulsome white skirts that weighed their burdened branches down low sir geoffrey rainault tugged at the cloak slipping down his shoulders begrudging the body warmth that escaped with the movement between saddlesore legs his mount his favourite edith plodded relentlessly and wearily a beast that had carried him across too many countries to remember nine months across the sunbaked deserts of the holy land across the spring meadows of endless principalities and dukedoms and now at last home england north of london and en route to the remote wilderness of scotland geoffrey shifted in the saddle to glance over his shoulder at the others three other knights their retinue of squires sergeants and the token priest travelling with them to attend their five daily prayer meetings in all just the eighteen of them now when theyd set out on their errand thered been over sixty in their party but illness some battlefield wounds that had gone bad and one or two skirmishes on the way home had whittled their number down now those left still intent on seeing this lie through looked like men ready to lie down in the winter coldness and let sleep take them sire look shouted one of the squires pointing up the forest track geoffrey turned back in his saddle and squinted at the bright blanket of undisturbed snow ahead of them he could make out the perfectly still form of a man swathed in a dark hooded cloak standing in the middle of the rutted track geoffreys sense of caution stirred him to rein in edith and raise a gloved hand he heard the column of boneweary horses and men shuffle to a halt behind him we are about kings business make way the hooded figure remained perfectly still the forest was utterly silent save for the cawing of a murder of crows circling high above in the winter sky the rasping of the horses breath and the clink of a harness as one of the pack horses stirred uneasily do ye hear the figure seemed not to geoffrey switched tongues nous faisons les affaires de rois a breeze tugged at the hooded cape but the man within remained perfectly still this is not good geoffrey looked at the trees either side of the track perfect ambush terrain theyd been jumped before by bandits on the continent in woods much like this the mistake back then a mistake that had cost them a good knight and two sergeantsatarms had been not to form up the moment the first of them had appeared he raised his hand and balled it to a fist the signal for the rest to dismount and make ready for a fight the forest echoed with the metallic clank of buckles and belts the rasping of chain mail and the drawing of swords from scabbards step aside now or i will have one of my men fire upon ye said geoffrey beckoning forward bates one of the sergeants in his retinue and reliable with a crossbow bates drew up beside him ratcheting back the drawstring and slipping a bolt into place a warning shot is it sir geoffrey pressed his lips tightly the warning had already been given nonetheless he decided if one more caution could save bloodshed on such a cold and godless day it was a breath worth expending step aside or ye shall be fired upon for a moment the mans response was the same nothing then slowly he began to stride through the ankledeep snow towards them bates turned to him sir this foolish man was going to die then perhaps that was what he wanted a martyrs death geoffrey had seen too much of that these last few years men hungry to die on the battlefield for all the promises theyd been made about sins forgiven take him down bates swiftly shouldered the crossbow aimed and fired the twang of the string echoed off the trees as the bolt flickered across the twenty yards between them with a smack it embedded itself into something beneath the flowing dark robes but the mans stride remained unbroken good god geoffrey whispered under his breath the hooded man now no more than a dozen yards away produced a broadsword from beneath his cape with an effortless sweep of his arm prepare to fight shouted geoffrey over his shoulder at the others sergeants defend the cart he was joined by the other three knights all younger some fitter than him but all of them prepared to die to safeguard what lay behind them secure in a nondescript wooden box and nestling in the back of their baggage cart the squires not fighting men but hired valets drew back to gather the horses reins and watch over the columns possessions geoffrey regarded his three brethren all seasoned fighters veterans of king richards crusade despite this man shrugging off the impact of a bolt still protruding from his chest he was sure between the four of them that this was to be a short fight the hooded man broke into a sudden sprint as he closed the last yards between them raising the fivefoot length of his cumbersome blade as if it was no heavier than a clerks quill geoffrey and the youngest william hefted their blades aloft twohanded as geoffrey had taught poised ready to swing down the hooded mans final stride brought him within range of strike and william swept his blade down first aiming it at the vulnerable l between neck and shoulder his sword clanged on something hard beneath the cape armour for sure his sword hummed with vibration as it bounced off the man and continued down into the snow the hooded mans response was a blur of movement and the glint of the broadsword through air young william was a dead man before his legs had begun to buckle his head toppled down beside him into the crisp white snow eyes still blinking surprise geoffrey swung his sword in a reckless roundhouse sweep hoping if not to cleave the man in two then at least to knock him off his balance his sweep ended with jarring suddenness and a metallic clang he grunted a curse the hooded man had to be wearing a complete suit of battle armour beneath that cape and yet he moved with the agility of a man almost naked the response was a whipsnap blur and before geoffrey had fully understood the result of the blow he was looking down at the blade being yanked firmly from his sternum in a fog of incomprehension he found himself lying in the snow looking up at the grey sky the flakes settling lightly on his cheeks and nose his mind was still dealing with the ridiculous notion that for him the fight was already over he a man whod fought saracens all his life killed hundreds of men was now reduced by a single thrust to being a pathetic panting body staining virgin snow with his blood far off he was aware of voices screaming the sound of fear and anger and the metallic clang and rasp of metal on metal an exchange of swordplay that seemed to come to an end horrifyingly quickly the voices receded the squires perhaps even the sergeants running for their lives then finally silence he was aware of the crows still circling above and the soft crunch of snow underfoot as someone slowly approached him daylight was blocked out by the hooded man leaning over him geoffrey thought he caught the glint of armour amid the shadows of his cowl how can an armoured man move so quickly then his fading mind was aware of another person leaning over him where is it said the new man geoffrey spat congealing blood out on to his cheek we we have no money im not after your money said the man ive come for the relic no matter well find it ourselves geoffreys grey eyes tried focusing on him yyou know of it the mans voice softened almost kindly now yes im one of your brotherhood geoffrey felt a hand under his cropped hair lifting his head out of the snow heres something to ease the pain the second man a lean face framed by long hair and a beard lifted a glass bottle to his lips he tasted a strong mead im truly sorry said the man but we must have it he sighed the the relic is to be taken to scotland it must it must be kept safe for for future generations the man completed his words yes i know this thats why were here he smiled we are that future generation and weve come for it geoffrey could feel death coming fast warm and welcoming and yet his mind felt compelled to know more his mission had failed it was to be taken from him and now he needed assurance ye ye are a a templar yes geoffreys eyes were far off now looking for hosts of angels to guide him to the kingdom of heaven weve come from near the time that it all happens and we have to know the truth weve come to find out it will be safe brother i promise you that we will keep it safe the words meant nothing to the knight now his breathing short and rapid puffs of tainted air finally ceased with a soft gurgle the man gently eased the knights head back down on to the snow and traced the sign of the cross along the red cruciform on the mans white tunic then he looked up at the hooded figure kneeling in the snow beside him he nodded towards the abandoned baggage cart itll be there somewhere find it the hooded man silently stood up and strode towards the cart im sorry the templar whispered again to the dead knight gently closing the lids of his eyes but we simply have to know chapter new york liam winced at the noise it was so loud he could feel something inside his ears vibrate and that surely couldnt be healthy maddy had dragged him to the front of the small nightclubs dance floor dragged him by the hand until theyd found a gap just in front of the stage hed been prepared to stand there and listen while the band had been playing a slower quieter almost pleasant song but then without any warning at all theyd taken a passable piece of music and turned it into a screaming banging cacophony of sound that made his ears hurt and of course all the other weirdlooking youngsters standing around him had started jumping up and down for some reason and rudely pushing and shoving him and each other he soon had enough of that and left maddy and sal bouncing up and down like idiots he squeezed his way through the crowd quickly giving up on his excuse mes and pardon mes until he found becks standing at the back of the nightclub calmly studying the behaviour of everyone inside like a scientist studying a cage full of lab rats they call this music so they do he shouted music would you believe that affirmative she shouted back at him spectrum analysis of the frequency envelope and beats per minute indicate this music matches other tracks identified collectively as death metal death metal is it now more like deafandmental she looked at him negative i said death she hesitated that was a joke wasnt it liam he shrugged aye she practised a laugh shed been working on against the din of the bands final chorus it sounded coarse and braying and not particularly ladylike he shook his head and looked back at the dance floor a seething bouncing carpet of hair and sweaty heads nose rings and tattooed shoulders while five willowy young men on the stage jerked and twitched over their instruments he decided they looked like something out of a travelling freak show jayzus so this is the modern world is it ah come on laughed maddy lighten up liam you sound like my granddad yes it wasnt exactly the bangrathrash im used to added sal but shaddyah they were proper good good liam huffed as they stepped out of the warm and humid fug of the nightclub into the cool september night ive heard anglegrinders along the liverpool docks make a more tolerable noise than that he tutted grumpily now are you sure those fellas back there actually knew how to play their instruments its not about how well you play liam said maddy its the i dont know its the energy the attitude you know attitude is it they stepped out of west st street on to broadway leaving the milling crowd of emos and grunge rockers dispersing behind them yes attitude its about getting an emotion across to the audience laying out how you feel becks cocked her head in thought that would indicate the musicians were feeling moderate to extreme levels of irritation about something liam laughed anger said maddy and thats all you need is it to be very angry and very noisy umm maddy made a face well not exactly yes said sal angry and noisy is exactly what music sounds like in as they walked down broadway towards times square quieter than theyd ever seen it maddy checked her watch youre sure your idea works asked liam she nodded we dont need a portal back to our field office its nearly midnight now the time bubble will reset in a couple of minutes by the time weve walked back down and across the bridge well be an hour into monday but wont we like meet a copy of ourselves that doesnt happen replied maddy we dont copy theres us and were either here or there but not in two places i dont get that sal replied liam stuffed his hands in his pockets actually i wasnt thinking so much about the time thing just that this is going to be a long walk so it is the girls laughed at that becks dutifully copied them i would have thought youd be used to walking said maddy why because im just some potatoeatin paddy from a hundred years ago no i didnt mean that exactly its just i dont suppose there were many cars or buses an stuff jayzus were not jungle savages you know we have had trams and trains and the like in cork so we did i didnt like walkin much then just as im not so keen on doing it now broadway led them on to times square which was much busier the cinemas were spilling out those whod been watching the late showings of shrek and monsters inc and yellow cabs queued in the central reserve to pick up the last of the welldressed audience for mamma mia sal staggered for a moment you ok asked maddy dizzy it was a bit loud in there i guess my ears are still ring sal shook her head and looked up not that i just felt the ground shift she looked at them you didnt feel it liam and maddy shook their heads maddy looked around at the busy thoroughfare nothing looked any different to her sal was it a yes a small one i think her eyes systematically scanned the buildings the people the cabs see anything not yet not yet give me a second it was difficult she was used to scanning tuesday morning at am the routine shed established she could describe that particular moment and place in time down to the tiniest detail now but this was times square thirtytwo hours earlier with different people doing different things then her eyes landed on a poster outside the golden screen cinema over there she said pointing and stepping quickly through a logjam of cars and pedestrians to get to the far side of the square a minute later the others joined her as she ran her fingers across the scuffed perspex cover over the sidewalk poster this is new she said this isnt meant to be here not on tuesday morning it isnt im certain maddy looked it over the poster displayed a picture of a young man on the run being chased by helicopters and black humvees through some european city it could have been paris it could have been prague for all she knew the manuscript she read aloud never heard of it liam read the strapline the greatest code in history has just been broken he looked at the top of the poster so whos leonardo dicaprio maddy waved the question aside sal you sure about this i felt something and this shouldnt be here she nodded tapping the poster unless it gets taken down before tuesday but why would they maddy checked the date the movie wasnt out until october just over a month from now they run these posters right up until release week she turned to the others anyway ive never heard of this movie and im pretty sure leonardos never been in a a chasey spy movie like this ill give this a lookup when we get back becks nodded firmly an untidy tress of dark hair flopping across her face this isnt right he watched them go picking up their pace as they strode purposefully across times square dont lose them whatever you do dont lose them he matched their pace weaving between the stopstart yellow cabs and ignoring the insults hurled out of the drivers windows at him dont lose them not now not after all this time he only recognized two of them the girl with the glasses and the frizzy hair and the tall athletic girl with long dark hair the other two seemed to be friends close friends by the look of their body language and theyd stopped and been studying a poster for the movie hadnt they the movie the manuscript was just another hollywood copout a cheesy chase movie with big explosions and stupid slowmotion gunfights and the obligatory baddy with an english accent they were heading down broadway now the three girls and the boy passing by a noisy gaggle of middleaged women tourists by the look of them he lost sight of them for a moment and began to panic dont lose them whatever you do he caught sight of the tall girl with the dark hair again striding like an athlete on platform heels that added another half a dozen unnecessary inches to her height he gasped with relief as the other three emerged through the tangle of women he decided to close the gap on them unwilling to risk losing them because a pedestrian light went against him or theyd turned a corner and took a side street before he could reestablish a visual too long hed been waiting to see them again way too long to lose them now chapter new york just as maddy had promised the archway was there as theyd left it and not empty and disused nor occupied by alternate versions of themselves giving them grief for causing some weird time paradox she pulled the shutter down once they were all inside gonna need a coffee here i think i need a caffeine hit affirmative said becks ill go check on bob said liam see how the fellas coming along maddy nodded distractedly as she made her way to the computer station now lets see whats what she muttered as she sat down in the chair and swivelled round to face the monitors a dialogue box popped up hello maddy how was the musical performance we call it a gig bob how was the gig it was cool very cool and ill tell you all about it later right now i need to hook into the external internet link and do a search affirmative external feed active she pulled up the systems search engine and tapped into their connection with the world wide web what was the name of that movie again the manuscript said sal taking a seat beside her she pinched her lip like i say never heard of it and sheeesh i love dicaprio the search engine spewed out a page of hits every last one to do with the movie reviews good and bad mostly bad entertainment news and dedicated film sites all chattering about leonardo she picked a website she used to regularly tap into from her bedroom back in aintitcoolnews she smiled at how primitive it looked back in good ol world wide web version directed by don rowney a change of pace and direction for the director who normally does drippy romantic comedies the manuscript starts out with an interesting highconcept premise before nosediving and becoming a pretty dull dialitin chase movie the first twenty minutes of the film introduce us to what it calls the most mysterious manuscript in history something i thought was a madeup story device until i did my homework the voynich manuscript apparently a booklength document that first surfaced in the middle ages written entirely in a gibberish language that to this day has yet to be successfully deciphered dicaprio still hot from his freshfaced role in james camerons titanic plays adam davies a hacker and cryptolinguist a codebreaker who manages to write a piece of software that unlocks the voynich and foolishly decides to brag about his achievement to family and friends and fellow hackers but as is always the case it isnt long before the bad guys the nastiest kind of shady government spooks come knocking concerned that daviess codebreaking software could be equally successful in unlocking the intelligence communitys deepest and darkest secrets the movie is based on a supposedly true story culled from the british press the real culprit adam lewis a hacker from england was written off as an attentionseeking loner after the story appeared in a british newspaper called the sun back in maddy looked at sal interesting i wonder if thats the same leonardo dicaprio as the old man who bought a whole chunk of the antarctic like earlier this year she looked at the others i mean my year you know he went to live there among the penguins to protect them from oil drillers or something you gotta be kidding me seriously sal shrugged might be someone else pretty sure the name was dicaprio maddy shook her head at the thought of it before returning to the task at hand she typed a search on adam lewis and and voynich manuscript as maddy trawled through the hits that came back becks cleared a space on the cluttered desk and placed a mug of black coffee in front of her thanks she scanned the hits and finally picked a link and clicked on it a moment later the screen went black and a banner logo appeared a redflaming eye oh look bingobangobongo she said reaching for the coffee lets see what this gives us the article was a lazy cutandpaste job from a tabloid newspaper on to some guys foilhat conspiracytheory website dark eye adam lewis a student doing a degree in computer studies at the university of east anglia the computer geek looking more like a tatty bearded animal rights protester than a microsoft pencilneck claimed in an article posted to new scientist magazine that he had singlehandedly achieved what historians codebreakers and several big american mainframe computer systems have all failed to do to produce a single legible phrase from the mysterious leatherbound book known to historians and codehounds as the voynich manuscript lewis laughingly admits that the deciphered phrase sounds a lot like something that might have come out of the kind of dungeonsanddragons fantasy games he loves to play with fellow geeks the sentence he supposedly managed to produce from a passage in the voynich which hes not prepared to identify is this pandora is the word the word leads to truth fellow traveller time to come and find it maddy spurted hot coffee over the back of her hand sal looked at her concerned maddy you ok maddy sat back in the chair glasses in her hands absently wiping the lenses as she gazed wideeyed and unfocused at the monitor in front of her maddy whats up whats the matter she shook her head chewing her lip a while before finally turning to sal with becks still towering over them in platform heels and looking bemused i think she started ive got a feeling this voynich thing might just be the work of another team another team sals jaw slowly dropped open you mean another group like us timeriders maddy hunched her shoulders i think were not alone folks chapter new york you sure about this mads i mean its just a sentence thats all and it doesnt really say anything anyway all three of them were slumped in the threadbare armchairs around the wooden kitchen table and maddy had printed out the web pages shed read onscreen despite explaining her point very clearly she thought liam still didnt seem to have grasped it the point is liam she tried again the point is this voynich manuscript may well be a document used by another team to communicate forward from the past just like you did with the museums guest book like you did with that fossilized message now if someones managed to decode some of it then maybe theyll decode more of it or all of it and god knows what sensitive agency messages are in there being sent forward if they think their codes unbreakable they could be saying all kinds of stuff in there and the agency is meant to be supersecret added sal liam pursed his lips all right i suppose i see your point i suppose maddy sighed not so much frustrated with liam being slow on the uptake but more because she was keeping something from him from sal too it felt wrong unfair and worst of all it made her feel lonely she remembered word for word the scribbled message shed found in that deposit box in and it was beginning to haunt her dreams maddy look out for pandora were running out of time be safe and tell no one more than a message it seemed like a warning no it was a warning but a warning of what well surely we dont need to go right now though do we moaned liam its late so it is and my heads still ringing from that noise you call music and im tired as in the morning then maddy cut in we all need a good nights sleep anyway im still a little hazy good plan agreed liam but this time its not you whos going back liam the other two looked at maddy what you going to tell them about pandora maddy you ready to do that no she decided at least not yet not until she knew a little more im going and ill take becks with me for security of course but you need to be here liam to watch over bob if im delayed and hes ready to hatch you should be here for him when he comes out so that he sees you first you remember what foster said the clone imprints on the first person he sees bonds with them you should be here for his birth true he nodded at that she knew he didnt want to miss that moment and look its not exactly like im heading somewhere superdangerous its england she turned to becks standing patiently at the end of the table where is it exactly information adam lewis is a registered secondyear student at the university of east anglia in the city of norwich a university campus there hardly dangerous she grinned maybe even fun i could come said sal hopefully sorry not this time sal its probably best youre here too watching for signs weve had one small ripple there could be more on the way sal huffed why do you always get to decide everything now im sorry its maddy sighed foster made me leader sal so im supposed to lead thats the way it is i wish it wasnt i wish somebody else was calling the shots i wish foster was still here to be honest but it is what it is just seems unfair all of this is unfair i didnt want to come here i didnt choose to die in a plane crash at eighteen i had plans you know i had plans to do more with my life than watch a bunch of computer screens and live in this cruddy dump she could have said more things shed regret later it was bad enough having to be in charge when she barely felt she had a grasp on how things worked but add to that somebody somewhere seemed to be trying to warn her about something and she was way too stupid to get it the moment tasted sour and all of a sudden she felt tired she looked at her watch it was gone two in the morning look im hitting the mattress maybe we all should its late and weve got stuff to do tomorrow she got up and headed into the arched recess where their bunks were and pulled a curtain across as she changed into her pjs liam looked at sal and shrugged both of them perplexed at her mood maybe shes missing home arent we all said sal chapter new york maddy and becks were treading water in the perspex tube one moment and gone along with sixty gallons of diluted disinfectant solution the next the large plastic tub flexed inwards with a loud thud that echoed through the archway jayzus does that tube always do that sal nodded the pressure of all the water suddenly not there it makes the perspex flex oh right he looked round at sal sitting patiently beside him hands crossed in her lap so what normally happens now her smile was resigned we havent had normal yet either weve been hiding from cannibal mutants or weve had secretservice agents knocking at the door she laughed skittishly it seems like weve been hopping from one crisis to the next since we first arrived here doesnt it liam nodded well then while it appears the sky hasnt yet fallen on our heads again and while were waiting for this machinery to recharge perhaps miss vikram would like to go for a breakfast in one of those charming scottish restaurants scottish restaurants one of them mcdougal places mcdonalds aye thats the fella the ones with the big fancy yellow m she pulled a face breakfast sounds good but maybe somewhere else chapter may uea campus norwich opening the portal in the universitys swimming pool after closing time had seemed a good idea to maddy back in the archway theyd arrive wet but thered be changing facilities and hopefully a blowdryer or towel or something but now floundering beneath the water in total darkness not knowing which way was up and which way was down she realized it ranked pretty high on her own not to be tried again list suddenly maddy felt beckss hand grasping her followed by a hearty yank and her face breaking the surface she coughed retched and spluttered as becks swam to the side of the pool pulling her after recommendation this was not a good idea no really she gasped becks nodded firmly not yet a master of irony yes you could have drowned maddy eased herself out of the cold water and flopped exhausted on to the side she looked around the universitys sports centre was closed now the swimming pool dark lit only by the dim amber glow of street lights outside strips of orange light leaking through the drawn and turneddown blinds along the racinglane side of the pool all right well so were here now weve got four hours so lets get dry and changed and then well go find this adam lewis adams nerves were getting the better of him he needed to get a grip get a grip he uttered to the face in his mirror a lean face of freckles and acne framed by the pitifully feeble sprouting of an auburn beard auburn not ginger auburn thats what he kept telling everyone and the tatty twists and turns of greasy hair tied back in a ponytail they were flippin well auburn too his eyes looked back at him through roundframed lennon specs you look terrible he told himself well why not he argued back ive got every right to look terrible why not indeed he was scared really scared hed not stepped out of his room now for what four five days missed half a dozen study periods and lectures and his flatmates were beginning to mutter about him in the hallway outside his door theyd already thought he was a bit of an oddball before well before this outside it was dark eleven he could hear the thud of music coming from the floor below he recognized it chili peppers his flatmates were playing mario on the snes there was a lot of noise the clackfissss of cans of beer being popped open and laughing lots of laughing most probably about him not so big a deal to him now a week ago stuff like that got him down a bit being a loner being perceived as the resident freak but he brushed off the quips and sniggering at his expense the way every hardened geek does it by acting as if far greater matters were on his mind matters these beerswilling oiks wouldnt even begin to understand one day ill be flying business class and you idiots youll be serving fries somewhere thats the sort of thing he usually said aloud the lads laughed and shook their heads at his lame and faltering comeback but he quietly smiled because he knew it was undoubtedly going to be true and that he figured was how he and every other geek coped with being the frozenout loner the certainty that thered come a day of mega payback for all the jibes and the sniggering but right now he really did have far far greater matters on his mind why me how do they know my name oh god who are they all of a sudden the throbbing music and the drunken guffawing stopped he realized the front doorbell to their digs had just gone he licked dry cracked lips and realized he was holding his ragged breath to hear better who was down there at the door to hear whod come knocking at so late an hour he could hear lances glaswegian accent and who else another murmuring voice quiet polite businesslike female lance was trying it on some witty banter loosened up by the beer his easy celtic charm usually worked flawlessly on the freshers firstyear girls looking for an older wiser university boyfriend but from the murmuring tone of this female visitor she seemed wholly uninterested he heard lances attitude suddenly change clearly facing a rejection for the first time in his life he sounded like a petulant child well if you really want to see the freak hes up the stairs second on the right adam heard footsteps on the uncarpeted hallway and up the wooden stairs his heart was pounding in his chest his stomach suddenly churning like a spin dryer oh ggod its them his mind spun between two options to go for the window clamber out drop down outside and run for his life or to stay put and meet them see what they wanted from him oh god oh god oh god maddy stood outside the door she turned to look at becks before gently rapping on it with her knuckles adam lewis there was no answer but she heard something stirring inside the clunk and scrape of footsteps adam she called softly can we talk to you a long pause downstairs she could hear the murmur of male voices no doubt talking about her and becks actually probably just becks she was well aware the support unit tended to attract the gaze of excitable testosteronefuelled young men finally she heard a shuffling sound from just beyond the door who who are yyou a voice came through the keyhole my names maddy are yyou hhere to gget me the voice sounded pitiful thin with fear no im not here to get you i just want to talk to you i did what i was told i ddid exactly wwhat it told me to ddo maddy had no idea what he was talking about but she decided the only way she was going to get him to open the door was to mention something very specific adam im here about a particular word silence im here to talk about pandora she heard the dull click of the lock turning and the door cracked open an inch a pale face dotted with spots and the glint of spectacles appeared in the space between the door and frame are yyou are you the one go on maddy play along with him she offered him a reassuring smile sure im the one the the one who wwill explain bbecause i nneed to know i i ill do my very best adam if youll just let us in the crack widened another halfinch as the glinting of spectacles shifted to study becks and whos she shes a friend shes no harm just a friend ddoes she know a about ppandora yes adam studied them both for another few seconds before finally his face pulled back into the darkness and with a creak of worn hinges the door swung slowly open inviting them in chapter norwich it was too dark to see anything but the room she stepped into smelled musty a room she guessed that was probably littered with dirty clothes and underwear lying in crumpled piles can we have a light on in here she asked yyes sure a moment later a bedside lamp snicked on the room was as small and as messy as shed expected but the walls the walls caught her breath shed done a couple of terms of college before dropping out and getting a programming job shed had a room like this once and covered its walls with posters of scifi movies she loved like aliens predator serenity computer games bands and stuff but this this was plain weird all four walls seemed to be covered with sheets of paper filled by the handwritten scrawl of strangelooking hieroglyphics so youre pretty keen on what egyptian stuff then she said breaking the silence uh oh yeah no its not hieroglyphics im into cryptanalysis he turned back to her you you said youre theone right thats wwho you are the one who explains it now they were through the door she decided it was going to be best to come clean and confess she really didnt know much if anything adam were here because of a message you posted on the net net maddy shook her head of course back in they called it the web a different language for the technology they took for granted in you posted on the universitys public forum that youd decoded a complete sentence of the she forgot the name of the thing the voynich manuscript said becks helping her out he nodded his head vigorously yes yes i did thats what thats exactly what i was instructed to do ii did exactly what i was told i did what told told by who adam looked from maddy to becks then back again completely bewildered by you i was kind of thinking youre involved not me maddy shook her head i never heard of the voynich manuscript until last night adam still appeared completely on edge and wary of them both never heard of it nope he licked dry lips so you cant be the one you cant tell me why my names in the maddy raised her hands to calm him down i know about pandora adam i know that much he regarded her suspiciously youre involved us too in whatever this means im just trying to make some sense of it i need to know what it means too please she said softly please why dont you tell me about this voynich document his eyes flickered uncertainly from her to becks please she spread her hands in a disarming way then maybe the three of us can figure this out together huh yeah sure he seemed relieved at the suggestion relieved to have somebody else to share what he knew as an afterthought he nodded towards a stool and a beanbag want to sit down maddy smiled thanks she unzipped her anorak and laid it on the bed and gestured to becks to settle down on the beanbag she was going to look less intimidating that way than standing over them both like a guard dog so maddy looked at adam expectantly he sat down on the end of his bed its the ultimate challenge for codebreakers he started its a severalhundredpageslong document thats been carbondated back to the twelfth century and the entire volume is written in a completely unknown language i mean the whole thing is a bunch of characters and glyphs that have never been used in any other written form adams ragged nerves seemed to be settling a little people have been trying to decipher this thing since the seventeenth century when it was first discovered its been floating around from one archived library to another spent a hundred years or so in the papal library in rome until the jesuit order desperately needed some cash and flogged off a whole section of their library in it was a joblot bought by a trader in old manuscripts called wilfrid voynich he found it buried among crates of old papal paperwork he had it for a while and tried selling it on to various collectors he realized there was something very special about it he never did manage to sell it though what happened to it he died in left it to his wife she died in and left it to a friend who sold it to another dealer a bloke called hans kraus like voynich he took it around a bunch of collectors hoping to make some money but no one took it eventually kraus donated it to yale university in he opened a bottle of flat weak pepsi and took a gulp and thats when it became public domain and ever since then codebreakers linguistic hackers have all been having a go at it he offered the pepsi to maddy she nodded and took a polite sip it really is the most incredible coded document in history he continued no one i mean no one has managed to extract even a single meaningful sentence from it not even a single word until you did he nodded until i managed to decipher that uhh that bit yeah information said becks adam lewis is exhibiting behavioural stress indicators he is concealing truth from you maddy adam looked at her suspiciously are you two some sort of secretservice types maddy laughed god no she cocked an eyebrow becks here is pretty paranoid shes good at spotting things like this so is she right is there something youre not telling me adam i he swallowed his adams apple bobbing like a fishermans float ok all right ii deciphered a little more than the sentences i made public how much more he looked up uncertainly at maddy how do i know i can trust you maddy shook her head i cant help you make sense of this unless you tell us what youve got adam she looked at him then around the room clearly the poor young man had been holed up in here for too many days presumably too frightened to step outside you want someone to share this with dont you his head nodded vigorously i yes actually im totally freaked this is seriously hardcore i yes jesus tell me you can make sense of this stuff tell me well do our best adam just let me know what you decoded he licked his lips again took a deep breath and steadied his nerves all right then ok this is how it goes he took another slurp from the twolitre bottle of pepsi you must make public the last part of this message adam lewis and i promise you someone will come and explain everything when she comes it is important you tell her this seek cabot at kirklees in do not reveal any more of this message to anyone else the last part now follows pandora is the word the word leads to truth fellow traveller time to come and find it thats all of it he nodded maddy turned to becks what do you think at this time i can offer no data adam stood up i really have to go pee youre gonna stick around right maddy nodded and watched him tiptoe across the messy floor and open the door to an equally grubby bathroom she waited until she heard the door lock click before turning to becks my god becks this voynich manuscript its a droppoint document it has to be its got to be another team do you think beckss eyes fluttered processing going on inside this is possible it is also possible this is a document that will be used at a later date by your team maddy shook her head no theres no way id use it now because its look now i know its been decoded by some teen hacker i certainly wouldnt allow liam to use it to talk through time to us not now we know its compromised that its been hacked and ill tell liam when we get back of course so look whatever happens in the future we know we cant use it therefore it has to be someone else becks nodded a logical argument what weve got to do is get back home to then ill send a warning message into the future to ill send a warning that the voynich manuscript isnt safe for any other teams to be using becks nodded approval there was the sound of a flushing toilet and a moment later the lock clacked and adam emerged maddy hastily picked up her anorak from his bed adam she said we have to leave weve got a got a train to catch his jaw dropped open but but you said we cant stay im really sorry but i need someone else i need someone to explain what this means maddy shook her head sorry she pointed at the door and becks reached to open it please dont go iim completely freaked here who wrote that message why was it me that deciphered it why me adam grabbed at her arm holding it tight i dont know adam but look we have to go when i know what this all means ill come back ok ill come back and tell you i promise please dont go his grasp was tightening hurting her becks noticed and with one swift movement she grabbed one of his fingers and twisted it savagely back he screamed with pain and released his grip ahhh jesus its broken maddy winced im really sorry adam well be back i promise she stumbled out of the open door and into the hall down the noisy wooden steps and past the young man whod answered the door everything ok girls he asked as they swept through the hallway towards the front door fine said maddy hastily he reached out an arm in front of becks blocking her way sure you dont wanna stay and share a few beers with me and the lads lance offered her his most charming smile the one that never let him down we could parteee sweetheart her cold grey eyes locked on him calmly assessing what level of force would be appropriate to remove the obstruction from her path but maddy stepped in and casually pushed his arm out of her way i really wouldnt recommend doing that shes uh she can get quite tetchy chapter new york liams stomach was groaning from the burden of consuming a dozen pancakes glistening with maple syrup he belched so loudly it made sal jump shaddyah you are too gross sorry he uttered shamefaced as he sat down in front of the computer screen hello bob hello liam did you enjoy a good breakfast i did thank you although im feelin as sick as a butchers dog information i have two notifications for you the displacement machine is fully charged and ready to activate the return portal also the support unit in growthcycle is now ready to be ejected thanks bob looks like youre going to be walking around with the living again soon enough i am very pleased i enjoyed working with you in the past liam oconnor and me with you be good to have another man about the place so it will its gettin all frilly and girlie in this place i do not understand please explain frilly and girlie just a turn of phrase bob he turned to sal pulling a face at her well im not frilly and girlie she huffed liam chuckled all right bob which should we do first bring back the ladies or toss the new clone out of his tube recommendation i suggest activating the return portal first right you are lets get a wiggle on and do that then chapter uea campus norwich maddy checked her watch they had a few minutes to spare before the portal was due to open the return coordinates were outside beside a service entrance behind the universitys pool building it was gone am and the hustle of life after dark on the campus had died down to the snuffling of a fox going through bags of rubbish nearby and the faroff wail of a police siren becks yes i need to discuss something its something that she frowned as she tried to find the right words its something ive been keeping from the other two because well because i have to but i need someone else to talk to about it its driving me nuts you wish to talk to me confidentially yes but i know everything i say to you becomes data everything you see hear becomes data thats available to the others i can partition my hard drive and create a folder that is accessible only after a certain code word is used data that is acquired while the partition is open will be stored there the partition can be closed again and accesslocked with the use of the same or a different code word do you mean everything you hear see if we were to have a conversation while this partition is open the memory of it would remain in there would remain a secret that is correct my normal functioning ai would also not be aware of those memories until you activated them with the code word maddy understood it would almost be as if becks was operating as a schizophrenic a person with a multiplepersonality disorder unaware of the actions of the other personality a little bit weird to be honest but she needed someone to help her make sense of things someone to help her connect the dots something was going on out there someone wanted her to know something just her do that please becks set up your separate partition affirmative beckss eyes blinked rapidly her cool emotionless gaze lost and far away for a moment information partitioned drive ready please provide an access code what anything any word recommendation three words one after the other that would not normally appear next to each other in sequence during a normal conversation this would provide adequately strong security what like banana alien jigsaw correct is this your codeword sequence no hang on id forget that let me think she rubbed at her chin thoughtfully as the police siren faded leaving the night still quiet ok thisll do ipad caveman breakfast this is your codeword sequence yes becks blinked again security measure activated the partition is open she turned slowly to look at maddy i am listening maddy ok maddy puffed a breath ok this is what ive been keeping from liam and sal when we went to get some new clone foetuses back before that whole dinosaur mess before you were grown becks we got the foetuses from the san francisco drop point the one based in there was this secure deposit box where we found a crate of refrigerated embryos but also there was this note all scribbled like somebody had tried to sneak it in real quick it was a message addressed to me for my eyes only liam didnt see it so its just me knows about it becks nodded do you wish to tell me what the message was you promise me this is all secret she nodded it is password protected when you have finished discussing the matter with me and speak the codeword sequence my normal ai will only be aware that a duration of time has passed without sensory data being collected right ok well this was what the note said maddy look out for pandora were running out of time be safe and tell no one becks nodded and looked at her this is why you instructed liam not to come along on this mission thats right and obviously when i saw the phrase this adam guy decoded and posted publicly it contained the word pandora she bit her lip for a moment my god becks i can only think its someone trying to contact me through this voynich thing the voynich manuscript is approximately nine hundred years old i know i know thats whats so creepy somebody nearly a thousand years ago wants to talk to me why i have no data to answer that and what was that weird stuff adam said he had to tell me seek cabot at kirklees in whats a cabot or who i have no data at this time we have to go back there becks if is a year weve got to go back to that time and find out what pandora means what it refers to and why its me me of all people who needs to know that would seem the logical next step becks raised a hand i am detecting tachyon particles maddy looked at her watch theyd run out of time to talk this through the portal was moments away from arriving becks can we talk about this again affirmative you should close the partition with the codeword sequence now when you wish to resume this conversation repeat the sequence to open my drive ok here it is then ipad caveman breakfast becks blinked rapidly several times then her head cocked on one side curious i appear to have two minutes thirtytwo seconds of unlogged time she turned to maddy did i malfunction in any way the air in front of them pulsed stirring plastic bags and newspapers into chasing each other in the dark ahead she could see the shimmering forms of their colleagues sal waving liam doing bunny ears behind her head no youve been just fine becks perfectly fine lets go home shall we chapter norwich adams hand throbbed the tall girl with the surprisingly strong grip hadnt in fact broken his finger just stretched the tendons in his hand not broken but still incredibly painful under normal circumstances it would have been painful enough for him to take himself to the campus walkin surgery for a splint or icepack and some serious painkillers but he was distracted enough that the throbbing in his finger was for the moment ignorable it cant be thats what his mind was muttering to itself it just cant be what weve got to do is get back home to thats what the girl with the glasses had said while hed stood in the bathroom holding his breath and listening to them then ill send a warning message into the future to hed nearly laughed out loud at that if he had it would have been the shrill humourless laugh of someone losing their mind because this the stuff they were saying it was plain crazy right because because was seven years from now was the future mission control to adam his mind chastised him are you about to tell yourself that theyre time travellers is that it have you really gone that insane he nodded and chuckled to himself yes thats it maybe ive gone completely mad he was halfway to accepting that was what was wrong with him his two visitors his throbbing finger all of it were just elements of a paranoid delusion after all hed been hiding out in this room for nearly a week living like a hermit beginning to see things he decided that the sensible little voice in his head was most probably right that this was a sign it was time to go see a campus councillor and maybe just maybe he or she could explain to him in a perfectly rational way how come hed found a message written in modern english in a document nearly a thousand years old how come he was imagining visitations from timetravel girls from the future he laughed at how crazy it all sounded he was just about ready to admit hed gone completely insane and help when he noticed a twist of paper on his bed where the girl maddy thats the name thats what your hallucinated visitor called herself wasnt it had placed her jacket he reached over tentatively to pick it up hoping it was just one more example of his mind playing tricks on him and it would vanish in a puff of delusion before he even managed to touch it only it didnt errr adam to mission control its uhh its he muttered turning the twist of coloured paper over in his hand this is real right im not hallucinating this am i mission control had nothing useful to add at this point in time he looked closely at the paper in his hand it was a ticket stub an entry ticket to what appeared to be a nightclub or a bar or something the address was west st street new york whats more it had a date and an admission time stamped faintly like tickertape along the bottom all of a sudden he felt lightheaded dizzy and queasy excited and terrified all at the same time he looked again at the faintly printed time and date september seven years from now the girl whod just left his room was going to go to this new york nightclub it was one thing too many for him he lost balance and flopped face forward on to his mattress outside he heard the clump of boots on the stairs and a moment later a heavy fist on his door hey adam who were those girls lances voice sounded far away it sounded utterly inconsequential suit yourself you stay in there you little freak but tell your weird freak friends not to come round so late next time right adam heard none of that he was already busy mapping out the next seven years of his life chapter new york all right stand clear everyone sal crouched down and thumbed an icon on the growth tubes small glowing touchscreen a motor softly whirred at the bottom of the perspex tube and it slowly tilted backwards to a fortyfive degree angle a moment later the bottom of the tube opened and a floodtide of foulsmelling gunk splashed out on to the floor of the back room bobs glistening babysmooth body slipped out of the tube and across the floor like a freshly landed blue marlin on the foredeck of a fishing boat its a boy announced liam this time round added maddy the newly birthed clone stirred on the floor grey eyes opening and gazing up at them they crouched around him cooing like proud parents liam said liam pointing to himself my names liam the clone opened his mouth and vomited a river of pink gunk down the front of his muscular chest oh thats our bob all right said sal negative becks squatted down to inspect the slimy naked body on the floor the ai designated bob has yet to be uploaded shes right said maddy its not our old buddy yet just a meat combat unit og gub ber smuh gurgled the clone in agreement and just as moronic as he was last time she added come on lets get him cleaned up and dressed then we can get the software upload started liam placed a hand under one bulging arm becks the other and together they helped him to his feet liam winked at the bewilderedlooking giant welcome back bob half an hour later hosed down and no longer stinking like a pile of rotten meat dried and dressed in a mixandmatch collection of oversized clothes bob sat motionless on liams bunk his eyelids flickered rapidly as terabytes of data filled the empty silicon wafer embedded in his skull becks was overseeing the software transfer process while maddy had called the other two to join her around the kitchen table so you see weve got to at least go and take a look make sure this voynich manuscript isnt going to totally give the game away she shrugged it isnt going to be a particularly secret agency much longer if one of our teams is blabbing away all our secrets in that document right liam nodded sure does that mean liam might meet another operative like himself asked sal maddy shrugged its entirely possible hell make contact she turned to him and if you do then obviously the most important thing you need to communicate is that they cant use the voynich manuscript any longer its been compromised ok right so maddy consulted a pad of paper on the table so the time were sending you back to liam is thats when this adam lewis said the document carbon dates to she looked up from her notes i dont think carbon dating can be that precise but its a specific year to aim for and were sending you to a place called kirklees thats in england ahh now ive been to england before with me uncle and me dad so a place called kirklees priory i did a search on it its famous because its the place where robin hood died and was buried supposedly liams eyebrows shot up robin hood did you say maddy laughed at his response dont get your hopes up liam from what ive pulled up there seems to be a lot of evidence that hoods just a myth a story made up from a whole bunch of different sources from old saxonaged myths to like seventeenthcentury highwayman stories oh his face dropped and there was me hoping to become one of his merry men sorry now listen closely historical records show this is a dangerous time the king of england is richard and hes abroad fighting some crusade at home theres a lot of unrest and stuff bandits anarchy that kind of thing so for safety im going to send both support units along with you ok liam smiled ill be fine then me own little army and remember all this is a quick looksee if you can i want you to find who or what cabot is and talk to him see if you can find out whos writing this voynich manuscript and if its another team like us then youve got to make contact and warn them that the codes been broken right aye a secondary objective liam if you can locate the manuscript or come across whoevers writing it is if you can find out how to decode that manuscript so we can see what else is in it she glanced at both of them i dont know about you but im tired of being totally in the dark about this agency i want to know more and if theres more we can find out yeah said sal i want to know too the three of them were quiet for a moment i dont know where this is taking us said maddy history has been changed a little theres a movie out there that wasnt there yesterday and maybe thats all thats going to happen with this time wave and we dont need to correct things again as foster once said history can tolerate some change maybe this adam guy got lucky with those couple of sentences and thats all anyone is ever going to get out of the manuscript but i think we have to just take a look agree liam nodded its the time of knights an all i wouldnt mind seeing some of that cool so when bobs ready sal i want you liam and the two units to go locate some clothing thatll not attract attention god knows what they wear then she said shrugging potato sacks and sandals for all i know ok what about you i need to put together a data package for bob and becks so theyre you know up to speed on all the relevant history she looked at her watch its just gone ten if we say launch time after lunch she nudged liam might as well get some pizza in before you go chapter new york he was watching the row of archways not entirely certain which one theyd disappeared into last night hed let them get too far ahead theyd turned into that backstreet and by the time hed arrived and looked down past the wheelie bins and bags of festering rubbish they were nowhere to be seen nerves had got the better of him hed allowed himself to fall too far behind he could have gone down there knocking on each shutter door but hed wimped out back at his apartment in the early hours unable to sleep as new york finally stilled itself for a new monday morning hed paced his living room angry with himself seven years of waiting for this moment seven years waiting to talk to the girl again and hed wimped out and lost them down this street in all that time hed played the memory of that night in his bedsit over and over in his head trying to understand what it had been about trying to keep the memory of their faces fresh and vivid preparing himself to accept the possibility that this was for real that that little ticket stub was actually going to reunite him with someone whod travelled across time adam had called work this morning told them he was feeling poorly told them he might not be in for a couple of days shermangolding investment would cope just fine without their it systems security consultant for a couple of days seven years it felt like a lifetime ago those unhappy university years hed never kept in touch with those moronic beerheads hed shared digs with couldnt care less what they were doing now because he was doing just fine a nice manhattan apartment a gold american express card membership of an exclusive gym that overlooked the hudson he earned more money a year than his old man earned in a decade and all he was really was a hacker in a smart suit but then this life this career everything hed planned and done since he was twentyone had been so hed end up here in new york so he could be there at that club on that night his whole career his life governed by the faint print on a crumpled stub of coloured paper totally mental now watching this little backstreet in the morning mr sensible urged him to make a move mission control toadam time to go and say hello now dont you think the thought sent butterflies fluttering in formation around his gut come on adam youre a confident man now not that nerdy little weasel not any more right a player not a loser a winner and winners dont sit around whining he nodded right mission control says were good to go time to go it was then that he saw them four of them emerging from one of the archways he spotted the tall girl whod twisted his finger nearly out of its socket looking no different wearing exactly the same clothes shed been wearing that night the very same clothes shed been wearing seven years ago and it looked like shed not aged a day with her was a small asian girl thirteen maybe fourteen a young man perhaps a couple of years older and next to him a giant of a man he had to be seven foot tall at least a yard across the shoulders and over two hundred pounds of muscle that leaves the other girl the one called maddy shed been with this lot last night hed watched her bouncing around amid the sweaty mob like a loon hed liked that kind of thrash music when he was a student not now though it was music for kids he preferred jazz classical rhythm and blues it better suited the sophisticated professional executive hed become all part of the new image new adam mission control says go green light mate time to knock or are you going to bottle out again who dares wins he whispered thats the spirit hed noted which archway theyd come out of the fifth one along he waited until the others had turned out of the backstreet and east to head into brooklyn before he tossed the paper cup of bland coffee hed been holding on to into a litter bin and took a first tentative step across the pedestrian walkway towards the dirty little backstreet here we go he whispered maddy heard the shutter door rattle as someone lightly tapped on it from outside one of them must have forgotten something she got up from the office chair and crossed the floor rubbing her eyes tiredly she punched the green button and let the shutter clatter up to knee height before ducking down what did you forg she looked up and saw a tall tanned and wellgroomed man in a very expensivelooking suit he removed a pair of designer shades and smiled uh hi he said with an english accent and a small selfconscious wave excuse me she said can i help you he smiled you and i we uh met some years ago maddy frowned confused for a moment i dont think so then she realized there was something about his face that looked vaguely familiar he shrugged i think i looked quite a bit different then long scruffy dreadlocks pretty bad zits and if i recall correctly i had a beard if you can call it that i dont think you caught me at my best he smiled a handsome expression on his lean sculpted face but you he said shaking his head quite incredible you dont seem to have changed one bit her eyes widened with surprise she suddenly recognized him oh my god she whispered youre youre that young adam lewis he said squatting down to face her on the level he offered his hand how did you her jaw flapped uselessly how did i find you she nodded he reached for the inside pocket of the welltailored pinstriped jacket and pulled out a leather wallet ive kept this safe in here you know all these years and every now and then i pull it out and look at it just to remind myself that i wasnt going mad that i didnt imagine that night he pulled out a frayed and faded corner of paper and held it in the palm of his hand its a little bit of litter you left by mistake in my room she could just make out the name of the club theyd been to last night i dropped that he nodded he looked up at the clear blue sky and sighed i do believe back in you promised to come back and tell me what the message was all about so how did you get on with finding out the truth finding out what pandora means oh boy she looked up and down the street i suppose youd better come in chapter new york adam straightened up inside his eyes slowly adjusting from the bright september morning outside to the dimly lit interior my god he whispered and turned to her this is your your base is it she nodded fraid so he took several hesitant steps across the floor towards the bank of computer monitors the perspex cylinder and the rack of machinery standing beside it and this what is thats our time displacement unit she replied drawing up beside him we have to talk mr lewis he shook his head adam will do clients call me mr lewis fair enough we have to talk about pandora adam you know what it means now she shook her head no look my colleagues dont know about it yet i plan to tell them but not yet not until i know what it means she looked at him maybe you can help me i need to know everything you know about the voynich how you managed to decode it when no one else can and how youve ended up here he nodded yes yes of course lets go sit she gestured to one of the threadbare armchairs ill make some coffee a couple of minutes later she sat down opposite him with two mugs of coffee and a packet of oreos so where do i begin adam took off his suit jacket laid it carefully over one arm of the chair and loosened his tie not long after you visited me i became a news story for a day a national newspaper ran an article on me and a story about the mysterious voynich manuscript became the next days fishnchips paper he laughed bitterly but the damage was done everyone at university knew who i was a loony a deluded little sad case who made up the story just to get some attention why you managed to decode it successfully so you didnt explain how you did it show them you werent a nutcase i couldnt explain the technique to anyone i couldnt demonstrate the deciphering method why not adam sipped his coffee because he sighed it sounds crazy he shook his head maybe because it is just tell me why you couldnt explain how you managed to decode it because i believe it used a cipher aimed specifically at me excuse me it was encrypted in a way that only one person in the world could unlock his eyes widened looking more like the paranoid student hed once been than the successful and groomed executive he was now someone in he laughed edgily knows me knowsme very well he sighed ok here goes he said sitting forward on the chair i was really interested in palaeolinguistics the study of dead languages and i took a gap year before my degree to go to south america with some others we were following the trail of a preaztec tribe called the windtalkers theory was they had a form of writing long before the aztecs arrived anyway to cut a long story short i managed to locate a cave wall high up on a cliff overlooking the rainforests a wall covered in this dead language their glyphs its unique maddy completely unique no one has ever discovered that cave or written a paper on the windtalkers and their language why not i guess because no other palaeolinguist has discovered the cave since and why didnt you make yourself famous then go public with your find he shrugged various reasons i wanted to understand it first i wanted to keep it to myself its also a unique character set perfect for encryption he grinned coyly i use some of it in the work that i do now creating software security ciphers and thats why im one of the most soughtafter it security consultants in new york the ciphers i write are unbreakable he waved that comment away embarrassed at how conceited it sounded anyway im telling you that because well because i spotted two very specific glyphs from the cave wall in the voynich manuscript maddy nearly dropped an oreo in her coffee theyre very important glyphs they were used by the windtalkers to separate ideas sentences if you like much like we use a capital letter and a full stop one glyph always appeared at the beginning of a sentence or an expression and the other at the end so what youre telling me the voynich was written by like aztecs no its not the glyphs are only used once he raised a finger on just one occasion the voynich manuscript is hundreds of pages crammed full of random characters some of them roman latin some egyptian some greek some mathematical and then theres this one passage of those same random characters which begins with a windtalker glyph and ends with one my god he nodded yes like it was flagged up like someone was saying focus on this passage alone he stirred uneasily like they were saying focus on this passage adam lewis a nervous grin skittered across maddys lips then slipped away that is sooo creepy he nodded anyway i wont bore you with the technical details of breaking open a cipher but if you can isolate a chunk of meaningful language from random gibberish a technique often deployed to throw cryptanalysts off the scent then its just a matter of time before you can break it down those windtalker markers were the reason im the only person whos ever managed to extract something meaningful from the voynich he set his mug on the table and thats the reason why i couldnt explain myself publicly thats why i was dismissed as an attentionseeking nut i couldnt say some medieval bloke knew i was going to take a field trip to the amazon and discover the key to breaking the code i just had to take all the criticism all the mickeytaking on the nose its a period in my life ive tried to put behind me he smiled then of course this bloody film comes out he sighed luckily they changed the characters surname and whod want to be portrayed by leonardo dicaprio eh they both laughed politely at that maddy weighed him up silently she realized he already knew too much that at some point they were going to have to undo history and see to it that adam lewis never found his way here until then though he appeared to be a reluctant part of this mystery linked to pandora somehow perhaps even the key to it all just like his preaztec glyphs cookie chapter new york so wheres this place youre taking us asked liam its a theatre and antique junk shop that does expensive fancydress hire the clothes are the proper thing not all the nasty cheap polyfabric and synthetic shaddyah you get in like joke shops polly horrible she shuddered in my time my parents used to wear brightcoloured polyfab kurtas and these imported jogging suits and plastic jewellery ughh hideous there she said gesturing along the street its just a couple of blocks down this way rightoh he said nodding itll be good though to try on something more comfortable she looked him up and down you dont like the jeans and the hoody he couldnt help but grimace a little the trousers seem a little tight around my legs so they do its quite difficult to walk and its rubbing me sore in places id rather not talk about she quickly lifted the bottom of his hoody up and laughed at what she saw thats because youre wearing the waist wayyy too high they should you know hang really low liam had the belt cinched tightly and the waistband of his diesel jeans hawked up high over his hips to just beneath his navel with that the tshirt underneath tidily tucked in and his shock of greywhite hair he looked like an old man its all got to hang loose and low you know jahulla you wear trousers like how my greatgrandfather wears trousers tucked up under his armpits well thats where a pair of trousers should be so not round your knees she huffed and rolled her eyes youd never fit in in even if i dressed you up in the streetiest polyfab booger suit and loads of chumpbling round your neck youd still stand out like a naraza aguhe he pressed a weary smile out i think i prefer the way people used to dress in the past to the way they do in the future it all seems to be about lookin poor and as scruffy as you can i mean why is it tell me that people deliberately rip holes in their trousers ive seen that several times now in their jeans you mean aye she shrugged its just the fashion i dont know to make them look older than they are i guess he shook his head and circled a finger at his temple there see thats just completely peculiar that is back home my mother was always trying to keep all me school clothes and me sunday suit looking as new as if theyd just come out of a shop well i guess in your time clothes were really expensive in mumbai in my time even now in i guess its all so cheap you wear something a couple of times then you just sort of throw it away that sounds like such a waste to me sal shrugged maybe that was why in the news always seemed to be about this or that running low the worlds resources one by one finally exhausted she vaguely remembered news reports on digihdsahyadri of the oil shortages wars in faraway countries full of deserts burning pipelines and burning tanks well now said liam cutting into her thoughts good to have bob back so it is i missed the big old ape sal looked at bob and becks walking half a dozen yards in front of them like a pair of presidential minders eyes panning smoothly in all directions ever ready to throw their lives down in the line of duty while becks moved with practised grace and agility bob lumbered along like a tank still adjusting to the use of his new body i wonder what those two talk about she said liam smiled aye becks nodded at the incoming lowfrequency bluetooth signal she agreed with her colleagues observation she said his grey eyes swivelled to look down at her her mind processed the suggestion for a moment you are correct she said aloud after a moments consideration we should practise verbal communications when possible bobs voice rumbled out past his thick lips it feels like a long time since i have communicated verbally feels she looked at him curiously feels this is a very human word to use he vaguely remembered the muscle movements required to pull off a smile for a moment as he worked his lips he looked like a horse baring its teeth agreed humans use unspecific terms of measurement often in their verbal communications words like feels seems affirmative she stored that observation then looked at him you seem to have absorbed more human behavioural characteristics than i have yet we are both running identical versions of the ai i am running version of wg systems miltech combat operative ai module confirmed he nodded i am running the same version number they walked in silence for a while it is my observation that the siliconcarbon interface between the processor and the undeveloped organic brain has produced unanticipated sideeffects said becks additional softcoded ai subroutines affirmative replied bob i have also noted this he trawled through terabytes of data stored from months ago during my mission with liam oconnor input from the organic brain allowed my ai to recalibrate mission objective priorities i was able to make a tactical decision to save him yes she said nodding i have access to that memory also that was effective because my ai is a duplicate of yours i benefit from that decision tree advancement she cocked her head a lock of dark hair swinging across a face momentarily frozen in deep thought i believe a human would extend a verbal gesture of gratitude her smile was more goatlike than horselike thank you he acknowledged that affirmative on the last mission i observed some basic principles of humour from the humans would you like me to upload a joke bob nodded affirmative i have very few files on humour she tilted her head and bluetoothed several megabytes of data his way as they walked in silence bob blinked the data away into longterm storage and replayed a memory of jungle terrain standing atop a cliff face and looking down at a group of nervouslooking children it appears you made liam oconnor laugh she nodded cluck cluck she added drily i called him and the others chickens they laughed at this he frowned pondering why did they find this amusing she frowned too puzzled eventually she looked up at him i do not know sal drew up outside the front window of the store this is it she said she called the support units back to join them and they stepped inside a musty smell of mothballs and dust tickling her nose becks and bob led the way in liam following after them what sort of thing do i want large plain coloured woollen smocks replied sal nothing patterned liam nodded and headed off down a cramped aisle spilling over with costumes of all sorts of colours and eras she watched him admiring a pirates costume inspecting its lace cuffs and braiding with a grin on his face she shook her head he looked like a kid in a toy store she turned to see if there was someone in the shop she could ask for some help and was walking back towards the shop front and the dusty front window when something caught her eye something blue something vaguely familiar sitting in a wooden rockingchair to the side of the store window a teddy bear she walked over squatted down to get a better look at it i know you she whispered lifting one of its threadbare paws she remembered this bear this little faded blue bear this oneeyed bear she remembered it from somewhere tumbling head over paws where do i know you from she was pushing her mind to explore the fleeting image when liam called out from the back of the shop sal sal is this any good she got up and headed back into the shops tight warren of musty aisles to try and find him the little bear for now forgotten chapter new york maddy looked round at the sound of the shutter rattling up she saw four pairs of legs and then liam ducking down and stepping into the gloom of the archway here we go he stood up and waved a hand at her you should see the daft bleedin costumes we he stopped dead whos this becks was straightening up beside him as he asked her cool eyes evaluated the visitor this person is adam lewis she answered he should not be here uhhuh said maddy you can say that again bob ducked inside unauthorized presence his deep voice filled the void he must leave immediately relax guys said maddy he already knows too much i cant just turf him out sal was the last in she hit the switch and the shutter descended noisily both support units approached maddy a united wall of disapproving frowns this person is not authorized to be in here this is a security maddy raised her hand i get it its a security breach but heres the thing she nodded at adam he found us we she shrugged guiltily all right i was careless i left a breadcrumb trail that hes followed liam stepped around bob and becks warily looking at the man hes the fella you went to see yes adam lewis she turned to him why dont you say hello adams eyes remained on the intimidating form of bob standing over him uh hi liam broke the stony silence with a proffered hand well now theres always room for another so there is my names liam oconnor adam relieved grasped it and this here is sal she waved hi adam returned the gesture but his eyes flickered towards bob is this the uh support unit you were telling me about maddy am i safe liam followed his gaze and grinned you mean safe from bob he nodded ive heard a little about his uh exploits you mean ripping the arms off bad nazis yup oh now dont you worry about bob hes a good reliable chappie so he is he means well maddy got up from her chair and addressed becks and bob directly as team strategist im authorizing him to be in here in this field office is that understood both support units nodded like children and chorused affirmative she turned to adam temporarily understand until weve checked out this voynich manuscript uh thats fine with me once this is done once we know whats in there then were going to have to figure something out adam lewis you cant stay and we cant have you walking away from this blabbing to everyone he shook his head i wouldnt honestly her eyes narrowed listen he said standing up ive sat on the fact that i know time travel exists for seven years i havent told a soul in all that time i wouldnt he shook his head really i wouldnt it would ruin me and ruin my professional reputation apart from anything else id never get another data security contract again maddy pursed her lips i can imagine anyway he added ive been there before treated like a complete nut no one believing me been a laughingstock no thanks i dont fancy that again liam put his hands on his hips well you seem all right to me chap the support units both remained quiet four grey eyes silently appraising him maddy turned to them and you two youre not going to rip him to pieces as soon as my backs turned are you bob spoke for them both negative adam lewis has been temporarily authorized he offered the man a hand the size of a baseball glove i am pleased to meet you adam lewis he rumbled adam grasped it lightly uh sure pleased to meet you becks did the same offering a slender but equally deadly hand sure shes not going to maddy laughed awkwardly twist your finger off again negative replied becks with a friendly smile grasping his hand not unless i am ordered to maddy grinned and pushed her glasses up her nose well ok great introductions made we need to set you two support units up for the trip data uploads relevant history period languages the whole deal she looked at adam you said youve got a good knowledge of this bit of history he nodded twelfthcentury history its become something of an obsession good then ill need your help putting together the data package you can start by giving bob and becks a verbal briefing on the historical situation what you were telling me earlier about the political situation richard and john and all that all right she turned to liam and sal a quiet word he dies maddy watched their guest through the open door of the hatchery he was sitting on the arm of one of the armchairs and talking bob and becks through the relevant bits of plantagenetera history the hatchery was illuminated by the soft peach glow of half a dozen growth tubes each holding a curledup foetus maintained in stasis and ready to be activated and grown at the touch of a control screen they hummed softly the gentle aquariumlike noise of the pumps of their filtration systems he dies i looked him up when soon very soon jayzus uttered liam how thats not important the point is even if he does blab theres not much chance for him to get anyone to listen and anyway no ones likely to believe him remember the poor guys been a laughingstock before i dont understand why you let him in said sal maddy bit her lip i didnt have much choice he turned up on our doorstep he knows were time travellers i couldnt just tell him to go away could i anyway he knows everything there is to know about the voynich she turned to liam and about the time period youre going back to and if were going to try and find out what else is in that document having the only guy to have ever decoded some of it around might be a smart move sal nodded this is true maddy sighed i feel like im pushing you two on this its not like the last two times when we had no choice but to act and act fast this time i dunno this time maybe we could just let this go let some other team worry about it but theres been a change not a big one ill admit but its right under our nose and its ok mads liam put a hand on her shoulder we got a job so an important one sal frowned unhappily maybe i got it wrong maybe that movie was always on and i just didnt notice it before maddy shook her head you havent been wrong yet she glanced at adam again thing is what he decoded tell them maddy tell them about the message in the safety deposit box what he decoded sounds too much like an important message you know like our kind of message we need to know liam grinned ahhh itll be fun anyway knights and maidens and maybe even a chance to meet robin hood i cant wait to go itll be interesting to see said sal lowering her voice pointedly to see how our two pet killing machines work together what punch and judy said maddy she nodded thoughtfully thisll be a good field test for bob i guess aye and this adam do we trust him asked sal not really said maddy but hes here right now and i figure what he knows may prove useful and this is going to sound harsh but he dies really soon anyway seriously said sal liam looked at her and youre going to let him die she sighed i have to its the way we have to do things isnt it chapter new york liam climbed up the creaking ladder behind bob and becks bob was the first into the displacement tube with a hefty splash of water why the big water tube asked adam maddy was busy at the computer table discussing portal coordinates with computerbob so sal answered for her its filled with a mixture of water and disinfectant so they wont be carrying back any of those bugs on your skin oh right and its also a buoyancy device so we send back them and the water and nothing else she pointed to the small yardwide crater in the middle of the archways floor weve had to open a portal not using the tube a couple of times and thats the result we end up sending a chunk of floor back too which is not good becks splashed into the water beside bob kicking her legs to stay afloat and holding a plastic bag stuffed with clothes in one hand maddy finished finalizing the coordinates and activated the countdown she joined sal and adam standing round the bottom of the tube all right then five minutes until launch righto said liam sitting atop the ladder and letting his bare feet dangle into the cold water just remember guys its january dark times her voice reverberated around the archway adam nodded king richards been away for four years crusading in the holy land in the absence of the king englands become a lawless place the kings brother john is struggling to maintain order and failing badly so you need to be careful all right this is bandit country liam cocked a mischievous eyebrow not like in the flickers then adam shook his head sorry no nothing at all like the films im afraid no men in tights or maidens with golden locks waiting to be rescued from disneylike castles its a dark and brutal time warring factions barons vying for power roaming bands of bandits mercenaries and murderers be careful said maddy all youre doing is looking for this kirklees place and find this cabot guy sound him out but be discreet liam ok be very liams face straightened time to be serious hey mads i know i know discreet bob and becks have been uploaded with french which you may need she added its spoken by much of the aristocracy added adam the merchants and lowborn of the time on the other hand speak a primitive form of english just bear in mind the pronunciation of words we use today will be very different anyway said maddy the support units can do the talking if youre struggling you can use them as translators if its too difficult to understand whats being said right maddy realized she was fussing and clucking like an overprotective mother she turned and glanced at one of the screens behind her so three minutes and twenty seconds youve got winter clothes said sal its going to be very cold i think wrap up tight when you get there liam raised the ziploc plastic bag he was holding in his left hand is this not going to cause a contamination you know the plastic biodegradable replied maddy bury the bags quite deep theyll break down over a few years she shrugged well they should break down if the ecolabels kosher she checked the clock again you should probably get in the water now liam he nodded and eased himself down into the cold water aghh hate this bit maddy climbed the ladder to the top and squatted down beside their bobbing heads all right so ive set a return window at the same location you arrive in it will open as normal for only a couple of minutes therell be one set to open an hour after your arrival a second window for twentyfour hours after a third window set for a week after and then of course the emergency sixmonth window is that clear liam bob and becks all nodded silently two minutes called sal maddy reached a hand down to liams bare shoulder and tapped it gently please dont go missing again im not sure my nerves can take another freakin crisis well be ffine said liam through chattering teeth a quick looksee a qquick chat with this mr cabot about this voynik thing and then bback home in time ffor tea is there any way we can communicate with them adam called up you know while theyre back in the past yes she replied over her shoulder we can beam a signal to them but they cant talk back could ii not use this vvoynik bbook said liam information it is pronounced voynich corrected becks maddy shook her head no hopefully thisll be a quick inandout and no need like last time to leave any fossils lying around right liam nodded ssee you ssoon then she rested her hand on his feeling a growing sense of guilt at sending him back through time was it really necessary this time how much damage was this particular journey going to do to his body maddy get a grip she squeezed his knuckles gently see you soon liam she looked at bob you keep him safe all right affirmative liam oconnor is the operative there seemed to be a note of affection somewhere in that deep growl and to becks you clear on the mission parameters becks nodded calmly affirmative maddy called sal you need to get down now twenty seconds left she clambered down the ladder and took a couple of steps back from the bottom of the tube as sal counted out the last ten seconds adam was gazing with unconcealed wonder at the workings of the displacement machine a rack of circuitry and looped wires the arch filled with the increasing hum of suppressed energy building up and eager to be unleashed is that buzzing noise normal he asked but his voice was all but lost against the increasing electrical hum seven six continued sal maddy fought a growing urge to yell out an abort maybe this was one mission that wasnt theirs to worry about maybe she should have consulted with foster first maybe she should have sent a message forward to the future to check if anyone else was handling it there were probably a dozen or more maybes she could come up with four three fact is sal spotted a small time wave and they were dutybound not to walk away from that fact is there was a man standing here in their archway who really shouldnt be who really shouldnt know about them and what they were up to and yes fact is i need to know what pandora is what does it mean who wants me to know about it two one too late for second thoughts now maddy energy pulsed out of the machinery beside the tube and with a loud echoing thud of flexing perspex liam the two support units and several dozen gallons of water were instantly gone adam filled the silence with his own whispered voice absolutely incredible chapter kirklees priory yorkshire a heavy and wet landing liam staggered under the impact dropping to his knees as the white mist of chaos space quickly evaporated from around him ow he yelped as he slowly attempted to get to his bare feet the ground beneath him was a lumpy dark soil rendered as hard as sharpedged rock by a thick morning frost shivering in just his boxer shorts he looked up to see the three of them were standing in the middle of a small and empty windswept field the lifeless light of a pale sun hiding behind featureless scudding clouds made the winter morning seem like a forlorn twilight llovely liam shuddered hugging himself we should get dressed immediately advised bob tttoo rright he chattered he slid back the zip of his plastic bag and pulled out a thick coarse woollen robe of olive green and eagerly pulled it over his head ignoring the scratching against his skin next a pair of thick cotton leggings not technically of the period but the best they could get at short notice as a precaution sal had unpicked the brand label and wash instructions it looked convincing enough to liams eye and hopefully no one was going to be studying his undergarments too closely finally a pair of soft leather shoes with wooden soles picked up at the fancydress hire store and a length of braided rope to secure the robe around his waist as they dressed in hurried silence he watched a dozen crows circling in the greywhite sky above their cawing echoed across the stillness like a caution he listened to the mournful hum of a fresh wind and the dry rustle of dead leaves picked up and tossed from one ploughed furrow into the next its nnot wwhat i expected he uttered his teeth still chattering as he cinched the rope belt tightly round him beckss head appeared through the neckhole of a muddy brown dress what were you expecting liam oconnor he shrugged green woods sunny meadows may flowers she frowned and cocked her head why it is winter liam watched a plume of his breath curl twist and drift away from him dunno really i just recommendation said bob we should dispose of these bags immediately agreed bob kicked at the ground and dislodged a dark clod of soil then squatted down and began digging with his big hands like a dog burrowing for a bone liam handed becks his bag and then took the opportunity to study their surroundings ahead of them the field ended at the edge of a wood he turned behind them the field rolled over the gentle brow of a hill and beyond that he could just make out a thin line of smoke drifting up from the top of a stone chimney hey theres something over there he said affirmative both support units chorused liam tutted at them both whatve i told you two about that the affirmative thing sounds wrong so it does even more so now were here bob stood up straight as becks placed the bags in the hole and began kicking soil in to fill it up the folds of his grey robe stretching over hard slabs of muscle we should adopt the vernacular language of from this point onwards becks nodded affirmative they both froze for a moment both blinking both busy retrieving data finally they stirred to life once more liam shrugged are you two all done bob nodded ay serrr we now can speake bothe in auld anglishe en outra said becks finishing the plasticbag burial and stamping down the dark soil with a woodenclogged foot nous sommes en mesure de parler en francais normand well liam grinned i am impressed he nodded towards the thin smudged column coming from the stone chimney and for the first time his nose detected the inviting odour of wood smoke is that the way we need to go then becks nodded oui cest la destination continu tu doit trois cents cinquantesix pieds dans cette direction ay added bob seeke ye beyonde yon furlong we sholde find liam raised his hands i cant understand a thing youre saying now three hundred and fiftysix feet in that direction said becks we should be entering the perimeter of the kirklees priory according to boundary data of that time ahh liam scratched at his ribs itching already from the coarse material much better could i suggest while its just us on our own you speak normal bob and becks looked at each other and exchanged a nod shall we he rubbed his cold hands together and maybe whoevers over there can rustle us up a nice bacon sandwich or so new york so what happens now asked adam maddy pointed to the displacement machinery we get ready to open up the portal again in about half an hour it should be fully recharged by then he looked confused i thought you said we give them anhour before bringing them back time doesnt run the same said sal that sort of confused me at first as well for them an hour will pass said maddy but doesnt mean we need to wait an hour in about thirty minutes well be charged up i could send you back in time to some point and arrange to bring you back a whole week later but the moment after i sent you i could tap in the timestamp for one week later and open up the portal again for you a week wouldve passed for us here just a few seconds its not like symmetrical if you see what i mean he nodded i get it she turned to the desk mic bob can you set the data for the first return window affirmative maddy she turned back to adam knowing them theyll probably miss the first window anyway she huffed a laugh i dont know why i bother adam looked at the desk cluttered with soda cans pizza boxes and scraps of paper its almost as messy as my apartment sal sighed i clean up maddys the untidy one he sat down beside them and stared at the monitors so youre patched into the internet uhhuh maddy clicked with a mouse and minimized a couple of dialogue boxes on one of the monitors access to pretty much every linked database in the world i think good god he said pointing at one of the screens is that is that what i think it is the white house intranet yup youve actually hacked into it id like to say i managed to do that myself she chuckled but the field office has always had a line in since we joined she clicked the mouse for a laugh i go rooting around in president bushs email inbox she giggled he likes sending pictures of cats doing funny things to his buddies check it out adam sputtered laughter at an image of a sleeping kitten on a windowsill with a tiny yankees baseball cap perched on its head youve got to be kidding uttered adam she smiled and clicked the mouse to close the presidents inbox she knew there were emails buried in there that hinted about tomorrows events events a person from the present shouldnt know about not today anyway she neednt have worried though adams mind was swimming around elsewhere he turned to look at the perspex tube and the rack of wires on the floor beside it so maddy you said we can actually talk to them while theyre in the past uhhuh if we know where and when they are it means we can aim a precise beam of tachyon particles at the point in space they would have been in eighthundredandwhatever years ago the support units are the big ape and the tall girl who nearly broke my finger she laughed yes them they can both detect tachyon particles they have embedded tech in their heads theyre sort of clones with computers for brains but they cant send tachyon beams back to us said sal why not the energy it requires said maddy and theyd need a transmitter cant fit all of that and a supercomputer in their heads so how do they talk back to you they cant we sort of operate blind on that front we just have to hope theyre sticking to the plan but they can talk to us said sal kind of maddy winced a little she really didnt want adam knowing too much about the way they did things liam did it last time continued sal he left a message for us to find all the way back in the late cret yes maddy cut in stepping lightly on sals toes to shut her up no need for adam to know just how far back in time their technology could take a person yes weve used what we call drop points before a document or some kind of artefact that we know they can interact with in the past and that we know to closely observe in the present adams face creased thoughtfully for a moment so thats what you think the voynich manuscript is something somebodys using to communicate with the future she nodded uhhuh it might be we just need to know he shook his head silently i just this is im struggling here to take this all in maddy clacked her tongue its a lot i was kind of the same at first me too said sal adam grinned i knew all this time i knew you were for real that i wasnt mad but this really is absolutely incredible he giggled like an oversugared toddler yes my god thats it thats the only word that does this any justice incredible sal sighed you get used to it after a while chapter kirklees priory yorkshire they watched from either side of the path mouths slung open in curious os a dozen monks whod been tending lanes of withered grapevines as liam flanked by his two support units strode up the dirt path towards the priorys main entrance morning called out liam selfconsciously one of the monks dropped his basket and scrambled across the vegetable gardens towards a nearby barn stammering latin blessings to himself the others shrank back their eyes darting nervously across all three of them but lingering unhappily on becks standing in the doorway was a young lad liam guessed he was a year younger than himself watching them approach fear making his eyes comically round ye cccanaught entre hhhier the boy stammered liam cocked his head then turned to becks did he just say we cant enter here affirmative well its not so hard then this old english he turned back to the young man wearing the white robe and black apron of a cistercian monk can you understand me he said slowly the boy swallowed eyes darting left and right and up at bobs expressionless bigboned face eventually his shaking head nodded aaye liam relaxed a little this is going to be easier than i thought were after someone called cabot hes supposed to live here do you know him the boys eyes narrowed this is kirklees priory right we got the right place have we kirklaigh the boy uttered yes kirklees priory this place the boy nodded slowly aye kirklaigh and cabot is there a man called cabot living here the frowning again information uttered becks quietly what your pronunciation of the name may be incorrect well then how would you say it try carboh the boys eyes widened at the sound of that sseek ye ssebastien cabot liam shrugged aye thats him the boy pointed a wobbling finger towards a low thatched stable on the far side of the gardens yonder bbrother sebastien tends to the hhorses liam handed the boy a broad smile thanking you they crossed the gardens watching the silent monks edging back from them in the stillness a cluster of loose chickens happily pecked and clucked brainlessly liam pulled open the barn door it creaked deafeningly in the still grey morning inside it was dark save for faint dapples of weak light that had found a way through threadbare patches of thatch above he could hear the hoarse rasp of animals breathing is there a saybasteeen caybow in here he cringed at his own mangling of the pronunciation aye a voice called back grating and deep who seekes him uhh my names liam he heard the scrape and rustle of movement from somewhere among dark stalls and a moment later a robed figure emerged into the thin light of the open doorway cabot wore the same cistercian robe and apron but looked unlike the other palefaced monks still standing amid furrowed lanes of turned soil like forlorn ghosts he stood an inch shorter than liam but a great deal broader wide shoulders accustomed to bearing old muscle a greying beard covered pockmarked and leathery skin and battlehardened muddy green eyes stared out beneath a thick brow broken by a livid pink scar that ran diagonally across the bridge of his nose and down across his right cheek liam is it he growled softly liam oconnor but you can call me liam liam ye say he said again rolling the name around his mouth tis a name ive not heard before cabot glanced over his shoulder at bob ye have the look of a manatarms sir nay replied bob the rumble of his deep baritone stirred the horses in the darkness mr cabot is there a place we can talk somewhere liam looked back over his shoulder at a dozen faces still slackjawed still standing motionless with garden tools held in their hands watching and listening curiously somewhere private cabot glanced at becks she cannot enter the priory itself my brothers seek to avoid distractions of the flesh the stables will do the old man nodded and waved them into the dim interior of the stables at the far end of the long building were guest lodgings little more than four bare stone walls a couple of wooden cots softened with a haystuffed sack and a tiny rectangular window in the gable wall that let in the poorest glimmer of light he sat down on one of the cots and gestured for the others to do likewise dark times as these cabot began quietly my brothers outside are full of fear evil stalks these woods stalks this country so tis he spread his hands we are all most cautious of strangers his eyes narrowed and the scar across his brow flexed ye know of my name liam of connor tell me how is that liam gave a small defensive shrug thats a little difficult to explain mr cabot but well we came here because we got a message to find you a message say by who well thats the thing we dont exactly know so ye seek me now ye have me for what reason is it liam made a face not really sure of that either cabot shook his head confused for a moment then he laughed what good is this then i have horses i need tend to this morning he made to get up liam decided to play their trump card mr cabot have you heard of a thing called the voynich manuscript cabot stopped and resumed his seat considering liams words for a moment then shook his head voynich i have not heard of such a thing well then liam bit his lip have you written some sort of important manuscript of course not cabot laughed i wield a sword far better than i do a quill well how about someone else here is anyone working on any manuscripts scrolls of any kind he shook his head again we keep scrolls of prayers and records of the priory this is a place of quiet devotion to god that is all now if that be the last of yer questions i must ask ye and yer fellows to go about yer business he said hefting himself wearily to his feet liam cursed quietly almost as an afterthought he had one last try mr cabot what do you know of pandora the word stopped cabot in his tracks he glanced at liam at the other two finally in a voice almost as soft as a whisper he spoke ye know of this great what do i say now liam decided the only thing he could do was to bluff his way he nodded sternly oh yes mr cabot i know all about pandora these two the old man asked a furtive glance again at bob and becks they both took liams lead and nodded cabot pulled absently on his beard studying liam silently ye do not have the look of the order about ye lad ye look barely old enough to be a squire order what order jayzus what do i say now but ye do sir he said to bob a fighting man if ever i saw one ye have come back bob glanced at liam for help all liam could do was nod vigorously for him to say something aye said bob slowly i have returned do ye know of king richards predicament does he return bobs eyelids flickered for a moment before he replied king richard will return in five months cabot cursed then his rage will know no bounds there will be much blood he will kill all in his way to find it again god have mercy on us if we have not found it by then it liam looked at cabot find err it he wished he had the slightest idea what it was right now it would make bluffing his way through this conversation a thousand times easier yes it is lost they say it is the hooded man who has taken it the hooded man cabot nodded yes know ye not of this liam shook his head weve uh we only recently returned from the holy land liam thought it best to just nod briskly at that right yes then tis possible ye will not have heard two winters ago a party of our templar brethren had it in their care they were to bring it back to safety away from danger away from the saracens from saladin but it was that they were attacked in woods not so far from here a party of our orders best and bravest knights cabot looked up at the small window a squire one who escaped the murder told of a single hooded man one man who attacked them and killed every last knight and many of the sergeantsatarms he said he saw with his own eyes blows land full square on the hood many crossbow bolts and arrows pass through it but whatever was inside and surely not a man did not but stop until the forest path was soaked with their blood and it the the pandora yes said cabot he took it he took away with him the word of god and it has been lost these last two years liam glanced at the other two word of god my fellow cistercians do not know what they fear more the wrath of king richard on his return or this this hooded wraith but i know it is richard coeur de lion i would fear the most he almost spat the nickname richard the lionheart i fought alongside him i have seen the bloodshed he leaves in his path thousands of prisoners beheaded at his whim unspeakable things done to them in the name of the lord cabot shook his head he will burn the woods of england black level every village and put the sword to every man woman and child in his way until he has the grail back in his possession he cares not for this country the sound of voices outside the barn caught cabots attention my brothers are unhappy at yer arrival he shot a quick look at becks and the presence of a woman this will unsettle them he got up i will be back i trust yer intentions are friendly yes we mean no harm bob rumbled were friends said liam that seemed to reassure cabot they watched him weave his way through the darkness towards the slatted light of the barn door he turned to the others did he just say grail affirmative said bob becks cocked her head for a moment consulting her database information there are many historical crossreferences linking the knights templar to an object referred to as the holy grail holy grail whats that there are many references to the holy grail being the cup jesus christ drank from at the last supper supposedly having magical properties she looked at him this is of course entirely illogical it is more likely to refer to some religious text we also have detailed files added bob that describe the templars as being a military religious order set up to protect christian pilgrims entering the holy lands from muslim raiders but also many uncited records that claim the real reason for the establishment of the templars was specifically to seek and safeguard the holy grail liam cocked an eyebrow hold on so does that mean this grail and pandora are one and the same thing both of them nodded that is a possibility added becks liams eyes narrowed i suppose weve missed our onehour return window two minutes and twentyseven seconds to go all right no point running back across that field like mad things we can catch the one tomorrow presuming mr cabot will put us up here for tonight we can talk to him some more about this holy grail thing chapter new york the three of them stared in silence at the wavering image in the middle of the floor is that is that sky im seeing there said adam squinting at the shimmering mirage it looked like the flickering reflection one might see staring down a dark well a dancing glinting shifting reflection that hinted more than showed things yes said maddy and that looks like a field or something good god he whispered so im seeing a field and and the actual sky from nine hundred years ago but no liam and support units said sal ok maddy said stepping back to the desk and hitting a button its been open long enough they must have decided to overnight it there the portal puffed out of existence i hate it when this happens said maddy i wish they could just drop us a line and let us know what theyre up to she tapped the desk mic to wake up the version of bobs ai installed on the computer system bob yes maddy begin recharge for the twentyfourhour window affirmative adam joined her but you said there is a way for them to communicate what did you call it again a droppoint document thats it so why dont we tell them to use the voynich you know if they manage to find it no she shook her head cant she pushed her glasses up the bridge of her nose youve cracked it someone else might and anyway if another team are using it and we start overwriting their messages with ours who knows what chaos thatll cause all right then he said what about gravestones both sal and maddy looked at him uh well not exactly a gravestone as such but its in the graveyard at the back of kirklees priory what is asked sal inscribed masonry there are dozens that date back to the building of the priory you can find them if you dig around a bit what youre saying i send us over to england and we snuffle around some cemetery no need he replied ive been there i went there years ago after all that voynich publicity died down i wanted to know what was so important about kirklees so i went and checked it out for myself theres not much to see there of course the old priory building and a gated orchard which is all bloody brambles and stinging nettles but i did uncover several slabs of masonry some of them inscribed with latin theyre grave markers knocked over or fallen but you know still intact and you can still read the lettering i photographed some of them maddy laughed and what youre suggesting they carve mission updates for us he shrugged that would work wouldnt it if carving a message in a stone causes one of your time waves then surely the slight change in history would change the content of the photos i took he looked from maddy to sal and back to maddy again or am i getting this all wrong maddy stared at him silently for a moment before finally snapping her fingers yes yes i guess that could work she glanced quickly at sal if we need it but you know what i really dont plan to lose liam in history again not this time she looked at a display window showing the displacement machines charge progress bar thirty minutes and well open the portal again im sure theyll be right there waiting for us chapter kirklees priory yorkshire liam heard the scraping of footsteps and the horses beyond in the barn stir before he heard the light tap on their wooden door yes i have food for ye it was sebastien cabot ah liams stomach had been grumbling for the last hour the short winter day had passed without an opportunity to speak with cabot in private again and liam was beginning to wonder whether his decision to overnight in was going to give them an opportunity to learn any more he hopped up eagerly and opened the door leading into their guest quarters the young monk hed seen standing in the priorys doorway earlier today brought in a couple of wooden bowls and a loaf of bread behind him cabot entered with another bowl and a flagon of something that sloshed around as he placed it on the dirt floor a hot broth for a cold day he said and a little mead to warm yer toes cabot dismissed the boy and then sat down on one of the wooden cots by candlelight he looked older than he had this morning the folds on his face both wrinkles and the long twisting scar told of a long life and not much of it lived here in such a lonely and forlorn place my brothers seemed to have spent more time today gossiping like old women than in contemplation and prayer liam picked up one of the bowls and hungrily dipped a torn hunk of bread into the thick broth so mr cabot you said earlier that you fought alongside king richard he nodded aye in a real battle many battles lad but youre a cistercian monk so you are i didnt think your kind got involved in wars and fighting cabot looked up at him ive not always been of this order lad before two winters gone now i was one of the order of templars you were a templar knight asked becks not a knight he replied i am not nobleborn but a sergeant sergeant said liam tugging another hunk of crusty bread from the loaf information said bob sergeant lowerborn professional soldier also serving in auxiliary roles within the order ie maintenance of equipment and property cabots eyes narrowed ye have an odd manner about ye sir bob returned his stare for a moment then offered a friendly display of upper and lower teeth and you fought with richard so you said on this last crusade aye cabot shook his head wistfully tis the worst of things ten years i have been in the holy land in the service of templars five years of it peace of a kind after saladin took jerusalem there was a peace liam nodded adam had given them a history class before they set off jerusalem had been besieged by saladin and his massive army in and had fallen after nearly ninety years of christian rule it was back in muslim hands but saladin had chosen to be shrewd in the matter rather than slaughter every last christian in the city he proclaimed christians would be at liberty to live there to worship there that christian pilgrims would be allowed to enter the city at will and worship at their sacred sites all this in the hope that outrage in europe at the city falling would be somewhat lessened but he hadnt figured on the likes of king richard and king philip ii of france men who both hungered for battle and glory and a cause to hide behind the third crusade was king richards vainglorious attempt to reclaim jerusalem and acre and jaffa too the other major cities taken by saladin but with king richards arrival came a bloodshed i have never seen before cabots eyes glistened in the dark he took acre the saracens surrendered to richard and he had every last one of them beheaded there was a hill of heads a hill that grew gradually out of the moat and spilled on to the plain liam looked down at a potato bobbing in his soup and all of a sudden felt a little less hungry cabot sighed i suspect king richard came not for acre not even for jerusalem he came for what was left behind left behind aye what was left in haste when jerusalem and acre fell to saladin cabots eyes narrowed but ye know of this already yes he smiled drily ye claimed to be of the order earlier but i can see ye are not he glanced at bob and ye sir ye have the look of one but not the manner how is it ye people know of the orders most guarded secret cabots gaze returned to liam how is it ye would know of pandora pray tell who are ye liam looked to both support units for help but both of them stared dully back great he put the bowl of broth down on the dirt floor we perhaps i better give you the truth cabot nodded i think ye better had weve come from well a long way we came here looking for a document called the voynich manuscript and this may sound very strange mr cabot but your name is linked to it your name is in it for some reason ive never heard of the thing i know liam nodded i know i believe you but there was something else mentioned in this manuscript he glanced at the support units neither looked like they were about to caution him to stop pandora what you also called the word of god when we spoke earlier cabot was reluctant to speak liam decided to push him you also called it the holy grail i cannot speak of these things with ye lad tis the templars business alone but its not any more is it liam couldnt help a mischievous grin your brothers went and lost it you said cabot pressed his lips together stubbornly i cannot talk of such things but you did talk about it liam leaned forward look i think its this grail we need to find and if your templar brothers have lost it to some robber then maybe we can help cabot laughed the three of ye ye would hunt through all the woods of nottingham for the hooded man and take it back from him affirmative replied bob the old mans laughter dried up as he stared at the flickering light of the candle between them there are some fools who say he is but the devil himself cabot shrugged he has attracted men starving men into the woods men who follow him like a king like a god because it seems he cannot be killed and because of the raids on the taxmen they have coin and they have food fighting for him there are stories that he has a great strength can tear a man in two with his bare hands that he can run as fast as a horse can charge but most of all that he is immortal that he cannot be killed cabot smiled wryly these are dark troubled times and people tell stories the poor the hungry look to devilish stories like this cabot sighed truth is this hooded man whether tis true what they say about him or not he is stirring up unrest and trouble among the poor and starving and worse still he has the grail liam chewed silently on his warm brothsoaked bread strong enough to tear a man apart he glanced at bob another support unit another team in the area cabot suddenly looked at bob and becks will ye two not eat are ye not hungry both shook their heads we are fine said becks liam cleared his throat you said you wanted to know who we are mr cabot aye well were from the same place as this hooded man cabot stared at him ye know him not really but i think i know what he is tell me then im not sure i can mr cabot its very complicated but i know if we could track him down in all those woods and if we had enough help enough people liam glanced at his support units im pretty sure my friends here could make him hand back what he took cabot studied them silently for a long while i have not met the likes of ye before there is a very strange manner about all three of ye i almost half believe what ye say mr cabot said liam grinning you have no idea how strange we are the man sensed his humour in that and shared the smile then there is a person i have a half a mind to take ye to a man i know who is sorely worried about the growing unrest in these parts and moreover worried that he will face king richards wrath should he return to find the grail is lost if he sees truth in ye if he believes ye can get back this grail then i am sure he would be willing to provide ye all the help ye might need who a man i provided sword training to as a boy a poor swordsman by any standards but his heart tis good mostly who the kings younger brother the earl of cornwall and gloucester john lackland he is known as chapter kirklees priory yorkshire liam checked over his shoulder to ensure that none of the monks had followed them out of the priory gardens and into the field they were safely over the brow and out of sight here it was as grey and dark as cold and unwelcoming as yesterday morning mercifully on cue the air before them shimmered he could see maddy and sal and that englishman adam and the dim lights of the archway twisting and undulating like a film of oil on rippling water they stepped through and moments later the three of them were standing back in the stuffy warmth of the archway liam rubbed his arms relishing the heat for the last twentyfour hours hed been doing little more than shivering adam was silently shaking his head and marvelling at their return well said maddy well we found your cabot so we did replied liam but i could murder for a lovely cup o tea before i do anything else sure and something to eat maddy looked at her watch the day had almost gone it was monday midafternoon and most of the cafes and restaurants theyd been to were usually quiet at this time sure why not you better get changed though you look like a bunch of krishnas new york so what this fella cabot suggested is hed take us down to meet this john fella adam lowered his fork so fast it dinked noisily on his salad plate john john lackland wicked king john liam nodded aye thats the fella my god he gasped thats i wish i he turned to maddy i should go i should go back with him and the two uh liam looked at bob and becks sitting side by side opposite and slurping on a bowl of chicken soup each big ape and psycho girl said maddy he shrank guiltily before them but nodded sorry no ive no idea how many agency protocols ive already broken allowing you to sit in on this mission im not sending you back in time as well but i know this history like the back of my hand ive read sorry no i cant take any more chances with you god knows what fosterd say if he knew what was going on foster ill explain later she turned to liam so this is what the message was about then do you think seek cabot at kirklees someone used the voynich she glanced at adam and used adam to get that particular message through to us and this is why so that you could retrieve the holy grail pandora added sal pandora holy grail same thing said maddy dismissively so you can retrieve this document scroll book whatever exactly it is from this behooded robber guy who you suspect might be a support unit from another timeriders team liam nodded thats about the size of it sal steepled her fingers beneath her chin what if the grail was meant to be lost i mean thats why its such a big legend right because it vanished you mean just let it go replied liam let it remain lost yes look around you history hasnt been changed that much apart from the cruddylooking dicaprio movie based on adams story maybe we should just let this one go liam took a bite of his burger mr cabot called it the word of god sounds pretty important to me and anyway if king richard comes back and finds that its been nicked because his little brother john couldnt keep order back home in england couldnt keep it safe cabot says hell kill him hmmm i guess theres another thing said maddy if theres a support unit running amok back there then that really is a contamination risk we cant sit this one out sal she turned to adam youre the history expert whats going on with king richard whats the situation in king richards crusade ended in failure in said adam he had an inadequate army to take and hold jerusalem knowing that saladin would be able to take back the city with ease he realized an attempt to attack the city was futile so he agrees a truce with saladin and the crusader army disbands and returns home in dribs and drabs richard himself returns to england by ship but bad weather means it ends up shipwrecked on malta and he has to return on foot but hes unlucky as his route home across europe takes him through the land of some duke with a grudge and hes kidnapped hes held for about eighteen months i think while some ransom money is stumped up so in hes just been released or about to be hes due to arrive home in a really bad mood because his crusade has been one big mess and hes coming home to an england bankrupt and on the verge of rebellion right so hes not a happy bunny then said maddy but he got what he went for said liam the grail and then lost it again lost it in england for which hell blame his brother if he does kill his brother said adam that would change things a lot no john means no king john and that could mean no magna carta the others looked at him with faces that said and oh come on the magna carta is the basis of english law its what defines england he looked at maddy and perhaps what defines america too oh god youre right it would be a significant enough change to cause a wave to alter all this she looked around at the restaurant an expensive one adams choice since hed offered to pay for lunch on his gold american express it was quiet except for the clack of dishes coming through swing doors into the kitchen just them in here right now and a couple of businessmen on the far side maddy looked out of the blue tinted window down on to times square we have to follow the trail she said eventually if cabot seems keen to take you to meet king john hes not king yet adam pointed out maddy shrugged and continued then i suggest you go along with it for now because this because somethings going on back there someone has gone to a lot of trouble to get us back there and talking to this cabot guy the pandora message maddy sal looked up from her plate why is pandora so important to you well you going to tell them that old dilemma again be safe and tell no one thats what the scribbled note had said be safe tell no one surely though sal and liam could know surely it wouldnt be dangerous to share this with them liams eyes were on her now maddy what is it but adam lewis was really just a stranger perhaps only a hapless victim caught up in this thing the less he knew the better adam would you please excuse us for a few minutes he looked hurt but then finally nodded all right ill uhh go and settle the bill she watched him cross the deserted restaurant before she turned to the others her voice lowered ive been keeping something from you im sorry what liam you remember our trip to san francisco to get some new clone foetuses aye in the safety deposit box was a handwritten message it was a note addressed to me she took a deep breath still not entirely sure she should be doing this it was handwritten scribbled really like whoever wrote it was in a real hurry sal fidgeted impatiently maddy just tell us ok ok she said well it was this maddy look out for pandora were running out of time be safe and tell no one liam and sal exchanged glances bob frowned becks cocked her head in consideration its a warning said maddy i didnt i really didnt give it much thought while we were sorting out the dinosaur business and you know i guess i was just trying to push it aside trying not to think about it but then she looked up at adam waiting for the waiter to process his american express card but then our friend over there decoded that message it makes a little more sense to me now said liam you being so keen for us to go back and take a looksee im sorry she shook her head so sorry i didnt share it with you both earlier but it said tell no one i didnt know what to its ok said sal we know now that makes it ok aye said liam he pressed his lips a half smile no more secrets she shook her head and sighed having that one was bad enough adam lewis was finishing his business by the till and getting ready to come back so the message is just between us ok this is agency business the others nodded adam approached their table tentatively safe for me to come back now maddy nodded and smiled all done i think we should make a move lots of things to do chapter new york liam nodded with approval at the thermal underwear i got them from a sportswear shop said sal that should keep you warm under your other stuff thank you he said stuffing them into the plastic bag i took the labels off again she added but all the same you should keep the thermals hidden its modern material right maddy joined them around the long kitchen table so im sending you guys back to a couple of minutes in time after we brought you back to avoid a tachyon clash she shared a look with liam not making that mistake again she uttered out of the side of her mouth ok she turned to adam adam you want to tell liam and these two about your idea she flicked a finger at bob and becks standing like two sentinels at the end of the table in their underwear adam nodded theres a way we figured that you can stay in touch but maddy said we cant use the voynich said liam no not using that theres a graveyard at kirklees that dates back to the beginnings of the priory ive actually been there myself and picked through it all loads of broken masonry slabs lost underneath brambles and nettles and what have you if you look youll find them there anyway i took a number of photographs of several of them one in particular was part of a simple gravestone for a man called robert haskette with as the year he died so hell be dead now of course he frowned well when i say now i mean you know the point at which you liam tutted and waved dont worry i get tripped up by the nowthen sort of thing too adam continued hell be dead and his gravestone there already and freshly carved hopefully you just need to look for it becks raised a finger question yes adams eyes flickered up her athletic body then he found himself looking over her shoulder shamefaced cheeks colouring uh what is it err becks you do not intend for us to communicate openly this will present a contamination risk no no of course not this would need to be encoded ideally a code that looks inconspicuous and not out of place on a piece of masonry almost like decoration do you have such a code asked becks indeed yes well its not mine but it can be adapted slightly you got any paper sal quickly skittered over to the computer desk and returned with a pad of paper and a pen thanks ok this is the masonic cipher they call it the pigpen cipher he sketched some crisscross patterns of lines and dots on the paper and then filled them in with letters of the alphabet now what you do is for each letter in your message you use the part of the pattern that the letter is within ill give you an example he scribbled a coded message liam craned his neck forward to get a closer look it meant nothing to him and as adam had said it did just look like a rather uninteresting pattern now see if we take for example the letter x do you see where it sits in the cipher which part of this pattern is it sitting in the part of the large diagonal cross with dots in the lefthand quadrant see the others nodded now look at that coded message the first character matches that bit of the pigpen grid the part that contains the letter x so the first letter of the encoded message is x anyone figure out what the second letter would be sal answered first its an m yup you got it go on see if you can do the rest sal grabbed a pen off the desk and with a grin quickly and easily extracted the encoded message there you go said adam easy as easy peas liam held a finger up but err this is a freemason code isnt it wont that mean any freemason who stumbles across our gravestone will be able to translate our message as well yup which is why we need to adapt it slightly if i jumble the order of the letters now like this adam drew the pattern again but this time filled in the letters in a random order now provided you keep your messages very short so that no frequency analysis techniques can be used then its almost impossible to break unless you throw some serious computer power at it frequency analysis techniques adam was about to explain that to liam but maddy cut in perhaps later she picked up the sheet of paper and held it up for bob and becks to study closely you guys can remember this layout affirmative said bob leaning forward i now have a stored digital image affirmative echoed becks good so thats how youre going to talk to us she tucked the paper into the hip pocket of her jeans for safekeeping and youll need to let us know when and where to open a portal well do the usual thing and plan a daylater one weeklater a fortnightlater and of course one just before the sixmonth critical mission window whats critical about six months asked adam bobs and beckss heads blow up whuh did you just say its a safety measure to ensure the computer tech doesnt fall into the wrong hands maddy wrinkled her nose more sort of a fizzle than a bang really the circuits fry oh right she resumed her briefing so those are the window times liam but since we dont really have a clear mission plan im guessing this is all going to boil down to you telling us where and when you want to be picked up are you ok with that liam nodded aye and youve got these photographs you say adam nodded yes not on me he turned to maddy back at my apartment on my hard drive ill need to go get it she pursed her lips sal or me will have to go with you to get it then what if the gravestone isnt there said sal it should be said adam maddy puffed her cheeks hmmmm well look if it isnt for whatever reason then you come back on the first of the scheduled windows i guess just play it safe dont go wandering off to see king john until you know you can talk to us recommendation first mission task should be to locate the gravestone and send a test message said bob thats quite right replied maddy very sensible bob she looked around at everyone so i think thats it she smiled this is a hunt for something we have no idea what it is or where it is other than some nasty guy with a hood stole it and ran off into the woods so its the usual halfbaked noideawhatweredoing thing again business as usual i guess she dismissed them all with a selfconscious shall we as liam turned to follow bob and becks across the archway and up the ladder she reached out for liam and squeezed his shoulder liam yuh she glanced at the plume of silver hair at his temple and the first faint hint of an age line around his eyes liam im glad i told you and sal the truth it was eating me up sitting on it he hunched his shoulders a load shared is a load halved thats what me auntie doe used to say you stay safe again ok he grinned with punch and judy ill be fine so he turned to go but she held on liam this is an important one you know ive got a real feeling this i dunno that this is going to open doors we find out about pandora and were going to find out more about who were working for she said quietly its a certain mr waldstein isnt it she shrugged so foster once told us i do wonder now theres an idea what foster maybe you should ask the ol fella about pandora while were gone i was sort of thinking of doing that she said thoughtfully i guess now ive told you guys telling him wont hurt right he cocked his head i trust him she smiled at liam realizing that in his cheeky cockeyed grin she could see the ghost of fosters gaunt face yeah me too the archway echoed with the splash of water as bob dropped into the displacement tube chapter kirklees priory yorkshire they found the graveyard towards the rear of the priory a sombre space occupied by only a half dozen stones and a dozen wooden crosses on which hungry beetleblack crows perched studying the frosted white ground for signs of a meal a recent grave marked only by a long hump of turned soil and a simple wooden cross indicated the most recently deceased person to be buried in this place was not considered worthy of a piece of inscribed masonry in the pale grey light they hunkered down beside each grave in turn and noted the names eventually to liams relief they found haskettes grave beside a small oak sapling that had pushed hopefully upwards for sunlight and rustled gently in the bitter cold breeze the grave was marked by a threefoothigh block of pale granite the name and year of death chiselled roughly clearly not by a trained artisan but presumably by one of the cistercian monks recommendation we should inscribe no more than the symbol for an l to indicate you have located the stone said bob liam nodded he was right best to carve no more than was absolutely necessary uh did anyone think to bring a chisel negative he cursed then looked around there had to be something they could improvise with but he could see nothing out here but withered grass and nettles froststiff and frozenhard soil peppered with discarded flakes of worked stone and flint flintthat could do us he began to scrabble in the hard ground to free a piece large enough that it could be used as a makeshift tool when becks quietly came over and tapped the top of his head unnecessary liam oconnor she said uh he looked up just in time to see bob pulling a long lumber nail out of the wooden crucifix of the freshly dug grave with a mournful squeak it came out and the crossbar clattered on to the hard hummock of dark soil disturbing the nearby crows they fluttered away noisily into the tumbling grey sky with caws of complaint errrr you cant just go and do that he said absently blessing himself with the tips of his fingers bob casually strode past him towards the gravestone why not well its its just not right thats a desecration so it is bob was already hunkered down over the gravestone and etching their pigpen symbol for l into its granite surface liam glanced heavenward uhhh really sorry about that if youre watchin tis later in the morning than id hoped to set off called out cabot irritably as he strapped the yoke to a pair of horses that is if ye still wish me to take ye to meet john yes yes we do replied liam whereve ye been to get some fresh air replied liam as they skirted round the vegetable gardens towards the stables he nodded at becks our lady was feeling sick cabot stuck out his chin are ye better now mdear becks glanced quickly at liam for guidance but he stepped in to answer for her shes fine so she is arent you lady rebecca she managed to nod mutely and swiftly adapt her usual tomboy swaggering walk to something that all of a sudden looked a little more feminine as they drew up beside cabot and the cart nobleborn are ye the old mans eyes narrowed as he regarded her mudbrown dress made of coarse material and her peasants clogs lady are ye now he said with a disbelieving tone in his voice hmmm and from what duchy do ye hail then liam looked at her come on becks better make it sound convincing her cool grey eyes returned cabots suspicious stare for a painful few seconds long enough that liam wondered whether hed made a mistake casually introducing her as an aristocrat je viens de la duche dalevingnon en normandy cabots manner changed instantly his flinty soldiers eyes widened maam please forgive my rude manner i just she smiled it is quite all right old man she replied sweetly our mission to recover this item requires a certain anonymity brilliant liam grinned at her bleedin brilliant he could have hugged her there and then but of course now that she was supposedly a highborn that would be inappropriate cabot gestured to the cart a simple wooden trap covered with a canvas awning and two potbellied ponies scraping the frosthardened ground with their hooves impatient to get going tis not much maam but it is all we have here at the priory she nodded calmly almost serenely the vehicle is sufficient and far better ye travel in a humble traders cart than in anything that might attract the interest of bandits added cabot becks nodded indeed liam smiled mlady seems happy cabot looked up at a heavy sky that promised snow then we ought to leave with haste tis three days but only if there is no snow three days to prince johns winter residence he pulled aside the canvas cover at the back of the cart there ye are mlady he said offering a calloused hand to help her up into the trap but she ignored that and hopped up with all the regal grace of a squaddie scrambling up into the back of an army truck liam pursed his lips lady rebeccas a very independent woman so she is aye nodded cabot noticed that bob clambered aboard behind her and the cart dipped and wobbled under his weight best we get going said cabot to liam we will wish to be well clear of the forests before it gets dark later this afternoon chapter new york im not going to run off and find the first news station i can and blab all about you you know maddy followed adam up the steps and through a rotating glass door into a quiet lobby before them the apartment blocks security guard looked up from behind a newspaper and a desk and smiled warmly at adam lovely evening aint it mr lewis isnt it jerry he replied cheerfully unseasonably clement for the time of year jerry looked like the kind of guy whod once worked homicide but been put out to pasture he sat back in a seat that creaked beneath his weight and laughed thas what i love about you brits always got somethin real smartsoundin to say about the weather adam shared his goodnatured cackle with a wave and swept past his desk towards the elevators at the back of the foyer he jabbed a button and they watched in silence as a number display slowly counted down and listened to the muted rumble of earlyevening traffic outside the rustle of the newspaper in jerrys hands with a ping the brass doors opened and they stepped inside adam hit his floor number and the doors swished quietly closed i cant take that chance maddy finally answered you still dont trust me nope id be a fool to since we only met this morning he laughed well actually we met seven years ago some of his smile spread her way i guess she looked around the dark wood and brass of the elevator im guessing the rent in this block is pretty high very a soft chime announced their arrival at the fourteenth floor and the doors opened revealing thick carpet and more dark wood you think this looks pricey just wait till you see my gaff gaff he led her down the hallway and finally stopped outside a door pulling a set of jangling keys from the inside pocket of his jacket the door opened with a soft click and he pushed it open gesturing her through first after you madam oh very gentlemanly said maddy she stepped in and almost immediately she had to stifle a gasp a wall of floortoceiling tinted windows looked out on a forest of manhattan skyscrapers bathed in the rich vanilla light of a setting sun she crossed a large openplan lounge until her nose was almost jammed against the glass oh my god this is so cool i certainly pay for that view he replied stepping in after her draping his jacket over the back of a chrome bar stool and hitting his answerphone maddy turned to watch there were messages of course there were several from work several female voices each enquiring what he was up to this evening adam shuffled through them dismissing them casually he offered her a selfconscious fluttering smile sorry about that she shrugged dont worry clearly youre much in demand now then he said i just need to dig out that old drive of mine he stepped past an exercise bike towards a chest beside the window most of my junk from my university days is in here somewhere he lifted the lid and carefully pulled out a dogeared warhammer box and chuckled could never say goodbye to all my fantasy stuff you can never let it go you know not if youve put the time in painting them that i did he dug back in pulling out one or two other assorted items for the first time since this morning she began to recognize once again the edgy lankhaired young man shed visited with becks back in a loner an awkward geek obsessed with dark corners of knowledge puzzles numbers codes conspiracies she looked around his apartment and realized it was a reflection of him a reflection of his attempt to completely reinvent himself no longer a narrowshouldered pigeonchested nerd with bad skin and bad breath but now the very essence of success smart intelligent confident its in here somewhere all the stuff i did on the voynich all my degree stuff on dead languages i never let any of it go he looked up at her because i always knew id be needing it again she crossed the lounge and carefully perched on the saddle of the exercise bike she looked down at his things warhammer you were into warhammer she giggled he hunched his shoulders oh yeah but i keep that all locked away the people i work alongside people i bring back here they uh they dont get that kind of thing if you know what i mean hell no she said i bet most of your girlfriends wouldnt be too impressed he pulled out a plastic bucket full of a tangle of wires plug adaptors and electronic doodads i used to play with my kid brothers warhammer figures when i was younger she added made up my own basic combat rules because the rule book was like wayyy too much thats for sure he replied carefully pulling bits and pieces out she watched him picking his way carefully and realized he reminded her so much of her older cousin julian shed idolized him hed been smart and cool an ubergeek always the highschool outsider but with an air about him a confidence that he carried with him always like an impenetrable forcefield adam hunched down there in his smart dolce amp gabbana trousers and shirt like a boy hunched over a toychest reminded her so much of him and her heart ached shed been nine when it happened when the world stopped for several hours and watched on tv three thousand people die like it was just some kind of movie just nine she hadnt really put it together in her young mind that after that second tower came tumbling down she was never going to see julian again ah i think this is the one he said pulling out a hard drive that looked almost as big as a shoebox twenty gigabytes he laughed as he got to his feet and look at the size of the bloody thi he stopped whats the matter maddy hadnt even realized she was crying tears were rolling out from behind her glasses down her cheeks and on to her tshirt she bit her lips angry with herself for allowing him to see her blubbing like this adam stood up and held her shaking shoulders whats up she shook her head what do i say you reminded me of someone i once worshipped someone whos going to die tomorrow morning maddy felt her resolve crumbling why hadnt foster rescued julian instead of her hed have made a far better timerider a far better team leader right then she realized if she had the choice to walk out of the archway and back home to her parents house in boston the choice to leave all the time travel the worrying about history timelines this socalled agency that seemed quite happy to throw raw recruits into the thick of it without any sort of assistance if she was given the choice to walk away shed take it in a heartbeat and then without a word spoken she found herself sobbing against adams shoulder dampening his expensive pale blue shirt with her tears hey its all right he cooed softly patting her heaving back awkwardly heavy day uh yuh sorta she mumbled snottily against his shoulder she let go of him and stood back her puffy eyes trying to find a million things to look at other than his outside the sun was busy with finding a bed for the night and manhattan was beginning to find its light switches i really dont know why i did that she started to fumble for the first words of an explanation its ok he replied honestly you dont need to explain no she decided to straighten her glasses i do need to explain i its just the work the stress thats what it is stress and she sighed suddenly realizing that if she wasnt careful she was going to go all girlie and cry again she took a breath i miss my old life and it feels like weve all been in this weird timetravel agency for years and i know its only been like a few months she laughed whimsically i guess for a bunch of mysterious time travellers from the future we must come across as a bunch of losers no he shrugged i suppose even mysterious visitors from the future are still human right still stub their toes still choke on their gum still slip on banana skins she nodded dabbing at her eyes oh weve done that enough freakin times already he reached for a hand she tried pulling back but he grasped it and squeezed it gently so it turns out that the history of mankind is in the hands of real people someone like you he smiled warmly you know i think i prefer that instead of some team of superheroes who think they know it all chapter woods nottinghamshire the fire crackled hungrily on the pine cones and dried brittle branches theyd gathered by the waning light of the winters afternoon a steady dusting of snow had slowed down their cart and cabot sounding a lot more like a badtempered soldier than he did a pious monk had finally had to concede they were going to have to make camp in the wilderness instead of seeking lodgings in the safety of some hamlet as they had done the night before had they been travelling during a warmer month he said theyd be safer not having a fire and running the risk of attracting brigands like moths but it was too cold not to cabot spat on the flames as he finished a mouthful of stale bread we will be in oxfordshire tomorrow and the royal household at beaumont before afternoon are you sure well be seen by john aye im sure the poor fool is losing his hold on the country he has done much that will enrage his brother including his foolish orders to richards templars to take the grail up north to scotland stead of letting them store it in beaumont why did he do that i know not perhaps he had plans to hide it up there to barter something out of his brother so cabots eyes locked on liam if none of ye are of the templar order as i suspect how is it ye know so much about the grail liam smiled you wouldnt believe me if i told you cabot spread his hands i am willing to listen liam looked at becks and bob both standing a dozen yards apart at the edge of the light cast by the fire silently standing guard he wondered how much the monk should know how much he could help them if he did know and of course how much contamination to history that might cause downstream from them were weve come from the future cabots grizzled face remained still unimpressed by that future quite a long time into the future so it is and well theres an ancient manuscript that mentions this pandora we came here to learn more about it future do ye mean this in the way i think ye mean it yes future as in days and years that havent yet happened but will cabots eyes narrowed sceptically how is that a mans life can travel but in one direction the sun rises then it sets it cannot move the other way its science replied liam i dont get how any of it works but it does science what is this word liam shrugged knowledge of how things work i suppose its quite big in my time science has given us all sorts of machines and understanding the old man absently stroked the ridged scar down across his cheek some saracens i met did talk of such things of numbers and such of things that cant be held weighed bought or sold ideas ideas our church would consider heresy his face creased with a grin would ye believe many saracen scholars say we live on a giant ball liam nodded aye cabots loud cackle filled the quiet wood would ye believe such foolishness a ball theyre right though the world is shaped like a ball cabots laugh choked the smile wiped from his face in an instant a man could burn at the stake for saying such as that in the wrong company but its true mr cabot the world is a ball and there are other balls we call them planets millions of them up there in space and they rotate around other suns in what are called solar systems our world goes about the sun aye ye say there is more than one sun aye thats what the stars are suns cabot looked up at the sky he could see none tonight his face seemed undecided between creasing with another goodnatured cackle of laughter or folding into a stern scowl of scorning disbelief finally cautiously he looked back down at liam and shook his head ye are a strange young man liam of connor with an odd way about ye and the way that ye talk he smiled and tis a fanciful tale ye tell despite my better judgement warning me otherwise ye are a young man i like but i would strongly caution ye to keep such tales of coming from tomorrowsyettobe and ballshaped worlds and many suns to yerself liam shrugged maybe cabot was right hed read enough history books to know medieval europe was a couple of centuries away from accepting ideas like these to them the world was a flat plain and the sun moved obediently across it from one side to the other simply because god willed it and there were no other worlds just this one and no other suns trying to explain time travel to him trying to explain how a history yet to happen already exists and just to make things even more complicated could even be rewritten well even liam struggled with that sometimes anyway liam tossed a branch on the fire all that aside we came back to learn a bit more about what the secret of pandora the grail is but now we know its been stolen by someone our mission has changed now i suppose weve got to get it back first aye cabot gazed at the fire there will be a terrible reckoning if tis not returned before silence barked bob waving an arm to quieten them both cabot hushed and for a long minute they listened to the soft hiss of wind stirring branches and the faroff hoot of an owl until finally liam heard something very quiet but close by the metallic jangle of a harness or a buckle ye hear whispered cabot we are no longer alone then they all heard it the almost musical note of a released drawstring followed by the whistle of something arcing through the air liam heard the smack of impact and saw bob recoil a step backwards by the light of the fire he could see the glint of something metal protruding from between his shoulders the support unit turned round to face liam and he could now see a pale wooden shaft and the white fletching of an arrow embedded deep in his chest danger his barreldeep voice boomed and echoed into the forest several more arrows whistled out of the darkness another finding bobs right hip a third hissing past liams head so close he could feel the rush of air on his ear bandits shouted cabot scrambling to his feet and heading for the open back of his cart into the pale dancing light of the fire a dozen shapes in rags emerged all of them armed with bows and long doubleedged swords that glinted and flickered by the look of them liam guessed their intention wasnt to demand they hand over their valuables but to kill them all first then to pick through their cart for what might be worth taking bob and becks moved at exactly the same moment identical ai routines calculating risk and available courses of action in precisely the same number of microseconds bob sprinted towards the nearest man ducking down swiftly at the last moment to dodge the careless swing of his sword he sprang up again and crushed the mans throat with the bullethard jab of his oversized fingers just beneath his jaw as the man dropped to his knees gasping and spraying blood from his mouth and nose bob grabbed hold of his sword flipped it bladeoverhilt and caught it then finished the bandit with a lightningquick thrust into his chest becks meanwhile had effortlessly relieved another man of his bow and using it like a quarterstaff had scooped him off his feet and on to his back she dropped down on to him knees on his chest and grabbed his head twisting it sharply until cartilage and bone cracked bobs blade clattered with a heavy ring as a second man stepped forward and swung at him sword pommels locked bob pulled his sharply yanking the other mans sword out of his hand it flew through the air still humming like a tuning fork and clattered off the trunk of a nearby tree the man older than the others a florid face framed with wisps of dirty white hair screamed i yield he raised both his hands in surrender a gesture entirely wasted on bob his next swing severed both of the upraised hands sending them spinning to the snowcovered ground the man screamed in agony turned and ran into the darkness waving bloody stumps before him liam heard the twanging release of another drawstring and saw becks had retrieved some arrows from the corpse at her feet a grunt on the far side of their crackling fire and a man who had been sneaking around to take liam and cabot from behind staggered slow babysteps forward sporting a tuft of fletching from his forehead and a yard of bloody shaft out of the back he toppled over on to the fire sending a shower of sparks up into the dark sky the remaining bandits had already seen enough and turned and fled like startled hares boot soles and swinging arrow quivers disappearing into the darkness someones agonized drawnout wailing presumably the unfortunate handless old man quickly receded to an indistinct echo that merged with the other frightened calls of the remaining bandits as they tried to find each other in the darkness of the woods in those few seconds little more than the time it had taken cabot to retrieve his trusty campaign sword from the back of the cart and adopt the oncelearnedneverforgotten onguard stance of an experienced swordsman four of their attackers lay dead good god gasped cabot bob walked over towards liam are you all right liam oconnor he asked casually im fine bob but you might want to take care of those he replied pointing at the arrow shafts protruding from bobs chest and hip affirmative becks joined them i will assist you bob she said calmly reaching for the barbed tip of the arrowhead poking out from between his shoulders she snapped it off with a flick of her wrist she reached around in front of bob and pulled the shaft out of his chest with the sucking sound of puckered flesh cabot watched in goggleeyed silence as she snapped the second tip off and pulled the arrow out of bobs hip without even a flicker of reaction on his face blood is congealing from the two wounds already she said i would estimate your combat functionality to be no less than ninetyfive per cent of full capacity agreed said bob what in the saints names are ye hissed cabot bob glanced at him very tough human being serr he replied unconvincingly and ye cabot said to becks no lady have i ever seen fight like that i am also a very tough liam laughed a little shakily still adrenalinepumped from the attack its all right i told him were from the future already you can drop the old english now becks frowned that will cause unnecessary contamination liam shook his head ah well its not like the fella believes a word i was saying anyway cabot was still holding his longsword aloft his arms now tired lowered it to the ground he leaned on the hilt and regarded the three of them in silence well liam of connor i think i believe ye now chapter new york oh my god yes yes it has its changed sal stared at the grainy image on the computer screen old stone dimpled and worn with age and mottled with olivegreen blooms of algae she could see faint lines inscribing the name haskette a gouge in the lettering where at some point in the last eight centuries someone had hacked at the gravestone or perhaps it had been shot at at the bottom of adams photograph where brambles emerged into the image she could just make out the faintest groove of several lines bisecting if hed taken this picture in poorer lighting it might not even have been visible theyd easily have missed it thats definitely it he said do you see it sal nodded maddy said nothing sals finger traced the shape on the screen and thats the coded symbol for an l yes yes it is not for the first time his jaw hung open dumbfounded i cant believe it i visited the ruins of kirklees priory six years ago and took all these graveyard pictures and these digital images have been sitting on my old hard drive in my chest jesus i havent plugged in this drive for a couple of years its just been collecting dust and yet somethings happened on there something changed on my hard drive that pictures been altered thats thats just well its just messing with my head a minute wave said maddy thats what happened a tiny tiny time wave so slight only sal felt it of course sal really wished she didnt pick up on the subtle ones they felt like motion sickness that sensation of spinning around too much with your eyes closed and youre telling me this is a wave thats been rolling forward through eight hundred and seven years yes subtly changing this timeline in its wake except of course everything inside the archways preservationfield she could see a look of confusion on his face thats why i placed your hard drive outside in the alley there its outside the energy field and so it can be altered by a time wave do you see he nodded slowly right so when sal sensed a wave thing thats why you maddy nodded shed raced outside with a data cable the moment sal started wobbling and looking pale and had quickly downloaded adams graveyard photos again all the while with him standing in the middle of the archway openmouthed and looking utterly bemused he nodded his head again as if that was going to help him get it then he leaned forward and studied more closely the image in front of them all i feel like my heads going to explode he laughed this really is the most incredible thing ever of course it is maddy said coolly thats why this time travel has to be kept so secret but but think how it could revolutionize history historians could visit the times they study see for themselves how things were and not rely on and with each historian casually joyriding back into the past the precious history theyd be studying would be altered mutated with echoes of change ricocheting back through time tiny waves affecting tiny decisions causing bigger waves affecting bigger decisions and all of a sudden in were all speaking i dunno chinese or were all suddenly dinosaur lizardmen or theres no new york any more and its just radioactive ruins all because somebody decided it would be a coolthing to go back in time and see a bit of history for themselves sal looked at maddy her cheeks were mottled pink with anger or embarrassment jahulla whats up with her sorry said adam meekly i was just saying maddy turned to look at him thats why were here adam stuck in this archway stuck in these same two freakin days watching the same things over and over were here because there are morons in the future idiots crazies powerhungry lunatics who think time travels just a game a neat idea were stuck here watching history and ive got no idea how long were gonna be here me sal and liam she looked at sal forever sal shrugged i hope not maddys outburst left a long silence filled only by the hum of computer fans and soft purring motors of the growth tubes in the back room you ok asked sal maddy chewed her lip in silence for a while then eventually nodded yeah she sighed im ok sorry said adam its just all so new and exciting to me maddy shook her head no im sorry i i was rude i didnt mean to crank off at you it just sort of gets to you this knowing about all this im tired sal decided to lift the mood well the good thing is they found the right gravestone right maddy nodded right well know what theyre up to this time she added chapter beaumont palace oxford the cart drew to a halt on the dirt and cobblestone track leading up to the flintwalled grounds of the royal residence and cabot dropped down off the carts seat on to the track with a heavy smack of sandals morning he called to the cluster of soldiers up ahead blocking the way staring at the tall stone buildings beyond the low wall the steep gables the crenellations the flumes and chimneypots from which thick columns of woodsmoke floated the fluttering rooftop pennants decorated with royal coats of arms liam found he couldnt help but giggle yet another sight a young man from cork was never meant to see what is funny asked bob oh im not laughing bob its just exciting seeing this seeing a real medieval kings palace cabots exchange with the pack of soldiers was already over they five of them in winter cloaks and heavy chainmail puffing clouds of breath disinterestedly watched him trudge back towards the cart whats the matter mr cabot john is not here he replied as he pulled himself up on to the seat he has moved to oxford castle to liams disappointment they had skirted round the walled city of oxford a mile or so back and not entered through the large archway into the busy thoroughfare hed glimpsed beyond however over the top of the thirtyfoothigh stone wall he had spotted tendrils of woodsmoke coming from several steep rooftops and thought hed caught sight of the crenellated outline of a keep somewhere in the middle the guards say tis the unrest in this region that has driven him to the castle for safety liam looked back at the low flint wall the open ground beyond that decorated with cherry trees and the structure of beaumont palace itself it was not unlike a cathedral long and low with a vaulted roof of timbers and he noticed no motte or other defensive earthworks around the place hardly the safe retreat of a ruler in times of trouble oxford castle said cabot grabbing the horses reins and turning them slowly round i know it well tis a strong keep and the city itself very well protected by its wall good place for john cabots dry laugh sounded humourless that is unless the people of the city have also turned against him the lateafternoon sun peeked through scudding clouds as the cart rattled unchallenged under oxford citys main gatehouse into a marketplace thick with the activity of traders closing up for the day liam sat on the seat beside cabot chuckling with undisguised pleasure at the sight and the smell of the place market stalls no more than flat handdrawn carts were being loaded with the unsold flotsam of the day rotten broken heads of cabbage and snapped turnip roots he saw a trader stacking the remaining skinned hares and rabbits head to toe a baker collecting the last unsold stale loaves of bread and among all the traders packing up for the afternoon he saw a wandering rabble of very old and very young beggars in dirty threadbare rags pleading for the scraps too unfit to sell and destined for a pigs trough tis a bad time for the poor said cabot liams gleeful smile all of a sudden felt wrong poverty grinding poverty hed seen that before beggars in cork of course but that was for money money that would perhaps end up going towards a drink but this this was begging for the food that pigs would eat aye he said quietly across the market a thin veil of smoke hung the collaboration of woodsmoke from a dozen outdoor pyres and the mist of warm breath from a thousand mouths in the cooling air the air smelled overpoweringly of two things woodsmoke and dung woodsmoke liam had noticed that every place and every thing seemed to smell of that if there was one odour that would remind him of the twelfth century for the rest of his life it would be that and it mercifully covered up at least some of the cloying stench of festering faeces a heady brew produced by animals and humans alike cabot noticed him wrinkling his nose tis one of the reasons i choose a monks life far away from the city he nodded ahead of them oxford castle it was approaching dusk now the grey sky deepening to a midwinters blue the nowyouseeit nowyoudont sun was gone lost behind the citys wall emerging through the lowhanging haze of smoke and mist ahead of them liam spotted the tall and squaresided norman keep of oxford castle through highup slitted windows he glimpsed the amber glow cast from warming braziers and flickering torches cabot steered the cart up a weaving cobblestone thoroughfare narrowing in places where shantytown huts and sheds encroached like scab tissue around a sore through open flaps of tattered cloth liam caught the fleeting images of pale and curious faces lashing out faces smudged with dirt and gaunt from hunger eyes that stared without hope at the flickering of a tallow candle inside eyes that glanced his way momentarily with only passing interest liams hope of seeing green fields and fair maidens and chivalrous knights in gleaming armour and merry men skipping round maypoles and floridcheeked buxom wenches laughing with simple peasant joy now seemed rather naive this is grim the cart crossed over a woodenslat bridge over a muddycoloured river that had frozen over at the edges ahead of them a tall stone archway announced theyd arrived at oxford castle liam watched a gate guard approach the cart what business he eyed cabots cistercian robes and added brother as an afterthought i seek an audience with his lordship the earl of cornwall and gloucester he has no time for a sermon tell him his old sword master is here cabot the guards eyes narrowed as he studied cabot in the fading light stay here he said before turning away and calling out to one of the other guards to take the news inside be hasty said cabot after him tis cold out here and he will be angry when he finds ye have kept his old friend waiting the guard looked sceptically at him friend eh he walked around towards the rear of the cart as they waited what have ye in here visitors said cabot the guard lifted the canvas cover with the tip of his sword ahhh a strumpet for his lordship is it a smile stretched across the leathered skin of his face as he reached a gloved hand out to touch her leg ye are a pretty thing for a peasant girl arent you i wouldnt said liam peering under the flap from the other end of the cart he looked at becks and saw muscles tensing beneath her peasants gown the last thing they needed was her twisting the head off one of johns guards becks he said quietly dont hurt him affirmative she replied a hint of resentment in her voice the guard laughed at that hurt me would you well now this i would most like to see raised voices came from beyond the archway echoing off the stone walls inside a commotion within the guard retracted his hand and nodded politely at becks pity he muttered then pulled his head out from beneath the canvas what is it the higherpitched voice of a younger man he comes he knows the monk cabot grinned like a wily fox at the guard captain there what did i tell you the captain stepped back from the cart and stood to attention as the clacking of approaching boots on cobblestones grew louder in the twilight presently the archway filled with the flickering glow of a blazing torch and liam spotted the short squat silhouette of a man with long hair standing in the middle what in damnation is going on here a voice barked angrily echoing off the masonry let him through cabot tweaked the reins and the cart rattled through the low archway and finally came to a rest inside the castle walls the squat figure stood on the ground beside cabot a dark shape puffing pale blue clouds of breath sebastien cabot aye sire last i heard you were abroad killing turks cabot wheezed a laugh i tired of such things a young squire holding the flickering torch hurried round the back of the cart and approached them johns face was finally illuminated by the dancing amber light liam could make out a slender effeminate face decorated with a wispy beard and moustache that fluttered with each breath and framed by fine long tawny hair he was smiling warmly at cabot sebastien he said after looking up at the old mans battlescarred face a little longer than was polite i cannot tell you how good it is to see you again my old friend cabot jumped down from the cart and john wasted no time in wrapping his arms round him tis good to see a friendly face added john cabot gingerly returned his embrace how is my student john released him and stepped back he shrugged i am still a clumsy fool more likely to hack my own head off than another mans he glanced up at liam so you have a son now no he is not my son he turned and looked at liam he he is here to cabot was searching for words what sebastien sire i believe this lad and two more of his friends in the back may help in retrieving the item that has been lost john sighed so you have heard of this as well eh a long silence passed between both men an unspoken understanding of the matter at hand then let us not talk carelessly out here john said quietly he beckoned liam to climb down come chapter oxford castle oxford liam followed cabot and john as they talked about old days they crossed the enclosure and entered the dark and cold interior of the keeps main entrance inside his eyes adjusted to the gloom and his ears rang with the echo of boots on stone as they ascended steps that took them upwards in a cramped spiral behind him he heard beckss lowered voice do you trust cabot weve no choice he whispered his words seemed to bounce and echo up the stairs towards the monk and john still talking convivially finally they emerged into a grand hall invitingly lit by an open fire and rings of fatdripping candles on candelabra suspended from several oak support beams that crossed high above liam suspected it was the glow of this hall he must have seen earlier john turned his attention to liam bob and becks so sebastien these three friends of yours we can talk openly before them i presume cabot nodded they are to be trusted john waved a hand you may sit he said slumping down on a wooden bench near the large crackling fire liam noticed for the first time how gaunt and unwell the man looked it is a troubling time said john after a while i have the people of england in open rebellion against me i have the barons conspiring against me all because of the taxes his eyes glistened as he gazed at the flames taxes that i had to raise to pay for this foolish crusade of his and to pay for that madmans ransom he looked up at cabot believe me i was sorely tempted to let him rot in captivity liam leaned forward madman sire said cabot so this lad is liam of connor these other two are bob and becks john nodded politely at liam and for the first time acknowledged the support units its the peasant clothing liam suspected thats how it worked in these times to be poor was to be less than human to be no better than the dogs and cats and chickens that wandered this city freely in the dark foulsmelling spaces between shacks to be almost invisible you are a soldier john asked bob neg bob corrected himself quickly nay serr i be just a normal man eyebrows rose on johns slim face i would wager you could pull a cart as easily as an ox bob frowned he was busy processing that comment trying to determine whether it was praise or an insult and this is johns eyes lingered on becks becks is it she was introduced to me as lady rebecca said cabot oh john looked sceptically at her mudspattered rags a lady is she now oui replied becks in perfect norman french je viens de la duche dalevingnon en normandie johns cynical leer vanished and cabot smiled yes sire i believe she is of noble birth but ive not heard of this duchy she refers to john tilted his head with a formal nod madame sil vous plait accepter mes excuses humbles i am also able to communicate in english she said then please accept my apologies my dear he gestured at her clothes it is your rags that we choose not to attract attention she cut in drily cabots eyes widened lady rebecca it is most rude to interrupt his lord john shook his head it matters not he smiled tiredly ive far greater things to concern me these days than royal protocol he looked at liam you asked to whom i was referring liam nodded the madman my older brother he said sighing the king he seemed to spit that last word out he has brought ruin on us all with this reckless crusade of his which all are saying has been a failure jerusalem remains in muslim hands but to make matters worse the fool allowed himself to be kidnapped for a ransom he pulled absently on the meagre sandycoloured tuft of his beard and it is i who has had to throttle the poor and squeeze the nobles for yet more taxes when there simply are none left to be had he gestured to a tall narrow arched window that looked out on the city below you will have seen them out there the people they are hungry and they blame me for this not him not richard the lionheart he sighed we are all ruined by this crusade the guards outside i have not paid they remain at their posts because here in this castle at least there is food it is little better outside the cities sire added cabot the villages and towns barely survive and all this muttered john for a fools errand what do you mean asked liam he noticed a sharp glance from cabot sire john looked up at him sebastien tells me you know of things only the templars should know of if you mean pandora john frowned the term didnt seem to mean anything to him the grail liam added aye this grail john laughed what is it a cup a goblet that is all a cup that the christ may have used once but richard like all those other templar fools believes such a thing has great powers that insane fool believes carrying this cup into battle would make him unbeatable thats what this crusade has been about you see not to free the holy city from the muslims but to retrieve what was left behind when the city fell to retrieve this this foolish relic the log fire spat a smoking shard of charcoal on to the stone floor john watched its glow slowly fade a madmans treasure hunt thats what this fools crusade was about your brother found this grail sire asked becks john nodded yes he did and had a party of his best templars take it here for safekeeping he laughed nervously but ii he will blame me for this i know it he will kill me liam noticed johns left hand trembled in his lap i had his men take their treasure to rosslyn chapel in scotland for greater safety you understand for secrecy the royal palace is not secure this castle is not secure i thought it would be a safer place but they were ambushed said cabot it was taken and on his return i have no doubt richard will have my head on a spike uttered john conscious that his hand was shaking he tucked it away into a fold of his robes sire it is this matter this reason why i have brought these three here they say they can help ye get it back and can you he looked from liam to bob to becks i have heard all the rumours too i have heard of this hooded man who cannot be killed it seems a demon say some a wrathful angel say all the peasants and villains that are flocking out to the forests to join him and you can steal it back from him you say john didnt look entirely convinced liam glanced at becks hoping she had something useful to say but she stared back at him silently and bob continued to dutifully and nonetoohelpfully monitor the conversation i think sire that this grail couldve been stolen by someone whos come from the same uh same place as us and what place is this liam bit his lip theyd explained as best they could to cabot and that perhaps was a time contamination theyd need to clear up later he wondered what the consequences would be for maddy and sal in if he tried explaining to the future king of england the basics of time travel it is a place very far away sire with strange ways about us but look this hooded man is no demon or angel he jerked his head at bob its probably another peculiar man like bob here thats all peculiar what do you mean by that a a strong man extraordinarily strong added liam and really tough and with certain unusual fighting techniques there is talk that this hooded fiend has shrugged off crossbow bolts and the like that he is unstoppable that it is the grailitself that protects him from harm john shook his head slowly you know perhaps there is some truth to this templar nonsense sire said cabot i have seen this bob do just the same johns eyes darted from cabot to the support unit this is correct bob rumbled i am capable of suffering extreme damage and deploying damagelimitation countermeasures john turned to cabot sebastien this ox of a man speaks a sort of english but i have no understanding of what he just said what he said sire is that he can do exactly what this hooded man can do i have seen with my own eyes bob take arrows that would kill any ordinary man and yet he did not even blink aye its not the grail sire its not magic or godly powers or anything this hooded man is just another well i suppose id say hes just another man like this bob john studied them in silence for a while a finger caressing the tufted tip of his chin the sound of popping and hissing logs filled the hall finally he stirred and you say you are here to help liam nodded sright were going to get the grail back for you chapter oxford castle oxford the quarters they had been assigned were clearly meant for nobleborn guests four rooms high up in the keep decorated with fine tapestries and embroidered cushions perhaps a true sign that john valued their presence was the distance from their windows to the fetid smell of the city of oxford below the brazier in liams room burned brightly filling the cold damp chamber with a welcoming warmth and a wooden table with a bowl of loaves and preserves and a flagon of imported wine had been set out for them i was his sword master in fact i tutored all three of the kings sons geoffrey richard and john continued cabot tipping the flagon into his cup they were but boys then long before political rivalries separated them geoffrey was the eldest and henrys favourite richard was always the headstrong one the one ye knew would seek to place his name in history and john asked liam cabot shrugged a gentle boy certainly no swordsman i saw in richard though something to fear a man who could become great allpowerful a man with the coldhearted ruthlessness to take all the kingdoms of europe and make them one when geoffrey died and it was clear richard would succeed his father i knew there would be plenty of blood cabots face creased with a lacklustre smile i too was younger then and i craved the glory of war how long were you a templar then i joined as the sergeant to sir godfrey cottleighs service fifteen years ago and we went to the holy land to do our duty to protect christian pilgrims it was in those years peaceful years by all accounts before the fall of jerusalem that i learned of the orders secrets secrets the grail and so much more bob and becks seemed to perk up liam suspected they were both carefully studying his face his body language for telltale signs of truth or deception what cabot looked at him uneasy with breaking oaths of secrecy hed long ago been sworn to mr cabot what else is there ye understand in telling ye more i am betraying the order of templars do ye understand this but you left them anyway right so aye he shrugged he tipped the cup of wine down his throat after jerusalem fell and richard announced his crusade to retake it i learned how much blood would be spilled in the name of god when king richard arrived in the holy land with his army i saw in him a powerful obsession a dangerous obsession cabots eyes met liams he had learned of the treyarch confession hed come for the grail becks stirred i have no details of a treyarch confession what is this the treyarch confession is an account written by a man called gerard treyarch he and his brother were soldiers in the first crusade they were among the christian army that first captured jerusalem in ye know of this liam didnt he turned to the other two bob becks the first crusade is launched by pope urban ii in the objective is to capture the city of jerusalem and expel the muslims the crusade is successful and in after a short siege the crusaders enter the city in the days that follow the soldiers are said to have massacred every muslim inside cabot nodded men women children bob continued the city of jerusalem and the holy land remain in christian hands for nearly a century under a succession of guardian christian kings it is known as the kingdom of heaven and peace ensues for nearly ninety years then in the muslims finally retake the city under the successful general saladin saladin said liam bob nodded saladin is merciful and allows christians to remain in the city and orders his men not to ransack the christian holy places so what is this treyarch thing then mr cabot asked liam cabot began guardedly during that century of christian rule and peace gerard and raymond treyarch are said to have discovered something in the vaults beneath jerusalem the treyarch confession is said to be gerards account of this discovered what an ancient thing cabot pressed his lips firmly together as if he was willing them to remain closed and the story goes a scroll that was over a thousandyearsold from the time of the christ jayzus liam blurted cabot frowned at him indeed the time of jesus christ what did it say i have never read the treyarch confession but i have heard it reveals nothing of what was in the text from the time of the christ it is only an account of what they did with it cabot bit into an apple it is said they transcribed the text of the original message to a ciphered form and then destroyed it liam sat up straight destroyed it why tis unknown cabot hunched his shoulders perhaps because the truth it contained was far too dangerous for mortal man to know perhaps it contained the real spoken words of god and they have a power we do not understand and this rewritten version this encoded version said liam that is the holy grail ahh ye are half right lad it is that version and the key to deciphering it those two things together are what is known as the grail he nodded warily tis a good thing that the grail is two parts kept separate you believe it has powers mr cabot said becks i believe it had the power to send both the treyarch brothers mad uh liams eyes widened seriously raymond treyarch tis said killed himself in jerusalem and gerard ended his years in some monastery in aquitaine where he wrote his confession and as the story goes went quite insane the fire was dying down liam reached for another log and gently placed it on the pile of glowing pulsing charcoal and embers so then we know one half of the grail has been stolen by this hooded fella and his bandits aye the enciphered text wheres the other bit then asked liam the key bit while jerusalem existed under christian kings the text itself was guarded by templar knights in jerusalem and the key was guarded by another order in the city of acre a hundred miles north then both cities fell to saladin and so richard launched his crusade to retrieve both items cabots eyes looked a thousand miles away i was there when acre fell to richards army he sighed i was there i watched as all three thousand muslim defenders were beheaded i believe he acquired the key that day that was his celebration liam shuddered at the thought of that so he wanted both things and he managed to get both things but sent the text to england question said becks why would he do that for safety king richard i know feared rivals perhaps other kings who might also know of the treyarch confession his army of crusaders became weakened after it became clear it was too small a force to besiege and take jerusalem his fighting men started to return to their home countries as i did a year before he sent one half of the grail home for safekeeping and kept the other the key to decoding it with him now his return home has been delayed by shipwreck and imprisonment two years he has waited to get home two years knowing he has had the means to unlock the words of god and finally he returns and john has lost it to this hooded fella cabot nodded liam could see why the poor man had looked so unhappy at every mention of his brothers name king richard will kill him on his return uttered cabot of that i have no doubt i believe this obsession has twisted his mind beyond any reason becks broke a long silence punctuated only by the crack and hiss of a burning log question what has the word pandora got to do with the holy grail cabot seemed hesitant to answer that mr cabot liam prompted his voice was low barely more than a whisper it is the oneword of the original message that the templars were permitted to know liam stroked his chin thoughtfully becks bob four grey eyes panned to rest on him if we got our hands on this grail text would you two be able to decode it unknown said becks we have insufficient data on the encryption technique used at this time added bob but say we got it and managed to take it back to he glanced at cabot perhaps it was best not to reveal the precise year to him if we got it back home maybe that adam fella could work it out it is a possibility said becks it is not just a childs puzzle for ye to solve snapped cabot this this is our lords words a sacred truth and lad ye talk of it like a like a game to be played liam returned a stern expression it is no game mr cabot not to me at any rate we are here because well because these may not be the words of our lord they could be the words of people like ourselves other travellers in time the old mans lower jaw hung and wobbled uncertainly we received a warning mr cabot a warning to look for this pandora whatever it may be you said this treyarch confession goes that the scroll they found was written in jesuss time right cabot nodded tis what is said then this warning has travelled across twothousandyears to find us he looked up at the old monk this is no game we must acquire this grail said becks agreed added bob that must become the mission priority chapter sherwood forest nottinghamshire he listened to the sounds of his people his followers their voices echoing through the woods as they chattered around their campfires their spirits were lifted for them today had been a good day theyd managed to intercept a merchants wagon destined to deliver to some baron a cart full of luxuries the foreign wine theyd found was being consumed now and their songs around the fire were gradually becoming less tuneful and more raucous they are like children he watched them from the darkness of his hut his army of peasant bandits so used to the grinding poverty of recent years the starvation grubbing for scraps of food that here in the forests of nottingham where they could poach royal deer and hares because the soldiers darent follow them in they were like excitable children it reminded him james locke too much of the place of the time hed come from a world of poverty overcrowded and crumbling cities polluted oceans populated by nothing but floating islands of plastic rubbish and slowly dispersing toxins a dying world a dying world he looked down at the wooden box in his hands old weathered wood with an ornate pattern carved into its sides locke stared at it inside this box was what hed come back in time for inside this box was what his brotherhood had been waiting nearly a thousand years to recover a lost truth a warning a prophecy pandora locke had glimpsed inside had touched it even unravelled some of it just to get a glimpse of the writing and hed felt the hairs stand up on the back of his neck the words were there on the parchment hidden from a casual eye random unintelligable the meaning locked away by its code he looked up again out through the flap of his hut at his bandits making merry by the flickering light of the campfire their raids on the barons goods on the farms on the taxmens carts all of that was eventually going to bring king richard up to nottingham once he returned to england up to these woods that and the knowledge that his precious holy grail had been taken locke nodded hell come and hell bring with him the other half of the grail the key chapter oxford castle oxford this will ensure you have the full cooperation of that bumbling fool said john liam looked down at the roll of parchment in his hand it was sealed with a blob of wax in which john lacklands royal crest had been impressed what is it sire orders for the sheriff of nottingham to give you anything that you need in hunting down this hooded man and his bandits he pursed his lips with wry amusement should that useless fool the sheriff william de wendenal object to this or prove obstructive in any way you may assume the office yourself these papers confer that authority to you you mean id be sheriff of nottingham tis so if necessity requires cool liam chuckled aye said john looking around at the courtyard the readied horses blew plumes of steam and overhead the grey winters sky tumbled uneasily promising another light flurry of snow cool indeed but it shall warm up soon though i warrant sternfaced soldiers stood nearby rubbing gloved hands and stamping their feet to stay warm i give you a dozen of my best guards to take up to nottingham with you they are all good men i trust them they will take your orders as if they were mine john glanced at bob now equipped with a chainmail hauberk over his wide torso a chainmail coif protecting his coconut head and a long sword in a sheath attached to a belt of leather cinched tight round his waist mind you if your big friend is half the fighter as you say i should think youll not need them liam looked at them and struggled hard not to grin proudly my own little army of tin soldiers id like to hang on to them please said liam john frowned for a moment then understood what he meant tis so then he placed a hand on liams shoulder bring me back what was taken liam before tis too late he nodded aye sire well get it back i do have one condition i insist on he nodded at becks lady rebecca will stay here in oxford with me liam drew back what john tipped his head subtly and a pair of soldiers appeared from nowhere and grasped her upper arms liam heard the scrape of a sword being drawn and bob getting ready to swing it bob stop he shouted he spun round to face becks already she had one hand round the throat of the unfortunate man to her right squeezing his larynx his eyes bulged and his feet shuffled and scraped against the flagstones becks put him down she stared at the man defiantly for a moment before releasing her grip as you wish the man gasped dropped to his knees hacking and coughing up phlegm on to the ground john puffed anxiously good grief shes a feisty one sire said cabot she can fight just as well as any man ive seen so it appears said john nonetheless i insist she remain here until you return with it they could fight their way out of here out of the keep liam knew that between bob and becks this courtyard would be nothing but a carpet of dead and dying men on the flagstones inside a minute but he suspected a more intelligent solution was needed may my friends and i talk in private for a moment sire john sniffed if you wish he waved a hand and the soldier standing beside becks helped his colleague to his feet and took him across the courtyard to join the other guards where a soft hubbub of laughter and ribbing ensued a grown man a kings guard bettered by a girl john took a dozen slow steps back from liam and started humming tunelessly liam becks bob and cabot converged and began talking with muted voices we should stay together said liam youll miss the return window if we leave you down here the scheduled window said bob is due in three days one hour and the onehour backup window will follow and there will be another after that in ten days time interrupted becks we also have the final backup set for five months twentysix days one hour and seventeen minutes from now liam realized becks seemed to be making a point youre suggesting you stay here affirmative there may be an opportunity to acquire tactically useful data here additional information on the treyarch confession bob nodded she is correct also now that we have a method of communication with the field office we will also be able to provide them a separate time and location stamp for becks he was right they could open a portal right here for her she wouldnt need to make her way up to kirklees liam looked at her youre ok with this it is the correct tactical choice she replied liam glanced at john looking up impatiently at the sky and still humming i think hes got a bit of a thing for you becks a thing you know i think he fancies you cabot snorted a dry laugh then quickly blessed himself with a guilty glance to the heavens yes youll have to be careful i will be able to deal with him she replied calmly i will use his desires and motivations to my advantage you cant let him know youre some sort of robot from the future said liam do you understand thats too much contamination becks studied liam for a moment then her cold emotionless face seemed to melt transforming into a warm and sensual smile she tossed her dark hair for good measure liam felt something flutter inside him desire oh come on liam meat robot remember my ai has already learned much i have observed female rituals i have also read harry potter i know what body language and verbal inflections work most efficiently on human males the smile remained on her face teasing encouraging bewitching she even managed a wink clumsy and forced but still enough to make his heart flutter i will be fine liam oconnor she will at that liam nodded all right then you stay here see what you can find out well let the field office know exactly where you are so they can beam a tachyon signal to you if something goes wrong becks if for some reason maddy doesnt contact you with a schedule for a window here make sure you get to kirklees in time for the sixmonther do you understand affirmative i have no wish to selfterminate all right then thats that he looked at bob and cabot nodded then turned to face john lady rebecca agrees to stay so she does of course she does said john i will make her most comfortable liam stepped forward and offered john a polite nod well be off now sire please waste no time liam said john a momentary flicker of tension crossed his face i have heard rumours king richard is already in france well be back before you can say pog mo thoin johns heavy brows locked in mild confusion again for a moment his lips pursed as if he was going to actually have a go at saying it its just a turn of phrase where i come from sire right he dismissed liam with a curt nod liam turned and pulled himself up into the back of cabots cart bob followed him up the carts axles creaking under his weight it has been good to see an old friend again john called out to cabot lord knows tis been a while since ive had one we shant return emptyhanded sire cabot clacked his tongue and goaded the horses to life with a sharp tug on the reins the cart slowly clattered forward across flagstones towards the castles front gate liam looked out of the back canvas to see the men his men forming up and dutifully falling in behind them a short column of ruddyfaced soldiers in dull chain mail marching heavily in their wake he caught one last glimpse of becks that teasing smile of hers packed away for later use she nodded a farewell at him as they clattered beneath the archway and out on to the bridge chapter new york sal watched adam across the archway bustling around their kettle and fridge making them some tea are we not telling too much she asked maddy showing him too much i thought foster said we were like this topsecret organization maddy looked away from the monitor towards him i know i know she muttered guiltily but i hes useful sal we need him so what happens though when weve fixed things up and its all back to normal whatre we going to do with him then maddy said nothing which sal misinterpreted her eyes suddenly lit up he can stay no she replied quickly no we cant recruit him oh he cant stay sal he cant i just cant take in anyone we just because we you know just because we like them why not because this is a team already a fourman team just like foster said the agency is made up of fourperson teams each with their own role and but with becks weve already got five in our team i know all the more reason not to be taking on any more they watched adam pour water from the kettle into several chipped mugs stirring the tea with a tinkling sound that echoed across the archway so whatre you going to do maddy she sighed nothing nothing because she bit her lip and looked away hes not going to last very long what do you mean i checked his name sal checked it against the rollcall of tomorrows victims sals gaze returned to the desk to maddy shaddyah she whispered no tomorrow dont say to me hes maddy nodded he works for a company called shermangolding investment theyre on the ninetyfifth floor north tower maddy realized her voice was wobbling ever so slightly hes one of them that never made it out they heard his footsteps approaching both turned to see adam carrying a steaming mug of tea in each hand here you ladies are nice cuppa he frowned puzzled whats up with you two maddy fixed a wide smile on her face hey absolutely nothing she reached for her tea thanks he glanced back at the kitchen table ill just go get the biccies mum always said a cuppa teas too wet without something to dunk in it they watched him go and maddy found herself wondering what sort of a person this job was turning her into that she could just knowingly let someone as likeable as adam walk blindly to his death chapter nottingham the town of nottingham glowed in the dark not the welcoming glow of lanterns and nightwatch fires but from several buildings set aflame as the cart and its escort of guards slowly approached the entrance to the town their ears picked up the faint ring and clatter of melee weapons and the roar of a defiant crowd through an open and unmanned gatehouse they entered the walled town to see a thoroughfare cluttered and messy with broken slats of wood a funeral pyre burned in the middle stacked with a dozen corpses the smell of cooking human flesh made liam gag cabot sitting beside him on the jockey seat turned all right lad jayzus the smell he grunted wiping a string of dangling bile from his chin whats happening tis a rebellion i think liam noticed some women and children in rags and on their knees around the fire presumably grieving for those bodies burning in the flames he spotted a cart laden with what at first he thought was a pile of barkstripped firewood pale knobbly branches of beach or willow then he realized he was looking at arms and legs bodies stacked on top of each other starvation and disease has come to nottingham said cabot shaking his head farmers no longer work their farms only to have all they yield taken in taxes so food rots in fields and tis the towns that feel it first where is everyone cabot tipped his head towards the centre of the town where it seemed most of the nights amber glow and the roar of voices the ring of blades seemed to be coming from ill wager they are turning on the sheriff of nottinghams castle cabot reached through the canvas into the cart pulled out his sword and sheath and rested it across his lap as he goaded the horses forward along a muddy avenue between tumbledown shacks we may have to fight our way in the noise and the amber glow increased with intensity as they rounded a bend in the muddy rutted track and finally the crenellated top of a stone wall came into view along its base a sea of humanity swarmed by the light of hundreds of flaming torches activity seemed to be focused around two large thick oak gates at the base of a guard tower from the confusion and movement amid dancing shadows and flickering firelight liam guessed the people of nottingham were doing their very best to attempt to build a bonfire against the gates the soldiers on the wall were in turn firing crossbow bolts down into the crowd and ducking back to avoid being pelted with stones and javelins and one or two arrows one of the guards john had assigned to escort them jogged forward to the cart edward eddie he seemed to be called the other men deferred to him although they all seemed to share the same rank sire he called up to liam if those see us here they will turn on us he was right it seemed none of the hundreds in front of them had yet noticed the cart and its escort tucked back in the shadows of the alleyway between a long thatched granary and a threshers mill well have to fight our way in said liam sire eddie stared up at him with astonishment he looked like hed seen a fair few battles in his time with like cabot a face that had taken its share of damage but that command seemed to unsettle him sire that would be suicide liam nodded uncertainly it didnt look too good but then they did have bob he turned in his seat uh bob he realized his mouth was dry and his voice fluttered with nerves he hated how every other man around him seemed to manage not to sound like a quaking child and yet he sounded to his own ears like a boy still bobs bristly head emerged through the flap of canvas we need you to do your thing affirmative his voice rumbled and he disappeared back through the flap a moment later the cart wobbled as bob emerged from the back and dropped heavily to the ground he strode to the front of the cart his chain mail jangling and clinking he stood beside the drivers seat his head almost on a level with liams and surveyed the scene ahead you intend for us to enter the defensive structure ahead liam felt his stomach twitching and writhing with apprehension he nodded what do you think bob can we do it bob gave it some thought and eventually nodded i estimate a high probability of success eighty i ddont want to hear a number please bob nodded obediently he reached up with a big ape hand and patted liams shoulder heavily do not be afraid liam i will clear a way he looked at the soldiers all of them had unslung their shields from their backs and unsheathed their swords ready for action have the guards form up behind me either side of the cart bob glanced at liam his eyes lost beneath the firm ridge of his brow and the rim of his chainmail coif and stay close to me liam looked at cabot got that he nodded vigorously oh aye ill stay right close liam gave eddie the order to have his men form up in two rows of six either side of the cart and then nodded at bob that they were ready bob turned towards the crowd and strode forward a longsword held aloft in one hand the cart rolled along behind him both horses skittish and nervous snorting their unease and the flanking guards moved with it hunkered down behind their shields the first heads in the crowd turned towards them as they emerged from the shadows voices raised alerting others liam could almost see the idea spreading from one to another an easier target than the sheriffs castle an easier target on which to vent their rage a dozen soldiers to make a brutal example of and a cart no doubt loaded with gold sovereigns or better still food destined for the sheriffs table a roar of excitement and anger rolled across the crowd the goal of setting fire to the castles gates forgotten for now oh boy liam had no weapon to clasp right now hed give anything to be holding one of those nazi pulse rifles in his hands even unloaded the weight of it would have felt better than twiddling his thumbs just ahead of them bobs purposeful stride switched to a slow loping jog cabot barked at his horses and the cart picked up a little more speed while eddie and his men broke into a trot beside them the castle wall loomed before them above the roar of the crowd liam could hear raised voices from the wall perhaps theyd recognized the round helmets and long shields of their guard as kings men and were preparing to open the gates for them the crowd though looked unwilling as yet to part despite the imposing form of bobs sevenfoot frame a cluster of a dozen men by the look of them not townsfolk carrying little more than pitchforks and stones but more like the brigands who had jumped them in the woods squared up to bobs approach liam caught sight of the rusted glint of a swords blade swinging round at bobs head he deftly ducked the blow and shouldered into the man with the force of a charging bull knocking him back into the crowd and a dozen people off their feet one of the men took the opportunity with bob adjusting his balance to lunge a pike at his stomach the tip of it bit deep into his mail breaking some chains piercing his skin and going some way inside bob responded with a roundhouse sweep of his longsword that cleaved into the side of the man cutting him completely in two the momentum continuing into the shoulder of the man standing beside him both men collapsed as bob jerked the pikes blade clear of the torn tissue and shattered bone and prepared to swing it again in the other direction but the rest of the men quickly pulled back meanwhile halted by the exchange in front the cart and the guards were fending off the closing press of people either side missiles of all kinds clattered down on them stones sticks chunks of broken masonry something punched liams shoulder he screamed out in pain and grasped where hed been hit there was blood beside his legs eddies shield clattered and clanged from the missiles raining down on them sire eddie called up jabbing the tip of his sword to ward off the nearest of the rioters sire we must keep moving chapter nottingham ahead of them bob had deftly spun the pike round so that the bloodwet tip and halberd blade were aimed towards the people he began to swing its eightfoot length in a wide loop that clipped and gashed a thickset man whod shuffled back too slowly the swooping pikes blade did the job and created an arc of space in front of bob as he resumed his steady stride towards the oak gates now only a dozen yards in front of them cabot roughly kicked the rear of the left horse and it staggered forward eyes rolling and snorting the other followed suit and the cart was moving again the guards kept pace their shields produced a cacophony of metallic clangs like hailstones descending on to a tin roof liam felt the air by his cheek pulse as a stone or rock whistled by far too close for comfort he wrapped his arms round his head and ducked down low jayzusanmarygetusoutofhere he screamed through gritted teeth cabot held the reins in one hand and held his other arm up to shield his face the lethal sweeping pendulum of bobs pike had now cleared space all the way to the large oak gates at their base the beginnings of a pyre of bracken and firewood had been laid but yet to be successfully set on fire several bodies littered the ground in front of the gates the stubs of multiple crossbow bolts protruding from them liam could see the bracken and branches were going to need to be cleared aside in order to allow the cart through the gates if that is someone inside was prepared to open up for them but bob was simply too busy sweeping his pike in order to keep the rioters back to deal with that himself as the cart rolled forward into the clearing created by him the soldiers spread out from guarding the carts flanks and formed a semicircle guarding the space in front of the gates the rioters and liam had noted a fair number of them looked more like seasoned fighters even mercenaries than they did townsfolk seemed unwilling to press forward and engage the soldiers or fall within the range of bobs swooping halberd blade instead they held back jeering and cursing and continuing to rain down an endless barrage of missiles on them liam jumped down off the cart and began pulling the small mound of branches and bracken away from the bottom of the gates help me he shouted to the nearest of the soldiers the soldier glanced quickly at eddie who nodded go on do as he says he dropped his shield and sword and joined liam dragging armfuls of tangled branches and twisted bracken aside between them they soon managed to clear a gap in the thick pyre when liam suddenly felt a sharp searing pain in the small of his back the impact of something sharp and hard his legs buckled at the shock of it and he collapsed forward into the nest of branches and thorns snagged and tangled like some hapless scarecrow on a loop of barbed wire he gasped for air for a moment winded stunned beside him he heard a loud ring of impact he twisted trying to untangle himself feeling a searing pain between his shoulders to see the soldier whod been helping him clear the pyre drop heavily to his knees then clatter forward on to the dirt and cobbles wide surprised eyes rolling uncontrollably his helmet was caved in on one side and the stubby fletching of a crossbow bolt protruded a river of dark almost black blood cascaded from beneath the rim of his helmet down his face oh god help us were all gonna die out here cabot was suddenly beside liam reaching down and pulling him out of the nest of wood he was shouting something at liam but above the roar of chanting voices and the hailstone rattle and clang on the shields of the soldiers he couldnt make out what the old man was saying cabot looked back over his shoulder and quickly ducked an arcing lump of flint that shattered and sparked on masonry nearby he turned back to liam and jabbed a finger past his head shouting something again liam turned painfully grimacing at the sudden twist of his spine to see the oak gates behind him had been cracked ajar no more than would allow a single man to squeeze through sideways cabot shouted again this time directly into his ear forget the cart liam nodded as cabot pulled him roughly to his feet yeah ok he uttered to himself liam could see that eddie and his remaining ten men could do little more than hunch down behind their battered and misshapen shields several of which looked little more than twisted corners of foil paper liam cupped his hands the gate is open his words were lost amid the chanting from the rioters he tried to make himself heard again the gate is open this time eddie heard turned quickly and saw for himself he snapped an order to his men and they immediately began to shuffle backwards towards the gates liam looked for bob over the top of the carts two horses he could see his round head protected by the swinging skirt of his chainmail coif as he ducked and weaved and the metallic blur of the pikes head whizzing round like the blade of some vast propeller bob he bellowed the support unit paused straightened up like a startled rabbit and looked round for liam liam waved his arms until bob spotted him then pointed to the gates its open bob nodded and then with one last warning flourish of his pike and a deep bearlike roar that startled and hushed the rioting crowd for a few fleeting seconds he bounded around the uneasy horses and the abandoned cart the soldiers had begun stepping through the tangle of branches quickly one after the other and through the narrow gap between the gates until all that remained of them was a rearguard of eddie and two others you first eddie shouted at cabot and liam liam pushed cabot towards the gates ill wait for bob cabot nodded and followed through the gap the rioters resumed pelting them with missiles as bob arrived beside liam go bobs voice boomed a large rock bounced off his left shoulder and spun off into the night now all right all right liam nodded and beckoned at the remaining soldiers to go for the gap in the gates the air around them was now thick with the hum of incoming rocks and stones liam hunched over with his arms round his head as he waited his turn certain that some large hunk of masonry was going to brain him before he got a chance to squeeze his way through eddie waved at him to go first and liam wasted no time he stepped through the nest of remaining branches and forced himself into the narrow gap between the two large oak gates rattling like drumheads from the impact of stones and rocks then he was through into the darkness of the towers entrance arch he collapsed on to a hard floor of flagstones gasping and wheezing by the wan light of the torches outside falling through the opening he could see the pale and frightened faces of half a dozen men their shoulders braced against the gate ready in case the rioters decided to rush it and force it wider bobs head appeared through the gap between the gates wider please his voice boomed above the din the men against the gate reluctantly gave him a few more inches to push himself through and then he was inside with the others immediately a heavy locking bar was slid into place liam collapsed back on to the ground exhausted as the thick gates rattled and thudded for a while longer under the dwindling barrage of projectiles finally apart from the occasional thud it seemed the riot going on outside had spent its energy he could hear the roar of voices grow sporadic beginning to dwindle and lose some of the intensity theyd experienced earlier finally one of the men in the guard tower called down theyre leaving a man next to liam one of the guards whod handled the locking bar sighed same as last night liam grasped his arm it was like this last night as well he shrugged tis like this most nights chapter nottingham castle nottingham it took a word of command from cabot and a mere glimpse of the kings royal seal to convince one of the castle guards to take them immediately into the main keep they found the sheriff of nottingham hunched over a round oak table on which a dozen thick candles cast a flickering glow across cluttered stacks of parchment and a plate of food uneaten and forgotten what is it now he stirred drunkenly bleary eyes opened and at the sight of strangers in rags spattered with blood he lurched back in his chair and fumbled clumsily for a longsword on the table it slid off the table along with a small stack of parchment and clattered uselessly on the floor sire said the guard a young lad with tufts of ginger hair poking down from the rim of his helmet sire tis not villains the sheriff stopped fumbling for the blade on the floor and looked up nnot villains his rheumy eyes narrowed behind a tangle of dark greasy hair we are safe they they have gone the fool is drunk growled eddie under his breath aye sire replied the young guard they have dispersed as last night the sheriff collapsed back into his chair with a sigh of relief resigned to leaving his sword where it lay on the floor he muttered a prayer of thick unintelligible words and then reached across the table for a goblet of wine sire said cabot stepping forward we are on royal business his lordship earl of cornwall and gloucester oh yes what ddoes john want of me now eh he grinned up at them and then upended the goblet into his open mouth we have come directly from johns keep in oxford said cabot on his orders nottingham laughed again orders i have orders eh he attempted to pull himself to his feet stumbled a solitary step towards them before losing his balance and sprawling on to the floor he lay where he was and began whimpering finally while they waited for him to pick himself up they realized he was snoring he is of no use to anyone said cabot bob liam sighed lift him on to his bed they watched bob heft the sheriff carelessly over his shoulder and cross the hall to a large oakframed mattress liam turned to the guard is he always so drunk the young man was unsure whether he should reply answer the man barked eddie aye ssire e es turned to drink the guard looked anxiously at them dreadful afraid e is of what asked liam the people sire the people out there every night now they come out every night they gather and try an burn them gates lad where are the captains the sergeants who is in charge here the young guard shrugged many ave deserted they gone to serve other masters so who is in charge the sheriff said the lad there are no captains no sire just other other men at arms sire how many we are at alf strength perhaps no more than two undred sire but more leave each day so whyve you stayed asked liam because because theres food ere because im afraid what them people out there goina do to me sire i eard stories of soldiers caught leavin this castle what them outside ave gone done to them eddie cursed this castle will not hold the people of nottingham out much longer if all that is left inside are frightened boys cabot nodded this is not a good situation for ye to take charge of liam the young guards eyes widened and cabot noticed that aye seems this young man is to be yer new sheriff he tossed a nod at the snoring body on the bed across the hall i am sure he can do no worse a job than that drunken fool william de wendenal cabot turned to liam so lad there are things it seems that need yer immediate attention here before we go looking for a certain item liam nodded silently jayzus im supposed to be running a castle now right he said with little enthusiasm right yes he became aware that cabot eddie the young guard even bob were all looking at him waiting for him to say something why me why is it always me errr all right he said finally right he said once more for good measure umm ok eyes on him still so then eddie sire im going to put you in charge of the men here his jaw dropped open sire thats right youre the garrison commander now i want you to take command on the walls for the rest of tonight all right aye my lord eddie barked with enthusiasm liam expected him to turn and go immediately but then he realized the man was waiting to be dismissed so then uhh you can go now sire eddie turned on his heels come on lad he barked at the young guard they clumped heavily out of the hall and a minute later liam thought he heard his paradeground bark echoing up the stone walls from the bailey outside cabot filled the quiet hall with the sound of his soft wheezy laugh so liam of connor mysterious traveller from the future it seems now ye have become a part of history ye are the sheriff of nottingham this will cause contamination cautioned bob and it is exceeding our mission parameters yes liam nodded im well aware of that he glanced at the snoring drunk on the bed the man was clearly unfit for his role a nervous wreck a drunken nervous wreck perhaps the situation had done that to him the stress of it being in charge of this hopeless mess hed learned enough now to know that this country was in a perilous condition bankrupt and on the verge of complete anarchy a resentful population taxed to their knees and now starving the noblemen barons lords earls who should have been the backbone of authority providing menatarms and money to maintain order were all conspiring against john refusing to pay the tributes they owed a mess a terrible mess but a mess that was not his nor bobs concern thats how this history was meant to be anyway right im afraid mr cabot said liam that fella snoring away over there hes still the sheriff ye understand this castle is the administrative centre of the north said cabot do ye understand that if it falls into the hands of marauding peasants if they overrun this place then the country north of oxford will be lost right but its not our business if it happens then its meant to happen thats how history goes cabot studied him silently ye would let that happen if order collapses the land will be awash with the blood of innocent people cabot was probably right information there are no records in history of a popular uprising of peasants successfully overthrowing the sheriff of nottingham said bob liam looked at him you sure affirmative oh thats just grand that is he sighed youre telling me this is all wrong right that this shouldnt be happening bob nodded it appears we are experiencing incorrect history chapter new york sal sal you ok maddy noticed she was teetering on her feet unsteadily the halfempty mug of tea dropped from her slackened fingers to the floor and shattered on the hard concrete she took a faltering step then steadied herself against the edge of the kitchen table maddy got up from her armchair and put a protective arm round her narrow shoulders dizzy she replied she ok asked adam sal nodded im fine but i think that was a the archway went completely dark time wave said maddy what she could hear adams breath uneasy and ragged she felt the soft touch of air on her cheek his hands swooping and flailing in the pitch black what is this is this is this some other sort of dimension thing no she replied its just darkness the genny should kick in in a few seconds but the lights flickered back on before she heard the deep coughing throb of the generator starting up oh that means weve got power still she said looking at him and smiling thats a good sign the computer monitors began to flicker back to life one after the other that was a big wave said sal yes it was adam looked at them both so does that mean youre in an alternate timeline an alternate his head bobbed like a cork yes she made her way over to the computer desk lets see how alternate the computer system was just finishing restoring itself and bobs dialogue box flickered up on to one of the screens system reset complete bob hello maddy we just had a time wave i know but weve got power still stupid thing to say but shed said it anyway affirmative we have power but i have had to correct the voltage and amplitude settings what the power coming in is a form of direct current she looked at adam and sal standing beside the desk then maybe its a bigger change than i thought information we have no external data link no internet said sal she made a face that isnt such a good sign maddy nodded towards the shutter door something pretty bigs changed out there maybe we should go see they made their way across the floor maddy jabbed at the green button nothing happened the shutter motor linked directly to the external power line and not automatically monitored and modulated by the computer system wasnt working marvellous she muttered and began cranking the handle beside it let me said adam taking over from her the shutter clattered up slowly letting in a surprisingly bright ribbon of light for the time of day maddy checked her watch it was approaching four in the afternoon the williamsburg bridge normally blocked the sun from their dim little alleyway pretty much from two in the afternoon onwards adam stopped cranking the shutter was waist height a quick look at each other then all three of them squatted down together to look outside shaddyah whispered sal uhh all right thats not new york said adam nope said maddy almost nonchalantly no it isnt again the cobblestones of their alley ended abruptly where the energy field ended and beyond that was a bed of tidal silt that sloped down to the east river she spotted several fishing boats of various sizes lying askew on the mud like beached seals tethered to wooden mooring poles across the east river manhattan island was still there of course but instead of the forest of skyscrapers there was a sleepylooking town nestling on it she could see a carpet of gabled rooves and chimneys and somewhere in the middle the spire of a church along the edge of the town she could see more fishing boats and jetties and the bustle of activity as fishermen worked their catch ashore small cranes lifting catchnets full of squirming sea life out of their holds and on to the dockside as clouds of seagulls buzzed swooped and complained weve had worse said maddy adam shook his head its like like completely changed duh chuckled sal of course it is but theres power said maddy she pointed towards the town where a line of lamp posts carried overhead cables along the shore front so its not like weve been thrown back into some total dark age but no internet said sal on this side of the river where only moments ago the seldomused dockside cranes and abandoned warehouses of brooklyn had stood there was nothing but silt punctuated by hummocks of coarse grass and dozens of tidemarooned fishing boats surrounded by discarded coils of rope and useless torn fishing nets she spotted a solitary gravel lane to their right flanked by intermittent wooden telegraph poles it wound along their side of the river and a couple of miles further up she could see the small midriver humps of belmont and roosevelt islands and just as in the normal timeline a bridge spanned the river there albeit a very differentlooking bridge adam followed her gaze can we go and explore maddy pinched her lip absently they needed information they needed some idea when and how this alternative timeline had sprung up i think wed better maddy locked the computer system with a password and they all stepped outside closing the shutter door behind them she looked at their archway nestling low down between two hummocks of grasstufted mud it was a jagged hemisphere a scruffy igloo of old crumbly brickwork that went nowhere she wondered how visible it was to anyone looking their way from the town across the river someone surely would eventually notice the sudden arrival of a squat round dome of rustcoloured bricks nestling amid the mud and abandoned old boats maybe all the more reason to get a wiggle on come on she said pointing to the gravel lane nearby they avoided the muddy silt as best they could picked their way along crests of grass until they stepped up on to the gravel road it reminds me of of calais said adam normandy maybe he added they walked along the coastal road towards the bridge finally spotting a vehicle as they neared it a small flatbed truck loaded with wire baskets of chickens it clattered noisily on to the bridge a motor that coughed whined and growled as it sped away from them towards manhattan that looks weird said adam like were in the forties or fifties or something yes it did oldfashioned the truck looked a little like one of those old model t fords youd see in jerky black and white movies they crossed the bridge walking on one side of the road a dozen other vehicles passed them either way all looking oddly antiquated and ever so subtly framed with decorative curls and fleurs de lys of brass trim on the far side of the bridge they turned left following a road that weaved into the centre of the village where it became busier with people going about the business of a normal monday afternoon an elderly lady in a black dress and scarf pushed a wheeled basket full of baguettes and looked at them curiously as they approached her she frowned puzzled perhaps by their clothes but then she nodded and smiled at them as she passed by bonjour she uttered politely adam looked at them did you hear that french adam nodded americas gone french maddy said incredulously the road took them into a small town square overlooked by the church spire and tall townhouses that seemed to lean forward over the space a fountain gurgled pleasantly in the middle momentarily drowned out by the piercing whine of a threewheeled scooter whizzing past them driven by an old man with a child sitting across his knees this seems quite nice said sal i think i like it better its french replied maddy defensively its not right a class of schoolchildren suddenly filled the peaceful town square with their voices a walking crocodile of twobytwos carrying satchels on their backs and wearing blazers of yellow and green the timeriders watched them spill out of a building and cross the square chattering laughing making the same noise any class of children would make enjoying the novelty of stepping out of school sal pointed at a sign above the door theyd emerged from bibliotheque whats that she asked not sure maddy shrugged lets see maybe we can get some information there the other two followed her as she crossed the square took the steps up and inside into a cool dimly lit interior woodpanelled walls and a threadbare carpet tall avenues of dark wooden shelves thick with volumes of books im guessing this is a library right said sal maddy nodded yeah yeah thats right but it was unlike any library maddy had ever been in since first grade she was used to modern bright glass spaces filled with busy internet stations and orange plastic bucket chairs and racks of dvds and magazines and oh yeah one or two books somewhere history uttered adam we need to find a history book his voice echoed around the quiet library and several pairs of eyes looked up mildly irritated maddy nodded they spread out each picking an aisle and started to scan the book spines on the shelves looking for some way to identify a category after a few minutes sal softly whispered for them to come over they both joined her in what appeared to be a childrens section she was holding a large book in her hands its a kiddie history book sal flicked through several pages all of them with brightly coloured illustrations breaking up the text she spotted an illustration of roman legionaries a diagram of a sailing ship a timeline chart world history by the look of it good enough i dont suppose either of you can read any french asked maddy sal and adam shook their heads me neither she replied well have to borrow it maddy took it out of sals hands and after quickly glancing up and down the aisle she shoved it under her sweatshirt its a kids history book said adam you cant get all the information you need from that can you she shrugged no worse than wikipedia wikiwhat never mind maddy pulled another book from the shelf and flicked through several dozen pages finally nodding with approval this one looks good too she pushed it into adams hands well hide it chapter new york computerbobs cursor blinked silently on the screen for a few seconds i have completed frenchtoenglish language translation from the scanned images i will be another few moments collating the data right said maddy tapping the desk impatiently with her fingers quick as you can please affirmative she wondered how long it would be before some curious gendarme came knocking on their shutter door their oddlooking round brick bunker was visible from the gravel road and although it didnt seem to be that busy a road she was sure someone driving past would eventually register the fact that their archway ought not to be there she looked down at the library books theyd spent the last half an hour scanning not every page just the pages that dealt with the twelfth century onwards childrens history books she shook her head the illustrations were cartoony with bright colours and smiley rosycheeked depictions of knights and maidens soldiers and peasants the text was printed large and friendly little detail there she imagined history for elementaryschool kids great research there the cursor skittered across bobs dialogue box process complete i will summarize the data components for you in a chronological sequence on another screen a wordprocessor opened text suddenly blinking on to the page in sentences and paragraphs quickly building up filling the page as bob rapidly cut and pasted relevant sections of text from the database hed just constructed adam craned his neck forward eager to read what was coming up on the screen just text computerbob had not wasted time processing the many illustrations most of which seemed little more than decorative rather than informative there merely to break up the paragraphs for younger minds to digest my god uttered adam starting to read the page the great peasant rebellion of the north he looked at the other two wide eyed thats a new thing said maddy isnt it he nodded speedreading ahead down the page great peasant rebellion the fall of the plantagenet kings peasant army led by some character known as the iron duke king richard retreats to aquitaine unrest and war in england nobles united against the iron duke iron dukes peasant army finally beaten at the battle of hawley cross ensuing civil war between nobles he reached out and hit page down on the keyboard the three generations war england broken into warring factions warring factions become independent states he paged down again king charles vi invades the united federation of anglo duchies he looked away from the screen england theres no england any more that explains why they were speaking french out there then said maddy doesnt it adam read on first french colony in the americas first spanish colonies the colonial war french versus spanish colonies king phillip iii of spain signs peace accord with king charles xvi france wins when dutch republics come on their side north americas divided into french dutch spanish regions my god uttered maddy then theres no america either there is said sal but it isnt english thats all maddy shook her head hey its not the same sal its not america if it isnt you know if it isnt english sal shrugged at that i would still be indian english empire or not you are the soil you are born on not a flag or a language well thats what my old ba used to say well maddy continued muttering under her breath still i wouldnt call this place america without the stars and stripes just isnt right adam was reading on in silence its now called le union damerique actually french is the international language the language of law he scanned the text the language of science science spat maddy thats rich theres no internet and those cars and trucks they looked like they were from before the war but it seems medicine is more advanced said adam he pointed to a paragraph at the bottom of the page the page numbers kept shifting bob was still adding chunks of text to the document the cure for cancer cure for something cant read that cure for something else look said sal world population reaches billion thats half the number of people on the planet than in our time said adam this is the same time i know that he replied i meant in our version of this time sals eyes narrowed as she skimmed the paragraphs of potted history for the twentieth century i cant see any world war two either adam nodded stroking his chin theres some wars in africa a couple in south america but it seems far less war in the twentieth century than in our what because america isnt there said maddy snippily is that the point youre thinking of making he shrugged not necessarily maybe because there are a lot less people maybe that means less fighting for finite resources i dont know im no social historian there was quiet between them on the screen the documents page number was still increasing as bob continued to add collated data it does seem a much more peaceful world said sal eventually she turned to adam i have to say this is the nicest time wave weve had so far she shrugged sort of almost feels like a shame to maddy looked at her sal dont even go there what you know what just saying sal pouted thats all well dont we cant keep this world just because it seems nice its changed history majorly changed history but but what sal hesitated uncertain how to finish but what if we didnt fix it maddy stared at her in silence aghast seriously what if we didnt what if we just brought liam and the others back home and we left it like this maddy shook her head sal now is not the time for this kind of conversation she glanced at adam watching their exchange and certainly not in front of someone else you understand for the first time she noticed there were tears in sals eyes all you know is maddy you havent seen my time you havent seen new york in or anywhere else in no i havent but thats its all so shaddyah its falling apart and we know it gets worse sal warned maddy were not doing this now were not doing this in front of adam but it does you know that i know it it all gets worse and worse the pollution the whole global warming the oil wars and we dont know how it all ends up but this look at it this is better adam looked taken aback oil wars maddy waved him silent sal listen we made a promise to foster to keep history on track to keep it the same for better or for worse you remember the things he said we cant change history to what we want we just cant because because because what he never told us why he never explained that he never did not in detail anyway he said history has to go a certain way because if it doesnt things break down things go wrong what things spacetime or something the fabric of spacetime thats what he said the stuff that holds those things back from our world sal knew exactly what she meant theyd seen one of them just the once a seeker they stared at each other in silence a mutual challenge to say that word aloud what things asked adam eventually maddy ignored him sal i know weve been pulled into this without much help i know we got thrown into the deep end and there isnt a day i dont wish to god that foster was back here telling us what to do in fact there isnt a day i dont wish i could walk out the door and let the bubble reset without me but were here for a reason if we hadnt done what weve already managed to do the world couldve remained a radioactive wasteland or just a big lizardmanfilled jungle all i know is that what weve done so far has worked has been for the best you know i just you dont knoweverything maddy said sal quietly that stopped her dead that hit home no ok youre right i dont in fact all i know is how little i know and that really scares me and i dont know what that warning means either i dont maddy stopped herself she realized that to continue was to take her towards openly discussing the pandora message in front of adam adam how about you just go take a looksee outside make sure no french fishermen are gathering to marvel at our brick whatever he looked at them both ok he got to his feet and wandered over towards the shutter door and began cranking it up sal she began quietly all you and i and liam have is what foster told us we have to trust that because thats all weve got right now sal eyed her silently but were going to learn more i promise you well learn more from this voynich manuscript well find out what pandora is what it means well find out what the warning is and when we know more than we do she smiled i dunno maybe one day we can make a choice of our own you know sal nodded her head ever so slightly until then she fiddled with her glasses until then all we know is whats meant to be and what isnt and this sure as hell isnt sal tipped her head at the monitor behind maddy i think bob agrees with you maddy turned to see the blinking cursor at the end of a message recommendation mission priority has changed history contamination needs correcting yup bob youre right i think we need to get a message back to liam chapter oxford castle oxford if we successfully complete the mission liam oconnor and we return to the field office do you intend to retire me retire what do you mean terminate this body and replace it with a male support unit i heard sal vikram refer to this organic frame as a mistake becks played the memory back in her head a conversation between her and liam as they walked along a prehistoric beach and watched distant brachiosauri grazing on an open plain she knew the only reason she existed as a separate entity in her own right was because sal had carelessly activated a female embryo from stasis instead of a male one she was an error why would we want to go and do that becks the male support frame is eightyseven per cent more effective than the female frame as a combat unit well now i really dont see why we cant have one of each of you you know a bob and a becks therere no agency rules are there you know against us having two support units in a team negative i am not aware of any agency rules on that so well there you are why not well have two of you instead of one the memory now nothing more than a compressed lowresolution media clip to allow for more efficient data storage on her hard drive the image pixellated the audio flat and tinny but there was another data file that had been created in that moment a file that recorded the neuron response in the one small part of her mind that was organic a file she had no meaningful name for yet just a useful categorization ident emoteresponse have i functioned as efficiently as the bob unit yes of course i dont know what wed have done without you so far becks the file was a recording of how her mind had reacted in that moment several thousand synapses in her simple animal mind firing off minute electrical impulses perhaps the closest shed ever come to a genuine emotional response as she stared out in perfect stillness and silence at oxford below a medieval town in slumber lit only by the faint and occasional stab of moonlight she analysed the file unpacked the data and pored through it wondering what human emotion the data file emoteresponse most closely approximated gratitude no not that it seemed more than that not just a response to a sentence of praise there was something else another factor involved she ran the figures in her head played the data on a digital simulation of her organic mind to try and replay that fleeting moment of emotion more than gratitude it was the recognition of her worth she amounted to more than an error now but that wasnt it there remained numbers in the file that were unaccounted for she replayed the file the moment the memory again and her perfectly still face flickered ever so slightly in response a hand muscle twitched this time around she understood the relevant factor it wasnt just that her contribution had been praised it wasnt that shed just heard she was going to be allowed to carry on functioning as a support unit after they returned it was the fact that a particular person had said that to her liam oconnor in the darkness of her chamber as a fresh breeze played with the drapes either side of her small window she slowly cocked her head unsure what that conclusion meant further processing was halted she heard the creak of the door to her room and silently turned to observe it easing open and the dark silhouette of a figure step lightly into the room the figure crossed the stone floor with the light tap of leather soles on stone lady rebecca she recognized the soft singsong voice as johns tis i do you sleep he wandered over to the bed and started patting the mattress lady rebecca i am here becks replied she saw johns outline lurch in surprise good lord he gasped in the dark she saw the outline of his head turn one way then the other then finally settle on her standing beside the window there you are can you not sleep neg no i do not sleep neither can i he confessed stepping around the end of the bed towards her i my mind races with all manner of things i am deeply troubled he drew up in front of her very close closer she noticed than humans normally stood when in conversation my mind it needs soothing distracting from these troubles he whispered softly and you you lady rebecca i i find myself drawn to you she felt the soft touch of a hand on her neck proximity threat she reached up and grasped his wrist firmly oooh john chuckled and this is what i find so alluring about you my dear you you are so wilful analysis subject responding favourably to threat response behaviour i liked the way she felt johns breath on her cheek fluttering puffs of hot air i loved the way you took care of yourself with that soldier my dear she realized he was referring to her nearly snapping the neck of one of the guards yesterday you approve he nodded oh yes yes so so rare is it to find a woman a woman like you so so strong strong yes lord yes a woman who can fight back with one graceful movement she lifted his feet off the ground and flipped him on to his back he landed on the hard floor with a percussive grunt and she dropped down heavily on to his chest knocking the wind out of him she put a hand round his throat but at the last moment held back from throttling him john struggled on the floor gurgling his eyes drawn wide and glinting in the fleeting moonlight googh ggoghhh urghhhrhbghady rrebeghhaa her mind processed the shrill tone of his gurgling voice and the accelerated pulse in his neck and determined that she may just have misinterpreted his meaning she released her grip on his throat i apologize sire she said john stared up at her in silence his ragged breath filling the air between them his thick tawny brows seemed to knit together into an intense monobrow an expression she wasnt familiar enough with him yet to understand have i angered you she asked finally chapter nottingham castle nottingham ye understand this is a fools errand said cabot the kings forests are thick with the hooded mans followers and they fight in a way that suits the forests liam sighed a night of sleeping on the matter hadnt helped in the cold light of the january morning their situation seemed no better coils of smoke from last nights riot snaked up into the tumbling sky and the subdued town of nottingham below seemed to glare back at liam with malevolence you understand mr cabot bob and me arent here to play policemen the sheriff will have to deal with this on his own he turned to bob sitting on an oak bench beside the window and gazing out at the town bob tell him mission priority is retrieving the artefact called the grail he rumbled his eyes remaining on the rooftops of nottingham william de wendenal is nothing but a wastrel a drunkard his men are deserting cabot shook his head i had no idea the authority of john was this far gone i had no idea how bad im sorry but we cant stay here we have to go find the grail do ye not understand liam if law and order falls in this country if chaos reigns it is an invitation for civil war the barons will tear this country into pieces for themselves worse still it is an invitation to france to invade to plunder england and by god they will if they catch wind of this maybe maybe liam said rubbing at tired eyes but thats a whole other mission so it is he turned away from the window we need the men out there patrolling the forests we need to find this hood patrolling the forests there be barely enough soldiers here to hold the castle and out there out in the forests they would be cut down liam suspected cabot was right the few men left in the castle were either frightened old men or even more frightened boys getting them to even consider patrolling the town around the castle would be an endeavour beyond him let alone organizing a systematic sweep of sherwood forest bob any ideas bob remained perfectly still liam came over and prodded his shoulder bob hello cabots eyes narrowed what is the matter with him he seems entranced liam could see muscles in bobs face twitch and the slightest flicker of his eyelids what is it are you getting something just a moment replied bob processing what is the matter asked cabot again rising from the round oak table still a shambles of piled parchments and scrolls matters long overdue for the sheriffs attention i think i think were getting a signal signal liam ignored the old monks question he pulled up a stool in front of bob and sat down bob tell me what youve got decompressing widerange tachyon signal data packet he replied just a moment a new signal from maddy thats what this had to be he wondered what had happened something not good presumably finally bob stirred his gaze returned from the grey sky over nottingham and settled on liam i have a message from maddy and an attached data package liam so whats the message time wave has arrived significant contamination event originating mission requirement has changed prevent an event known as great peasant revolt see data package attached for further information on event origins pandora now a secondary consideration please acknowledge whats the data package asked liam bob blinked several times before he spoke again the great peasant revolt of began during the reign of king richard his prolonged absence on the third crusade left his country bankrupt with the king abroad the authority of the crown quickly eroded under the proxy rule of the kings younger brother john his monotone voice echoed across the hall for the better part of an hour as he read aloud the compiled dossier cabot was the first to speak when hed finished his normally gruff voice shaken and small and this these are events that are yet to happen just as i was saying to ye rebellion civil war liam nodded thats history that has now happened has happened will happen corrected liam but need not happen if if if i if we take some sort of action yes he offered cabot a smile and an apology it seems youre right mr cabot there are more pressing matters to attend to this means ye will it looks like bob and me need to stay on here he got up and wandered over to the window and leaned against the stone frame those riots going on last night that appears to be the very beginning of this peasant revolt it all starts here in nottingham affirmative said bob corrective measures will need to be applied here immediately ye have johns full authority said cabot ye will use that liam shrugged id be mad not to so liam ye will become the new sheriff of nottingham liam saw that bob looked unhappy about that i know i know if i make myself sheriff im contaminating history but it looks like negative bob interrupted contamination level may be acceptable liam laughed oh come on there was never a sheriff of nottingham called liam oconnor historical records of this time do not specify a particular name for the sheriff of nottingham you mean no one knows who it was correct this means your name is unlikely to be recorded in history this is an acceptable contamination risk cabot joined them by the window do i presume from yer exchange that ye can become the sheriff then liam nodded uh yes yes i suppose i can good cabot slapped him on the back tis much that needs doing and quickly liam sucked in a deep breath this morning then i suppose we should make a start get an idea of what supplies there are in the castle what money there is left in the coffers and perhaps find out what the people of nottingham have to say what they need the most and this hooded fella whatever whoever he is the poor seem to think hes some kind of a folk hero as soon as we can we need to deal with him cabots old face wrinkled with a smile good decisions already young man and we should also get a message back to base liam said to bob let them know were working on it and that becks is down in oxford so they know where to beam a signal if they want to contact her affirmative replied bob i will prepare an encoded message to be carved on the gravestone gravestone liam offered cabot a guilty shrug i suppose we shouldve asked first were uh were using one of your graves up at kirklees as a as a sort of message board hope you dont mind it involves sort of carving a few lines and cabot frowned ye are interfering with a mans gravestone liam nodded whose he growled angrily haskette cabot pursed his lips for a moment oh brotherrobert not to worry the man was a fool anyway chapter june normandy france he stared across the cool blue of the english channel it glistened in the morning sun calm as a millpond quiet as a monk as it lapped gently up the normandy shingle and withdrew with a whisper king richard finished urinating and tucked himself away his gaze drifted along the coast towards the small cluster of ships beached and battened up and the tents and marquees erected between them topped with pennants that twitched and swayed in the light breeze a party of english nobles had arrived to meet him in normandy all of them pledging their support for him their menatarms their money his royal tent last night had been full of them like errant schoolchildren all trying to outdo each other in their demonstrations of unflinching loyalty to the crown richard smiled just like naughty children blaming each other for the unrest in the north of england the rumours if they were to be believed mentioned a rebellion of peasants and these fools who had come to meet him in normandy should have been maintaining the order of england while he was away instead of bickering among themselves jostling for favours and power and of course his brother john the useless idiot appeared to have done little to help the situation he was weak that was his problem that had always been his problem a weakling a coward richard tasted bile in his throat and spat the whole ugly cold wet country of england disgusted him his spineless brother the squabbling twofaced nobles the repulsive peasants even the ugly language they spoke anglish its tones grated on his ears my kingdom for what it is it was worth nothing more than the taxes he could throttle out of the miserable place taxes to raise a new army and reclaim his french lands lost during the last five years france all of france that was his birthright his true home that was what god wished for him and more hed known that since he was a young man known his destiny was to rule all of christendom not just that ugly wet island of britain and with such a magnificent force behind him he would sweep once more into the holy lands and east into the arabian deserts wiping out saladins army he smiled as a freshening breeze lifted the pennants above the tents into life and they fluttered with a renewed vigour god wants this for me why else had the lord led him to learn of the treyarch confession why else had the lord ensured his success in retrieving the grail from the muslims it was safe now safe on that ugly island across the channel safe in the royal palace and waiting patiently for him to return and unlock it he felt his arms and legs tremble with excitement at the thought of that hed seen it briefly after his knights had retrieved it from the catacombs of jerusalem the yellowing brittle pages of manuscript filled with faint ink lines of writing he thought he could sense a hum of divine energy coming from it sense the meaning of it even though the words were encoded one brief glimpse and then hed dispatched it with haste into the night with the templars he most trusted to see it safely home to england to the royal palace in oxford while in his possession in his oak campaign chest was the key to unlocking the words of the lord the other half of the grail a small square of worn leather sire a shrill tremulous voice like the cry of a seagull cut into his thoughts like fingernails down a board irritated he turned to see a young squire little more than a pageboy in silks several yards away kneeling in the shingle and looking down at his own feet not daring to make eye contact the lords are asking uh wwhen it is ye pplan to set sail the young man asked nervously richards broad face creased with amusement it was funny how nervous men became in his presence they stumbled over their words their voices rose in pitch until they sounded like women they fidgeted and scratched and shuffled their cheeks flushed crimson it was as if they too sensed the energy of destiny burning inside him as if they understood that soon king richard would govern an empire larger than rome had ever known and he would rule it with the rigid discipline and firmness of a father because god wills it we shall set sail this morning on the tide he replied slowly the young squire nodded and began to back away and boy richard called out to him he stopped yes sire bark at me like that again and i shall gouge the tongue from your mouth with the tip of my sword the squires face paled he nodded silently not daring to speak again richard watched him back away to a respectful distance then turn and run towards the tents with the news he turned back to look at the channel and smiled the weather for the crossing was good the breeze freshening because god wills it chapter nottingham castle nottingham the sunlight warmed liams face he closed his eyes savoured its heat and listened contentedly to the sounds of nottingham stirring to life the tactactac of someone chopping firewood the bray of a donkey the bustle of market vendors setting up for the day the bark of a dog setting off a dozen others all these sounds echoed across the cluttered shack rooftops of the town and up towards the castle keep a flight of swallows swooped past liams narrow window and he opened his eyes to watch them dive and chase each other his gaze shifted across the warm summer shimmer of the walled town towards the spread of fields outside all of them now being worked striped with thick lines of barley and wheat someone somewhere below was singing a distant female voice that seemed to share his contentment i could live here forever he sighed he could really he could he could abandon the mission he could abandon bob and becks let them return home without him and he could remain here in nottingham as the sheriff as long as he preserved history as it was no one would need to come for him would they he could live out his natural life here lord of all he surveyed a lovely dream one he could happily indulge all day but he sighed there were matters to attend to down below in the flagstoned bailey he could see soldiers being drilled eddie working the new recruits bob was down there with him demonstrating the onguard position a longsword glinting in the sunlight above the coarse mop of his dark hair liam stepped away from the window and finished dressing himself a pageboy brought him a tray of freshly baked bread and honey and a flagon of watereddown wine ten minutes later he emerged from the dark interior of the keep into the courtyard and watched the soldiers drilling for a while finding men willing to join the guard and replenish the garrison had been nigh on impossible five months ago the people of nottingham would have turned on any young man foolish enough to announce he planned to offer his services to the sheriff but that was before liam had opened the doors of the castles storehouse and offered loaves baked fresh from the contents of their granary word got around the towns starving folk barely managing on nettle stews and pottages made from rotting vegetables and that simple gesture on day one of liams role as sheriff had put an end to the nightly riots eddie spotted liam standing and watching good morning sire he called out liam nodded and waved morning eddie your lads are looking good several of the men drilling turned and knuckled their foreheads politely smiles and nods from recruits old and young alike liam cabot and bob had taken inventory of the castle and found food stores enough for the garrison to feed on generously six months or more shared out carefully with the townspeople thered been enough for a month liam had then decreed that the kings forests were free for all to find food and game in to forage for wildgrowing shoots nuts and berries for the immediate future a popular measure that ensured a steady supply of food into the towns market every day satisfied that support for the revolt within nottingham had been averted cabot had soon returned to kirklees to oversee his priory barely a week after theyd taken over from the previous sheriff liam and bob were able to mount a few cautious patrols beyond nottinghams walls which was timely with spring arriving the fields beyond needed to be worked if the people were going to feed themselves seeing liam bob disengaged from his class of recruits and ordered them to stand easy they lowered their heavy swords and shields with sighs of relief as he walked through them towards liam sheriff he greeted liam formally liam beckoned bob to walk with him around the edge of the bailey out of earshot so they could talk freely bob he said quietly how much mission time have we got left twentyfour days nineteen hours and fortythree minutes of mission time remain liam nodded thoughtfully stroking the thin tufts of downy dark hair that had sprouted along his jaw in the last few months we have what less than four weeks left affirmative both you and becks will need to return bob nodded our mission countdown needs to be reset six months a safety measure hardcoded into them both was a selfdestruct command the tiny mass of circuitry inside their skulls would fry itself it meant computer technology from the s was never going to fall into the hands of somebody from an earlier time nor could a killing machine like bob ever become reconditioned or reprogrammed to be used by some tyrant if the support units failed to return and have their mission clocks reset a tiny puff of burntout circuitry would leave bob and becks nothing more than dribbling village idiots i think i should take a trip out to see mr cabot well need to leave a message for maddy let her know were getting on top of things bob grunted an affirmative theyd need to set up a return window so that both support units could be returned and reset it would also be an opportunity for him to update maddy fully from where liam was standing it appeared support for the peasants rebellion had ebbed away the people of nottingham at least seemed content to go about their business the poor and hungry of the surrounding towns and villages would surely soon follow their lead once the harvest was gathered and food could be distributed more widely if history was back on track and it looked that way then he and bob could proceed with the rest of their mission to comb those woods he could see on the horizon for the hooded bandit and his dwindling band of followers and hopefully retrieve the grail from them truth was that mob of bandits whether led by some hooded figure or not appeared to be operating further away now that nottingham and the surrounding area was back under some semblance of order the farms were now regularly patrolled by their raw recruits and the daily sight of a column of one hundred men in chain mail appeared to have been enough of a disincentive to those villains that no crops had been flamed or ruined so far this year this time last year liam had learned from cabot theyd been raiding every farm theyd come across the workers killed animals butchered or stolen fields left in flames and a summer had passed in which little food could be set aside for the winter the previous sheriff had done nothing to prepare for the inevitable famine except of course to ensure his own castle was well stocked liam had been stunned at how much the simple gesture of offering bread to the poor and starving of the town had achieved ending the riots with one stroke these hardy people were prepared to endure endless hardship and sacrifice and even offer their unfailing loyalty so long as their nobleborn masters treated them like human beings a simple idea for a poor lad from cork born in the year to understand almost impossible for these frenchborn lords and barons to comprehend though most of whom didnt even bother to speak the same language as the peasants they ruled over what a difference five months has made liam realized once again how there was a bewildering onesidedness to things he and bob had arrived back in at the beginning of january a cold desolate month of dark grey days now it was june winter had ended spring had been and gone and summer appeared to have arrived early the trees already thick and green with budding leaves but for maddy and sal he imagined only half an hour or an hour would have passed the time it took to recharge the displacement machine he shook his head what is the matter liam i just realized something what im ageing faster than the other two maddy and sal aye that is correct for you much more time has passed he tutted but thats not fair is it we keep doing long missions like this i could end up an old codger while theyre still bleedin teenagers bob looked at him uncertain how to respond it is an unavoidable consequence of time travel liam he sighed ahh well i suppose i agreed to this kind of thing when i let that old man foster take me they walked in silence for a while the walls echoing with the clank and rasp of eddies recruits drilling we have another tax collection organized for today dont we affirmative half a dozen of the nearest nobles estates had been paid a visit by bob liam and half the castles garrison each time theyd returned with wagons loaded with grain and a tithe of coins the nobles and barons all pleaded poverty when they turned up outside their walled keeps all claiming that johns taxes had left them destitute and starving but it was surprising how well fed they and their household servants all seemed to be and how well stocked their granaries were meanwhile their tenant farmers beyond the walls looked as much like scarecrows as the people of nottingham had last winter well do the visits first then you can return with the loot but i need to go on to kirklees bob stopped you should not travel without an escort liam there are still bandits in the forest i know i know ill take some men with me i promise on horseback we should make it before nightfall we can stay at the priory and return early tomorrow i just think its time to update the others and make sure becks is ready to come back her mission clock is ticking down too affirmative eddie called out and his men ceased drilling liam watched the recruits at rest a pair of young women moved among them with water butts strung from poles across their shoulders they served the hot and thirsty men ladles of water that they drank and splashed across their sweaty faces i wonder said liam i wonder how shes doing chapter oxford castle oxford have i told you lady rebecca have i told you how beautiful your eyes are john cooed from her lap he looked up at her a blissful smile stretched across his face have i my dear becks nodded and smiled down at him faintly one hundred and twentyseven times sire she replied matteroffactly as she gently stroked his cheek he laughed you are so so precise he sat up suddenly and looked at her intently that is why i think i have fallen so in love with you you are not like all the other women i have known featherheaded moocows who think of nothing but poems and silly frivolities you are he frowned struggling to find the right words you are so very different she nodded slowly carefully weighing up what was the most appropriate thing to say back to him response candidates i thank you for your kind words sire relevance i wish to be different for you my love relevance i am different sire i am a combat unit from the year relevance she giggled shyly a gesture shed observed other women use all the time in response to flirtatious flattery i thank you for your kind words sire he frowned mock serious sire sire you must call me john my dear please in fact i am yours to call whatever you wish she nodded then i shall call you john he smiled dreamily and collapsed back his head cradled in her lap once more i have never felt so content he murmured his eyes closing as she stroked his troubled brow never in my miserable life not even with so many things to vex me troublesome barons no money unrest troubles troubles troubles he continued she pretending to listen nodding at what she calculated were the right moments but the cognitive part of her mind was busy elsewhere mission time remaining hours minutes time was running out another three weeks and she would have to return to if frustration had been an emotion she could emulate she supposed shed be feeling it now just over five months of this simulating loveplay with the earl of cornwall and gloucester that first night hed visited her room unannounced expecting her to surrender herself to him she had miscalculated the response and thrown him to the floor that was the night he later admitted that hed fallen head over heels literally in love with her at first shed been uncertain how effective and convincing her responses were going to be to his overtures his poems his breastbeating declarations of utter infatuation but then one of the household maids had spotted her awkwardness and taken her to one side an older woman with a lifetime of experience to offer her she listened intently the maid gave becks advice on how best to respond to all the things john was likely to say how best to please him shed wondered how exactly to translate the nugget of advice into a practical behavioural response strategy crossreferencing it with modern language idioms she concluded the old lady meant play hard to get which was the tactical solution shed decided to adopt and it appeared to have worked john to use another modern expression was like putty in her hands like a fawning puppy she understood that gave her some degree of leverage that she could ask favours of john that no one else would dare to ask but a part of her ai understood human behaviour enough to know that to ask him too much about the thing she wished to know more about was to invite his suspicion this thing of course was the treyarch confession in the last five months she had chosen to raise the subject less than half a dozen times on each occasion shed only asked after ensuring john had consumed enough wine to render him insensibly drunk his rambling replies had yielded some useful information the confession was something that his older brother richard had come across as a much younger man back when the sons of henry ii were all still boys and living at beaumont palace it was apparent that john was not lying when he said he had no idea how the document found its way into the royal library but that somehow his father had acquired it according to john throughout his childhood he had memories of how his father guarded it carefully and read it frequently it became an obsession of his older brother richard an obsession to find out what mysterious story was contained in this confession and one day when he was merely twelve years of age richard finally discovered the confession hidden carefully in his fathers library of scrolls parchments and manuscripts and it changed him as john muttered on about love in her lap becks replayed in her mind the audio file of the last occasion theyd spoken about the confession hed been lying by the fire as it roared and crackled from a fresh log his voice thick with drunkenness his words slurred overnight it seemed richard was utterly transformed he was still an awful bully but now now he was a bully with a singular vision of destiny he said he would take fathers kingdom and make it an empire that god had shown him the way he would do it i know i know this is why the stupid fool went to the holy land as soon as father and our oldest brother geoffrey died and richard became king thats the first thing he did launch his bloody crusade becks heard her own voice god showed him the way he would do it yes yes it was in that wretched confession wasnt it the grail story you see it was all in there it was what turned him into the crazy man whats made him so so very dangerous is the confession still in the royal library i i would not know nor care to know it i suppose richard would consider oxford the safest place for it to be kept but please enough of that madman my dear im getting stomach pains thinking about him a pause you fear him another pause a long one then finally i am terrified of him because he will blame you for losing the grail no sound except the crackle of flames on scorched wood becks however recalled his gesture a silent nod of the head his eyes wide with the look of a man considering his own imminent death i fear i will be a dead man on his return she recalled the haunted look on his face let me at least enjoy whatever time i have left with you and not speak his name again tonight chapter kirklees priory yorkshire sebastien cabot greeted liam with a cheerful wave as he clucked his tongue and reined in his horse behind him the crunch of boots and horses hooves on hard sunbaked soil ceased as eddie ordered the men to a halt sire called out cabot stepping through the gate of the priorys front gardens to meet him tis a wonderful surprise liam swung a leg over his horses back and stepped down out of the stirrups on to the ground he was hot and clammy beneath the quilted tunic and the robe of office he ran a sleeved forearm across his damp forehead pushing dark sweatsoaked hair out of his eyes its hot so it is he said needlessly cabot winked slyly good for the grapes and apples the two stared at each other for a moment then liam extended a hand cabot grasped it with both has been too many weeks since last i saw ye my friend liam nodded busy very busy what has brought ye this way sire we paid a visit to sir guys estate and sir raymonds this morning both pleading poverty but like all the others both very plump and extremely wealthy so we collected what they owed long overdue i would say aye liam wiped the damp from the thin downy bristles on his upper lip sebastien he said quietly im also here to uhh to talk the old man nodded of course liam turned to gesture at his soldiers all of them exhausted from the miles theyd covered so far today and equally hot under their vests of chain mail would your brothers see to these soldiers a little water a little food maybe of course sire he turned and bellowed orders across the garden and several monks emerged from a small orchard beside the barn baskets in hand ye wish to go somewhere private asked cabot liam nodded news of yer good work in nottingham has spread said cabot ye are fast becoming a popular sheriff young liam but not so popular with all them noble fellas right the nobles hate ye he shrugged they see ye as a young pretender they each wonder why it is that john has not chosen them to administer the north and he chuckled ye actually make em pay the taxes they owe liam slurped on his flagon savouring the cool trickle of water down his parched throat sebastien we will have to leave soon leave to yer time why its just the way it works we have to go back to our time for a bit but but ye cant return the sheriffs office to that wastrel william de well be back i promise you we just have to check in with our colleagues see how things are in the future the future uttered cabot his old face creased i would dearly love to see a little of that its not so great sebastien liam sighed tell me something of it the old monk already knew too much someday soon a decision was going to have to be made about him whether they could trust him or not a little more knowledge would probably make little difference its a crowded world he replied thats what i find a crowded world full of noisy fat people fat he nodded as plump as the lords and barons everyone even the poorest lives a lords life by comparison to the people here everyone eats more than they need everyone has more things than they would ever need tis a good time that ye come from then he shrugged it should be cabots eyes narrowed but ye do not miss it liam knew when he was all done here in hed miss rising each morning with the sound of cockerels stirring and the distant ring of a blacksmiths hammer the smell of woodsmoke and unleavened bread baking in hundreds of clay ovens i could happily stay here he said after a while then realized that was perhaps too much of an admission but i cant sebastien duty calls so it does duty i can understand that a gentle breeze stirred the tall grass of the graveyard they were alone here at the rear of the priory liam said cabot after a while is this world of mine he gestured with both his hands is this world as it should be now is this the correct england of yer history books i dont know yet the unrest that there was in nottingham months ago could have become a much bigger problem for john there was a new history created in my time a history where a rebellion broke this country into pieces and the french invaded and there was no more england good god and i think i hope were well on the mend from that but but what but history i think is still altered in smaller ways i mean think about it me me as the sheriff for one and all the things that you now know those are all small differences that could lead to bigger changes cabot hunched his shoulders ye worry i would tell others of these things ye have told me well to be honest yes who would believe any of it they would think it the ramblings of an old mad monk he laughed travelling to tomorrows yet to be worlds shaped like balls who would listen to that nonsense i would be clapped in stocks and have rotten food thrown at me for amusement he had a point i have a thought what perhaps young liam perhaps history too is round in a sort of way what do you mean cabots bushy eyebrows locked with concentration round such like a carts wheel perhaps ye were always meant to come back and be the sheriff of nottingham perhaps i was always meant to be told these things by ye the old man had an interesting point and perhaps our poor john was always meant to have lost the grail is that what your history books say liam about the holy grail liam emptied the cup i dunno i think theres nothing certain on that i think history books treat the grail like a fairy story or a myth or something there then said cabot smiling if it is a thing that never was then for it to be lost what difference does that make true he leaned forward and punched liam on the arm affectionately ye worry too much lad dont i just he smiled anyway sebastien he produced a sheet of parchment from the inside of his robe a single line of pigpen symbols were scrawled across it we need to cut this into he looked at the gravestone into poor old haskettes gravestone cabot studied the parchment for a moment ye know tis a very good thing this code of yers is all straight lines i am no stonemason i cannot engrave a curve worth speaking of he pulled a masons hammer and chisel from the apron of his robe to work then chapter new york it was dark outside lit only by a half moon the east river sparkled silver and reflected the amber glow coming from the lamps of several fishing vessels moored across the water a dozen street lamps in the small fishing port across from them theyd learned it was called laurentsurmer glowed mutely and windows here and there flickered with the movements of family life ive never seen new york so peaceful said adam it reminds me of my grandparents village up in scotland maddy nodded therere some places like this up in maine and connecticut all nice and picturepostcardlike they listened for a while to the soothing ebb and draw of gentle lapping waves and the faroff cry of seagulls so how long have you been in this timetravel agency i mean not always right you sound like youve done other things had a life before all this she nodded sure i did well she shrugged telling him a little about herself was probably not going to do any harm im from boston originally my folks live there i went to high school there then i went to college to major in computers i bummed out after the first year why i got a job with a games company seemed pointless going on with the degree an all where was the job here in new york programming user interface stuff on an online game kind of like world of warcraft but way better world of warcraft im sorry never heard of that stupid she laughed at herself of course not it doesnt come out until so how did you go from being a code monkey to being a time traveller asked adam thats quite a professional jump she looked at him im not sure i should tell you too much adam remember i said you wouldnt be able to stay with us and the more you know the bigger the problem so its best if i just say i got recruited maddy suddenly felt dizzy as if shed been spinning on a merrygoround with her eyes closed ohh she murmured queasily you feel sick too said adam beside her hang on was that a yup she turned to call inside for sal but she saw sal was already halfway across the floor hurrying towards them and uncoiling loops of data cable in her wake good job maddy said taking the end of the cable and plugging it into the hard drive sitting at her feet she looked up and studied the distant town and the fishing boats dotted across the river for a few moments even though it had been intense enough a ripple that even she and adam had felt it nothing appeared to be any different out there as far as she could see looks like we got another message from liam sal called from inside a moment later adam and maddy were standing either side of her staring at the grainy image of a gravestone on the monitor look see she said pointing at the image theres definitely more stuff carved on there now maddy leaned forward it was easier to detect the faint worn grooves in the old stonework now that theyd manipulated the image to a much higher contrast yup thats new all right she grabbed a pen from the desk and her notepad and the sheet of paper with adams pigpen cipher scrawled on it ok then lets work out what weve got the three of them peered closely at the screen despite the sharper image this time the grooves appeared to be shallower as if a different tool had been used in some places worn away until almost nothing but a guess could be made hmmm maddy murmured chewing on her pen adam grabbed another pen and began scribbling down the symbols that were clear enough to be certain of a minute later there was some semblance of a sentence emerging on paper i cant make that out said maddy what does it say oh come on its really easy said sal revolt stopped ready for return await instructions adam quickly inserted the missing letters they fitted the gaps perfectly he looked at her and grinned outstanding maddy continued chewing on the end of her pen but nothings changed out there or maybe it has and we cant see it yet cos its dark thing is that sure isnt new york out there still stating the obvious of course but she didnt care things still arentright maddy what is it bob some of the data on my system has changed what hows that possible the preservation fields on isnt it affirmative however the time ripple was significant enough to cause a temporary voltage dip the preservation field was down for several seconds sal looked at maddy shaddyah does that mean it has affected us i dunno she looked sal up and down you dont look any different what about me she flickered a smile you still look like a geeky geek thanks she turned to adam you ok adam but he was staring at her wideeyed his mouth hung open adam good god he slowly gasped whoareyou peoplewhere am i maddy turned to sal wondering what kind of a mess they were in now when adam finally cracked a wide grin just kidding she cursed under her breath and shot him pistol eyes thats not even close to being funny you moron computerbobs cursor skittered across the screen of the historybook pages you scanned have changed file size adam looked down at the library books theyd stolen a little earlier stacked on the end of the desk if their contents changed the page layouts may be changed and it would affect the size of the digital files a little maddy nodded bob what about the summingup document you put together the potted history that has also changed put it up on screen lemme see it the document appeared beside his dialogue box identifying text sequences that have changed bob began highlighting all the parts of the text that had been altered which was to say most of it adam began to read snippets of it aloud king richard returns from the third crusade reclaims his kingdom from his younger brother john the siege of nottingham john surrenders and begs for king richards mercy king richard executes his brother for high treason has him hung drawn and quartered adam shook his head thats still wrong the correct version is that richard forgives him lets him live you sure asked maddy of course im sure you never heard of king john she shrugged i guess i saw a disney cartoon once with a king john in it but then he was like a fox or a lion or something so i didnt take it too seriously sal had been reading ahead theres no mention of this peasant rebellion of the north any more the other two read on liam said hed stopped the rebellion in his message she added but if you look what it says there englands still going to end up disappearing adam resumed skimming the document king richard announces the fourth crusade he looked at the girls well there was certainly no fourth crusade thats new he resumed the fourth crusade is championed by king richard his goal again to retake jerusalem this time round there is little support for it despite a papal bull being issued whats one of those asked sal the pope basically announcing god says its a cool idea king richard raises ruinous taxes and incurs crippling debts to fund the crusade and in leaves england for the last time king richard and eleven thousand knights and menatarms are massacred by saladins army at the battle of al karak with no successor in england and the country bankrupt anarchy ensues king philip ii of france invades and so on adam shook his head same result still england gets gobbled up by france said sal this fourth crusade didnt happen you say no in normal history when richard failed to take jerusalem during the third crusade that was pretty much the end of the wars in the holy land all the christian kingdoms just sort of lost the appetite to fight for it none of them could afford another crusade anyway fact is in normal history when richard returned home he turned his attention to rebuilding his kingdom reclaiming territories hed lost to the french in normandy that became his sole focus for the last six years of his life getting back the lands hed lost while hed been on his holy war maddy pursed her lips hmmm somethings changed his focus focus adam shook his head more like obsession i mean whats going on there he ruins his country he bankrupts himself and he launches what looks like a suicidal last crusade why he went mad said sal some historians say he was already a bit loopy something new then said maddy maybe something that liams caused maybe something to do with the voynich manuscript she took off her glasses and rubbed her eyes if theres some other time traveller back there then perhaps something theyve done the others looked at her silently there were no answers only questions ok all right heres what we do we send back another data package of this new version of history and ask liam if theyve got any ideas at all whats suddenly eating richard that he wants to go back to jerusalem again she put her glasses back on meantime weve still got the scheduled sixmonth return window if they want to use that or if they want to come back any earlier theyll need to send us a timestamp chapter sherwood forest nottinghamshire so the pig says back to the farmer if ye sees what i seen yer wifes up to yed ave a curly tail too eddies ruddy face crumpled like an old rug on a smooth polished floor the other soldiers behind him those within earshot cackled along with him like a bunch of fishwives their voices echoing off into the forest either side of the track liam looked at the captain of his escort sorry eddie im not sure i get it well sire see the pigs been watchin the farmers behind eddie one of the soldiers suddenly lurched forward he dropped his shield and started clawing with both hands at his throat whats whuh then liam saw a bright spurt of crimson gushing from the young mans flapping mouth and for the first time noticed the stub of a crossbow bolt protruding from the front of his throat eddie responded far more quickly form up his paradeground voice filled the forest trail just as another dozen projectiles whistled through the air towards them two arrows thudded into the horses flank either side of liams right thigh the horse reared up and he rolled backwards over the beasts rump to land heavily on the hard mud track the horse bolted leaving a wake of dust behind it liam was winded lying on his back gazing up at a rich blue summers sky punctuated by blurred slithers of movement arrows and bolts passing overhead he struggled to get a breath in him and then eventually suspecting hed spent the better part of a minute on his back he hefted himself dizzily up on to his elbows through a cloud of dust he could see his men shields raised above their heads as they clustered around him squatting down in a protective circle the peace of the forest was lost in the deafening rattle of arrow tips clattering off their shields its an ambush liam struggled to gasp as he pulled himself on to his hands and knees eddie looked back over his shoulder and nodded worked that out sire over the rim of shields liam could see their attackers now flitting dabs of olive and brown rags among the trees and bracken impossible to guess how many of them but far more than his escort of twelve he figured he cursed himself for not having bob come along with them yesterday but hed been far more concerned that the rest of the column laden with wagons of food and several bags of coins made its way back to nottingham castle without incident too cocky by half hed made the mistake of believing the bandits had fully moved on from sherwood forest that hed done a better job of shooing them off than he apparently had if hed only just taken bob with him even just another ten or twenty men you idiot one of eddies lads grunted deeply and rolled flat on his back an arrow through one eye one of his legs twitched and drummed against the hardbaked mud as he went into shock sire barked eddie we should keep moving he nodded up the forest track the way theyd been heading he was right theyd been well on the way home another two hours and the forest gave way to open fields across a rolling hill down to nottingham if they kept in tight formation kept their shields up kept moving theyd have a better chance than they would staying put here right yes liam nodded eddie barked at his men ordering them to tighten up closer together with me now he yelled and began to step forward the other men followed suit with liam huddled in the middle pulling the thick velvet cloak round his neck as if it had any chance of stopping an arrow they began to make painfully slow progress along the forest track little more than a shuffle that kicked dust into the air and filled their eyes and mouths with grit another man went down howling in agony and clutching at an arrow shaft through his shin this is no good shouted liam were not going to get very far he saw eddie nodding under the shadow of his shield its thin metal peppered with gashes and dents through which rays of sunlight streamed we could make a break for it sire liam chanced a quick look up the trail some of their attackers had spread across the track a thin line of men in rags casually stringing arrows and firing opportunistically their way more than a dozen up ahead but none of them armoured none of them equipped for close combat eddie and his remaining nine could probably take them break through and then after that it would be every man for himself drop shields drop swords and just run for it all right liam nodded his mouth dry yeah llets do that then eddie cleared his throat and spat men on my word we charge down the archers ahead clear several heads nodded a mixture of young and old faces some of them he knew had seen a fight before most of them hadnt they were little more than farm workers whod been taught how to bear a shield swing a sword and march in a straight line make ready liam felt naked no chain mail nor shield or sword he unclipped the robe from his neck and let it fall to the ground it was only going to slow him down he pulled a ceremonial knife from the belt round his waist an ornate dagger with a beautifully decorated haft and a pointlessly blunt and useless blade still it felt better than having nothing in his hands sire eddie nudged him gently ready he nodded working his tongue round his mouth trying to find some spittle in there the hell i am he saw eddie doing the same and realized in that moment that he wasnt the only one scared out of his wits on my word we rush them eddies voice rasped and make as much noise as ye can lads well scare the devil out of them a couple of the older faces grinned at that right then eddie took a lungful of air at em without hesitation the men hed been drilling these last few months uneducated field hands that hed managed to build a bond with surged forward as one a defiant roar coming from every mouth liam found himself sprinting forward shoulder to shoulder with them his own screaming voice filling his ears the thin line of archers twenty yards ahead of them regarded them with comically round eyes he saw a couple of them fumble to string and then drop their arrows in panic others fired hasty and illjudged shots that whistled too high over them but then as the gap quickly closed he saw one then several then the rest take the first faltering steps backwards which swiftly turned into a fullscale rout go on run ye cowards screamed eddie a wide manic grin stretched across his face ahead of them the archers pelted down the forest trail like startled rabbits liam chanced a glance over his shoulder and saw more of them emerging from the woods behind them loosing off arrows their way many of them falling short were gonna do it he found himself thinking for the first time daring to wear a defiant grin on his own face but then on to the trail ahead a tall figure emerged chapter sherwood forest nottinghamshire it stood calmly in their way as the bandit archers streamed past seven feet tall a giant swathed in dark robes and a cowl that hid his face in deep shadow the sight of the figure caused their charge to falter and liam heard the men curse under their breath the hood yelled one of the younger soldiers god help us its the hood he dropped his sword and shield tis but a man in old cloth eddie snarled angrily pick up yer weapon but the young boy was already gone scrambling off the trail through brambles and ferns and very soon lost from sight their charge was halted now just ten nervous men standing in a forest trail cowering beneath shields the occasional arrow coming from behind and the solitary hooded figure ahead of them blocking their way eddie turned to his men come on ye fools but liam could hear even in his voice a wavering uncertainty it might just be a mortal man but it was still a huge mortal man and in his hands he held a broadsword that glinted sunlight as it swung casually back and forth the figure suddenly began to stride towards them the way it moved long even regular strides arms calmly down by the sides no sense of flinching or cowering reminded liam of bob reminded him of the economical and purposeful way he moved a memory flashed through his mind a memory that seemed to come from another lifetime bob calmly moving through a prison camp executing every guard in his way a pulse rifle blazing in each hand liam reached for the discarded sword and shield fumbling and dropping the sword nervously so that he had to pick it up again just run he hissed at eddie and the other men suddenly certain he knew what was approaching them you cant beat this thing just do your best to get past it several of the men took liams word for it dropped their shields and swords and ran for the treeline either side of the track but eddie and four others remained bunching up close together around liam presenting a shield wall to the figure run sire shouted eddie over his shoulder well hold him the hooded figure suddenly broke into a run and covered the last ten yards in a silent sprint he collided with eddie and his men bowling them backwards a roundhouse sweep of his broadsword lopped one of the mens arms off at the elbow sending it spinning into the air hand still clasped round the swordhilt one of the other men thrust his blade at the side of the hooded man the black cloak collapsed inwards and liam heard a clunk as the blade met something hard beneath the hooded figure reached with a gloved hand for the blade and snapped it with a sharp twist tossing the broken metal off into the woods it cocked its head for a moment studying the man holding nothing but the broken hilt of his sword in his hands and liam would swear blind later that he saw the figure wag its finger at the man before picking him up by the throat and hurling him like nothing more than a bundle of twigs off into the trees its head turned back and beneath the shadow of the hood liam sensed its gaze was locked specifically on him eddies remaining two men broke and ran leaving him alone in the middle of the trail beside liam the hooded figure strode past eddie as if he simply wasnt there sire run liam realized the thing had fixed on him for some reason he did as eddie said dropped the shield and sword hed picked up and backed quickly away towards the treeline he saw eddie lunge with his sword at the hooded figures back ramming it hard into the space between its shoulderblades the figure lurched in response and liam thought he heard some sort of wheezing whine come from beneath the hood eddies blade must have found some chink in the armour beneath the figure spun round to face him the blade of the handle protruding from its back the response was a savage thrust with the broadsword that punched a hole through the jagged and pockmarked remains of eddies shield the long blade continuing on into the mans chest liam watched eddie gasp then collapse slowly to his knees stuff this he then turned and ran off the track and into the woods charging through low branches and brambles that whipped and stung his cheeks his heavy leather boots stumbled over roots and hummocks in the ground his rasping breath and the snap of twigs and branches beneath him seemed to fill the silent woods around him he realized the racket he was making as he scrambled away from that thing was giving him away but he couldnt bring himself to slow down he ran for what he guessed was another minute before he finally stopped and turned to look behind him he expected to see the wraithlike fluttering outline of black robes weaving past trees and through brambles hot on his heels instead the woods were still empty liam gasped air into his lungs doubling over and dryheaving from the sudden exertion the burn of nerves he spat phlegm on to the ground and straightened up on legs that felt like jelly all he had a chance to notice was the blur of something in motion towards him then he was seeing a world of speckled white chapter beaumont palace oxford becks looked at the first grey light of dawn stealing in through the tall slitted windows she calculated that she had another fortyseven minutes until the sun breached the horizon and the city of oxford began to stir to life john of course was going to be asleep for another couple of hours at least shed worked out the average time that he emerged from his chambers and started bawling for breakfast it was usually eleven minutes past nine although last night shed made sure hed consumed several flagons of wine which meant perhaps another hour before he stirred it would take her precisely twentyseven minutes to make her way back out of the deserted halls and cloisters of beaumont palace occupied by a skeleton crew of soldiers and servants and jog the mile back to the walls of oxford city the citys walls were poorly maintained and the missing blocks of masonry and cracks in the mortar made it possible to be scaled shed get back into the castle itself climbing the rear bailey wall twentyseven minutes from now she would be back in her chambers pretending to be asleep she continued studying the wooden shelves of scrolls and leatherbound volumes of illuminated manuscripts in beaumonts royal library she pulled them off the dusty shelves one at a time scanning sample pages of each in an attempt to identify the correct document shed examined seven hundred and twentysix candidate documents over the last five hours of night her hard drive stored their digital images and her processor was working overtime to translate the elaborate swirls of handwriting into recognizable text characters none of the texts shed scanned and translated so far had produced anything useful thered been endless essays on royal protocol and volumes of romantic poetry but nothing she could classify as vaguely relevant she had opted for a very simple search algorithm any text that scored high on a hitlist of terms sorted into relevance by order search terms treyarch relevance pandora relevance confession relevance templar relevance grail relevance jerusalem relevance code relevance so far twelve of the documents had contained three of the seven words thirtytwo had contained two or more terms and a hundred and five had contained one or more confession was the highestscoring search term so far it seemed a lot of people from this time felt the pressing need to confess something she continued robotically pulling out manuscripts amid showers of dust motes opening them and grabbing snapshot images but somewhere inside her head a part of her ai that wasnt overloaded with running characterrecognition software was wondering whether this approach was going to deliver any useful results she paused a heavy leatherbound volume held in midair dust cascading down in front of her her mind was making a quick assessment of the situation of the amount of time she had left and of the thousands of scrolls and volumes shed yet to scan her eyes followed a small tuft of fluff the small downy feather of some bird that must have found its way in through one of the slit windows she watched it gracefully seesaw down to the stone floor and then settle she was about to resume scanning the leatherbound manuscript in her hand when the feather gently stirred it spun on the spot for a moment before flitting lightly across the floor curious at the sudden movement she suspended the maths going on in her head and squatted down to look at the feather she reached out picked it up and put it back on the floor where it had settled a moment ago it was still for a moment then it twitched spun then once again slid across the floor in a short stopstart motion away from the wall beside her she looked at the wall like the rest of the walls in the library it was decorated with oakwood panels identify wall wood oak purpose decorative she ran her fingers down the grained surface all the way down to the floor and there from a gap between the panel and floor no more than half an inch she felt a cool draught on the tips of her fingers she tapped the wood panel with her knuckles the knock echoed around the cavernous library assessment primary sonic response mhz frequency delay milliseconds she cocked her head and tapped again certain this time that it meant there was a significant space behind the panel she pulled her fist back and rammed it forward it disappeared through a splintered hole with a crack that reverberated around the library she pulled her fist back out and stared through the hole shed created beyond she could see a small room little more than an alcove lit by the faintest grey light at dawn coming through a tiny slitted window she saw what looked like a wooden lectern with a thick tallow candle on one side and in front of it a bench with a dustcovered cushion on it a private reading space of some sort she was about to destroy the rest of the panel with a few wellaimed kicks and punches but found that it swung out on hidden hinges with a soft creak she stepped into the small alcove beyond and now saw sitting on the lectern a roll of parchment wrapped around a simple wooden spindle she unfurled it slowly hearing the brittle parchment crackling spread across the yellowing page a spidercrawl of fading ink in lines that sloped and rose untidily her forehead creased absentmindedly as she struggled to make sense of the looped letters and errant spelling of a man quite clearly beginning to lose his mind this the confession of gerard treyarch wryten in the yeare of our lorde chapter dover king richard leaped from the prow of the rowboat and splashed down into the tumbling surf sensing the crunch and clatter of pebbles beneath his heavy boots english ground once more the dawn sky was a blue grey patiently awaiting the arrival of the sun but it was light enough to see further up the beach at the base of the cliffs a welcoming committee of assembled noblemen and their squires guttering torches and braziers burned brightly casting light among the many colours of coats of arms he waded forward through the waves and up out of the rolling surf on to the beach faces expectant regarded him warily i know what you all want he mused they wanted to be seen to throw themselves at his service to pledge undying loyalty to him to kiss his hands and praise god for his safe return and when all that was done theyd all be vying with each other to beg for titles and special privileges to seek tax exemptions permissions to build fortified properties licences to trade exotic imports with one gasp theyd plead unfailing loyalty with the very next be begging favours bloodsucking leeches the lot of them but necessary allies for now he was going to need their revenues their men for a while longer until hed reestablished his authority and more importantly held the divine power of the holy grail in his hands power enough to vanquish any army foolish enough to stand in his way so many years dreaming of this waiting for this moment the last of those years spent as the prisoner of duke leopold awaiting the ransom that would finally set him free and all that time all of those frustrating months having in his possession one half of what he needed the key but not the lock the cardan grille but not the precious text itself the word of god the grail a curse and a blessing he reminded himself if hed had the grail with him when hed been captured then it might well have been in leopolds possession right now that ignorant oaf far too stupid to realize the awesome power hed be holding in his hands richard grinned his broad mouth parted showing a row of small yellow teeth he could feel destiny touching him gods hand on his shoulder whispering promises softly into his ear just a days ride now perhaps two up to oxford where it currently was waiting for him in the royal palace and there alone in the royal library in his private reading room he was finally going to be able to spread the grail across his lectern unroll the cardan grille hed managed to keep hidden on his person in the dungeons of leopolds castle it was a roll of worn leather which when unravelled was no more than two palms wide and four deep and cut into it a matrix of tiny rectangular windows through which individual letters could be perceived letters that were going to spell out words words from god himself words when uttered aloud that would give richard the raw unbridled power of an archangel hellfire at his fingertips he knew this as one of the many promises god had quietly whispered to him his heart raced with excitement as the nobles looked on expectantly at their king richard had planned some sort of a rabblerousing speech that would have these fat and greedy fools roaring a hurrah for their king but then he spotted the white robe and the red cross of a single templar standing back from the gathered barons and lords a mere knight he readily accepted his place at the back of the queue allowing lords dukes and barons their business with the king first a templar perhaps with news richard strode up the beach towards the man as he did the nobles began to surge forward like so many jostling children each keen to be the very first to welcome their king home the baron henri de croy thrust himself into richards path dropping his heavy girth down on to one knee and clasping pudgy thickfingered hands together in prayer oh i thank the lord he has brought you home safely to us my king he bellowed richard curled his lip in disgust and casually stepped around the man other nobles were clustering towards him all claiming their devotion to him at once a growing clamour of insincere voices richard struggled to find the templar knight hed seen having lost sight of him amid the confusion of colourful coats of arms and standards the wall of bearded and amply fed faces all spouting meaningless nonsense at him be quiet his lions roar of a voice pealed across the beach and echoed off the chalk cliffs in front of him once more there was a stillness on the beach filled only by the gentle draw and hiss of the lapping tide templar he called out where are you heads turned among the nobles voices in a low murmur richard narrowed his eyes looking again for the distinct flash of red cruciform on white he heard the crunch of footsteps through pebbles and saw among the gathered crowd of barons and lords bodies parting to make way for someone coming forward finally the templar knight appeared before richard the knights face was vaguely familiar but he could not recall the mans name he recognized him from three years ago hed been among his cadre of loyal crusaders whod taken acre he offered the knight a brotherly smile from one warrior of god to another both of them veterans both of them crusaders but the man looked uncomfortable unable to meet his eyes looking down at his feet my king he began licking dry lips finding a quiet voice my king i bear bad news richard took a step closer he lowered his voice to little more than a whisper and leaned forward until his mouth was almost beside the mans ear what pray tell is this bad news sire the grail is lost stolen chapter sherwood forest nottinghamshire liam awoke into a fog of thudding agony every movement sent sharp splinters of pain through his head he was looking up at a clear blue sky through branches of leaves that jostled and swayed another pleasant summers day it promised to be but it was cool cool with the damp of dew a morning yet to properly get going he wondered how long hed been out for a day he decided not to turn his head it ached far too much he could hear activity around him the chopping of firewood the clang of a ladle against a metal cooking pot the jangle of horses harnesses the scrape of a blade being sharpened along a whetstone master locke a voice nearby called out he is awake now liam snapped his eyes quickly shut again he heard more movement around him men stirring the clank of things being put down the soft crunch of footsteps on pine cones slowly approaching him his mouth was covered with a gag of foulsmelling material some thugs sweaty rags no doubt but his eyes clenched tightly the lids flickering were giving him away youre awake fool i can see it growled a deep voice a booted foot kicked him roughly in the side of the ribs and liam grunted painfully he opened his eyes to see a tall man with long untidy locks of sandycoloured hair looking down at him see now i knew you were awake the man smiled then squatted down beside liam hmmm so youre the sheriff whos been giving me so much trouble liam could say nothing his mouth clogged with the dirty rag his hands bound behind his back with twine and so young as well he uttered cocking his head curiously he spoke in a lowered voice you know you did a far better job than the previous idiot he managed to turn nottingham and most of the county against him made my life very easy here no end of starving malcontents joining the cause every day liam looked over his shoulder at the gathering crowd of ragged men but you young man youve turned things around havent you made things very difficult for me john chose wisely this time a noble with a brain for once he smiled sadly which makes it a real shame that i have to do this the man stood up and turned to the assembled crowd pick him up lets see what the hood wants done with him a dozen pairs of rough hands seized and hefted him on to his feet liam looked around at the camp an odd assortment of flimsy wooden shacks wattleanddaub huts and cloth tents stretched over frames made from branches among the growing crowd he spotted men mostly one or two women and no children it had the look of a semipermanent settlement not an overnight camp but a yearround dwelling haphazardly built in and around the mature oak trees the tall man whod spoken led the way through the camp towards a round hut with wattleanddaub walls and a squat conical roof of branches and reeds bigger than the others more effort had gone into it liam suspected it was their leaders hut the hood he watched the tall man duck down and disappear inside through a low door leaving him alone with the crowd he felt hands pushing and shoving him a punch on his back that painfully jolted his head french scum someone hissed at him another cursed then spat a fat gobbet of spittle into his face go back to normandy liam tried to reply he wasnt french that he wasnt some arrogant norman aristocrat but the gag filled his mouth and the best he could do was grunt probably wouldnt have mattered if he could have made himself heard he was wearing expensive clothes a dark green velvet smock fine linen leggings and leather boots that marked him as a noble whatever he might try to say the tall man emerged through the low door and stood up straight raising his arms to hush the hubbub of noise in the crowd he says it is for you to decide the sheriffs fate liam felt his legs give as most of the crowd roared with approval oh thats not good kill him shouted several voices you really wish to show john the pretender show him what we think of his norman lackeys the crowd shouted its agreement liam looked at the tall man trying to make eye contact with him he sounded different from the others a different accent perhaps educated and wasnt there a hint of regret in his voice as if hed rather they chose another fate for him i need to talk to him he twisted his head from side to side trying to work the gag out of his mouth but already he was being dragged by the mob hands struggling through the press of bodies to get a grasp on him pinch him or land a punch on him he could feel the rancid cloth rammed into his mouth loosening able to find enough space at the back of his mouth to bunch his tongue up and push the cloth forward it made him gag and he fought the urge to vomit ahead of him he saw the crowd part making space around the flat top of a broad tree stump it was about a yard across and a yard high like a roughly hewn tabletop send his head back to oxford head oh god please no liam saw someone place a wicker basket beside the base of the stump he began to buck and squirm against the grasp of the men dragging him causing them to wrench him forward more roughly come on pig well put ye on a spike when were done strong arms pushed him against the tree stump and grabbed his shoulders to bend him down over the rough flat top liam frantically worked his tongue against the gag pushing the material bit by bit out of his mouth but even then even if he could scream something he was sure nothing was going to stop them now they wanted their darkhaired norman head his arms were twisted behind his back and the jagged splinters of wood from the stump ground and mashed away against his cheekbone as several hands firmly pressed his head down he rolled his eyes to one side to look up and wished he hadnt a thickset man was standing beside the stump enjoying the moment and flexing his muscular arms as he wielded a broadsword in both hands one stroke one stroke several in the crowd began chanting aye tis always one good stroke the man roared in reply not so seth another man bellowed did take more than three on the last close your eyes liam he told himself best not to see the blade coming down but he couldnt he couldnt take his eyes off his executioner the man making a big show for his crowd stepping round the stump and limbering up with long swooshing swoops of the sword the material of the gag was now almost entirely pushed out of his mouth but still over it he tried screaming at them to stop but his words were muffled in his peripheral vision he spotted the tall man looking down at him with a stern expression and beside him a foot taller the sinister form of the hood motionless a face lost in the dark shadows of his cowl their presence hushed the baying crowd until it was quiet enough that liam could hear the soft rustle of a breeze chasing through the oak leaves far above them you wish this said the tall man you wish to send his head as a message to those who rule yer country the crowd roared in response so be it then he said with a tone of regret in his voice he nodded slowly at the executioner see it done and mind its a clean blow this young norman deserves a quick death aye nodded the executioner he took a couple of steps over to liam and gently rested the swords cold blade against the back of his neck liam felt its weight the razorthin edge biting into his skin and then he felt the weight of the blade being lifted lifting for the swing oh god oh jayzus liam jerked his head bucking and kicking as hands pressed harder to hold his shoulders still best hold still one of the men holding him warned unless you want him to hack at you like a hog on a spit as the executioner sucked in a breath and his sword hovered for a moment above his head liam jerked his chin once more finally freeing his mouth above the cloth gag please im not french he heard himself screaming shrill and terrified im im from the future chapter sherwood forest nottinghamshire stop liam heard the blade coming down a long deep swoop that sounded like the wingbeat of death itself and then the wooden stump his head was pressed against vibrated with the jarring impact he heard the blade clang and hum and the executioner curse as the blow vibrated his hands liam tried to focus on the wobbling metal blade right beside his nose reflecting his own face back at him and that was the very last thing he remembered before he fainted water splashed across his face and liam came to screaming nooooo he opened his eyes to see he was in a dark place his bonds now removed it was a round room of wicker walls caked with mud above him sunlight dappled through a crude thatch of twigs and reeds and beams caught dust motes and pollen gracefully floating through them in case youre wondering said a voice calmly youre not dead liam looked around the room his eyes adjusting to the darkness the first thing he saw was the hooded figure squatting on the mud floor of the room beside it sitting on a wooden stool was the tall man with the long sandy hair studying liam intently and stroking his bottom lip thoughtfully who sent you he asked after a while liam struggled to gather his senses a moment ago seconds ago hed been awaiting the downward strike of a sword on the back of his neck you said im from the future the man said the only person in the twelfth century likely to comprehend the notion of time travel is someone who indeed has come from the future therefore i completely believe you now he went on sitting forward who sent you liam looked up at him you you youre a traveller too the man nodded are you are you one of us asked liam us the the agency he cocked his head agency liam bit his lip perhaps hed just blurted out too much agency hold on the mans eyes narrowed youre not talking about he smiled then laughed you cant possibly mean the agency liam shrugged yes i no i dont know i there were rumours back in the s a secret agency set up to track down and terminate illegal time travellers they were just rumours mind liam said nothing but the man seemed wholly intrigued by him of course everyone suspected that was propaganda a deterrent something to scare off any tech companies thinking about secretly developing a machine but youre here his eyes narrowed so is that it is this agency actually for real is that where youve come from liams eyes darted towards the hooded figure menacingly large in such a small hut it sat silently poised in a squatting position so far the man was asking questions not demanding he wondered how long that was going to last its true whispered liam im with that agency my god the man laughed again it was real i knew it tell me whos behind it the north american federation is it the sinokorean bloc new europe i dont really know liam replied or is it a corporation liam shook his head i dont know we just work on our own i dont know who organizes us youre just a grunt then he smiled not unkindly a foot soldier liam shrugged i i suppose and i presume youve come back here because ive altered history somehow yes a lot enough that theres been a time wave the present has been changed and your mission was to come back here to kill me liam closed his mouth there was much too much hed be giving away with an answer instead he asked a question who are you thats rather direct of you i like that the man smiled so i suppose i shall tell you my name is james locke pleased to meet you mr locke said liam gingerly offering a hand im liam oconnor a grin slowly spread across lockes face he reached out and shook the proffered hand i recognize that accent he said youre irish yes a pity eh liam frowned pity why why his eyes narrowed you dont know do you know what much of irelands gone now i think some peaks remain still in county kerry but the rest is all underwater liam stared at the man wondering if he was playing a joke with him a lot of other places have gone too mind but you really dont know about any of this do you what year exactly have you come from he wondered if there was any point in keeping that from locke really why so far back thats over forty years before the firstever test machine was functional as good a place as any other i suppose he looked at locke did you just say irelands underwater systemic climatic failure it used to be called global warming the ice caps melted decades ago the sea ended up rising by about a hundred metres weve lost about a fifth of the worlds land mass the most densely populated fifth whats left is crammed full of people standing room only im afraid jayzus oh you got that right locke said pushing wisps of hair out of his eyes liam looked at his lean face more closely and realized he was a lot older than hed first guessed forty maybe fifty his long hair threaded with greys and silvers and crisscrossing lines splayed out from the corners of his eyes in my time the worlds dying liam and its all our doing its overheating and every ecosystem is gradually failing liam rubbed his head still thudding with a dull ache so when have you come from he laughed a little sadly the end of times i suppose the end but when locke said nothing outside the hut there was a growing clamour of voices what do you mean by the end mr locke locke waved the question away maybe ill explain later for now though i better tell that crowd of barbarians outside that therell be no norman nobles beheaded today youre not going to kill me depends if you get in the way or not he splayed his hands my advice dont get in the way why whatre you up to why did you come back here he smiled again i came back to find out about something originally but my plans have changed somewhat he got up off his stool be a good man and stay here and dont try and run or ill set rex on you the hooded figure stirred at mention of the name is that a a support unit locke clearly didnt know what he meant by that a clone liam added unsure whether locke was familiar with that term either a genengineered product good god no theyre far too expensive and far too unreliable no this is something altogether more practical do you want to see locke asked with a glint in his eye errr all right he reached over and with a theatrical flourish he tugged the hood down to reveal a dented and rusted metal skull metal that is down to where the bridge of the nose would be on a human skull from that point downwards a synthetic skin cover descended starting as a scorched and partially melted jagged edge and becoming a waxy plasticlooking version of a nose mouth cheeks and jaw an almost convincing facsimile of the lower half of a human face the people that sent me back well he sighed in the year i come from we were lucky to get our hands on this model he rapped the metal skull on the top and the robot stirred with a soft whir of servomotors army surplus combat cyborg insurgency model with a synthetic plastene skin sheath or at least whats left of it used in the last oil war hes not a particularly pretty boy but hes as tough as a tank those people outside they follow him they seem to worship him locke shrugged yes worship i think that about sums them up the simple fools think of rex as some sort of a godsent instrument of justice sent down to lead them in a war against their norman overlords theyll do anything he tells them you mean anything you tell them he laughed indeed rex is programmed to take my verbal commands only they think the hood is leading them and that works just fine for my purposes and whats that mr locke he tapped his nose well talk later he got up from his stool and stooped down to exit the small hut liam could hear the crowd outside and lockes voice explaining something about the sheriff being a useful hostage liam turned to look at the robots face half human half rusting metal dappled with peeling armygreen paint and two small and faint pinpoints of blue light leds that glowed dully just like the powerup indicator on the displacement machine back home in liam nodded gingerly and waved uh so errr hello it continued to stare at him motionless and silent chapter nottingham castle bob surveyed the recruits as they trained standing in the middle of several dozen of them paired and sparring with wooden baton swords and wicker shields the sun had climbed high enough now that it shone down into the castles main bailey making the men perspire under the weight of their chain mail he observed their leaden and clumsy swordplay and evaluated their abilities as individual combat units evaluation combat efficiency insufficient there was no numerative score he could sensibly apply to them yet they were that bad barely better than malnourished old men and young boys struggling to remain standing under the weight of their armour let alone able to sustain effective melee combat with properly weighted swords and heavy iron shields however merely having columns of men tramping around the nottingham countryside wearing the royal burgundy tunic sporting three amber lions and managing to approximate the look of soldiers seemed to have had the effect that liam was after the banditry the raids the lawlessness had receded from the town and the surrounding farming villages and disappeared deep into the woods bobs ai took a moment to shuffle through a highlevel menu of mission objectives the current primary goal of subverting a peasant uprising originating from nottingham appeared to have been met but until he received a tachyon signal from the field office confirming that history had realigned itself it remained a mission goal yet to be struck off the list liam oconnor seemed content to leave the majority of the logistics of running the castle leading the garrison and overseeing the feeding of the people of nottingham to him the fleshy part of bobs mind seemed to want to communicate something to him about that an emotion of some sort he tried to identify it tried to find a human label for it and finally came up with one pride his silicon mind stepped in and decided to phrase that more concisely analysis mission achievement verification bonus he tried out one of his library of smiles one of the smaller ones that looked less like a horse flashing its gums it matched that small buzz of satisfaction he was feeling he decided the smile worked and matched this mild emotion he was currently experiencing he labelled it proudsmile a voice calling down from the gatehouse disturbed his musing he looked across at the gatehouses entrance archway to see a wounded man being helped through the gates by several others you may now rest he instructed the drilling recruits and stepped across the courtyard towards the new arrivals drawing closer he could see the burgundy and amber colours on the man and recognized the face as one of the dozen men assigned to escort liam to kirklees priory he was aware that liam was a day late but had assumed he had decided to stay with cabot a second night bobs pace quickened until he stood beside the man being lowered gently to the ground by several men from the town sire said one of them we found im collapsed in the marketplace bob knelt down and inspected him blood soaked half his tunic turning it almost black he will not survive for very long he has lost too much blood the soldier was one of the first intake of recruits bob retrieved the mans name from his database henry gardiner you must tell me what has happened the man looked up at him sire sire they ambushed us they he coughed spluttering a dark spray of blood down his chest a a drink please bob called for one of the waterbearers and then carefully helped the man to sip a ladle of water continue when ready he said as the man finished and let the ladle go ambushed us yesterday the hoods men he panted in short rattling breaths the sheriff what has happened to the sheriff took took him he is alive henry gardiner appeared to be waning fast his eyelids fluttering his face pinching from the pain he is alive bob repeated insistently aye yyes they took they took him bob nodded understood his deep voice rumbled he turned to one of the recruits standing nearby fetch this man some mead from our storeroom he estimated the dying man had another hour of life left in him the alcohol would at least make it a comfortable hour bob evaluated the man deserved at least that for dutifully struggling back to make his report his grey eyes swivelled on to the townsfolk whod helped him in you are good civilians i am grateful for your assistance you may also drink some mead the men tugged their forelocks with gratitude bob rested a hand on gardiners shoulder and squeezed it gently you have functioned well henry gardiner he stood up his mind already shuffling through a decisiontree of actions he was going to need to take there wasnt a great deal of calculative effort required to come up with the conclusion that retrieving liam alive was the preferred course of action it didnt conflict with the primary objective whats more liam oconnors role as sheriff had proven to be effective among the local population the people appeared to like him and would want their sheriff back bob had already made the decision to find and rescue him he was just waiting for his code to spit that out as a formal menu option but finding him finding where exactly the hoods men were encamped within the forests of nottingham could take days weeks perhaps even months he didnt have that kind of time he had just twentythree days left until either he returned to or his silicon mind fused itself here in little time to waste if thered been a skirmish in the forests an ambush logically it would have occurred on the forest track northeast between nottingham and kirklees priory there would be detectable signs of the fight still bloodstains scuff marks perhaps a trail to follow perhaps the raiders were still in the vicinity he turned to look up at the men in the guardhouse above several faces were peering curiously down one of them he recognized as belonging to one of the original guard that had escorted them here from oxford nearly six months ago like eddie a veteran with experience he pulled the mans name from his database jethro longstreet sire under the authority of the sheriff of nottingham i am promoting you to garrison commander of this castle in my absence he could see the mans eyes widen with disbelief you will continue the daily patrols of the farms outside his voice echoed around the castles walls you will continue supervising morning food distribution in the town marketplace you will also maintain the training regime for these new recruits i will be absent for several days are these instructions perfectly clear aye aye sire then proceed in this role he turned to the men standing nearby and bring me a horse immediately chapter oxford castle becks detected noises of distress coming from the castles outer walls raised voices highpitched and signifying alarm and one of those voices she identified as johns a few minutes later he staggered into the great hall gasping looking for her his eyes found her standing beside an arched window doing her best to look serene and ladylike he came quickly over tis true i have jjust this minute heard he stammered what is true rrichard he has sset foot in england johns face was ashen with fear and damp with sweat the messenger the messenger arrived this morning he tells me he set foot in dover yesterday becks consulted her database and a map of england it was miles from dover to oxford a piece of data she didnt have was how many miles an army from this period could travel in a day however a determined man could cover that distance in two days john had already told her his brother most likely would gather supporters along the way with his growing army eventually catching up with him do you believe he will come to oxford immediately she asked john nodded frantically he will come here directly bbecause he believes the grail is here he swallowed nervously i will have to be the one to tell him tell him that its lost it was on my instructions the templars were taking it north to scotland johns nerves spilled out and became a manic laugh hes going to kill me i will protect you she said calmly he wandered over to the balcony and looked out across the city the heat of a midmornings sun was baking the castles stone walls and the air shimmered above the crenellations making the dark slate rooftops of oxfords shacks and hovels dance and undulate beneath the cloudless blue sky why has your colleague liam not managed to find it yet it does not sound like he has even started to look for it there had been several couriers from nottingham over the last few months bearing a detailed account of matters up there most of liams reports had been on his efforts to win the starving people round to carefully rebuild some semblance of royal authority law and order all in johns name he has been busy stabilizing the region she replied only when he has the support and sympathies of the people will he have a chance of locating this outlaw who has stolen your grail she was quoting liams words from the last report i know i know snapped john but we have no more time now for making friends of the peasants richard will be here this very night maybe tomorrow he turned to look at her trembling as he spoke do you understand there will be blood when he discovers it is lost my blood beckss eyes narrowed she looked back out at the walls of the castle the walls of oxford you could hold out against him prevent him from entering the city john scratched at his beard a nervous tic of his that becks had noticed gradually become increasingly pronounced over the last six months the city would fall to him he said the people here love him becks nodded slowly his evaluation was of course quite correct she trawled through her database of history for this period and immediately hit upon the obvious solution a solution that as it happened would also align with history as it was meant to happen you must retreat north to nottingham she said the castle has a better defensive configuration and the city is sympathetic to you john licked his lips breathing noisily through his nose as he gave her suggestion serious thought no no that wwill anger him ffurther beckss store of data on the correct timeline indicated a successful defence of the city and a siege by richard that lasted several weeks the siege concluded with johns surrender and richard demonstrating uncharacteristic mercy for his brother letting him live as long as he swore allegiance to him that was the history that needed to happen now to prevent an unacceptable level of temporal contamination nottingham is loyal to you she said the city will hold this may give the sheriff enough additional time to locate the grail for you the grail could then be used as a bargaining tool allowing you to negotiate an acceptable surrender he looked at her you think that is possible of course it is possible liam may already have enough local intelligence from the people to successfully locate these outlaws winning their loyalty and support as he has been doing has been a necessary first step perhaps you are right he cupped his chin in a shaking hand yes yes perhaps then thats yes thats what i should do the other alternative is to remain here she added which i calculate would be a tactically poor choice he reached out for her and grasped her arms suddenly what would i do without you she flashed one of her carefully selected smiles at him johns face seemed to have reclaimed some of its colour behind such beauty you have a mind just as cunning as any ambassador or general i i becks eased herself from his tight grip and pushed him gently back my lord we should set forth immediately yes yes that would be advisable his lovelorn puppy eyes cleared and focused on more practical matters yes we must assemble a caravan immediately yet he stared at her in silence for a while longer his blue eyes narrowing marvelling at her if only it were the way of things that i had been king you would truly make a formidable queen a part of her mind calculated whether she should reveal his future to him whether knowing what fate awaited him would strengthen his resolve to stand up to richard but a hardcoded protocol reminded her that knowledge of the future to any man was just as big a contaminant to history as any careless time traveller there were other ways to ensure he found a bit of backbone and stood firm against richard when the time came be strong for me now she said gently teasingly and perhaps i will yet be your queen chapter sherwood forest nottinghamshire what are you going to do with me asked liam locke looked up at him i dont really know he replied my merry men he said with a hint of sarcasm in his voice were rather keen to make an example of you its down to the fact that youre a rich norman and theyre all poor saxons but im irish not french he shrugged all they see is a rich young man in expensive clothes he pared a hunk of venison off the bone and handed it to liam as it always was it shall always be rich overlords a poor underclass and a world of hatred between them liam chewed on the meat surprising himself at how hungry he was mr locke the things youve said about your time it doesnt sound too good he smiled sadly no no it isnt locke held him with his eyes in my time things are going very badly very quickly how do you mean where do i start we weve exhausted the world of its resources the world ran out of oil in the late s it ran out of coal and natural gas in the s it ran out of many of the essential minerals and ores at the same time we lost so much land to the advancing seas land that contained fertile soils mines oilfields and thereve been wars plenty of them regional wars as billions of dispossessed people migrate from flooded lands to already crowded lands locke shook his head sadly its a mess all of our own making perhaps if wed changed our ways at the beginning of the twentyfirst century if wed managed to control our population if wed all been less greedy wanting our shiny new things then perhaps we wouldnt be in the mess were in now its an exhausted world its a dying world liam looked at the hunched form of the robot in the corner just a dark outline and two pale blue eyes mr locke why did you come back here it wasnt just to escape that world was it locke sighed a long silence followed and outside they could hear the evening routine of camp voices raised several dogs barking hungrily liam had imagined the camp might have been alive with folk songs around a fire the goodnatured exchange of merry freedomfighters instead it was the desperate sounds of a refugee camp a hundred ragged halfstarved outlaws living off what they could trap or steal youre right there was a mission he picked at his teeth a mission of sorts an objective he frowned for a moment as if trying to remember what it was in my time there are only a few of us left no longer influential no longer the silent power behind presidents and popes were just a small band of believers believers templars liam stopped chewing youre one of them knights but youre youre from the future so you are you saying theyve got templar knights in the future he laughed softly well not if you mean men running around in chain mail and waving big swords liam but yes there are templars men who believe men who still hope even now at this late stage that god will step in to save us from ourselves lockes face reminded him a little of cabot a face etched with a lifetime of memories and set with a grim determination to see the right things done we put our faith in technology all of us we saw we were running out of oil but instead of using less of it we assumed technology would eventually find us a miracle free energy harmless energy for all but there was no manmade miracle we used up oil and then there came the oil wars the world became obsessed with fighting itself for dwindling resources and the oceans and the skies grew more polluted the ecosystem began to collapse there was a hope technology could engineer new forms of genetic life that could restore the balance bacteria that would eat carbon out of the air and help to cool our world down again but it was too little and too late all we did was create bacteria that poisoned the sea with big toxic blooms the more we tried to bail ourselves out with technology the worse we seemed to make it locke shook his head so all thats left now is blind faith that theres something else that can help us god he shrugged who can say god or perhaps something godlike something greater than man something or someone who can help us liam looked down at the candle im not a real believer mr locke truth be told if there is a god hes never bothered yet to speak to me im not sure what i believe either but hope belief is practically the last thing we have left that doesnt sound like much and we have a knowledge liam looked up knowledge locke seemed reluctant to continue as if debating with himself whether to say more finally he spoke in a voice little more than a whisper knowledge of a prophecy what a prediction a prophecy something weve known about for over a thousand years you say we you mean the templar knights yes us the name has changed of course depending on which conspiracy nuts you listen to templars masons the illuminati priory of sion new world order there have been all sorts of imaginative and ridiculous names for us over the decades and centuries but we started out simply as an order of soldiermonks in jerusalem he laughed drily no more basically than janitors temple security guards hence the name templars liam recalled cabots story but something happened didnt it something was discovered by the security guards locke nodded you know the story then i suppose i know some of it i know some knights found a scroll and it became known as the grail right indeed the grail a chalice a cup a symbol of containment containment yes but not of a liquid not the blood of christ but a secret secret this prophecy yes what is it locke laughed just like that you ask and expect me to tell secrets that men like myself have been keeping and passing down from one brother to another from grandfather to father to son liam thought about it for a moment then nodded why not who am i going to tell sitting here locke laughed some more maybe i will trade secrets with you liam nodded all right so then locke hacked another chunk of meat off for liam tell me why exactly were you sent back here liam wondered whether to mention the voynich manuscript it was what had started off this mission the first breadcrumb in a trail that ultimately had led him here into this mud hut in the middle of sherwood forest the grail replied liam you wish to decode its secrets too aye a question suddenly occurred to liam how did you know where to find it locke sat up the grail disappeared from history at the beginning of the thirteenth century it simply vanished became nothing but a myth from then on but weve always known it existed and weve always known it was never just a mere cup he began to carve another ragged hunk of meat from the bone we have templar records letters of instruction personal correspondence dating back to the brotherhoods inception and papal blessing in so weve always known king richard got what he came for in the holy land but it is there that the trail goes cold until that is the second world war liams eyebrows lifted a german bombing raid over oxford in damaged some ancient castle buildings old crypts were disturbed unearthed and as a result of that documents that hadnt seen the light of day for over nine hundred years emerged one such document was attributed to king john written actually before he became king written while his brother richard was still being held for ransom in europe locke passed another hunk of meat over the candle to liam it was a letter of instruction to some knights to transfer king richards sacred possession north to scotland john we suspect intended to hide it from his brother to use as a bargaining chip or maybe he really did think his brothers haul from jerusalem would be far safer in scotland but history tells us it never arrived there it became lost johns letter of instruction was the very last mention of it locke half smiled there was a date on johns letter so we finally knew a pretty exact whereandwhen for the grail and the brotherhood has of course known that since the letter finally surfaced courtesy of a luftwaffe bomb the plan therefore liam was to retrieve the grail and decode its secrets but you cant can you ahh i presume you know about the key the key to decoding it a cardangrille a template with viewing slits in that one rests over the encoded text yes and without that the grail is just a scroll full of meaningless words and king richard has it indeed liam frowned so how were you planning on getting this grille off him to lure him here of course stir an uprising in nottingham that hed insist on dealing with himself on his return he does have a reputation for that recklessly leading from the front a taste for the bloodrush of battle locke glanced at the motionless squatting form of the robot and if such an opportunity presented itself my big friend here rex in the heat of battle might be able to get through to richard locke shrugged its not much of a plan but its all ive got he turned to liam and smiled not unkindly but youve done such a good job of winning the locals round that my fledgling uprising looks like its going nowhere six months ago i had nearly a thousand men out here in the woods most of them have returned to their homes now what with your pardon i presume the amnesty for outlaws was your idea im sorry liam replied your uprising was causing waves in the future lockes smile faded well i imagine it isnt any longer but you have the grail that will still bring richard to you right of course he wants what ive got and i want what hes got perhaps well make a deal liam frowned a question occurring to him you said your brotherhood has known where the grail might be intercepted for ages since what so when exactly have you come from mr locke the last time liam had asked locke the question hed replied rather cryptically the end is it much farther into the future than me locke said nothing the halfsmile frozen on his face teasing liam a hundred two hundred years five hundred the end said locke again offering nothing more the end liam hunched his shoulders ahh come on what is that supposed to mean do you mean the end of the century the older man said nothing the end of what end of the world locke relented it really boils down to how you interpret this world around us liam in a scientific way or a spiritual way is it an ending or a beginning liam ground his teeth with frustration that means nothing to me so it does thats just the kind of mumbojumbo id expect from a priest the prophecy liam weve always known the grail contained a detailed prophecy something happens on a certain date a certain year something something locke spread his hands we dont know thats what i came back to find out something uttered liam again something good or something bad i suppose if you have faith liam if you can believe in a caring god then it can only mean something wonderful will happen and do you locke scratched the tip of his nose i suppose ill make my mind up when ive managed to decode the thing chapter sherwood forest nottinghamshire moonlight illuminated the forest track in front of bob it was just possible to see the dark stains of congealed blood in places the scuff marks of boots the glint of several twisted and broken loops of chain mail and the pale feathered fletching of a few arrows deeply embedded in the dirt bob reined the horse in and stepped down on to the track it was silent except for the hiss of a breeze through the endlessly stirring trees and the faroff hooting of an owl he examined the signs of battle more closely heavy boots close together had rucked the dirt and many small gouges in the mud suggested arrows that had embedded themselves in the ground and been retrieved later bob nodded with calm certainty that this was the site of the ambush that had happened over twentyfour hours earlier he wandered over to one side of the track pushing aside the thick ferns and bracken that filled the forest floor between the stout oak trunks he soon found the first body hastily pulled out of sight and dumped amid a thick clump of nettles stripped of anything of value and left as carrion he picked his way along the edge of the track finding several more bodies all of them stripped of their mail and their leather boots and left with nothing but their leggings and bloodstained tunics half a dozen bodies in total he flipped the last of them over to his relief none of them was liam relief bob queried his mind for greater clarification his onboard hardware looked dispassionately at the impulses coming in from the organic nub of flesh that barely deserved the term brain the tiny electrical impulses fired off by the ratbrainsized organ conformed to a pattern that humans would call an emotion yes relief he stood up and listened to the night hoping that beyond the hiss of stirring branches he might hear the faint and distant cry of human voices raised in drunken celebration or calling for help but he heard nothing just the owl bobs decisiontree had been here before on his very first mission hed lost liam in the aftermath of a battle for the white house liam had been taken away in one of a column of prison trucks his ai then had been woefully unprepared for the decisions it had to make but hed managed to do it hed managed to reprioritize the mission goals to put rescuing liam at the very top technically a breach of his programming but also something hed been proud of this time round it was a far easier decision this missions goals were so poorly defined and ambiguous that devoting what was left of the sixmonth mission envelope solely to finding his friend liam was a nanosecond evaluation but how he could wait until dawn and attempt to identify a visual trail a body of men moving through the thick undergrowth of sherwood forest would leave behind something that even an inexperienced tracker could follow he decided that was to be his plan of action and settled down to a hunchedover squat amid some nettles to wait for the light of dawn he wouldnt sleep instead his mind would do what it always did when the rest of the world was in slumber a defrag a chance to play through the endless terabytes of data stored on his hard drive memories to replay it all every single image every sound every sensation every smell to try and make connections to make associations to understand a little better what it would be like to have a real brain to be a realhuman instead of an engineered tool a meat robot hed just started unpacking and sorting through a slideshow of memories when he detected the faintest odour of woodsmoke not the everpresent odour ingrained into the tunic he was wearing the smell of melted tallow mixed with stale sweat this was on the air a fire burning somewhere out in the forest tonight caught on the fresh breeze and carried for miles he sniffed loudly his broad nostrils flexing like a horses the faint odour again he stood up quickly scanning the woods in a steady arc hoping to detect just the faintest flicker of light deep in the woods he saw nothing but he had the odour not just the smell of dry seasoned logs but the vaguely minty odour of pine needles burning a campfire he decided to follow his nose chapter sherwood forest nottinghamshire it was morning and a mist mingled with the white smoke of a dewdamp cooking fire drifting up through the canopy of branches above liam watched lockes camp slowly stir to life men in rags turning over under their damp capes robes and animalskin covers he heard the snotty rattle of someone clearing his nose and hawking it out on to the ground and the distant chup chup of someone already up and cutting firewood locke was trusting him not to run allowing him the freedom to move around the camp liam felt the mens eyes on him distrusting eyes resentful eyes if he did attempt to run from the camps perimeter into the thick undergrowth he was certain any number of them would gladly take the opportunity to hunt him down and put an arrow in his back and he wasnt really going to get far barefooted locke had had him remove his leather boots and donate them to one of his men a gesture of humiliation that had proved popular a norman noble reduced to picking his way about the camp as barefooted as a common street beggar the men clearly liked the idea of that liam watched locke emerge from his hut stretch and yawn the robot emerged behind him swathed once more in robes the top half of its metallic head lost in the shadows of its hood the plasticskin chin and jaw just barely visible listen there is news announced locke all heads turned towards him the various activities of stirring men came to a halt our leader the hooded man has received news locke nodded respectfully up at the robot standing beside him a foot taller news from nottingham it is said king richard has returned to england and as i speak to you now he is travelling northwards towards us voices raised through the camp lockes men unsure how to greet the news also it is said his brother john has fled from his castle in oxford and is on his way to nottingham there is talk in the town that a feud exists between the king and his brother that john may choose to challenge richard and make a stand at nottingham our lord hood is considering this important matter if there is to be a battle there in the coming days then both sides will be looking for fighting men like ourselves to fill their ranks we have a chance to air our grievances to discuss the unjust taxes that have driven us all into these woods out of hunger more than that we have a chance to perhaps seek assurances from either richard or john whomever we choose to offer our support to that we are all to be pardoned and our status as outlaws revoked several of lockes men cheered at that liam sensed that it was fear of being arrested and hung as criminals that was keeping the majority of them from returning to their families and homes we have a chance to make ourselves heard our leader will be deciding over the next few days with whom we shall throw in our lot locke grinned at the men and we can only pity the army that does not have the hood fighting for them eh the men cheered he is truly unstoppable the men roared immortal they roared support again because he has been sent by god to free poor englishmen from being slaves to these norman lords we will have god on our side whichever side we choose and that makes us formidable so ready yourselves lads there will be a fight coming soon sharpen your swords restring your bows and be ready for it locke said something quietly to the robot and it raised a sword and held it aloft the forest filled with a cacophony of raised voices every last man young and old on his feet and punching the air excitedly liam looked around at them none of them had the faintest idea they were pawns being used by locke additional battlefodder for whichever plantagenet presumably richard that locke intended to make a deal with if it was true if both john and richard were converging on nottingham then presumably locke was hoping to get an audience with richard and then what try to steal richards cardan grille or offer to share the grails secrets with him it occurred to liam that that would be the worst possible outcome someone as mad and as powerful as richard privy to whatever revelations prophecies might be hidden in the grail i really have to get out of here i have to get back to nottingham more than anything he wanted to find both bob and becks and return home to all of the things that locke had told him about the future he needed to share with maddy and sal particularly maddy she would make more sense of it than he ever could shed have a far better idea of what they needed to do next he wondered what bob was doing right now whether the support unit had yet found out about the ambush and was in the middle of sherwood forest already searching for him or whether he was waiting in nottingham castle still expecting him to return what about becks wheres she with john if she was then presumably shed also be able to make the rendezvous if john was travelling north to nottingham he had a horrible feeling both support units were going to turn up in that field in a weeks time without him and go home leaving him here as lockes prisoner locke nodded at liam and beckoned him over as the gathered men dispersed to the various morning tasks foraging for food and firewood boiling up a meagre pottage for breakfast liam said locke come inside and have some breakfast with me he ducked down through the entrance and followed locke and the robot inside back into the stuffy smoky gloom of lockes humble shack locke sat down on his bench the robot hunkered down by his side like a loyal dog you heard liam nodded i heard what you said just now apparently the streets of nottingham are buzzing with the news the people favour john they see richard for what he is an absentee ruler whos ruined the country mr locke can i ask do you have this grail here is it somewhere in this camp locke eyed him cautiously thats for me to know and you to mind your own business what do you intend to do with it i will do whatever it takes to unlock it youd do a deal with richard he shrugged i would id betray all those gullible morons outside if thats what it takes but you have no idea whats in there have you considered the prophecy youre hoping to find might just be a message from someone like me another timerider locke frowned and is it do you know no i no i dont know but thats my point it could be anything surely it would be dangerous to give someone like king richard that kind of knowledge it could completely change the course of history and is that such a bad thing liam from where im sitting the time i come from maybe giving king richard a brandnew history a new destiny will give us an entirely different timeline and a different better future it certainly couldnt be any worse but there could be a worse so locke shook his head what whats worse than an overheated poisoned dying earth i dont know all i do know is what we were told that to mess with time like this to change it weakens the walls between us and and chaos chaos liam didnt know enough to explain himself any better not for the first time he wished foster had stayed around long enough to talk them through all the things they needed to know its what we travel through when we travel in time a dimension a place that is just chaos perhaps even what some people call hell lockes eyes narrowed i recalled only a falling sensation its more than that look mr locke ive i think ive seen things so i have things in there liam couldnt find any better way to say it than that but in that milky nothingness hed seen them entities swimming closer and closer to him each time he travelled as if they were growing familiar with him as if they sensed a regular traveller someone who might offer them a way into the real world mr locke the only thing i know for certain is you cant just mess with time if this holy grail of yours was meant to be lost in the woods and end up nothing but a myth if thats the history thats meant to be then so be it and maybe what you want to do and what i came back to do to find out whats in there maybe thats a big mistake maybe its best that no one finds out whats written in there liam weve waited since the discovery of that scroll in jerusalem eleven hundred years of waiting to know im not going to walk away from that now he shook his head almost sadly i cant walk away from that liam was about to reply that locke had no choice but then the pause in conversation was suddenly filled with a crack of snapping branches and the clatter of an avalanche of dislodged dry mud from the shaking wattleanddaub wall another loud crack and a ragged uneven circle of daylight appeared lockes jaw dropped what the a round head topped with dark shaggy hair pushed through the hole liam oconnor chapter sherwood forest nottinghamshire liam gasped bob bobs head turned to look at him in a flurry of noise and showers of cascading mud and a cloud of dust and flying splinters he burst through the wall liam was wiping grit out of his face when he felt big fists grab him roughly and pull him on to his feet stop him he heard locke scream in the confusion but suddenly they were outside in the blinding daylight liam grunted the wind knocked out of his chest as bob picked him up and flung him like a sack of cornmeal over his shoulder he ran with heavy loping strides across the camp past wideeyed men and boys stunned into inaction at the sight stop him lockes voice pealed across the camp he has the sheriff liams face banged and bounced heavily against the rough chain mail draped over bobs chest he managed to twist his neck enough to glance around at a world upside down men scrambling for weapons men scrambling out of bobs way a large man with a mane of ginger hair twisted into greasy rattails chose to remain in bobs path he held in two muscular arms a longhandled woodcutters axe yield he challenged but bobs loping pace remained unchanged with a roundhouse swing he brought the axes blade around on a trajectory that was going to end up smashing directly into bobs chest and liams face jayzus bob look ou bob blocked the swinging axe blade with his forearm the weapons blade biting deep through the chain mail sharp hot splinters of shattered iron rings stung liams face and he screwed his eyes shut instinctively to protect them he felt bobs body lurch beneath him and heard the thud crack and grunt of several exchanged blows landing home then the agonized scream of someone presumably the unfortunate gingerhaired man suddenly cut short with the snapping of cartilage and bone his head was bouncing and banging against chain mail once again as bob resumed running and liam dared open his eyes to the upsidedown world once more to see they were nearing the edge of the camp clearing bob bulldozed his way past several old women scrubbing clothes in a large wooden tub a moment later they were crashing through bracken twigs and branches thorns slapping and tearing at liams face as bob continued to bound through the woods like the worlds clumsiest gazelle liam was still struggling to get some air as each loping stride brought his ribs crashing down against the hard slope of bobs shoulder and slammed his lungs empty of breath like a blacksmith pumping vigorously at his bellows bob he managed to gasp after a while stop just a moment his voice rumbled back we are not safe yet bob scrambled down a steep slope almost losing his balance several times at the bottom he waded knee deep through a stream sending showers of spray up into liams face on the far side he scrambled up a slope then finally reaching the cover of a large fallen oak tree he bounded over its thick trunk and hunkered down on the far side he eased liam off his shoulder on to the ground where his grey eyes quickly studied him are you hurt liam oconnor liam struggled for air you mean apart from a few cracked ribs bob scowled sceptically im fine im fine liam gasped waving the comment away just joking from the far side of the stream up the slope opposite echoed the sound of dozens of voices calling out to each other a search party already beating the woods for them liam wondered how much effort theyd put into that having the sheriff of nottingham as a prisoner might have been a bargaining chip if locke intended to deal with john but clearly that wasnt his plan the grail was his true prize leverage that would work on richard alone bob liam whispered bob was still scanning the slope opposite bob they have the grail the support unit turned to look down at him are you sure he nodded towards the slope and the camp back in that direction its over there the leader of those bandits he is a time traveller just like we thought but hes not one of us hes not you know a timerider who has sent him i didnt really understand but hes hes come back to get it the grail i think its back in that hut or if not locke knows where it is locke the leader james locke he hissed impatiently the leader i see you wish to return to retrieve it actually no he really didnt going back to the camp was actually the last thing he wanted to do yes he sighed i think we have to go back just then he felt the fallen oak trees trunk vibrate he sat forward and looked along the trunk towards the splayed and unearthed roots at the end and saw the dark fluttering wraithlike form of the hood crouched like a beadyeyed bird of prey looking for a morsel of food oh come on he uttered give us a break chapter sherwood forest nottinghamshire the hood jumped down and the trunk free of its burden flexed with a woody creak that disturbed several crows nearby the shrouded form slowly pulled itself from a squat on the ground to its full height bob turned to face it his arms and legs flexed ready for action bob be careful its a metal robotic thing the hoods head slowly turned towards liam in the shadows he thought he saw the faintest blue glimmer of its led eyes warning boomed bob you are not authorized to participate in events that will change history the hoods gaze smoothly panned towards bob there seemed to be an unspoken challenge in the way it silently regarded him then without warning its glovecovered hands pulled the cloak up over its body and tossed it aside liam gasped at the sight horrific in a way yet also fascinating beneath the cape its form had looked so convincingly human but now exposed as he looked at the metal frame specked with blisters of rust and flecks of old combatgreen paint he wondered how anyone could ever have been fooled into thinking this thing a man fleshcoloured plastic in some places scorched black in other places melted and bubbled like toasted cheese hung from its arms and shoulders and neck in some areas it was actually entirely unmarked and looked very much like real human skin hanging in sagging loops like the putrefying flesh of some undead being its an old war robot said liam thats what locke said affirmative replied bob configuration matches korean model dating from early s right nodded liam uh does it can it talk it can communicate using synthetic speech circuits not convincing this functionality may have been disabled does it understand us bobs eyes remained on it watching waiting for the thing to make its first move yes it does could we could we convince it you know to nnot hurt us be our friend the robots gaze swivelled smoothly towards liam its dented and corroded metal skull cocked on one side blue lights regarding him with cold curiosity for a moment bob regarded the robot his database included a catalogue of ai variants family trees of artificial intelligence code from the first viable selfcognitive versions developed in the late s right up to his version number compiled in bob identified this model robot as an old north korean combat unit massproduced in the mids and used to devastating effect in the first pacific oil war his records indicated that hundreds of thousands of south korean chinese and taiwanese as well as their own north korean civilians were butchered by this model they were unreliable with a friendlyhostile identification software that was prone to error understandable given the original ai was pirated code adapted to work with imported chinese chip sets bob decided to attempt a bluetooth handshake beneath the chinese or korean language interface would be a common programming language wg systems ai vc please identify the robot turned its gaze slowly on to bob solsun inc v communication protocol please select asciienglish hexadecimal binary selecting asciienglish we have a communication channel open said bob liam nodded all right well could you ask it to be a good fella and leave us alone negative it will have mission parameters just as i do bob decided that finding out what it thought its mission was would be the most useful line of enquiry specify mission parameters highest priority first mission priorities primary follow orders ident j locke secondary locate identify hostile forces in target combat zone bob turned to liam its code has been hacked identify target combat zone the robots gaze shifted to the trees the thick branches of oak leaves and acorns above them then back on bob target combat zone ne kumwonsan south korea bob whats going on tell me whats it saying it appears to be following mission instructions from a war that ended in it believes it is in a korean jungle it also believes the year is this unit was not properly decommissioned its mission program is still active but has been crudely hacked to make it follow the verbal commands of j locke well cant you just tell it that its wrong negative it has no way of identifying the correct year liam eased himself slowly back along the ground away from the hoods unmoving form is there not a way you can you know convince him to i will try information current location is nw sherwood forest england negative you are outside the target combat zone the robots response took a moment to come back current location coordinate offset is within target combat zone bob tried a different approach information current date is june negative present time data is hours transmitting correct time data the robot received the information then cocked its head curiously transmitted data data confirmed as valid please wait you are beyond mission parameters you are not in the target combat zone data conflict deactivate combat status immediately the robots blue led eyes dimmed and flickered out and its frame sagged and shuddered liam clapped his hands together bob you did it he got up off the ground and took a cautious step towards the immobile statue of corroded metal and melted plastic jayzusnmary you made it turn himself off so you did youre a bleedin genius bob shook his head it is not turned off it is merely considering liams eyebrows arched and he stopped midstride oh in that case he took several steps back couldnt we just hit it over the head you know while its busy considering things an offensive action may activate its selfdefence routine oh how about we just run bobs mouth had just opened to reply when the statue stirred to life with the soft whirr of servomotors primary mission priority override the blue eyes glowed once more verbal command from j locke password verified command received minutes seconds ago command status active command kill them both bob eased his broadsword out of its sheath the scrape of metal on leather seemed deafeningly loud in the stillness of the woods the noise seemed to trigger a reaction from the robot it pulled its own sword from a scabbard and holding the weight of the long blade effortlessly in one hand it advanced towards bob liam oconnor you should run chapter sherwood forest nottinghamshire the robots last step took it within striking range and with a whiplash movement it swung its sword at bobs head bob quickly raised his own parrying the blow with the sharp vibrating clatter and ring of metal on metal bobs riposte was a lightningfast lunge towards the robots armpit hydraulic fluid pipes momentarily exposed between plates of pitted metal armour the lunge nipped at one of the pipes causing a clear yellow liquid to spray out under pressure the robot swung its arm down snapping bobs sword like balsa wood it reached out and grabbed bob by his neck lifting his feet off the ground and hurling him like a childs toy against the fallen oak he bounced off the stout trunk the tree shuddered under the heavy impact you must run barked bob as he struggled to get to his knees liam shook his head i can help run the robot reached down and grasped hold of bobs right ear in an attempt to lift him up off the ground but with a loud ripping sound it was torn from his head spattering them both with a thick gout of blood the robot tossed the ear aside and reached down again this time picking bob up by his neck raising him above its head liam could see a fine spray of the yellow liquid puffing out from the rubber pipe that bob had managed to nick with his blade it was pumping out in arterial pulses like blood just like robot blood the robot carried bob still aloft like some sort of trophy towards the trunk and then slammed him down across it liam thought he heard something snap as bob grunted and rolled off the side falling heavily to the ground jayzus its going to kill him the robot thrust the sword still held in its other hand through bobs left upper arm skewering him to the trunk like a butterfly pinned in a collectors cabinet bob liam shrieked bob struggled to wrench the sword out of the wood but its blade was buried at least a foot deep into the old dead oak with bob pinned down the robot now slowly turned round to focus on liam blue eyes softly glowing evaluating its next target please liams voice quaked im not in your war it advanced on him hey there hhey james locke said to go an get me right not nnot kill me liam fell as he took a backwards step landing amid a cluster of nettles the robot stood over him and then slowly squatted down placing one glovecovered hand around liams throat pplease i can help mr locke i can hhelp hhim behind the robot liam thought he heard something crack and rip or maybe that was the sound of the tendons in his own throat he felt the robots fingers begin to compress his windpipe firm and steady like someone winding a vice closed feeling tender muscle and trachea cartilage and his adams apple pressing in on each other his eyes saw white sparks his ears roared with pulsing blood struggling to find a passage up to his brain through a dangerously compressed carotid artery then suddenly hot foulsmelling liquid was splashing into his face the hand round his neck twitched painfully as if attempting to snap it but then released its grip as if someone had suddenly decided to spin the vices handle the other way the hand dropped down on to his chest like the lifeless appendage of a paralysed man his vision cleared again and he saw the robots left arm dangling by its side from beneath its armpit the rubber pipe flapped like a serpent gushing yellow liquid in hot spurts the combat robot flopped to its knees bluelight eyes looking down uncomprehendingly at its powerless arm behind it he saw bob standing triumphantly with the broken jagged remnant of his sword in one hand his other hand his left arm was a dangling tattered stump that ended with the fragments of an elbow and dangling loops of frayed tendons and muscles bob thrust the sharp edge of his broken sword into a small gap between the robots armourplated shoulders and twisted the robot lurched and more of the hot clear yellow liquid spurted out under high pressure the robots half metal half plastichuman face seemed to express something surprise shock then finally with a whirr of hidden motors working against hydraulic pressure that no longer existed it collapsed on to its side we were fortunate it appears the combat units rear motion sensor panel was damaged in an earlier fight said bob matteroffactly as he began to examine the ragged remains of his left arm the arterial spurts of his own opened veins already beginning to cease as the blood clogged into a thick sealing glue bob liam managed to gulp your your arm he looked round bobs wide frame to see the rest of it was still pinned to the tree i will live he said gruffly he looked down at the robot it is still active although motion on its combat chassis has been disabled liam could see the bluelight eyes burning angrily still and its head turning frantically left and right with the loud whirr of a small overworked motor as if that alone was going to move its heavy lifeless chassis across the forest floor what what did you do to it liam struggled to talk his throat was killing him i severed a major hydraulic pipe the liquid provides the pressure system that enables the servomotors to activate limb movements he examined the disabled robot a design flaw of mechanical units he said dismissively they cannot heal themselves they are old technology right bob started looking at the ground until he spotted what he was after he stooped down and picked up a rock the size of a human head what are you doing asked liam this unit is still active it needs to be destroyed as bob raised the rock over his head liam found himself looking away even though it was just a machine on the ground the plastic skin from the nose down made at least half its head look too human for him to want to watch it being smashed in he heard several heavy thuds followed by a clanking and the clattering whirr of some part of it still working frantically another final thud and the noise stopped is it dead it is dead bob replied liam turned to see a flattened hump of crumpled metal and shredded fleshcoloured plastic before this unit found us you indicated we need to return to the camp liam looked at bob we cant go back youre in no condition to fight not like that my combat proficiency has merely been reduced by fifty per cent i am still an effective combat platform liam looked at him perhaps he was right even with one arm he pitied any poor man who decided to stand in bobs way but looking at the pitiful dangling shreds of his left arm he didnt feel he had the heart to ask no to order bob to fight his way back into the camp then his gaze rested on the robots discarded dark cape then the tattered rags and woollen hose that still clad the dead robots body all right all right ive got an idea i guess we should bury the robot correct the metal will corrode in due course well lets undress it first he looked at bob and cocked an eyebrow guess who youre going to pretend to be chapter sherwood forest nottinghamshire liam eyed them cautiously as he stepped through the camp there were expressions of hostility someone picked up and threw a handful of horse dung at him it broke up in midair and rained down his chest as liam covered his face behind bound hands in case there was any more coming his way behind him the tall hooded figure silently prodded him forward with the tip of his sword and the crowd jeered as liam stumbled and nearly fell they made their way across the camp the crowd parting reluctantly to let him through he felt the soft tap of spittle on his shoulder and in his hair and grimaced beneath his hands the crowd was growing noisier bloody french scum a woman shouted and liam felt something hard and sharp bounce off his back cease boomed bob from behind him the effect that had on the press of gathered people was instantaneous an utter silence so quiet in fact that liam could hear the gentle crack of burning kindling and the bubble of simmering water from a cooking pot nearby theyve never heard the hood talk before perhaps that was a mistake he wondered if the silence would be broken by someone claiming the hooded form was some impostor but instead the respectful silence remained and the crowd parted before them all the way towards lockes hut liam led the way doing his best to continue to look cowed beaten and humiliated with one last unnecessarily hard prod from behind that made him yelp liam stooped down through the low entrance and bob followed behind the hut was lighter of course it was bob had casually demolished one side of the round wall he saw locke standing a gun aimed at them held in his shaking hands stay where you are he snapped he glanced at bob where is it what have you done with my combat unit bob pulled the hood down no point maintaining the ruse your combat unit has been deactivated lockes eyes narrowed good god youre a youre a genetic model arent you bob nodded wg systems combat prototype foetus batch wgs my god he uttered with a smile of admiration lower the weapon said bob locke hesitated staring at the tip of the blade and realizing his gun wasnt going to stop the giant standing in front of him he slowly dropped his aim what now he asked quietly liam flexed his wrists and wriggled out of the loose rag binding the grail its here somewhere in the camp isnt it locke was silent his face offered nothing come on locke said liam were here for the same reason as you we need to know whats in it the prophecy liam shrugged if thats what it is if thats the big secret in there then yes lockes eyes remained on the sword come on look weve got the same goal right we can work together so we can theres something coming right and theres a warning about it in the grail tell us where it is and maybe we can work out how to read the thing together the man shook his head king richard possesses the only way to decode the grail liam glanced at bob for help but the support unit had nothing to offer at that moment we could take it back to our field office weve got a powerful computer theres got to be a way we can use that to help us decode the thing you have a way back yes a way back to the future of course weve got a rendezvous time place and everything locke shook his head youre lying apart from waldstein no ones ever managed to develop a reliable return system we have my god he whispered good god then you people are for real this agency of yours the agency is real said bob come on what do you say mr locke we we need what king richard has in his possession we would need the grille there is no mathematical way to decode it liams brow locked there must be another way but look it seems to me the one thing we cant do is allow king richard to have both right affirmative said bob history as it is says the grail is a myth continued liam thats how it goes it gets lost it becomes a myth and thats all there is to it no matter what secrets lie in there it certainly doesnt end up being found by king richard and and inspiring him to run off again to conquer the world on some fourth crusade or something information the correct history is that king richard attempts no more crusades the last five years of his reign are spent attempting to reestablish royal authority in england and reclaim his lost territories in france right no grails no more crusades hes all done with that locke stroked his bearded chin thoughtfully if we can work out how to decode it we will you and me and if we cant well liam shrugged then we make sure it stays lost mr locke what do you say to that he pressed his lips together perhaps there is little time to delay said bob if king richards forces are on the way to nottingham the grail would be safer in nottingham castle than out here in the woods cut in liam affirmative and then we can decide our next step all right locke finally nodded he handed the gun to liam all right i i suppose yes i should speak to my people out there what will you tell them he looked at bob if you wear the hood as you just did they will believe you are the hooded man locke again stroked his beard thoughtfully i will tell them we must offer our loyalty to john that we should prepare to leave for nottingham he stepped towards the doorway and then turned to liam if they return to nottingham you do still have the authority to pardon them all correct liam nodded yes until i hear otherwise from john i suppose im still the sheriff locke smiled thank you theyre not outlaws theyre not bad people theyre just hungry desperate he ducked and stepped out of the hut liam let out a breath and waited until the sound of lockes footsteps was lost amid the babble of voices outside well that went better than i thought it would do you trust locke asked bob hes after the truth thats all hes after the same thing as us and he came back here using a oneway time machine thats a pretty brave thing to do not sure id have the guts to do that but do you trust him yes yes i think i do i think we have to it makes sense we should work together right bob didnt look entirely convinced liam nodded at the torn remnants of bobs arm how is it gone replied bob flatly liam winced well what i mean is hows whats left of it the upper bit the arteries are sealed there is no additional blood loss i will need to dress the wound to ensure no foreign matter gets into the wound and causes secondary infections it will regrow right youre not going to be stuck as a onearmed support unit forever are you bob bob shook his head it will not regrow on its own i will need to return to a growth tube for healing right well he slapped bob affectionately on the back thatll be first thing on the todo list when we get home he grimaced poor you it always seems you have a tough time of it each occasion weve gone back that is my role aye but ah well i suppose i they both heard a sudden commotion voices calling out the sound of horses hooves thudding on soft ground whats going on liam ducked down and stuck his head outside to see lockes people standing around bemused and motionless watching the retreating rear of a baggage cart bounce across the lumpy ground of the camp and rattle on to a narrow track that curved and weaved into the forest and out of sight liam cursed he stuck his head back in that slippery sod what has happened locke hes only bleedin well done a runner chapter sherwood forest nottinghamshire he wont have left without it said liam not without the grail im sure of it bob nodded then we must catch him liam ducked back out through the entrance and was pushing his way through the crowd when several pairs of hands grabbed him and wrestled him to the ground an where ye goin frenchie snarled someone liam heard the grate of a metal blade being unsheathed release him bobs voice boomed across the clearing once again he strode forward his face once more covered by the hood stand back the crowd did so instantly drawing back from liam as if he carried the plague bob reached down with his one good hand and helped him back on to his feet we need horses uttered liam out of the side of his mouth well never catch him up on foot who has a horse the crowd was silent bob tell them youre taking me to nottingham he whispered tell them youre going to force me to write a pardon for them all theyll be free to go back to their homes bob nodded and repeated liams words in his paradeground voice the people listened in stunned silence as he announced theyd be free to return home an uncertain cheer rippled through them uncertain perhaps because to them it sounded too good to be true where has locke gone asked someone ill tell them uttered liam to bob he cleared his throat locke has gone to offer his services to king richard some of the men in the crowd cheered at mention of the king oh i wouldnt be so quick to cheer him liam continued i wouldnt be so sure richards here to save you from john hell come here first id wager come here and deal with you all before dealing with his brother youre lying someone shouted you are johns man others in the crowd murmured their agreement liam could see none of them was going to believe a single word he uttered you better tell them he whispered to bob he is telling the truth barked bob recommendation leave this camp immediately and return to your homes king richard is coming and will kill you all the wood was suddenly filled with raised voices all speaking at once through the crowd on one side of the clearing liam spotted a solitary malnourished horse tied to a tree and staring listlessly out at the noise and commotion in front of it he nudged bob gently over there do you see it affirmative i will now leave with the sheriff you will all be pardoned bob led the way dragging liam with him by the arm the crowd was beginning to break up into knots of people arguing with each other some determined to stay here some wanting to go home an old man reached out for bob his hands grasping at his cape please dont leave we follow you we came here to follow you liam glanced up at bob he couldnt see bobs eyes beneath the shadow of the hood but a gentle tip of his head assured liam he had an answer it is over old man there will be no uprising now you must go home with that he grabbed liam by the arm again and pulled him forward through the milling crowd but the old man was not to be shaken off so easily you cannot leave us now we have nothing we have he grasped at the cape again but this time the old mans frail hand grasped at material further up the cape and as bob stepped away the hood pulled back off his face and flapped down on to his shoulders the effect was instant a silence once more arguments momentarily forgotten voices hushed and eyes growing ever wider as they stared at his face tis the man who was here earlier a trick someone else cried out to rescue the sheriff liam jabbed bob in the ribs run bobs one good arm stretched out and snatched a longbow from the hands of a young man standing nearby he swiped it around smacking the heads of half a dozen of those too slow to duck and then the pair of them were running for the horse liams bare feet stumbled through the embers of a fire kicking up a shower of sparks he yelped and hopped as those nearby frantically brushed off and patted down embers on their dry rags and lank hair liam was still hopping and yelping as bob tossed the longbow aside scooped him up under his arm and a moment later hurled him over the rear of the horse the animal bucked and complained at the sudden load deposited on its back bob snapped the horses tether from the tree with a savage jerk and then swung a leg over with a brutal kick of heels into its flank he startled the horse forward into the crowd knocking aside hands reaching out to grasp the reins and wrest the horse from their control they clattered through the rest of the camp the horses hooves kicking aside the frail wooden frames of tents and hovels people lurching back out of their way at the last moment curses and stones whistling through the air at them and then they were on the narrow forest track chapter nottingham john stared with utter bemusement at the people in the marketplace they respectfully made a pathway for his escort of soldiers and the two dozen carts and wagons containing his baggage and essential royal staff of servants i do believe theyre uhh theyre cheering for me he uttered to becks she rode on horseback beside him sidesaddle rather than astride dressed in fine linens that fluttered lightly and gracefully yes my lord it appears they are that makes a rather pleasant change he murmured selfconsciously waggling a limp hand back at the people they roared approval at the simple gesture leaving oxford hadnt been quite so pleasant john had felt compelled for his own safety to hide in one of the wagons while his escort of soldiers had had to push and shove the angry crowd aside to allow the column through the main gate hed heard jeering and cursing hed heard swords being unsheathed and the thumps and bangs of fists and booted feet against the wooden trap of his wagon it seems your friend has won them round for me becks nodded yes he has been very effective he smiled and nodded at the people and they are staying put even though they must have heard by now that richards army approaches becks nodded as she rode in silence she offered him a faint smile the slightest curl of her lips john felt his heavy heart lift for the first time in years he actually felt liked these people could have abandoned nottingham to its fate they could surely leave and find shelter elsewhere in other towns villages but theyd decided to stay prepared to show the king that they actually approved of johns stewardship while hed been away on his foolish crusading bankrupting them all he noticed the market stalls were well stocked a good summers crop that had managed to be harvested without the disruption of roving gangs of bandits and villains leaving smouldering fields and dead farm workers in their wake the people certainly looked better fed than those in oxford not all pallid skin drawn up against hardedged bones and dressed in rags but people who looked well people from better happier times that at least was some comfort if richard wanted to besiege this town then he was going to have a hard time of it the walls were good the towns position a strong one there appeared to be good supplies of food within and a population that appeared willing to make a stand for him but the grail has he found it yet johns heart skipped anxiously at the thought thered be no need for any kind of a stand a battle a siege no need for any of that nonsense if that curious young man liam de connor had managed to successfully track down the bandits and get back what theyd taken he could hand it over to his brother and then beg his brothers forgiveness for losing the grail beg his forgiveness for failing to find that ransom money for two long years he could beg and publicly stoop to kiss his brothers hand and perhaps that and the safe return of the grail would be enough to appease him thered be a beating with a cane later of course away from public eyes royalty can never afford to be seen as frail just as mortal as any common man richard would delight at that stripping him beating him having him beg and plead like a pitiful dog it wouldnt be the first time hed done that to him but richard would have his precious grail with all its precious templar secrets and be in a good mood hed be distracted into thinking about future insane campaigns in faraway lands now that he had his holy relic and john would get to keep a head on his shoulders he glanced up at the sturdy keep in front of them at the centre of nottingham hoping to catch sight of his new sheriff riding out to greet them on horseback hoping to see a sign a smile and a small nod a gesture from him to assure him that all was well that he could relax once again that he has the grail no welcome uttered john is no one at home he could see the bobbing of helmeted heads between crenellations the castle appeared to be garrisoned still but a greeting party on horseback should have emerged by now out of mere courtesy i wonder where the sheriff is up ahead liam shouted sitting across the bouncing rump of the horse his voice warbled like a songbird thats him the cart ahead of them was rattling along the narrow track wheels wobbling and straining as they careered over the humps of tree roots in the back of the cart tethered faggots of firewood and several sacks of apples rattled and rolled around as locke kicked and cajoled the rear of his horse to pick up the pace they closed on him quickly even their wearylooking old horse all bones and hide and ready for the butchers cleaver was making better progress than the wideaxled cart down what was barely more than a winding footpath locke must have heard them approaching and turned to look over his shoulder it took him all of a second to realize the cart was too slow he reined in the horse reached round into the back of the cart grabbed a small dark wooden box no bigger than a hatbox and leapt off the seat on to the track hes bolting bob nodded get off here he grunted i will pursue him liam slid clumsily off the back of the horse the still raw soles of his feet jabbing him painfully as they settled on sharp stones bob kicked his heels and clattered off down the footpath turning the horse left into the trees where locke had disappeared moments before liam listened to the receding thud of hooves and the occasional crack of a dried branch echoing back through the wood as bob gave chase he made his way slowly down the path towards the abandoned cart yelping and grimacing at each sharp stone each fir cone he stepped on finally he drew up beside it the horse eyed him irritably as if even he knew this was no track for a cart it snorted flaring its nostrils easy there said liam he pulled himself on to the back of the cart and allowed himself to collapse exhausted among the apples that had spilled out across the flatbed chapter sherwood forest nottinghamshire bob steered the horse through the woods deftly ducking the low swoop of branches up ahead he could hear locke scrambling his way over fallen branches that cracked noisily under his feet making far too much noise to hope to evade him he caught a glimpse of locke up ahead the man was making pitifully slow progress the wooden box tucked under one tired arm pushing his way through a tight bush of brambles with the other cease running bob called out you will not escape locke stopped and turned his eyes widened at the sight of bob calmly steering the horse as it picked its way through the undergrowth towards him locke seemed to realize he was wasting his time he slumped down on to a small boulder winded and spent bob swung his leg over the horse dropped heavily down to the ground and approached him i presume you want this said locke holding the box out bob reached out his one hand for the box he placed it on the ground lifted a small metal clasp and opened the lid he stared at the contents in silence for a moment before closing the lid who are you people really asked locke between laboured gasps bobs grey eyes studied him silently youre just a dumb robot arent you inside all that skin blood and bones a dumb robot just like my warsurplus mech a machine under orders i have mission priorities said bob drily and what do you know about whats in there locke said nodding at the box bob was silent right locke nodded not much uh the item known as the holy grail may contain sensitive information about the agency that is why we seek to obtain it and decode its contents locke laughed a wheezy and dry cackle is that it is that all you think might be in there something that might expose your little agency he shook his head and laughed some more you really have no goddamn idea do you bobs eyes narrowed explain that he said nodding at the box still struggling for breath that contains something far more important your secret agency is nothing compared to this its a speck of dust compared to this explain its our future its everyones future dont you know this theres a door that opens in a door that opens on something that what locke shook his head thats just it we dont know no one knows thats why i was sent back to find out to decode it to find out and in some way to get a warning through to everyone in my time so that they can prepare themselves locke spat phlegm on to the forest floor good god you have to help me you have to help me get the key off king richard and your mission priorities are in conflict with mine replied bob what what the hell kind of priorities are more important than knowing whats going to happen mission priorities retrieve the grail decode the grail correct contaminated history locate and terminate potential contaminants locke looked up at him terminate potential contaminants oh i see i get it you have to kill me correct said bob pulling his sword out of its scabbard your presence in this time represents too much of a risk to the timeline lockes eyes followed the dull glint of the swords edge look i have no modern technology artefacts on me im just one man on my own you could let me go you could let me just walk out of here you see i dont want to go back to i really dont bob silently appraised him please just let me go what could i say that anyone would believe anyway id just be considered a madman a village fool some small part of bobs brain registered the growing desperation in lockes voice a desperate desire not to die to live longer the small part of his brain could understand that animal instinct even sympathize with it get up said bob locke clambered slowly to his feet bob raised his one good arm and pointed into the woods with the tip of the blade you must run in that direction locke looked confused run in that direction you must leave the county of nottingham immediately any attempt to influence historical events will be picked up by us and we will return to kill you is this clear locke nodded yes yes of course then proceed go now immediately locke stepped away from bob cautious backwards steps at first then a few yards from him he turned tail and began to run bob silently watched him pick up the pace as he ducked and scrambled through the undergrowth certain now that the man wasnt going to dare look back again he pulled the sword back over his shoulder poised for the briefest moment as he calculated speed and trajectory then flung the blade forward it whistled through the air one complete cartwheel hilt over tip ending with the tip facing forward once more just as it made contact with the soft fleshy space between lockes shoulderblades he tumbled forward and kicked once on the ground a moment later bob stood over the mans body and retrieved his sword wiping the blood off on lockes clothing his silicon mind quietly ticked off the lowest of his list of mission priorities his animal mind begrudgingly murmured approval of the small mercy hed given to locke letting him believe he was going to live death came without any warning and quickly a small mercy at least chapter nottingham he wasnt sure if hed actually fallen asleep he must have because all of a sudden he was looking up at an evening sky free of overlapping branches and leaves and the carts wheels were creaking easily along a rutted track he sat up and turned to see bobs wide shoulders swaying in the drivers seat did you get him bob turned and looked at him locke is no longer a contamination issue what you mean he i managed to acquire what we were after bob interrupted he pulled some sackcloth aside to reveal a small dark wooden box the lid was decorated with the faint lines of a geometric pattern carved a long time ago and attached by old iron hinges bob is this really it is this the holy grail did you open it bob played his best grin the kind that would give small children nightmares i believe it contains what we have been looking for liam reached out for the box touching the wooden grain lightly with his fingertips the faint lines of the carving on the lid the oddest sensation he felt a tingle of energy course through his hands he felt the fine downy hairs on his arms raise and a shudder of something fear excitement ripple through his body inside this is the holy grail liam the holy grail the very thing sought by figures of legend king arthur and his knights of the round table a relic thought to be a cup of christ a chalice or just a myth a metaphor but here it was in the back of a bouncing cart full of rolling apples carefully reverentially he eased the lid slowly open half expecting the sky above to crack open and reveal a god ready to smite him with a bolt of lightning for daring to consider himself worthy enough look upon his very words inside the small box he saw a threadbare canvas bag a drawstring at the top pulling it tight and closed the canvas bag rested on a shallow bed of coins stamped with the face of king henry ii richard and johns father liam guessed that was some of the money lockes bandits had managed to rob from tax collectors and merchants foolish enough to travel the forest tracks of nottingham during the last two years carefully he lifted out the canvas bag and loosened the drawstring to look down inside he could see the handle of a wooden scroll spindle and the frayed edges of yellowing parchment wrapped tightly round it he felt an almost overpowering urge to pull it out of the bag and unroll the parchment but the cart was rolling and bucking as the wheels rode up and down ruts in the track a bump and it could tear in his hands he stared at the frayed edges curled round the spindle somewhere on those pages of parchment the word pandora was written a message a warning that if maddy was right someone wanted them specifically them to know about he felt that shudder down his spine again as if simply by holding this roll of parchment looking at it he was waking something up from a deep slumber disturbing it foolishly prodding it he pulled the drawstring tight again and gently laid the canvas bag back on its bed of coins and closed the lid he shuffled forward and tapped bob on the shoulder he turned his head and liam found himself looking at the frayed and bloody pink edges of what remained of the top rim of bobs right ear a line of dark dried blood ran down the side of his neck and disappeared beneath the folds of the dark cape bob thats really it isnt it weve got he looked down again at the box weve got quite possibly the most important piece of rolledup paper that has ever existed he was wondering whether to voice that out loud or whether saying it was somehow pushing their luck inviting some sort of lightning bolt caution said bob suddenly liam looked up from the box the dusty track had just brought them over the brow of a hill there below them like a childs play set shimmering amid the midday warmth was the walled town of nottingham busy with activity a welcome sight for liam or at least it would have been had it not been for the spreading dark line of figures casually crossing and flattening the patchwork of furrowed fields outside the walls thousands of them he saw the flickering glint of chainmail armour among them a forest of multicoloured pennants fluttering above columns of men trudging off the road leading up from the south and fanning out into the fields he could see swarms of dark figures pulling equipment from baggage trains of carts tents already being erected on beds of trampled crops and long beams of wood being worked upon by teams of carpenters with the percussive rattletap of dozens of hand axes and hammers it appears king richard has arrived said bob down the sloping track leading to the towns main entrance liam could see a river of traffic emerging king richards soldiers seemed to be permitting those who wanted no part in the siege to leave mostly merchants visiting tradesmen driving out empty carts people with no special allegiance to the place and no wish to die for a cause letting people out but no one in liam commented affirmative he looked down at the milling chaos outside the opened gates to nottingham perhaps if they could get down there in among all that confusion they could find a way to sneak in bob lets see how close we can get before someone stops us affirmative and you better pull your hood up your ears going to attract attention bob did as he was told working the hood up over his shaggy head then with his one good hand he grabbed the reins and kicked the horses rump it staggered wearily forward and the carts wheels once more creaked as they descended towards the scene below a couple of minutes later and they were passing the first of the merchants streaming out many of them irritably shouting at them that they were heading the wrong way and should either turn round or get off the track otherwise they met with no interference until a picket of soldiers thirty yards ahead of them wearing olivegreen sashes over leather jerkins began waving them down to stop liam cursed whatre we gonna do he hissed from the back bob shrugged casually i am evaluating well we dont have time to evaluate dammit liam gritted his teeth they were a hundred yards from the main entrance and all of that distance was a confusion of people surely if they could just lose themselves in that the soldiers ahead of them were now stepping on to the track and into their way and what if they decide to search the cart what if one of them decides this little box looks rather nice bob i think were going to have to make a go for it clarify go for it dont stop just go go very fast bob nodded agreed he whipped the reins across the horses shoulders and for good measure swung a hard kick once more at its rear the horse bellowed a complaint but all the same broke into a begrudging canter the soldiers ahead of them called out warnings for them to stop but at the very last moment stepped aside to avoid being run over as they swept by them angry voices rippled orders and another party of soldiers further up overseeing the merchants exodus readied themselves to stop the cart liam could see these ones were better equipped for the job armed as they were with pikes just one of those braced firmly against the ground would be enough to run their horses chest through and bring it down in an untidy heap what they needed was a stampede a distraction chaos what they needed was he reached for the box yanked the lid open and carefully tucked the drawstring canvas bag into the folds of his cloak what was left inside a small mound of gold coins he scooped up into his hands bob he bellowed over his shoulder shout free money shout something like free money really really loud bob craned his hooded neck to look at liam and saw him holding the handfuls of coins he seemed to understand what liam was up to money his voice boomed above the pounding hooves and the laboured creak of their spinning cartwheels have free money liam tossed a handful of the glinting coins over the left side of the cart and into the tall grass beside the track the result was almost instantaneous like tossing a handful of breadcrumbs into a courtyard full of pigeons merchants wives walking beside their husbands carts the foot traffic tradesmens helpers old and young children all swarmed off the dusty track and began scrabbling in the tall grass bob steered their horse cutting in between two carts and putting them on the right side of the traffic emerging through the arch of the gatehouse as liam tossed another handful into the crowd around them free money for everyone bellowed bob again hands snatched and grabbed for the coins tumbling through the air they were now level with the pikemen the soldiers on the left of the surging river of people them on the right separated by a roiling sea of grasping hands fighting each other to get within reach of the last shower of coins the soldiers pushed their way angrily through people bent over double and scrabbling in the dust to get to them but then liam tossed a handful right at them coins clanging like shrapnel off their helmets it did the trick stopping them dead as they too dropped to their hands and knees to scrabble for what they could the large arched entrance to the town loomed above them and bob savagely kicked their poor beast one last time raising their canter to a reckless gallop its hooves clattered and scraped noisily off dried mud on to cobbles and flagstones and the tail end of evacuating merchants ahead of them swiftly parted either side to avoid being flattened as they passed beneath the archway and into the market square inside the wall free money for everyone bobs deep voice echoed across the market bouncing off the inside of the stone walls like the blast of a ships foghorn liam tossed out another fistful in their wake ensuring none of king richards soldiers were going to be able to push through the entrance after them plugged as it was with people doubled over and searching for coins were in liam shouted we did it bob reined the horse back and it slowed down to a blown wheezing trot people around them soldiers too this time wearing the burgundy and orange colours of the towns garrison flocked around the back of the cart looking in at the remaining coins scattered across the flatbed why not liam grinned he scraped the last of the coins up and threw them out into the crowd money for the poor he shouted chapter nottingham castle nottingham the first thing liam registered as he and bob stepped through the velvet drapes into the keeps main hall was becks she was standing by the arch that led out on to a wooden balcony poised in a ridiculouslynother demure and ladylike pose long embroidered linens and lace fluttering glamorously from her in the breeze salutations liam jespere que vous allez bien liam bit his lip resisting an inappropriate urge to giggle instead he tipped a polite nod at her greetings lady rebecca she switched to english greetings to you also john stepped into view from the balcony he smiled genuinely pleased to see liam ahhh my sheriff tis the man of the hour he stepped forward to greet him i am indebted to you i truly am i arrived here earlier today to would you believe to cheers actually cheers from the peasants liam bowed they are loyal to you sire indeed but i suspect it has been your common touch as sheriff that has earned me their affection hmmm johns face adopted a mockserious expression his thick brows knotted i noticed your rather flamboyant entry to the marketplace just now congratulations for making your way through richards lines outside but i must ask is it customary now to hurl handfuls of royal revenue at the people to gain entry ahh yes that well err i we umm johns frown faded and he waved the question away it matters not to me any more now he is back home it is richards money you were throwing anyway not mine he stepped closer to liam he could see there was something far more pressing on johns mind than mere coin now please please you must tell me he said more quietly i i need to know liam quickly nodded saving the man any more anguish yes is the answer sire i have it we have the grail john sagged with relief his breath puffing out in a barely suppressed gasp oh thank the lord thank the lord he settled down heavily into a wooden chair robbed of the strength to remain standing i cannot tell you how how vexed how how so very worried i have been becks stepped into the room and stood beside him liam noticed the graceful way she moved and the way she gently caressed his brow no longer the swagger of a tomboy no longer another bob in a girlsuit she was all grace and elegance now thats very weird so it is he smiled proud of what she seemed to have learned over the last few months her ability to adapt so convincingly not so long ago shed barely managed to pass herself off as an american highschool student now here she was quite believable as a medieval lady of noble blood calm yourself my lord she cooed softly did i not say my friend liam would retrieve it for you john nodded and smiled yes my dear yes so you did i should never have doubted you bob helped of course said liam shrugging actually he did most of the hard work bob emerged from behind the drapes and nodded politely at john and becks good god said john his eyes suddenly as round as pickled eggs this man needs a physician bob looked down at the ragged shredded stump of his left arm dangling shreds of tattered skin and the rounded white nub of a bone the wound is no longer bleeding it is not life threatening your arm is gone man you should be attended to immediately gasped john he got up from his chair and led bob back towards the drapes he called out for one of the guards standing outside to take bob to the garrisons apothecary and be double quick about it fool the man needs it bound he returned palefaced and shuddering ughh i have a poor stomach for such things he puffed his cheeks queasily oh quite horrible all that gristle and and he reached for a cup of wine and drained it then wiped his mouth now to matters of importance he pointed to the balcony i should waste not another moment we must surrender the town immediately what john nodded his head vigorously indeed yes i have what he wants john looked at liam where is it by the way liam nodded down at the box in his arms right here john glanced down at it and it is safe complete undamaged he had little interest in opening the box and inspecting the parchment itself holy relics and templar superstitions were his brothers obsession not his it is fine good then theres no need for this battle to take place no need for bloodshed today i shall arrange a parlay with him at once becks leaned down speaking in soft soothing tones to him and gently stroking his forehead that is a bad idea the grail is all that you have to bargain with you must hold on to it tu dois es courageaux et fort mon cher liam was again impressed with how much her ai had picked up how convincing she sounded and looked i am tired my dear lady muttered john closing his eyes tired of fearing him fearing his return i want this to be over with so i can rest and it will be soon she cooed soon but you must be strong be strong for me he opened his eyes for you she nodded you must be strong and make your brother wait becks glanced towards the archway and balcony from afar the sound of carpenters at work echoed across the walls of nottingham let him build his siege weapons let him waste time and then you should parlay john closed his eyes as she caressed his forehead you should rest my lord theres time for that and you have slept little john nodded i am so very tired becks glanced up at liam rest now my dear take some more wine and i shall go and arrange supper for you and the sheriff she stood up and discreetly beckoned liam to follow her out of the hall chapter nottingham castle nottingham jayzus becks whispered liam you were completely convincing back there does john is he in love with you or something she shrugged he has developed an infatuation for me i have attempted to analyse why this is so and have no valid conclusions to make he has said he finds my unladylike fortitude bewitching the important factor is that this is useful leverage which can be applied if needed she hushed as a castle servant passed them in the small dark hallway she beckoned liam to follow her until she found a low wooden door on their left and stepped inside they were in a small pantry it was empty save for several shelves laden with clay pots of preserves liam reached out and grabbed her arms its good to see you again becks me and bob were becoming worried about you so we were i have been in no danger she replied calmly with a hint of a smile for him but then it was gone more pressing matters to attend to john does not have the will or the courage to stand up to richard but my history database shows this siege does take place that john does make a stand against him nottingham holds out for a week that needs to happen then right to ensure history is back to where it was she nodded what about the grail said liam richard isnt meant to get his hands on it is he there is no information on that in my files this would indicate that the grail vanished ended up getting lost affirmative she cocked her head considering a suggestion we could destroy it liam shook his head no no i think theres much more than we thought in there not just this word pandora theres some sort of prophecy about the future prophecy liam told her everything he could remember locke telling him he told her about the robot he came back with about the templars whod sent him he talked uninterrupted for what seemed like ages finally describing bob chasing locke off into the woods and retrieving the box she now knew everything he did then there may be strategically important information we can retrieve by decoding this document she said calmly gazing at the wooden box in liams hands exactly and the only way to do it is using this grille thing out there in king richards possession she shook her head what i believe there is another factor involved liam frowned this was already confusing enough for him what are you talking about she reached under the layers of her gown fumbling awkwardly for a few moments before pulling out a scroll of parchment it was flattened and creased he didnt dare ask where that had been wedged this is a document known as the treyarch confession she said this is an account of the discovery of a scroll dating back to bible times cut in liam he remembered cabots description of it months ago affirmative where did you get it that is irrelevant information i have scanned the text of this and analysed the content and i calculate a fiftyseven per cent probability that the treyarch confession is the correct key for decoding the grail what he looked at the creased and tattered parchment in her hands thats the key fiftyseven per cent probability that it is correct so whats king richard got then a piece of worn leather with holes cut into it why what makes you think that this is the real thing she carefully unrolled the parchment until finally it was spread almost two yards along the stone floor she pointed to illustrations in the margins on both sides of the text these decorative illustrations are common for the time typically they mirror the theme or message of the text observe she said moving her finger down one margin these illustrations are just simple geometric patterns they have no discernible symbolism or meaning theyre there just to make it look nice correct liam noted the patterns were intermittent a dense and intricate block of crosshatching and swirls about two inches high and wide located every ten or eleven inches down the margin on either side the patterns are identical becks said liam looked more closely yes they were line for line curl for curl the same ornate pattern beckss finger moved down the scroll and finally stopped except these four she pointed them out two on each side liam struggled to see the difference by the guttering candlelight his eyes strained as he studied them again comparing lines and curves look very closely said becks pointing to a faint penstroke amid the pattern the slightest hint of a minute cruciform easily lost amid the confusion of elaborate ink swirls she pointed to another of the four again the hint of a cross in a different location within the pattern and then the other two the cross appears only in these four blocks of pattern he looked at her so her brows knotted momentarily perhaps a flickering learned gesture of impatience each cross could indicate a corner he looked back down at the parchment she was of course right four corners four corners of a box he looked back down again she continued i calculate with reasonable probability that this is an instruction on how to build a cardan grille to decode the grail the corners of the template would line up with the four crosses she pointed at the handwritten text that would be framed by all four markers and some of the letters of the text within the template area should be identifiable as window candidates what do you mean you would mark where the letter was on the template and cut out a small square of the template around it thus creating a window ahh i see liam grinned and you cut out all these little windows and then you lay out this template on the rolledout grail and correct she nodded making sure you line the template up with similar corner markers and the letters you see through the windows that you have cut out spell the hidden message thats thats genius that is you could be right he got up off his haunches and started to look around for something they could use we could make our own grille right here right now no she replied we cant why not we do not know which letters are the window candidates liams excitement vanished with a sigh hed assumed shed already identified which were the ones on several occasions this document switches from old english to another language as you can see it does so within the area marked out by the crosses she pointed out the change of language to him i do not have this language file in my database we have to presume there would be clues within this text to identify which letters are the window candidates liam scratched at his chin would bob know this language no we had the same files downloaded before the mission liam looked at it he recognized some of the letters from the alphabet but there were others that were totally alien to him well this is no good he slumped back down again on the cold stone floor suggestion what she began to roll the treyarch confession up carefully finally gathered up it disappeared again under the folds of her long dress oh hang on said liam realizing what she was thinking you cant take it to kirklees becks were surrounded by richards army it could end up falling into richards hands becks reached for the candle flickering on the floor between them then the alternative is that we burn both documents before nottingham falls to king richard what is your decision liam oconnor chapter nottingham becks managed to pick her way through the picket lines of soldiers not too difficult the few men on guard duty were too busy discussing how they were going to spend their share of the spoils once nottingham had fallen rumour was king richard was going to turn a blind eye to any looting or pillaging in the immediate aftermath just as if this was a siege taking place in the corner of some foreign country towards the rear of the camp she found the assembled carts of the baggage train and tethered nearby in a temporarily erected corral the horses she picked one untied it led it quietly out and was cantering away up the track towards the nearby forests before the meadsoaked old boy dozing instead of watching over the animals registered theyd become restless and that one of them had in fact gone missing the canter became a carefree gallop along the dirt track leading up to the brow of the hill overlooking nottingham she took the northeast route through the forest partially following liams directions partially relying on the precise coordinates in her head liam had warned her to be wary of bandits but the forest presented no threats to her the shabby band of villains liam had mentioned lockes people had either disbanded and gone home or disappeared deeper into the woods in an attempt to evade any punitive raids richard might decide to unleash through several hours of night she covered winding miles of nothing more than the hissing of trees stirred by a lively breeze and hooting birds until finally just as her silicon mind indicated she would she caught sight of the dark and low form of the outbuildings of the priory sebastien cabot was awake in an instant his soldiers instinct to reach for the dagger hidden under his straw mattress kicked in only to be stopped by the lightningquick grasp of a firm hand round his wrist from the slither of moonlight stealing through the narrow window into his bare room he could see just the dark outline of someone leaning over him who who is he blustered his voice still thick with sleep this is lady rebecca she whispered cabot struggled to sit up the wooden frame beneath his mattress creaked good grief what are ye doing here the other monks her hand smothered his mouth and pushed his head down heavily against the mattress with a soft thud be quiet and listen her hand remained clamped over his lips until he finally nodded she lifted her hand and he sucked in a muchneeded breath i have obtained the grail document she said without any preamble what my go his voice bounced off the stone walls of his room her hand clamped his mouth firmly again above the back of her slender hand and the bulbous end of his florid pockmarked nose she noted the wide rolling whites of his eyes for a moment she considered how expressive human eyes could be just those alone seemed to be able to communicate a whole language of emotions cabot for example right now appeared to be communicating an emotion akin to profound shock she made a note to try rolling her eyes like that sometime i also have the treyarch confession she added her hand remaining over his mouth as he grunted and struggled i will need your assistance in translating a section of the treyarch confession she waited a few moments for that request to settle in and for cabot to stop making that muffled mewling noise beneath her firmly clamped palm when she was sure he wasnt going to blurt out loudly again she slowly lifted her hand will you assist cabot gasped for air again sucking in breath through his mouth after a few seconds he managed to talk in a hoarse whisper ye ye have them both she nodded here right here with ye yes will you assist me good lord ii cabot struggled to frame an answer becks once more hushed him this time with a finger pressed against his whiskerlined lips we will discuss this further in your graveyard she said put clothes on now i will see you there in five minutes she let go of his wrist and got up and bring a candle he picked his way through weeds and brambles that scratched at his bare ankles below the coarse hem of his robe by the scudding light of the moon he spotted the dark outline of lady rebecca standing perfectly still beside a gravestone my lady he called softly here she replied he joined her ye last i heard ye were in oxford john has relocated to nottingham king richard has come north with an army yes yes the county is full of this news but the grail how did ye find where was the grail was recovered from the bandit known as hood earlier today she replied quickly as if answering the question was valuable time wasted how did they manage to find him that is unimportant the grail document can only be decoded with the correct cardan grille she said reaching into the folds of her dark robe she saw the whites of cabots wide and round eyes again ye have it he asked dont tell me ye have stolen it from king richard she ignored his question and calmly pulled out the treyarch this document is written in latin and norman french she began but there is one passage written in a language i have no data on your assistance is required to identify the language she carefully started to unroll the parchment you may light your candle now if there is inadequate light for you to see cabot shook his head impatiently tis not necessary the moon is enough please continue she resumed turning the wooden spindle and spreading out the long curled sheet of parchment on the ground by the moons wan light the pale parchment seemed to almost glow the dark spiderlines of ink across it every bit as clear and legible as they needed to be the unidentifiable language is located here said becks pointing to a passage threequarters of the way down the scroll she put rocks out along the edge of the parchment to stop it curling up again and then leaned back so that her shadow didnt fall across it cabot squatted down and inspected the writing closely this here he said running his fingers along the curls of writing tis a form of gaelic i believe you know this language he grimaced i know some words of it and there are many forms of this language i could perhaps translate this for ye if i had some time and a library of other gaelic works to compare to she cocked her head and her eyebrows locked in concentration for a moment after a minute of silent consideration she nodded slowly a decision silently made the contamination risk is acceptable for the moment she uttered what is that my lady again she ignored him you will come with me please she said where to she got to her feet and began foraging among the tall weeds around the gravestone until she finally found what she was after a long lumber nail she crouched down in front of the gravestone and began scratching deep lines into the stone what are ye doing communicating she carried on in silence nothing but the sound of scraping and scratching and stone grit tumbling to the ground i am requesting an immediate portal what is this what are ye up to asked cabot once again she turned to look up at him impatiently you are coming with me coming with ye where to the future chapter new york sal looked at them both jahulla that was one she said another one did you feel it the other two looked at each other maddy quickly got up from the table and went over towards the bank of computer monitors she sat down at the desk and downloaded the image again from the stillconnected drive outside as it flickered open on the screen sal leaned over and traced a finger along the faint new lines on the photograph theres another message on your gravestone adam scribbled down the pigpen glyphs on to a pad of paper the girls watched him impatiently as he checked each symbol against the table hed drawn up on the page of writing paper earlier well just hang on his eyes narrowed as he doublechecked some of the symbols on the new row that had appeared on his photograph there were faint lines there lines that might not have been part of the original carving and lines lost to nearly a millennium of weathering he looked down at the page of letters hed deciphered and realized there were mistakes in there first word is extraction said sal maddy nodded the rest is a timestamp twelve numbers the first four a time the last eight a date sal grabbed a pen and quickly scribbled the nearlywords as numbers maddy checked her numbers against what adam had decoded yes yes ok quarter to five in the morning th june right she looked at the webcam you get that bob affirmative i have been listening date stamp june therere no geocoordinates though said maddy same coordinates as last time then said sal maddy tapped a pen against her lips yeah you get that bob affirmative same geoplacement coordinates she leaned back in her chair and glanced round adam at the rack of equipment beside the empty perspex tube the charge display showed a full line of green leds all right weve got enough juice on the board to open it up bob affirmative activating density probe kirklees priory yorkshire cabot looked around the field although the sun had yet to climb into view the peachstained sky was light now a sky that would soon be a deep blue and cloudless another hot summers day why pray are we standing in this field becks raised a finger just a moment cabot looked around at the softly stirring ears of barley they rustled and whispered among themselves as they waited in silence for for what lady rebecca had said the future days yet to be to visit one of those it was a concept he could barely get his mind around a day simply is and then after the day has ended it merely was complete with whatever one remembered of the day in question to walk into what was yet to be he shook his head at the impossibility of it perhaps this lady and her friends were afflicted by some madness hed come across holy men in jerusalem who made claim of things just as impossible and nonsensical as this my lady perhaps it would be best if we return to the grounds of the priory she shook her head i am detecting tachyons cabot it appears the message has already been received tackeeons another one of their strange words that he could only ponder the meaning of he looked around the field not sure what a tackeeon was or what he should do if one were to approach him a fresh breeze stirred the barley sending a gentle wave across the ears of grain the portal is coming said becks cabots gaze flitted from one direction to the next all he could see was the field they were standing in the edge of the nearby woods and a thin smudge of smoke rising from the priory just over the brow of the hillside then all of a sudden he felt a strong buffeting wind cool against his cheek a dozen yards ahead above the chesthigh sea of swaying barley he could just make out the outline of a shimmering undulating dome within it he saw swirling dark details that flickered and twisted like the reflection in a disturbed pool of water what devilry is this his voice croaked hoarsely it is a time portal said becks matteroffactly she started towards it follow me please but cabot remained rooted to the spot suddenly terrified of this thing that had no place being here in their field he saw darkness in the middle of it shapes he couldnt understand demonlike shapes that seemed to be waving malevolently to him beckoning him on this can be of no good he cautioned himself he glanced at lady rebecca and for a moment wondered if his more devout brothers in the priory had been right all along that there were demons and devils and a dark place beneath the earth they stood on whither tainted souls were taken down and doomed to burn in torment for an eternity becks turned and saw he hadnt yet moved now she barked at him cabot shook his head tis tis an evil work she pushed her way impatiently through the stalks and grabbed his arm roughly we are wasting time the portal can only remain open for a limited period on one charge no he tried to wriggle free of her grasp no please but her hand had closed around his lower arm like a vice she began to wrestle him forward towards the churning darkness oh lord forgive my sins cabot began to bellow trying his best to dig his heels into the soft dry soil i renounce all evil i renounce the devil and his minions cabot threw a punch at her face it landed firmly on her cheek leaving a graze and a welt that was sure to turn into a dark purple bruise within the hour her eyebrows knitted disapprovingly please do not do that again with both hands she grasped his monks habit and lifted him up off the ground his arms and legs began to flail frantically ye are a demon he screamed down at her face his feet in sandals kicking her stomach her thighs i knew it she staggered forward just about managing to keep her balance as he squirmed kicked and punched in her grasp no pleasehave mercy on chapter nottingham castle nottingham what roared john liam looked at bob standing beside him a quick warning glance to him to be ready for anything there was no knowing how john was going to react to the news i said its gone sire lady rebecca took it last night the skin on johns face raced through several shades of crimson anger then it drained to a pallid grey good god she was a traitor she was a spy of richards she was no liam interrupted him no she is nothing to do with richard sire johns anger was already spent gone in a moment leaving him quivering and looking lost she johns jaw worked silently she but i thought we were in love he looked slowly up at liam and he could see tears filling the mans hooded eyes but do you say she was taking me for a for a fool liam couldnt deny that bit yes she had been using him lady rebecca has taken it to a safe place said liam the fluttering of nerves in his own voice had gone john didnt look like a tyrant about to order his head be cut off liam had expected a torrent of abuse a face full of royal spittle instead john looked all of a sudden like a child abandoned frightened and lonely she told me to to be strong he said quietly a tear rolling down his cheek into the wispy bristles of his beard for her you know i would have been he swiped at his cheek with a sleeve for her you understand for her i would have stood up to richard liam looked over johns slumped shoulders at the arched alcove and the balcony beyond in the heatshimmering distance beyond the walls of nottingham he could see the endless rows of multicoloured tents and marquees of richards assembled army the sturdy lumber aframes of half a dozen catapults being swarmed around and finished by carpenters like ants at this distance i have to surrender to him whispered john i have to capitulate the longer i leave it the angrier he will get he will no said liam john looked up at him sharply a flash of irritation in his eyes at liams insubordinate interruption listen sire if you do surrender while you have no grail you have nothing to bargain with liam didnt need to finish that thought for john by the look in johns redrimmed eyes he knew exactly what that meant for him but if you stall liam continued stall a word john was unfamiliar with if you wait let richard think you have it maybe even threaten to destroy it if he attempts to attack destroy it johns eyes looked like theyd glimpsed the very bowels of hell can you imagine sheriff can you imagine what he would do to me if i if i were to would he dare risk that though liam cocked an eyebrow really after all that hes done to get hold of it would he risk you putting a candle to it john swallowed nervously he he would know i darent liam looked at the man trembling and pale perhaps he would at that you still have to be strong sire you have to arrange a meeting with him you have to tell him we have it here and unless his army disbands you will burn it yourself bob opened his mouth to say something liam knew what it was a warning about time contamination the way history was supposed to go richards siege was successful and john surrendered to his older brother liam patted his good arm to hush him john didnt need to hear that right now that he was destined to surrender buy us a little time sire said liam meet with him convince him that you will destroy it if he attempts to attack us john stroked his chin obsessively the faint tremor of a nervous tic in his quivering jaw liam wondered if the poor man could convince anyone of anything right now lady rebecca will be back i assure you shell be back with the grail i hope and then you can arrange a truce sire youll have something you can use to bargain with chapter new york sebastien cabot kept his eyes firmly clenched shut not daring to get his first glimpse of the underworld and the devils workings through his closed lids he could sense it was a dark place his ears picked out sounds hed never heard before soft beeps and hums that could only be the devices of evil stirring ready to tear his mortal soul apart and whos this a female voice echoed he sensed they were standing in some cave perhaps on a ledge that overlooked an infinite cavern filled with a squirming sea of tormented souls below burning in agony prodded stabbed and tortured by demons wandering among them cabot he recognized lady rebeccas voice in reply cabot like like in the message the same guy affirmative he is here to help cabot slowly opened his clenchedshut eyes he first saw his sandalled feet on a hard pockmarked and stained stone floor and as he looked up he saw lady rebecca and three other strangely dressed people staring at him with curiosity no demons no fire no tormented souls one of them stepped forward a young woman she had long frizzy hair and pale freckled skin on her face were two ovals of glass that glinted reflection from a bright bar of light above him that fizzed and flickered slightly hey pleased to meet you she said extending a hand towards him im maddy cabots dry mouth opened and closed without producing anything finally he managed to say something this this place tis not hell the frizzyhaired girl shrugged and smiled in a friendly way guess its a matter of opinion really some time later cabot still lost in a state of numb shock had no idea how long perhaps an hour a day perhaps only a few minutes later he found himself and these curious strangers sitting around a long wooden table on padded chairs he held a cup full of a warm and bitter brown drink the other girl in this place darkskinned like a turk and wearing black clothes splashed with a lurid orange and pink design of some sort shed been introduced as sal had told him the drink was called koffeeee as shed pressed it into his hands has a section in it that is marked by four corner markers lady rebecca was saying in these margin illuminations here here here and here the man with them called adam hunkered over the table beside lady rebecca and examined the treyarch confession more closely my god i think she may be right he said theyve got to be grille markers maddy joined them slumped over the table she pushed her glasses up her nose show me see said adam like corners embedded subtly into the illustrations pattern yeah oh man yeah i see it adam looked at them basically this is the blueprint instructions on how to make a cardan grille to decode that he said pointing to the small wooden box containing the grail it is this passage of text continued becks spreading her hands across the treyarch that is being indicated but it is in a language we do not have data for an extinct form of gaelic cabot she said pointing at him has knowledge of this language all eyes suddenly rested on him he put down the mug of hot liquid on the table and spread his hands apologetically i uh i know but a little of it he said i served the order alongside another templar irish a man who came from dun garbhain maddy cocked a finger inviting him to lean over well come on and take a closer look mr cabot see what you can figure out cabot pulled himself up out of his chair and joined them over the document rolled out and spread flat along the table and almost as long a steadily burning light in a small wire cage dangled from the arched brick roof just above them he wondered what made it glow so steadily it was certainly no flame he turned his attention to the elaborate curls and flourishes of handwriting before him by contrast to the feeble flickering candlelight the priorys monks worked to after dark this steady light let him see as if the table was standing outside in a field in the middle of a bright summers day this he began moving a leathery old finger along the first lines of text this i believe tis a form of irish gaelic his finger traced the words his lips moving in silence for a while i tell ye tis hard to read but i think this first line is a prayer of silence be thy true a servant or perchance that reads to help cabot growled with frustration seek ye notin matters of truth of or tis some other meaning take not matters of light achh my gaelic is too poor to read this what do you think thats supposed to mean asked sal matters of truth maddy shrugged just a bunch of weird voodoo crock she looked at cabot is there some hidden meaning in there that were supposed to get like is it cryptic or something he shook his head tis as close as i can understand it the rest is beyond me they stared at the swirls and strokes of letters a meaningless jumble of accented and contorted latin letters maybe its not actually meant to mean anything said adam the others looked at him maybe its not the words themselves that are the clue but how theyre written cabot the old man shrugged he studied it in silence for a while my knowledge is poor ye understand tis been a long while he hesitated a moment what asked maddy what is it he shook his head tis poorly written this man treyarch was clearly no scribe what do you mean cabot pointed to one of the words in the sentence hed loosely translated this letter is wrong tis written upside down adam hunched closer to it his nose almost touching the yellowed parchment i wonder he whispered to himself wonder what adam he looked up at them you got a decent digital camera ive got my iphone replied maddy whats that of course she smiled theyre still a twinkle in the eye of some apple designer its just my cell its got a builtin camera she went over to the computer desk and returned with it a moment later get a decent image of all of the text between these corner markers said adam she climbed up on to one of the armchairs to get a good birdseye view of the scroll then snapped several images what now photoshop said adam pointing back towards the bank of computer monitors a minute later and maddy had downloaded the four images shed taken of the confession on to one of the computers and they were looking at them within the imageediting software cabots eyes were comically round with wonder as he stared at the dozen glowing monitors so said adam clicking on a dropdown menu im going to lighten these images up a little he selected the clearest of the four images and tweaked its brightness the rich yellow of the parchment became a lighter vanilla and the black ink became a deep blue thing is continued adam when using a grille you place it down on the blank parchment with the windows already cut out and then you write each letter of your message on the little windows of parchment you can see then when youre done you let the ink dry first before removing the grille so you dont smudge it that would give the game away right only certain letters being smudged the others nodded made sense so what you have then is a page of isolated letters you write the rest of some meaningless or innocentsounding message that incorporates those letters he clicked on a menu and pulled another dropdown of editing options but quite often in between these two stages you might be writing with a different pot of ink its the same colour said maddy pointing at the image onscreen its black well dark blue now youve lightened it every pot of ink is slightly different you made your own ink back then cabot nodded this is right its homemade ink not factory made every time you make it its ever so slightly different to our eyes yes its all black ink but in photoshop just one variation of the rgb value rgb red green blue essentially tone hue said adam and we can separate it out exaggerate it enough to see adam zoomed in close on the writing then selected another menu option producing a slide bar the mouse cursor dragged the slide marker and moved it slowly along the horizontal bar the image started shifting tone the paper easing from vanilla to amber to pink and the ink sliding from a deep blue to a deep green to a deep ochre oh my god whispered maddy the upsidedown letter that cabot had identified was a slightly yellower ochre than the rest zoom out she said quickly adam did so pulling out until the whole of the captured section of text was on the screen among the page several hundred characters stood out distinctly from the rest as distinct as minstrels at a banquet chapter nottingham john struggled with great difficulty to keep the trembling to a minimum he knew his nervous tic must be showing that slight jerk of his head now and then the impulsive stroking of his chin no way of hiding that but the rest of him was hidden beneath flowing robes richard would know he was terrified of him but the other barons earls and dukes were only going to see him from afar his sheriff the very strange liam of connor and his even stranger squire bob walked with him along the dusty track leading out through the gates of nottingham towards the small burgundycoloured tent erected on its own in the middle of no mans land he waits in there beyond the tent richards army stood in battle lines a row of six gigantic catapults behind earthworks ready to bombard the walls of the city an endless sea of glinting helmets and chain mail pikes and pennants watching silently as they approached relax sire whispered his sheriff remember you have in your possession the thing that this is all about right johns head nodded quickly a good man this sheriff he offered liam a faint flickering smile as they came to a halt outside the tents portico two soldiers were standing guard outside only him one of them growled insolently no reference to johns titles no honorifics john gently tapped the sheriff and his large onearmed man to indicate they should stay where they were and stepped forward towards the tents entrance he pushed aside a drape of heavy velvet and entered the cool dim interior of the tent he saw a small wooden table with a flagon and two cups on it two collapsible campaign chairs of oak and leather and richard sprawled casually in one of them so my little brother you dared to come out to see me yourself instead of sending a lackey john nodded yyes he hated the strangled warbling in his voice he sounded like a woman beside the deep masculine growl of richards drawl richard snorted laughter you better sit before you collapse john obediently settled into the other of the two chairs richard sat forward the chair creaking under the weight of the man in his chain mail and armour plating im ready for a fight little brother are you i yes im richard laughed again ha you little runt you couldnt fight your way off a nursemaids teat he picked up the flagon and poured some watereddown wine into his cup but i am not here to punish you this day he emptied the cup with one swig spilling wine down his thick blond beard now ive been hearing rumours since landing on these godforsaken shores that something very precious to me has been lost by you you know what im talking of dont you john nodded although whether it stood out as a nod instead of another involuntary tic he wasnt sure i know you are a fool dear brother but not that much of a fool to lose it so i can only presume this is a fiction richard smiled for the first time a cold smile that meant absolutely nothing it seems you have grown a backbone after all this is your attempt to bargain with me eh john could see that smile wavering he could see it turn into a snarl in a heartbeat a snarl a sudden whiplash of movement and a blade sunk deep into his throat richard could do that and not think twice of the consequences be very careful i i have it brother excellent of course you do and now i thank you for keeping it safe these last two years you will hand it over to me and perhaps perhaps i will overlook your reluctance to pay my ransom i will overlook your many attempts to undermine my authority while i have been away fighting for christendom john felt his legs trembling beneath his robes felt his bladder loosen his stomach flip and churn be strong it is safe richard ii shall you shall what john swallowed drily i shall hhold on to it for nnow the smile froze on richards face he reached for the flagon and topped his cup up again your pitiful attempt at defiance is almost amusing but i have no time for that now i am sserious brother john uttered the words stumbling out of his mouth like a drunkard from an inn at closing time richards eyes narrowed i i i am s s serious b b brother he mimicked cruelly in a shrill high pitch i will not be bargained with by you you pitiful woman he shook his head at the very thought of that you are a child a baby you always have been you play at being king while i have been away and now you dare you dare to play with this it is just a scroll of words said john it means nothing but almost the moment he said it he regretted it he expected his brother to leap off his chair to slap his face with the hard back of his hand but instead richards response was measured calm it is gods instructions instructions meant for me and me alone john looked at his eyes they glistened with a frightening sense of glee purpose you stand in the way of the lords intentions brother a very dangerous place to be john took a deep breath steadying the churning in his stomach hopefully steadying the unfortunate tremor in his voice disband your nobles and their men leave nottingham and i shall ggive you the grail no richard looked down at the ground these are the choices i present to you surrender the grail immediately and i shall consider some leniency i am after all known for my mercy if i have to take nottingham to obtain it i will have your head attack the city and and i shall burn it before you get to mme dark hooded eyes settled on him for a long while then dear brother you will know the agony of a witchs fire before i have you opened up and quartered you will see your own heart in my hand before your head comes off god help me john stood up i am leaving we are done richard remained seated then you will die very badly brother john pushed his way past the velvet drapes cursing as his robes tangled with it and he stumbled awkwardly out into the open richards raised voice following him if you burn it you fool you will die badly chapter new york but those letters they dont spell anything said maddy theyre just a bunch of weird celtic squiggles adam was looking around her messy desk for something its not the letters we want just where they are on the page have you got any cardboard normally there were half a dozen pizza boxes lying around but shed binned a whole bunch of them the other day uh what do you want cardboard for sal looked around at the filing cabinet to the right of the computer table liam had left a breakfast bowl up there and being the scruffy shaddyah he was the box of rice krispies she reached for it this any good adam grabbed it yeah scissors both girls shook their heads this isnt a freakin craft store said maddy i need to cut out windows said adam have you got anything a penknife cabot reached into the folds of his monks habit and pulled out a small knife would this do perfect adam grabbed the knife from him he pulled the bag of krispies out and then began to hack at the cereal box maddy frowned you gonna make something you saw on sesame street adam ignored the jibe and pointed at the computer screen make a note of those standout letters he took his cardboard box and cabots knife across to the kitchen table where the treyarch was still stretched out under the glare of the overhead light he finished cutting one side of the cereal box out and laid it gawdy printside down on the parchment carefully lining up the ragged corners of the cardboard with the corners of the margin illuminations too big he muttered he began trimming one side cursing as cabots serrated blade chewed at the flimsy cardboard leaving a rough uneven shredded edge sal cabot and becks joined him thisll be no good for cutting out the windows he said i need a modelling knife or something the cardboards just shredding up sal looked down at the parchment why not just cut the letters out of this treyarch thing adam looked at the ragged wobbling scrap of cardboard in his hand then down at the unravelled scroll yeah why not cabots eyes grew round but but tis a valuable account from the first crusade no said adam its a cardan grille in disguise thats all it is thats why it was written its the real key to that he said gesturing at the wooden box perched on the end of the table maddy rushed over with a sheet of paper in her hand i printed it out she laid it down on the table the highlighted characters still just about discernible from the rest of the text ok she said this first line its this character thats highlighted she said pointing to the upsidedown gaelic symbol cabot had noted minutes earlier adam took the knife and carefully dug its sharp tip into the parchment and the wooden table beneath what if were wrong said maddy what if its something else youre about to cut holes in this thing and like theres only this one copy adam hesitated a moment ahh true he blew air through his teeth she looked down at the printout but looking at that he nodded exactly those letters are different ink theres only one reason youd write certain letters out of order like that yeah she shrugged ahh heck go for it then as adam began cautiously cutting the first character out of the stiff parchment cabot absentmindedly crossed himself with the tips of his fingers and muttered an apology in latin to god above chapter nottingham liam and the soldiers standing alongside him ducked again at the warning shout from the gatehouse half a dozen rounded boulders the size of mead barrels came hurtling over the top of the city wall and with a clearly audible whistle arced downwards into the market square one landed with a heavy thud that he felt vibrate through the ground it sent up a mushroom cloud of dust and airborne soil and chicken droppings the others found market stalls and the wooden shacks that surrounded the thoroughfare shattering them like eggshell jayzusnmothermary bob stood beside him calmly evaluating the paths the boulders had taken information they are adjusting their angles of trajectory he pointed towards a section of wall twenty yards to the right of the citys main gatehouse they are aiming for that the wall there is weak liam could see a faint discoloration to the section of wall as if different stone had been used there to patch up an ageold breach the first few volleys had overshot the wall and disappeared among the jumble of slate and wood rooftops in the middle of nottingham sending up plumes of dust and smoke into the cloudless blue sky a fire had been started in among that somewhere and the darker column of smoke growing thicker suggested it was beginning to take hold and spread liam could feel the nervous darting eyes of hundreds of the towns people on him looking to their young sheriff to issue his orders oh just great fantastic ive never commanded the defence of a siege before suggestion liam leaned closer to bob yes please ive got no idea what to do so help me the wall will fail there he said pointing towards the discoloured section we will need to concentrate the garrison where the breach will be right bob pointed up to the top of the city wall and the gatehouse nottinghams meagre garrison of troops were mostly dotted along the front wall firing sporadic unaimed arrows towards the metallic shimmering and glinting mass of richards assembled army these soldiers also the ones held in reserve to defend the keep are not efficiently deployed rumbled bob liam watched them cowering behind the crenellations as arrows flickered over the wall occasionally sticking their heads out to return the odd shot bob was right it appeared richard had not bothered with taking more time to build siege towers hed efficiently evaluated the citys wall and decided the obvious weak section was his way in half a dozen trebuchets working over that part of the wall was all that was needed the fight wasnt going to focus around the gatehouse nor be for control of the wall tops the fight was going to be concentrated around the breach just as soon as the masonry had finished tumbling down and the dust settled liam looked at the wall section at the same moment that voices from the gatehouse called out another warning several boulders arced languidly over the top their shadows racing across the cobbles and dirt of the market square as they came to earth much closer and thudded with impacts that shook the ground again beneath liams feet but one shot landed on target he heard the deep crash and boom of the projectile rock against masonry and saw a spiders web of cracks suddenly appear on their side of the wall dirt dust and shards of dislodged flint and rock cascaded down in a clattering shower on to the market stalls standing near the base of the wall liam turned to bob were going to need everyone right here arent we bob nodded correct liam nodded spat grit from his mouth he really could have done with john being out here for him to be seen by his people standing shoulder to shoulder with them with his appointed sheriff instead of cowering in the keep time to lead liam come on mr oconnor weve been here before true but it was just a class of kids last time not a whole bloody city come on theyre all looking at you waiting for you do something he cupped his mouth and waited for a lull in the noise the distant sound of richards men chanting taunts the frightened mewling of womenfolk and children the braying of donkeys the squeal of a pig nearby dragging itself in panicked circles both back legs and rear end crushed to a bloody bonesplintered pulp by the fallen masonry of the wall all menatarms to assemble here he bellowed at the soldiers standing nearby and those men up on the wall achieving nothing useful he then turned to the townsfolk he guessed there had to be over a thousand of them huddled in the open ground of the market square and clogging the narrow streets that led on to it every man who can fight to assemble here he gestured at the already cracked wall through a slowly clearing pall of dust this is where they will come through we will hold them here for a moment he wondered if theyd heard him for an absurd moment he thought everyone was going to laugh at him look at the boy playing at being a general but voices carried his command onwards across the market square and through the crowd along the wall one soldier to the next he saw a flurry of movement the backs of men young and old turning for their shanty homes to retrieve old weapons and farming tools liam let out a gasp of relief hiding it behind one gauntletcovered hand he hoped that to anyone watching him it looked like a casual yawn that sound all right he uttered out of the side of his mouth bob nodded a dark brow lifted and the corner of his horselips stretched with a hint of pride affirmative chapter new york they studied the rectangle of yellow parchment cut out from the treyarch confession adam held it up carefully by two corners and looked at them through the patchwork of little square windows hed cut out of it its so very fragile he said im scared of tearing the thing lets get the grail out said maddy she reached for the treyarch now missing a rectangle four feet long by eighteen inches wide and hurriedly wound it round its wooden spindle rolled up she casually tossed it on to one of the armchairs and reached for the wooden box cabot rested a hand on its lid his eyes locked on maddys ye understand what lies within she nodded impatiently he glanced at the treyarch tossed on the chair already forgotten i trust ye will treat what lies within this box with more respect than ye did the confession his hand remained firmly on the lid in here are precious words many men have died for and killed for the holy grail right his eyes narrowed ye say that young girl like a like tis just a flavour of preserve he looked down at the box if tis what king richard believes it to be if it be what the templars believe it to be then this contains the hidden words of god ye understand this maddy pursed her lips and sighed yes yes of course ill be very careful with it ok cabot shook his head with frustration tis not the scroll the parchment and ink i am talking about that is merely the work of a man with a quill he glanced at the parchment grille adam was holding up carefully if that really be the key by laying that atop the grail and looking through the holes we are looking upon the true word of god is it truly for us to see maddys first instinct was to brush the old fool aside she didnt have the patience for this kind of superstitious nonsense she didnt believe in some fluffyhaired father christmaslike guy sitting up on some heavenly throne and handing down soundbites of wisdom once every few millennia she was about to dismiss his medieval superstition with a sarcastic comment but then a solitary word pushed itself to the forefront of her mind and silenced her pandora her eyes dropped down to the box whats in there the message hiding inside includes the word pandora there was no knowing what was about to be revealed she looked around at adam sal becks cabot and wondered if this really should be for all of their eyes for your eyes only maddy uhh yes cabot perhaps youre right she looked at sal then adam im sorry guys this is something that i have to do alone why asked sal she sounded hurt in truth she probably was after all sal liam and herself were supposed to be a team a shared bond a shared trust in each other shared secrets but not this one not yet sal ii dont know why not yet i just know somebody somewhere in some time has tried to warn me about something with the word pandora thats all ive got thats all i know if this is the answer she said nodding at the box then i have to find out what this is first then well talk she looked at adam and im sorry adam this is meant for sal me and liam when we get him back team first thats how it works what you cant cut me out now i mean ive been helping you maddy i worked out becks stepped forward team strategist madelaine carter has authority on this matter she said in a firm voice that hushed adam hed nearly lost a finger in the casual twist of her hand once before he didnt look like he was ready to try his luck again now sure all right he said if thats how you want this to go sorry adam said maddy let me do what needs to be done first and maybe therell be more i can tell you in a little while ok he nodded putting the grille down gently on to the table maddy turned to cabot i may not share your faith im sorry about that but whatever truth is in here i believe is profoundly important its the holy grail i know ill treat it with respect i promise you that he lifted his hand slowly you may regret the truth you are about to discover she sighed well well see wont we she turned to sal will you take adam and mr cabot outside sal glanced at the support unit what about becks shes staying a flash of resentment seemed to cross sals face she looked like she wanted to say something maddy could guess what she was thinking youre trusting a robot over me but sal merely nodded beckoned both men to follow her towards the shutter door she cranked the shutter doorway up until it was high enough for them to duck under into the night maddy could hear their disgruntled murmuring as they walked together down to the muddy shingle of the river to watch the fishing boats in the harbour opposite becks she said yes im going to open a locked partition on your hard drive maddy trawled her own mind for those three words and then realized they were there in her head ready and waiting right listen to me ipad caveman breakfast beckss eyes lost their focus for a moment then almost immediately her body posture changed reset no longer the acquired modest stance of a noble lady instead she stood legs planted hands by her side like a marine on parade then she smiled faintly acknowledged the locked partition is now accessible good she looked down at the wooden box on the end of the table and carefully lifted the hinged lid inside she saw the roll of parchment and the wooden tip of its spindle she felt her heart quicken her breath catch this is the holy grail she found herself almost whispering as she lifted it carefully out and rested it on the table do you understand how to decode it becks nodded of course i have access to the rest of the data on my hard drive her left eyebrow cocked jayzus im not stupid maddy laughed no need to guess who shed been spending too much time with carefully she turned the scrolls spindle and gently pulled the brittle parchment down the table until finally almost long enough to overhang the end it was entirely unravelled just like the treyarch there were margin illuminations down both sides but this time much less elaborate simple crosses the crossswipe of a nib in dark ink there to mark the beginnings and endings of different meaningless passages she spotted what looked like sections of latin at least she recognized letters from the latin alphabet she looked again at the margin markings crosses every now and then on both sides she reached across the table for the template theyd cut from the treyarch and lined up the top right corner of it with the first cross in the righthand margin the top lefthand corner of their grille lined up with a cross on the left margin but it was several inches too short for the bottom corners to line up with the next margin crosses she looked down at the hundreds of squares cut in the parchment seeing the slanted strokes of the grail writing through the windows one or two letters seemed to line up to be perfectly framed but the majority of windows showed letters half in half out not here then said maddy beckss eyes ran systematically down the cross markings in the left margin she stepped slowly down the length of the kitchen table comparing measurements by eye it should be placed here she said finally pointing towards two crosses the gap between these is precisely twentyseven inches the grille is also twentyseven inches in length becks quickly examined the next cross marker down the left margin this is also spaced by twentyseven inches maddy stepped down her side of the table with the grille in hand and carefully lined up the top right and top lefthand corners she spread her hand across the parchment holding down the corners at the bottom that desperately wanted to curl up again oh my god it lines up she said quietly she looked across the grille and found herself holding her breath every small rectangular cutout in their grille perfectly framed a single letter she lifted the grille away looked again at the grail document and saw endless spidery lines of handwriting none of the letters seeming to stand out none asking for specific attention and all of it unintelligible she rested the grille back down again carefully lining the corners up once more you ready to know maddy ready to find out what pandora is supposed to mean the question frightened her no she wasnt ready she knew the story of pandoras box the young woman pandora who wanted to know the secrets within a box perhaps little different to the one sitting open on the end of their table but once the box was opened all manner of evil spilled out that she could never put back inside again theres a reason this code word is pandora right maybe it was something that would be harmful to know something that could hurt her destroy her hurt the others she looked at becks who watched her silently waiting for instructions i im not sure i want to read this said maddy why im scared becks looked confused it is just data knowledge all information is tactically useful well im not so sure sometimes knowing something isnt so good you know becks said nothing look i god i wish foster was here or even liam she decided after all they were one and the same werent they no not the same foster was liam but with a lifetime of knowledge a lifetime of experience one day liam was going to become that old man but he wasnt there yet she could imagine liam standing here impatiently fidgeting with frustration while she dithered like this i want you to read it she said finally decode the whole thing becks nodded when youre done i want you to come and get me and ill passwordlock your hard drive again understood yes of course maddy and when you come for me becks do not tell me anything about the message is that perfectly clear i dont i dont want to know yet this is perfectly clear maddy sighed whatever message was on this table would be safe on beckss harddrive mind for now she decided she needed fosters advice before she opened that mind better still she could bring becks with her to the park find foster sitting beside that hotdog stand and feeding the pigeons then they could both listen to it together that was it she realized she didnt want the burden of knowledge to be sitting on her shoulders alone shed already done enough of that you know what to do becks nodded ill be outside then with the others chapter nottingham oh jeeezz this is it this is it liam felt bile roll up his throat as his stomach did its best to jettison the last meal hed had he spat it out along with the mouthful of grit hed breathed in they are coming said bob standing beside him he had a shield strapped tightly to the stump of his upper left arm he flexed it it functioned almost as well as if hed had a whole arm to use he flourished the long blade of a broadsword in his right hand as he took several steps up the mound of loose rubble and fallen stone into the swirling eddies of dust liam could hear the excited roar of richards army racing heavily across the arrowstrewn ground outside towards the breached wall it sounded like a locomotive coming down a track the jangle of hundreds of harnesses swinging the clatter of chain mail men jogging as best they could under their bodyweight again in armour the inexperienced men of nottinghams garrison standing either side of him looked anxiously at liam young boys old men whod done little more than drill with wooden swords come on dont chicken out on me now he commanded his quivering legs liam raised his heavy blade above his head forward he picked his way up jagged boulders of shattered and sharpedged flint to join bob standing at the very top of the recently formed mound of masonry and in that moment the roiling dust finally blew aside before them closing the distance of several dozen yards of already flattened arid grass the front rank of richards army thundered towards them a sea of different colours the coats of arms and livery of a dozen or more noble families a juddering line of sunburnt and bearded faces split uniformly by mouths open stretched wide and roaring as the arid tufted ground between them narrowed all too quickly heres all that history foster promised youd get to see liam right up close he braced his shield arm in front of him and looked to his right bob standing protectively beside him a threefootwide immovable wall of chain mail and muscle bob im scared he muttered hoping his voice carried no further than his support unit remain close rumbled bob he looked down at liam his round tufted coconut head lost inside a coif of chain mail grey eyes and thickbridged nose lost in the shadow of his helmet remain close to me and you will be fine liam oconnor the front rank was clambering up the clattering mound of masonry arrows from civilian archers posted on the walls either side of the breach finding targets amid the solid mass of men liam had time enough to draw in one last ragged puff of air before he felt the terrific jarring impact of something against the edge of his shield the vibration running painfully up his arm and almost knocking the breath from him he instinctively ducked his head below the crinkled rim of his shield and blindly swung his sword downwards it bounced with a heavy ring off something to his left one of his men one of his recruited garrison a man perhaps only five years older grinned at him showing no more than a handful of yellowing teeth framed by a blond beard he swung his sword down on to the man in front of him its edge biting the curve between shoulder and neck dark blood arced into the air as he yanked his sword free liam felt his shield suddenly lurch downwards he saw the fingers of a hand clad in a thick leather glove on the rim yanking it roughly down and outward caught unawares liam found his left hand losing its grip on the shields handle jayzus no his shield clattered on to the rubble at his feet and he had only the briefest moment to register the florid hot face of the man in front of him a face he was never going to forget he was sure as long as he lived this man was destined to live on in his nightmares liams response was ungainly and entirely reflexive a lunge of desperate panic now that his shield had been ripped away and he felt naked and exposed despite his thick leather quilted underlay and the heavy mail on top of it in the terrible slowmotion of heightened awareness he saw the heavy blade of his sword swing down and bite deep into the side of the mans neck time seemed to slow down to almost a complete stop as their eyes met the mercenarys cornflower blue wide with surprise slowly realizing that the blade lodged in his neck signalled the moment his life had come to an end the noise of battle going on around them seemed to be a hundred miles away all liam could hear was the roaring of blood through his veins the hammer thump of his heart the sound of his panting breath in his ears and this man before him now spitting dark gouts of crimson from his mouth and gurgling something a defiant curse a last prayer liam found himself mouthing imsosorry to him as if the dying man would actually understand might even forgive him then the moment was gone slowmotion back to normal speed liams ears once again filled with the sound of grunts and cries scraping and battering clang of metal on metal the man with cornflowerblue eyes grabbed a firm hold of the blade with both hands as if he was attempting to pull it out of him but his strength was fast bleeding out and liam watched the man i just killed slowly collapse to his knees in front of him then fall backwards disappearing amid the churning quagmire of struggling bodies taking liams sword with him liam found himself emptyhanded as another thickset and redfaced man sweating under forty pounds of mail armour took his place liam cursed as the man grinned at his good fortune and pulled back to skewer him on the tip of his halberd liams face screwed up with anticipation his arms held out in front of him in a vain attempt to fend off the point but then all of sudden he felt himself being lifted off the ground by the scruff of his mail vest and tossed backwards down the clattering pile of rubble towards the marketplace he cracked the side of his head on the sharp rim of a jagged piece of masonry it left him stunned his ears ringing he watched dark shapes stepping over him clambering up the slope to join the press of men in the breach further above the darting flicker of arrows heading into and out of the city and high up in the rich blue sky a pair of swallows chasing each other in slow playful circles oblivious to the carnage beneath them a face full of bristles and a mouth containing a solitary tooth leaned over him ye alroight down there sire liam vaguely recognized the face as one of nottinghams blacksmiths he nodded a rough hand grasped his and pulled him up on to legs that wobbled uncertainly ii lost my weapon and my shield he said not to worry the man grinned therell be plenty more to pick up soon enough sire he said then turned away scrambling up the gravel to join the thick ruck of men fighting to hold the breach at the top liam thought he caught sight of bob the back of his head his broad shoulders one arm swinging a longhandled axe to and fro like a scythe his head was swimming with pain a sharp stabbing agony that almost made it impossible to gather together a single coherent thought but he just about managed one when the hells becks coming back john watched the distant struggle from the balcony of the keeps great hall from this far away the squirming press of men looked like insects fighting over a dung hill every last man of the garrison was over there and a good proportion of the towns menfolk all fighting for their town and fighting for me he felt sick of his weakness his cowardice the sight of blood had always left him in a cold dread you have not the heart of a king thats why you shall never be one something richard had once said to him back when their father had been alive perhaps you are right john whispered miserably and yet he thought hed caught a glimpse of something inside himself perhaps courage was too grand a word for it but it was a firmness of resolve perhaps even a hint of defiance as hed parlayed with richard earlier i was strong then was i not strong he stroked his beard absently with a hand that trembled like an autumn leaf ready to take flight on a fresh breeze no you are just a weak fool he answered himself sire john looked over his shoulder to see one of the keeps squires standing beside the drapes a palefaced effeminate man in expensive linens sire should we should we not close the castles gates should they break through we would be safe in the castle a while longer john felt something deep inside him turn away in disgust no he said finally have you a sword and mail the squires eyes rounded sire you heard ii i suppose i have somewhere then fetch it ffetch it ssire yes john took a deep breath to steady the timbre of his voice we shall be joining them chapter new york maddy leaned against the crumbling brick wall of their transplanted archway watching the others standing over on the grasstufted hummocks of silt along the east river madelaine she turned round to see becks standing in the opening beneath the fully raised shutter you all done becks nodded an affirmative if i lock your harddrive partition again what you know what youve just read its all gonna be safe in there right that is correct maddy nodded thoughtfully no one else would know what secret message was hidden in the grail not even becks herself shed already made her mind up on the matter she was going to unlock beckss partition with foster present theyd both hear what she had to say and then together figure out what it meant what theyd have to do about it if anything ready to lock that information away affirmative she uttered the three words quietly becks blinked several times then cocked her head her voice immediately returned to its softer more feminine tone i register thirtyseven minutes of absent data maddy raised her hand its ok ive been talking with your alter ego becks consulted something inside her mind my codewordlocked partition yup maddy looked at the others you decoded the holy grail successfully its now safely locked away in your head maddy laughed not even you can get in there becks nodded approvingly a sensible precaution maddy she was about to say a thankyou when she heard sals voice calling out she could just make out her small outline in the twilight turning away from the river towards her whats up she called out she replied something but a sudden freshening breeze carried it away ripples of cats paws danced across the mirrorsmooth water towards them as a fresh breeze stirred the millpond calm somethings coming our way maddy looked at the sky and saw it what looked like a rolling stormfront rushing towards them from out of the atlantic ocean hurry she shouted at sal sal in turn beckoned the other two men to hasten after her up the shingle towards their jagged brick bunker perched among the sandy dunes their feet clattered off soft sand on to the broken fragments of pavement and alleyway that had transported to this reality along with the archway just as the black stormcloud rolled over manhattan island tis the lords coming gasped cabot sombrely no said sal just a time wave among the churning black clouds crossing the river towards them maddy thought she saw a dozen different city skylines flicker over manhattan one moment towering pointed church steeples topped with cruciforms that reached for the sky then the next they formed into the rounded bulge of mosques and onionshaped minarets topped with crescents my god do you see that said adam his voice competing with a growing thundering boom wind danced around them stinging their cheeks with whippedup sand as they stood in the opening to the archway watching the world in flux and then the wall of undulating reality was upon them a moment of pitchblack as the tidal wave swept over and then it was gone the archway was entirely dark and lifeless then a moment later a light winked on inside and they heard the soft chug of the generator starting up in the back room outside it was a calm evening once more the gentle lapping of low tide punctuated by the lonely plaintive call of a solitary seagull either side of her maddy heard both adam and cabot gasping cabot the worst of the two god help me he gasped did i just witness the devils work a reality shift said becks events in the past have changed the present maddy looked at the island of manhattan the lights of the fishing boats had gone the lights of the town beyond gone instead she could only make out a thick dark treeline descending down to the waters edge theres nothing there now just woods said sal maddy bit her lip becks yes what on earth was going on when you left the twelfth century king richard was preparing to take the town of nottingham from his brother oh great snapped maddy is that like ourfault no said adam that actually happened well somethings still wrong back then the holy scroll thing sal pointed towards the table maybe we hung on to it too long yes maddy nodded yeah youre probably right we should get it back asap but is that right said adam does richard get his hands on the holy grail you know in correct history maddy shook her head i dont know but it sure shouldnt be here in the twentyfirst century it goes missing it gets lost adam stepped back towards the table thats how this becomes the stuff of myth and legends thats why people ended up thinking it was the cup of christ it gets lost right maybe we should just you know rip it up offered sal they all stared in a prolonged silence at the unrolled parchment beneath the glare of the light above it king richard would kill his brother said cabot finally if he does not get what hes come for the old man shook his head his anger he would kill everyone in nottingham that doesnt happen said adam not in proper history the siege of nottingham lasts just a few days john surrenders and richard forgives him cabot looked at him ye are certain oh yeah johns forgiven in fact he gets to be king when richard dies several years later then richard must get what he wanted said maddy the grail right he gets it hes a happy boy john is forgiven but sal glanced at the table but isnt there some big secret in there some secret that makes him go and do another one of them crusades which which results in englands complete financial ruin cut in adam and the invasion of the french king philip ii maddy bit her lip with frustration what do we do give it to him or not another long silence all eyes on her waiting for her to make the call no it was becks who spoke finally no she said again no what said maddy impatiently king richard will find nothing in the grail adam suddenly grinned shes right maybe its a maybe it turns out to be a a complete disappointment for him maybe what he ends up with is a useless scroll that he cant decode because because the real grille was always the treyarch confession said maddy adam nodded and perhaps what he has that grille guarded by the knights in acre that was just a red herring a fake maddy gave it a moments thought yes why would there be another key the one richard has is no good we should return it immediately said becks reality is fluctuating sal nodded that last wave was really weird like it couldnt decide which way it wanted to go perchance the battle for nottingham has begun said cabot and tis that the outcome of this battle hangs in the balance maddy wasnt sure if this last time wave actually meant that in fact she wasnt sure what it meant other than history was still somehow derailed but then again maybe the old monk was right after all the correcthistory version of the siege of nottingham hadnt featured a lethal killing machine like bob back there fighting on the side of john ok my minds made up she said becks and you too mr cabot youre taking the grail back and youve got to get it to john to give to king richard somehow make him a happy boy happy enough to let his brother live she bit her lip oh crud is this the right call chapter nottingham liam had managed to work his way up beside bob again armed with another shield and this time an axe both homemade by some artisan blacksmith in between ferocious swings hed managed to tap bob on the shoulder and let him know he was right there and watching his flank in front of bob the descending slope of rubble of the collapsed section of wall was covered in a thick carpet of mangled bodies bludgeoned and cleaved by his swooping axe blade either side of them stood the defenders now mostly the citizens of nottingham dotted with one or two dozen remaining men of the garrison in their burgundy and amber tunics the attackers momentum seemed to have been stalled for the moment the front rank of men decorated with the colours of a dozen different coats of arms began to slowly recede down the ever more cumbersome and slippery mound that led up to the breach liam allowed himself a hope that the attack had faltered that the men of richards gathered army had lost heart already but it was soon obvious that the men had been summoned by the distant call of a horn they were retreating to take a water break he found himself laughing almost hysterically bob glanced at him over his shoulder what is funny its like halftime at a peil ghaelach match snorted liam the flitting of arrows overhead ceased as if archers on both sides had agreed to a temporary truce he could see women and children with buckets slung on yokes over their shoulders moved swiftly among the ranks of richards men as they dipped their helmets and grubby hands in and scooped and sloshed muchneeded water into their mouths and on to their faces from behind liam women also emerged from the market square with buckets and hides full of water which the fighting men eagerly sipped and poured over their heads of course it made sense to him he realized how desperately hot he was under the leather and mail and of course hed only fought briefly water and an agreed break in the hostilities during which it could be distributed was as much a part of the twelfthcentury battlefield as anything else bob he said rapping his knuckles on his back theres water you should get some while you can bob turned round for the first time liam saw the front of the shield strapped to the stump of his left arm jayzus bob you seen that the shield bristled arrows like a hairbrush the enemy archers had been deliberately targeting him several other arrows protruded from the front of his chest oh boy you need to get some of this seen to the damage at this stage is acceptable liam grunted bob i am still at fiftyfive per cent functioning capacity his fat lips spread but you are correct i could do with some water along with the other men they took their turn scooping cooling handfuls of water out of the buckets being passed up to them and it was as bob was glugging water like a thirsty dog after a long walk that liam heard a muted cheer rippling through the crowd gathered in the market square he saw bodies part respectfully and then finally stepping on to the bottom of the mound of broken masonry he recognized john in heavy mail holding a shield bearing the royal crest sire he called out john slowly picked his way up towards him sheriff he finally replied winded from the exertion he gathered his breath before speaking again tis hard enough walking in this let alone climbing the men of the garrison standing nearby respectfully dropped to their knees oh stop that barked john with his best go at heroic bravado save what you have left for the fighting men sire said liam youll be a target so you will he could see how pale john looked trembling inside his mail then said john running a tongue along his dry lips then i shall just have to keep moving wont i a distant horn sounded again and liam saw the women and children moving among richards men scramble at double speed away from the front line towards the tents and marquees on the hillside in front of them almost immediately the flitting of dark arrows resumed peppering the clear sky and the men fifty yards away reformed their lines in preparation for the renewed assault on nottingham chapter new york maddy and adam stared at the monitor while sal helped becks and cabot ready themselves for transport back to what do you mean you cant use beckss timestamp asked maddy there appears to me too much instability to lock on to a reliable window what does that mean reality is fluctuating unreliably between two preferred states it cant make its mind up said adam that is a fair analogy well what do we wait do we risk it we can risk sending them back using beckss timestamp but i cannot anticipate the result of that maddy balled her fist on the desk ok then well how big is this instability please restate the question how far how much time is affected by it what i mean is is it regionalized like a storm or something the fluctuating timelines appear to branch from between seven and nine hours before beckss return timestamp maddy turned round towards the water tube becks was just about to climb the stepladder to get into the water becks what happened seven hours before you left becks stopped consulted her memory precisely seven hours i was walking along a stone passage maddy flapped her hands impatiently or thereabouts anything significant six hours and fortythree minutes prior to the timestamp i scaled the outer wall of the city of nottingham go back a bit becks tilted her head seven hours and three minutes prior to the timestamp i was saying to liam and bob that i would be fine oh come on go back more something significant becks spooled memories silently for a moment then finally her eyes locked on maddys at eight hours and fiftysix minutes prior to the timestamp i was speaking with john what the hell did you say to him exactly her eyelids fluttered a man must find at least one moment in time to make a stand for himself or live a life burning in the flames of regret maddy looked to adam he shrugged its very poetic checking quotation database just a moment she turned back to becks you think thats like changed history somehow i believe it may have inspired him becks replied john was considering immediate surrender to his brother however correct history shows he held out for five days i decided he needed encouragement maddy sighed well guess what looks like it worked quotation source rock band esszed lyrics to song yuh thanks bob so she turned back to becks you think maybe saying that quote to i also offered myself to him sals jaw dropped you mean becks looked down at her marriage if he what showed you he was a big tough man said maddy if he stood up to his brother affirmative maddy shook her head oh well looks like you really encouraged him all right she turned back to the monitor bob what competing histories are we getting out of this no information the fluctuation is too rapid to generate timelines thats why were not getting time waves said adam correct however this oscillating status is unstable and dangerous dangerous maddy pushed up her glasses whats that mean exactly it is a stress factor on the reality wall adam looked at her the reality wall what separates us from chaos space she replied quickly bob then what are we supposed to do the instability may settle itself or it may increase in severity and if it does do that if it gets worse no information no information she howled exasperated well but look its not a good thing right not a good thing there are several essays on chaos space written by r waldstein and e chan in my database can you sum them up chaos space is a dimension where the laws of quantum physics are contradicted theoretically the effect on normal dimensions would be their complete destruction what does that mean like all of earth destroyed negative everything ev everything the entire universe maddy suddenly felt lightheaded and short of breath oh crud oh my god weve weve really messed up her hands scrambled across the clutter on the desk for her inhaler weve maddy adam put a hand on her shoulder maddy come on calm dont lose it she found the inhaler and pulled hard on it several times she doubled over on her seat her head between her knees the wheezing rasp of her contracting throat sounding like a blacksmiths bellows sal was over beside her an arm across her shoulders maddy you ok she shook her head second she wheezed gimme a second adam looked down at her this is all going wrong isnt it this organization of yours its were still learning sal snapped defensively weve been in worse situations she bent down and stroked the hair out of maddys face right maddy weve got out of worse things maddy pulled again on her inhaler then lifted her face yuh still wheezing yeah she said again bob yes maddy becks and cabot have to go back with the grail like right now find us the best window you can as close to the castle as you can affirmative searching but its unstable isnt it said adam your computer was saying theres a risk of sending them theres always a freakin risk maddy uttered wearily she pulled herself up off her elbows and faced the desk again bob come on give me something just a moment searching she checked their displacement machine had charge enough it looked good she turned to sal get them in the water sal go get them ready sal nodded and rushed over to the perspex tube if its unstable what could happen to them asked adam they could end up turned inside out and looking like a bowl of lasagne she replied oh i wish i hadnt asked or worse adam pulled a face worse how could you get worse than that she lowered her voice they could end up stuck in chaos she turned to look at him tell me do you believe in hell he shook his head you kidding i no of course not its an invention of the catholic church just a load of old religious mumbojumbo thats what i used to think but you know i wonder is it the dark dialogue box on the screen in front of them suddenly flickered with the movement of computerbobs cursor i have a candidate timestamp that is currently holding a solid state how long will it last there is no information how long it will last perhaps only seconds activate a tensecond countdown now affirmative she turned to see becks splosh into the water the grail once more in its box the box sealed in a plastic ziploc bag cabot was standing at the top of the stepladder and regarding the chilled water at his toes but please young lady why do we have to get into just get him in shouted maddy above the growing hum of energy building up for a release sal climbed up the steps of the ladder mr cabot you have to get in the water please she spun round to see the countdown on the screen four three two push him in sal nodded and threw her weight behind a hard shove against the monks thighs he teetered for a moment arms cartwheeling for balance before he toppled forward into the tube sending a small tidal wave of water splashing over the side and on to the floor the stepladder wobbled under sals sudden lurching movement and tipped back against the brick wall the legs sliding along the concrete floor dumping her on to a storage shelf full of cables and toolboxes that cascaded down and clattered along with her to the ground just as the displacement machine discharged its energy the perspex tube flexed violently and thudded with a boom as the water cabot and becks vanished back into the twelfth century as sal rolled on the floor among spools of cable and yelping from a sprained wrist and the echo of the flexing boom bounced around their archway slowly fading maddy could only wonder how it was that mankind perhaps even the whole universe had ended up resting its fate in the hands of an amateur little outfit like theirs chapter nottingham they landed within the keeps outer bailey the splash of thirty gallons of water echoing off the tall stone walls cabot landed heavily on his side grunting at the impact on hard cobblestone becks landed on her feet poised and ready for action the keep itself was devoid of any activity a pair of soldiers manning the gatehouse emerged from the cool shadow of the archway to find out what the noise was all about they gazed in bemusement at the old monk and the woman in the leather corset and dark woollen tights where is the earl of cornwall not ere love es fightin one of them answered and then suddenly it occurred to him they might not have his best interests in mind ere ye be spies he barked at them ye stop roight there becks calmly handed cabot the box as he got to his feet and approached the soldiers openhanded and with the most alluring smile she could conjure up let me explain she started to say ten seconds later both men were on their backs one of them out cold the other with a broken wrist becks tossed cabot one of their swords as they jogged out of the keep through the open gatehouse crossing the bridge over the river and following the main dryrutted track through the centre of nottingham towards the marketplace towards the noise of a raging battle in progress the marketplace was filled with the squirming howling wounded men and boys missing limbs heads and faces split open puckered and purple wounds that were clearly mortal children with water and bloodstained rags moved among them providing what comfort they could ignoring the occasional arrows that dropped down into the square and clattered on stone slabs or thudded and embedded themselves into the earth up ahead to the right of the citys gatehouse a seventyfivefootwide breach in the wall was plugged with a rising sea of struggling humanity soldiers and civilians men old and young even some women pressed into one enormous writhing scrum on the walls either side she saw soldiers and citizens firing arrows children hurling stones down at the attackers outside a citywide attempt to defend themselves and a convincing job they seemed to be doing of it thus far the sun was well past midday in the sky and halfway into the afternoon she realized the fluctuating timelines were stemming from this struggle that could go either way even though richards army was far greater than the number of people in nottingham their motivation to fight would be entirely mercenary on the other hand the people of nottingham were fighting for their very lives if they could hold those soldiers in the breach long enough if the battle were to spill into another day and another day quite possibly the assembled nobles with their menatarms might begin to stand down their selfish allegiances to the king softening she scanned the front line of the fighting and quickly spotted the silhouette of bob head and shoulders taller than anyone else she took the wooden box from cabot and tucked it under one arm stay close to me she commanded him before picking her way through the marketplace carpeted with the dead and the dying arrow stems sprouting from the dirt like freshly grown weeds she clambered up the incline of rubble forcefully barging aside tired men from her path scanning faces on both sides looking for liam looking for john she collared a garrison soldier clambering downhill bloodsoaked and exhausted where is the earl of cornwall he shook his head and she realized that over the din of roaring voices and the clatter and ring of blades on shields he could not hear her where is john she bellowed directly into his ear the man pointed a shaking finger uphill he fights alongside us becks pushed past him her feet finding a soft carpet of bodies now that shuddered and twisted underfoot above the din she could hear the bass notes of bobs voice a deep roaring anger that seemed to fill the entire space of the breach like an echo of whale song or the trumpeting of some enraged elephant she picked out his head and shoulders again slow shuddering sweeping movements that told her he was fast on his way to becoming a spent force now exhausted from exertion or loss of blood quite probably both she was nearly at the crest of the small hill of debris and bodies when she heard the sharp peal of a distant horn above the cacophony the clatter and ring of blades almost immediately ceased as both sides of the struggle on the mound halted their melee and disengaged weary catcalls and taunts being exchanged as the men of richards army withdrew to take another water break becks took advantage of the lull in the fight to push her way up the last few yards bob she said he turned slowly his eyes flickered recognition perhaps even relief becks i need to locate john and liam before bob could point them out liams voice rang out becks she turned to see him squeeze past some bloody and grimy men descending the slope to get to the waterbearers he stepped awkwardly over several entangled bodies and then with a careless relief swung his arms round her i thought wed lost you so i did he lowered his voice we thought youd open a window directly after you left she nodded there were difficulties this battle is causing instability she regarded the thick carpet of bodies beyond the city wall you are doing too well liam snorted humourlessly too well youve got to be joking one more push and theyll be through for sure she shrugged perhaps not the light is failing and fighting will cease for the day another day will weaken the attackers resolve and strengthen the defenders morale she caught a glimpse of john looking exhausted and drenched with sweat beneath the weight of his mail and helmet and smeared with drying blood he was talking animatedly with some of the other defenders high on the adrenaline rush sharing the water with them john is in danger of becoming an inspiring leader she tipped her head his way he is becoming strong liam followed her gaze and understood what she was saying this this fight its changing him isnt it changing his destiny she nodded it is causing contamination he noticed the box clasped under her arm youve brought it back does that mean she finished his thought yes it is safe to pass on to richard he will get nothing from it liam could hear cabot talking to john now the old friends embracing then the monk gestured up to the top of the mound towards becks liam saw johns face suddenly crease with relief and joy they made their way up to join them my lady gasped john breathless liam and bob silently looked on in admiration as becks swiftly changed her manner sire she replied softly with a tender restrained smile that lingered just for him sire cut in cabot lady rebecca has it right there he was careful not to say grail in case the word carried down the slope to the others you can now make terms with king richard john sneered i shall not bow down to him to that animal never again becks reached a hand to his face and stroked his cheek my dear you have shown your honour today shown courage you have been strong the king will respect that said cabot ye gave him a good fight sire john spat a mouthful of thick phlegm at the ground i would sooner cut off his hand than kiss his royal ring you have done what was necessary whispered becks now you should make peace with your brother or youll risk dividing this country with a war sire said cabot johns eyes studied them both then he nodded at liam what do you say sheriff you have led well here i would trust your council as well liam wiped grime and sweat from his forehead i think theyre right sire he pressed his lips together nobody else needs to die here today he glanced at the box and you can parlay reasonable terms now sire john stroked his chin thoughtfully for a while but that brother of mine is a danger to this country his endless wars his crusades his obsession with this my lord becks leaned towards him and whispered something in his ear the expression on johns face slowly changed as her lips moved how would you know of such things john quietly replied a moment later she smiled at him you must trust me on this he regarded her in silence for a long while lady rebecca i have never before encountered someone quite so he shook his head struggling to find the right word trust me she whispered again your time will come he clamped his jaw and then finally slowly nodded i will speak with him then chapter nottingham john noted the look of surprise on his older brothers face as he entered the dark gloom of the tent little brother his deep voice growled with amusement you look like you have finally got your hands bloodied in battle john stepped forward he said nothing you surprise me richard laughed finally you seem to have outgrown your wetnurse i suppose because you have at last managed to wield a sword in battle that you consider yourself a man uh richards smile turned to a sneer hardly you are still a snotnosed whelp but i will credit you with taking a first step john met his stern gaze thank you he uttered flatly now richard stood up the matter at hand you have the grail with you john pulled the scroll from a fold in his tunic richard slowly nodded john could see the stretching pink of his lips among the thatch of blond bristles oh yes he whispered you have no idea do you little brother no idea of the power this this yard of parchment conveys it is just words richards deep laugh filled the tent just words he says just words he shook his head you are an imbecile this is a message from god a message given a thousand years ago a message that was always intended for me do you not see the wars i have fought my crusade against the infidels was at the lords bidding he spoke to me told me where to find this message and you thought to steal it from me to use this to bargain with me his face darkened i would happily cut out your tongue little brother pluck your eyes from their sockets and hurl your head into a field for the crows to dine on for your daring to play with my destiny but he smiled but you have shown some spirit in fighting me today i like that he held his hand out towards john now give me the grail and i will consider leniency for you and what of the people of nottingham richards thick eyebrows arched you actually care for those peasants they fought with courage they are no more than farm animals little brother beasts of burden they fight because they are commanded to fight no more brave than a horse that charges because its rider has kicked its flanks i am asking for leniency for them their king has returned richard snapped irritably those those vermin dared to challenge my authority a few hundred of their heads on spikes lining the road into nottingham will ensure i have no more nonsense like this to deal with john felt his resolve weaken but they were merely defending their homes give me the grail push him not too far he might still decide to have your head richards outstretched fingers wriggled the grail now john clasped it more tightly give me give me richards eyes widened give me you say give me i will give you exactly what i decide to give you and if it is your life then it is only because it is because it is not wise for the common folk to see royal blood spilled john could see his brother struggling to control a burning rage a pinkness in his cheeks a throbbing vein across his forehead push him more and he might strike your head off right now john felt whatever strength hed entered the tent with ebb quickly away i i insist i have your word there will be no example made of them richards eyes narrowed do not anger me further little brother he said quietly i have been patient enough with you john quickly held the scroll towards the candle burning on the table in the centre of the tent stop yelled richard i will burn it brother i will richards wideeyed stare flickered from the candle to the edge of the parchment mere inches away his face darkened with rage his lips twitched his hands slowly reaching for the sword beneath his cape then like sun piercing through scudding grey clouds his demeanour changed he suddenly laughed good god youve grown some fighting spirit john held the scroll where it was so be it you will have my word nottingham will not be punished richard slowly shook his head they will not john felt his guts loosen he struggled to keep a gasp of relief inside him then you can have your piece of parchment he said as calmly as he could manage he held it out towards king richard richard took it from him unravelled several inches of it to be sure it was the grail he examined it in silence for a moment before carefully rolling it up again as king my word is of course law said richard you will honour that he nodded i will now kneel and kiss my hand john steadied himself with a deep breath then stooped to hold richards proffered hand you are going to see little brother the making of one kingdom stretching from this miserable wet island of england to jerusalem one kingdom under god under me john struggled to suppress a wry smile on his own face as he pursed his lips thered been something about lady rebeccas whispered assurance an assurance about things yet to be something in the way she said it that he could actually believe it to be true the grail will give him nothing john and you will be king in less than five years kiss my hand commanded richard yes yes of course muttered john chapter new york adam stood beside sal and gazed out at the darkness america at least what they could see of it a dark wilderness of tall cedar trees beneath a clear night sky and a crescent moon that gazed down at its own shimmering reflection on the gently rippling surface of the east river its like its just how i imagine america must have looked before columbus first landed adam whispered out there somewhere there must be tribes of native americans running around free and living just as they were back in the fifteenth century sal nodded i like it like this no people so maddy said you came from yeah tell me whats it like she shrugged crowded busy noisy at least where we lived it was is there any really cool you know technology like i dunno flying cars or something sal snorted no its all rickshaws and battered old nanos the airs thick with toxins and stuff and there were the troubles in the north troubles terrorists bombs things werent so good with talibanpakistan my father worried about what was going to happen in india what with that and the flooding areas and migrants they listened to the woods the call of a heron the lapping of the river up the shingle banks nearby the future doesnt sound so great said adam uhuh i remember everything felt so so she struggled to find a word that worked so temporary like you couldnt really get used to anything because you knew it wasnt going to last forever sheesh thats my future too then twentyfive years from now he did a quick sum ill be fiftytwo fiftythree then i wonder if ill still be in new york new yorks not so good she replied they started evacuating parts of it flooding uhhuh and growing crime and food riots and stuff like we were having in mumbai jesus adam sighed you make the future sound depressing sorry she replied softly no not your fault sal thanks for you know being honest about it he pursed his lips makes you wonder why you bother doing anything if thats how it all goes like why am i bothering with my consulting job saving up for a retirement that sounds like well a nightmare its only a nightmare for the poor she replied for those with lots of money its just sal hesitated sal what is it she looked at him i think theres a big wave coming she leaned around and ducked her head under the shutter maddy time wave big one maddy pulled herself off the bunk and staggered blearyeyed to join them in the doorway there it is said sal pointing east a dark wall approached like last time rolling in from the atlantic looking like a mountain range advancing rapidly towards them better come inside so youre not right on the edge of the concrete maddy said pointing at the crumbling edge of the field offices forcefield effect adam and sal shuffled quickly inside and crouched on the floor just inside the archway here it comes uttered maddy just hope this one gets us back adam watched the churning black wall approach like a tsunami blotting out the sky the stars the crescent moon i wonder whether wed be better hanging on to this he said nodding at the wilderness given how it all goes in the future too late said sal the time wave rolled over manhattan and the distant tall trees quivered and shook and vanished and swirled into a maelstrom of flickering possibilities as the wave swept across the broad river adam thought he saw the ghostly outline of skyscrapers forming then with a fresh gust of wind pushed before it the wave was over them a destructive tornado passing momentarily overhead eating up reality that shouldnt be and laying down in its wake reality that should and then as soon as it had arrived it was gone outside a cobbled street littered with plastic bags and several wheeled dustbins and the ambient noises of new york sal was the first to step out she looked to her left towards the river and nodded yeah she said looks like were back home adam and maddy joined her manhattan glistened flickered shimmered in the night the sky punctuated with the faroff winking lights of commercial airliners coming in to jfk and laguardia a distant police siren the booming of someones sound system a monday night in new york still very much alive noisy and busy even approaching midnight i better go check our database and see if historys properly back said maddy sal and adam watched the night in silence for a while i kind of liked manhattan the way it just was said adam uhhuh said sal sadly me too chapter kirklees priory yorkshire it was a cool morning for a change the clear blue sky with its relentlessly hot sun was tucked away behind a skein of combedout clouds that looked thicker towards the west cabot looked out of the stable across the priorys parched vegetable gardens looks like rain is coming that is good liam admired the old mans calming air of common sense amid all the things that had gone on he was so very easily able to come back to his priory to resume a role of quiet contemplation and address the practical matters of their small order when will ye leave asked cabot soon replied liam bob and becks have a device in their heads that sort of does them in if they stay in a place for too long times nearly up isnt it bob nodded remaining mission time thirtyseven hours fortythree minutes a window will open just before that time runs out said liam unless we signal the field office to open one up sooner suggestion said becks it is not necessary to communicate again the window in thirtyseven hours will be adequate agreed said bob liam nodded fine then were in no hurry the siege at nottingham had ended peaceably although the citizens of the town had been quaking in fear at what king richard would do to them he had surprised them all with his unexpected leniency thered been some grumbling among the assembled army and their controlling barons earls and dukes whod all been assuming theyd get a share of the towns loot john had been sent with an escort of soldiers to london officially pardoned by richard but perhaps not entirely trusted by him rumour was john was going to be kept in the tower for an undefined period as a punishment becks had been allowed to visit him one last time before he was despatched south she said he appeared to be relieved to still have his head on his shoulders he also appears to be exhibiting a different behavioural pattern shed reported after seeing him liam had asked her to describe it he no longer shakes his atrest heart rate is within normal parameters she replied coolly liam had laughed at that shed managed to take his pulse as theyd embraced one last time i believe hed make a good king cabot had said he may not ever be a great commander of soldiers but he has other qualities worth speaking of prudence caution compassion compassion liam wondered now perhaps history was going to judge john harshly he was destined to be known as englands worst king the king unable to hold on to the french territories his much braver older brother fought so hard to keep hold of the king who signed the magna carta granting legal rights to its subjects but only because of the pressures put on him by englands valiant nobles there was a correct history and it seemed like theyd managed to restore it but liam couldnt help wondering if this correct history as it was recorded in history books and encyclopedias was a true reflection of the past a part of him was always going to wonder if the signing of the magna carta signing away the most powerful privileges of the monarch was really the result of nobles fighting for the rights of their peasants or whether it was in fact king johns idea a gratitude to the common people of nottingham for fighting for him liam beckss voice cut through his musings uh liam bob and i have one remaining mission task liam looked at her at bob what now bob answered the voynich manuscript dates from this time it has yet to be written we have to write it said becks his jaw sagged open hold on are you youre saying this voynich thing was was originally written by us becks nodded yes it was written by us to ensure we visited this time this place liam frowned trying to put the circular logic together but does that mean weve been here before he scratched at his temple where a thin plume of grey hair grew it could mean that at some point in time one or more of us has been here before to seed the voynich manuscript said bob you mean one of us will come here correct since we have no knowledge of it this has yet to happen but but that means deliberately altering history right the very thing were supposed to be preventing his brows knitted with confusion hang on does that mean those clues that the adam fella spotted those are clues that were deliberately seeded to ensure adam lewis alone was able to identify and decode a specific portion of the voynich manuscript in order to flag our attention said bob that is now no longer required becks continued the voynich manuscript must be written without those coded flags uh but we no longer need to be alerted and brought to this place said bob he turned to becks this is also your conclusion she nodded i concur history is corrected it is now an unacceptable historical contaminant for any of the voynich to be translated so whatre you going to write asked liam i have detailed visual records of the document i can duplicate it as it was but without the south american characters that originally flagged adam lewiss attention so that means liam frowned as he worked the logic through hell have never known about us affirmative and of course never have tracked us down to new york right he looked across at cabot sitting on a wooden bucket looking almost as bemused at the exchange as liam felt and what about our good friend here mr cabot cabot smiled aye i was wondering when ye would be considering me both becks and bob looked at him dispassionately no said liam youre not going to kill him so help me we couldnt have fixed this all up without the fellas help youre not going to hurt him and thats an order to both of you both support units calmly nodded termination in this instance will not be necessary said bob cabot is required to ensure the safekeeping of the document agreed said becks so long as you do not speak of all the things you have seen she said looking at cabot pointedly liam realized she was right the old man had gone through with her to the twentyfirst century god knows what he must have seen but then liam imagined little of what he saw must have made sense little of what he saw and heard could be of any use to him cabot scratched his beard and who would believe what i have seen they will call me a fool shes right said liam we still need you to mind the voynich manuscript it has to stay with you alone you cant tell anyone about any of this fear not liam he laughed gently i have no desire to be burned as a heretic i will not talk of round worlds or days yet to be or a place called new york ye can trust in that liam smiled and offered his hand its a deal then mr cabot he grasped it a deal liam of connor becks and bob both stood up at the same time liam guessed they must have been quietly exchanging data you two all right we should proceed with creating the voynich manuscript said becks it is two hundred and thirtyfour pages of manuscript and will require approximately seven hours to duplicate she turned to cabot i will require parchment and ink do you have these things cabot nodded we have the priorys librarian will not be a happy man but i shall see to it thanks said liam the three of them watched the old man go we can trust him he said we know where to locate him if a contamination originates from this point said bob he is an acceptable risk said becks and terminating him would be simple liam shook his head at them you really do make a charming couple so you do they both looked at each other then back at him please explain liam waved that away never mind chapter new york yeah the film posters gone said sal standing outside the golden screen cinema and studying the billboards whats that she said into her cell phone several yellow taxis lined up on the far side of th avenue were honking at a delivery truck backing into a side road yeah im positive no sign of it nothing on the coming soon list its gone she nodded several times at maddys instructions then hung up she looked around this was tuesday morning as she knew it she was out and about a little earlier than normal but it all looked as she expected it to look times square hummed with life the sky a deep welcoming blue and no sign of this movie the manuscript it was gone the tiny ripple theyd felt just half an hour ago had been adam lewiss claim to fame being subtly erased from history no film starring leonardo dicaprio on the run from sinister agents and clutching an ancientlooking scroll in one fist she suddenly felt a rumble in her stomach and realized she hadnt eaten a thing since yesterday lunchtime she checked her watch it was am an hour and twentytwo minutes to go until tuesday turned into its regularly scheduled horror show time enough to go for a bottle of soda and a cream cheese bagel maddy tapped her phone and put it down on the desk its gone adam she said the movie about you and the voynich well it never happened he ran a hand through his hair what does that mean though have i been deleted from the world or something his eyes widened with a horrible thought oh god is there another different me out there somewhere no she shook her head no its ok just the one you but your lifes a different one now thats all if the wave had come while youd been standing outside you wouldnt know any different youd be off living that life wherever it is but because you were inside our field it means youve got to go out and track your new life down find out what it is where it is i thats you telling me i might not be living in new york any more maddy shrugged i dunno you could be you might be living back in england who knows he pulled his apartment key out of his jacket pocket youre saying if i go back to my apartment it might not be mine ive no idea probably not he looked like he was struggling with the idea of that your life is probably going to be very different adam you should go and find out what it is maybe call your mom and dad youve got parents right he shrugged i did god knows if i do now call them talk to them find out who you are she laughed softly not unkindly theyll probably think youve gone mad though you can say that again adam stood up uncertainly grabbed his expensive suit jacket draped over the back of an armchair its been a weird twentyfour hours hasnt it she nodded very weird i feel i feel like ive known you and sal and the others for ages but i knocked on that shutter just a day ago she smiled sadly thats time travel messes your head up he looked at her could i not stay the question caught her unawares a part of her longed to say yes to have someone she could share the leadership role with to have someone she could offload on to to confide in to he cant stay maddy you know that adam i uh i dont think so im not sure i have the authority the right to be recruiting people but he said coyly surely i know too much now ive got to be some kind of a security risk better for me to join you chaps right than be out there you know blabbing about all the stuff ive seen i dont think youll blab adam i trust you anyway if you come back here on wednesday with a film crew in tow youll simply find us gone he hesitated staring at her as a long and uncomfortable drawnout silence filled the space between them all right he nodded finally awkward a little embarrassed ok well i thought id ask you know if you dont ask you dont get right she felt she owed him something of an explanation im sorry the three of us are still new here were still just trying to figure out whether were doing our jobs right and i just dont think im meant im allowed to be signing anyone else up for the cause no thats fine sorry i uh i asked he stepped across to the computer table to collect his hard drive ok for me to take it back she considered that for a moment his work on decoding the voynich was on there his photographs of stones in the kirklees priory graveyard were on there but then none of it would mean much to anyone now she nodded sure he picked it up and tucked into the pocket of his jacket i suppose this is goodbye then she pressed her lips together holding back an urge to change her mind to tell him he could stay yes its goodbye adam she said eventually his feet clacked across the concrete towards the door and he pressed the green button the shutter rattled up letting daylight creep in across the archway he turned round maybe one day i can write a book about it as long as you call it fiction she smiled become an author why not sounds like a great idea he ducked down to go under and looked outside lovely day out there he was about to step out when she called out adam yes your new life im pretty sure it wont involve you working in the world trade center she looked briefly down at her watch just listen you dont need to go looking there this morning ok go call your folks first thing forget about going to work will do promise me he looked back at her made a face confused all right i promise go on said maddy she found her voice catching she didnt need him to hear that to see that there was a struggle going on inside her head go on and find what your new life is say goodbye to sal for me he said then he ducked outside and she watched the grey flannel of his office trousers walk up the cobbled backstreet and out of sight take care adam she whispered chapter kirklees priory yorkshire they stood amid the waisthigh field listening to the hiss of a thousand ears of barley swaying in the gentle breeze becks handed cabot an armful of sheets of parchment this is the complete duplication with several minor alterations you must look after it keep it safe sebastien cabot nodded dutifully i will we have a crypt below the priory i will see to it that it is stored there that is good liam stepped forward mr cabot we we owe you our thanks the old man grinned aye tis been a a truly fascinating few months that much is for sure he held a hand out to liam i have learned so very much perhaps too much my my faith has been troubled well liam grasped his hand if its any help despite all the things i know and all the things ive seen i still pray to the fella upstairs when im in a tight spot that is cabot nodded there is comfort in that liam thank ye information tachyon particles detected said becks the soft tones of a court maiden shed used just for john dispensed with for now she turned to regard the circle of low stalks in the field clipped down close to the ground from the last time the portal had opened here stand back she cautioned a moment later their loose robes fluttered in the gentle gust of displaced air and they were staring at the undulating sphere of the portal im sorry mr cabot i would invite you to come along with us but cabot shook his head tis a world i think that would send me mad anyway he held the parchment out i have a duty here do i not liam nodded aye thats true we must go now said bob he stepped towards the portal then stopped turned and offered his one good hand to cabot a pleasure working with you mr cabot cabot grasped his large hand and ye truly i have never seen a man as indestructible as ye i would not be surprised if the superstitious folk in these parts tell fireside stories about ye bob long after yeve gone bob worked on a smile and let his hand go becks was the last to bid him farewell if you ever see john again tell him she hesitated unsure how to complete the sentence shall i tell him that ye think fondly of him that ye have returned to france she nodded affirmative that would be an appropriate message to convey the portal still shimmered impatiently inviting them through we should go said bob it is unwise to open nondimensional space longer than necessary becks released the old mans hand and joined bob and liam at the edge of the sphere take good care of it said liam cabot nodded and watched as the three of them stepped into the churning perimeter their solid outlines becoming wavering phantoms lost in a swirling dim world then with a soft puff the portal closed leaving him alone once more in the swaying field of barley he looked up at some crows circling above the trees now beginning to turn from their rich summer green to the golden hues that beckoned harvest time the stifling warmth of summer was soon going to give way to fresher winds he sniffed the summer scent with his florid nose and found himself considering an idea so the world is round now is it the thought placed the hint of a smile on his craggy face a vaguely reassuring notion that he looked up at the sun in the sky and ye stay put do ye its us that wanders round ye again a strangely comforting idea that gods works might be far larger far greater than this one little world full of greedy and insane barons princes kings and popes chapter new york sal watched the twisting coiling outline of several figures embracing one another she thought she could make out a swaying field of yellow wheat or maize and a blue sky then the figures three of them stepped closer and emerged a moment later into the archway she almost didnt recognize two of them bobs fastgrowing coconut hair was a shaggy coarse dark wild bush the other thing she immediately noticed was that his left arm was missing at the elbow and one ear was gone shaddyah bob but liam it was liam she almost could have passed him by in a street and not have recognized him his dark hair had grown uncut for six months it hung down on to his shoulders parted scruffily in the middle it draped either side of his face like dark theatre curtains it was his wispy beard however that shocked her a jaw lined with bristles across his top lip a downy moustache his mouth framed by a goatee liam maddy balled a fist in her mouth oh my god liam you look she didnt know what to say scruffy he arched his thick eyebrows that the word youre lookin for he grinned and stepped over towards them wrapping one arm round each of them pulling them all together in a clumsy bearhug ahh tis good to see ye so it is maddy laughed you sound all funny he let them both go and stood back aye tis the old anglish so ill be back to meself soon enough love your gear said sal admiring his studded leather jerkin cotton hose and boots aye they are well made maddy looked bob over bob the arm can you be fixed up like becks was affirmative i will need the growth tube she turned to the monitors bob can you set that up affirmative maddy the cursor blinked for a moment then skittered along welcome back bob and becks both support units silently acknowledged that with a wifi handshake wheres that english fella adam asked liam hes gone said maddy gone back to his life was adam lewis realigned asked becks maddy knew what she was asking had he been outside when the last minor time wave came through was his memory wiped clean was he adam lewis living a very different life she decided to keep matters simple for now after all she trusted him sort of and even if he did decide to rush to the nearest newspaper with his fantastic story who was going to believe him anyway if he led a curious journalist back to the archway this time tomorrow thered be nothing to see just a vacant archway beneath the williamsburg bridge yeah dont worry hes aligned becks nodded satisfied with the answer liam clasped his hands together so its been a long while since i had a nice hot shower maddy wrinkled her nose uhhuh we noticed why dont you and becks get changed into something less fancydress and head over to the dropin centre shower block liam nodded aye sounds like a plan and when youre done well go out and get something to eat she looked at bob you too we can growthtube you afterwards if youd like bobs thick lips slowly stretched with what looked like something approaching a mischievous grin aye sounds like a plan maddy rolled her eyes and looked at liam i see hes growing a funnybone too liam shrugged right pair of jesters so they are adam stood at the intersection of bowery and delancey street busy with this mornings rushhour traffic a new life and he hadnt the first clue what it was yet his mobile phone was in his jacket pocket maybe maddy was right maybe he should dial up mum whatever new course his professional life had taken she and dad were still likely living in their old bungalow in chelmsford and what do i say exactly hey mum ive just come from another timeline where am i living right now am i married what job do i do he chuckled at the thought of that but then he realized the cell probably wouldnt work its contract would never have existed the sim cards code number would be invalid a new life and yet new york looked exactly the same as it did this time yesterday he couldnt quite believe his apartment would no longer be his that jerry the security guard wouldnt have a clue who he was he looked to his left the tall skyscrapers along wall street the twin towers standing proud thrusting into the cloudless sky he pulled his trade center security pass out of his breast pocket and gazed at his passport photo a daft grinning face above a crisp shirt and tie if maddy was right this pass wasnt even going to get him past reception on his floor let alone allow him to enter the it room and his personal office and his apartment keys he pulled them out and jangled them in one hand somebody elses home now he shook his head it was too damned strange too weird standing here in a wholly unchanged world unchanged except that adam lewis was living a very different life in it mission control to adam what if she made that up he didnt believe maddy carter would she seemed the genuine type ok then adam how about this what if you just dreamed this all up eh what if this has all been a hallucination what if youve turned into a loony the thought of that sent a chill down his spine it happened he told himself all that timetravel stuff happened im not a bloody loony only one way to find out then old son hmmm he looked at the twin towers then glanced at his watch it was just gone eight in the morning maybe he should at least check walk in and swipe his card at the reception desk see what happened if it let him through then it meant his old life was still there the wellpaid consultancy job the fancy riverside apartment the exclusive gym membership it just meant hed had one helluva hallucination and of course it means you might need to go and see a head doctor he laughed at that a therapist crazy maybe this whole thing had been some sort of trip maybe hed had a little too much to drink last night maybe someone had slipped something funny in his drink only one way to find out mission control said again he tucked his keys back in his pocket and turned left heading down bowery towards the world trade center he figured half an hour from now he was going to be behind his desk again and wondering where the hell hed got the fanciful idea from that hed actually spent the night in a dingy brick archway with a team of timetravelling kids crazy chapter new york monday time cycle i know maddy wanted that adam to stay i think she really liked maybe fancied him or something he could have stayed though we could have fitted him in somehow at least hes got his life back now lucky him i wonder what hes doing now where he is probably back in england anyway bobs busy growing an arm and liams shaved his head short i dont like it he looks more like a coconut than bob does oh and the beards gone liam used an electric shaver for the first time in his life said the thing scared him half to death he thought it was going to eat his face off im glad hes lost the beard it made him look so much older that and his bit of white hair he was looking like an oldie at least now he looks more like himself but jahulla he is definitely older he doesnt look like the boy i saw when i first woke up hes changed somehow the eyes maybe old before they should be sal put down the pen and took in the quiet archway on liams bunk was a small stack of history books that he was working his way through the one on top looked like it had something to do with the american civil war the cover was all flags and crossed swords and bearded generals right now he was downtown said he wanted to take a walk and clear his head sal got the distinct feeling he wasnt so happy to be back as hed let on that maybe he could have been quite happy living on in the year i was actually the sheriff of nottingham for a while hed told her rather proudly and she suspected a little wistfully sal knew something was also troubling him shed heard him murmuring in his sleep last night telling someone over and over that he was so very sorry his eyes old before they should be eyes that word suddenly stirred a memory i saw something a couple of days ago its a bear a childs teddy bear i cant explain why its playing on my mind i know ive seen that bear before i mean before like before me being a timerider i just cant quite remember where or when its totally dullah weirding me out through the open door into the back room she could see bobs form floating in the nutrientrich amber soup gently kicking in his sleep as something close to a dream must have been running through his head his lower arm had grown bone first and now was at the stage of sprouting ribbons of feathery pink muscle tissue it was quiet in the archway becks and maddy they were out together to give foster an update sal wanted to go along and say hi but maddy had said not this time shes always doing that treating me like a child she sighed irritably just me she said aloud her voice echoing around the brick walls and coming back to her she got down off her bunk bed with a squeak of springs and sauntered over to the computer desk and sat down bob hello sal wanna play a game of something certainly what would you like to play do you have any pikodu puzzles on your system affirmative would you like to do a twoplayer one yes one of the monitors flickered to life with a complicated mosaic of icons and put some music on something really heavy what would you like she clucked her tongue what about that band maddy took us to see what were they called again esszed yeah lets have some of their stuff the faint rumble of a train passing overhead was lost behind the opening powerchord of a distorted guitar and the rasping deep drawl of the vocals she sat back in her chair and nodded along to the beat go on then she said nodding at the webcam your go first chapter new york foster was sitting on the park bench just like the last time she saw him pulling nuggets of dough from a hotdog bun and throwing it to a strutting pack of impatient pigeons hey said maddy he looked up at her and smiled you found me then he studied the girl standing beside maddy and whos this oh yeah this is becks we grew her fosters eyes narrowed for a moment then flickered with recognition yes of course thats the female model you know about the san francisco drop point i take it yup his eyes were drawn to the swirling ridges of scarred skin tissue running up her left arm looks like shes seen action already maddy sat down next to him a prehistoric monster bit her arm off thats regrowth there his eyes rounded prehistoric maddy nodded thats a whole other story foster i told you about it last time oh this is not the first time youve come to me i must seem like some senile old fart relax she said laughing its only the second ahhh so how are you coping she sighed ok so far i think historys still in one piece she looked around the park a toddler was tormenting the pigeons his parents a few dozen yards away watching him no one close enough to earwig foster i really need to talk to you about something he threw the rest of the bun at the pigeons and dusted the crumbs off his hands go on does the word pandora mean anything at all to you he tilted his head in thought do you mean apart from the greek legend maddy nodded no i he shook his head nothing especially only when we were getting the spare foetuses from the san francisco drop point i discovered a handwritten note addressed to me telling me to look out for it he frowned odd theres more maddy proceeded to spend the next ten minutes talking explaining all about the voynich manuscript adam lewis the holy grail and freemasons from the future finally she explained that some sort of prophecy some big secret supposedly penned nearly two thousand years ago was locked up in a passwordprotected portion of beckss brain so that secret its right here foster right inside beckss head i wanted you to hear it as well as me what about liam and sal she shook her head theyll be next but i just feel i can trust you because because i havent got long to live maddy winced he was right no thats not it its the note said tell no one so whatever becks has got to tell us i guess i just want to hear it first before i share it with the others he nodded fair enough youre quite right maddy beckoned becks to sit down on the bench on the other side of foster becks im going to open your locked partition now are you ready affirmative she said coolly im sort of worried foster its something important im sure its something to do with the future perhaps something the future knows about the past he added yeah could be anything really but this what shes about to say maddy laughed a little manically this secret is what the legend of the holy grail is all about she looked at him ill be honest with you that kinda freaks me out a little its going to be a big thing right big its gonna change things he nodded thoughtfully possibly im scared its just information maddy better to know something than not he reached for her hand and squeezed it well figure it out together so we will all right she leaned across the old man becks listen very closely she lowered her voice ipad caveman breakfast beckss face suddenly became a blank canvas expressionless her eyes locked on maddy hello maddy she looked at foster who is this hes foster hes one of the agency he can be trusted do you understand affirmative you remember you used that cardangrille to decode the holy grail document yes maddy i do it was a very interesting task good i want you to tell me and foster exactly what you read beckss mouth opened to speak then froze she remained motionless for a good ten seconds before maddy and foster exchanged a questioning look becks whats the matter the question unfroze the support unit and her grey eyes swivelled on to her i am unable to comply with your request she said im sorry i cannot reveal the message to you maddy not at this time what who says beckss eyes flickered as she checked data i am unable to reveal that but it is a higher authority than yours a higher authority she looked at foster a higher authority do you know who shes talking about foster frowned puzzled no no i dont oh god i dont like this she whispered secrets within secrets i
