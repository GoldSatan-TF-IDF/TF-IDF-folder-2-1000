spring never in all his twentysix years had menedemos been so glad to see the sailing season come round again not that winter in rhodes was harsh menedemos had never seen snow fall here nor had his father even so his fingers caressed the steeringoar tillers of the merchant galley aphroditeas they might have stroked a lovers skin his cousin sostratos stood on the akatos poop deck with him sostratos was a few months older and most of a head taller but menedemos captained the ship his cousin served as toikharkhos keeping track of the aphroditeand of what they would bring in and spend on their trading run sostratos had a splendid head for numbers people now people gave him a good deal more trouble from the quay at which the aphroditewas tied up menedemos father called be careful by the gods be extra careful i will father menedemos said dutifully one of the reasons he was so glad to escape rhodes was that that meant escaping philodemos living in the same house with him through the winter had been harder this year than in any other menedemos could remember his father had long been convinced he couldnt do anything right as if to prove as much philodemos called listen to your cousin sostratos has the beginnings of good sense menedemos clipped his head as hellenes did to show assent he shot sostratos a hooded glance sostratos had the decency to look embarrassed at such praise from the older generation sostratos father lysistratos stood alongside philodemos he was a good deal more easygoing than his older brother but he too said youre going to have to watch yourselves every single place you go we will even sostratos let a little exasperation show and he got on with his father far better than menedemos did with his but lysistratos persisted not just pirates these days you know since ptolemaios and antigonos started fighting again last year therell be more war galleys on the sea than a dog has fleas some of those whoresons are just pirates in bigger faster stronger ships yes uncle lysistratos menedemos said patiently but if we dont go out and trade the family goes hungry well thats true lysistratos admitted watch out for the silk merchants on kos philodemos warned theyll gouge you if you give them half a chanceeven a quarter of a chance they think theyve got the world by the short hairs because you cant buy silk anywhere else they have a point too menedemos thought aloud he said well do our best we did all right with them last year remember and weve got crimson dye aboard they always pay well for that his father gave more advice in a low voice sostratos said if we keep listening to them well never sail isnt that the truth menedemos whispered back he raised his voice to call out to the crew rowers to the benches diokles come up to the stern if you please right you are skipper diokles answered the keleustes was in his early forties his skin tanned and leathery from endless summers at sea he mounted from the undecked waist of the akatos to the poop his bare feet were sure and quiet as he came up the steps to the raised platform at the stern seamen didnt wear shoes aboard shipand few of them bothered with shoes ashore either all forty of the akatos oars were manned fast enough to keep menedemos from complaining more than half of the rowers had gone west to great hellas and the towns of the italian barbarians the year before almost all of them had pulled an oar in a rhodian warship at one time or another they werent a raw crew and wouldnt need much beating in to work well togetherso menedemos hoped at any rate he glanced over to the quay to make sure no lines still secured the aphrodite sure enough theyd all been taken aboard he knew that but was glad hed checked all the same trying to row away while still tied up his father would never have let him live it down neither would anyone else having satisfied himself he dipped his head to diokles good enough as always aboard ship the oarmaster carried a little mallet with an iron head and a bronze square dangling from a chain he used them to beat out the stroke all eyes went to him when he raised the bronze square he grinned at the rowers as he cocked his right arm then brought the mallet forward as metal clanged on metal he began to call the stroke too rhyppapai rhyppapai the oars rose and fell rose and fell the aphroditeglided away from the pier slowly at first then faster and faster sostratos waved back toward his father grudgingly menedemos looked back over his shoulder and lifted one hand from the steering oar to wave at philodemos in turn a little to his surprise his father waved back but is he waving because hes sorry to see me go or because hes glad rhodes boasted no fewer than five harbors but only the great harbor and the naval harbor just northwest of it were warded from wind and weather with manmade moles the great harbors opening onto the aegean was only a couple of plethra acrossnot even a bowshot menedemos steered toward the middle of the channel rhyppapai diokles called he smote the bronze square again rhyppapai he set a stately pace what point to wearing out the rowers at the beginning of the voyage and what point to embarrassing them by pushing them up to a quick stroke and having them make mistakes under the critical eyes of every wharf rat in rhodes after all the only reason menedemos put a full complement on the oars was for show once out of the harbor the merchant galley would either sail or amble along with eight or ten rowers on a side unless she had to flee or fight menedemos tasted the motion of the sea through the soles of his feet and the palms of his hands on the steering oars here in the protected harbor the water was almost glassy smooth even so no one could ever mistake it for the staid solidity of dry land almost like riding a woman isnt it menedemos said to sostratos his cousin plucked at his beard they werent fashionable for young men these daysmenedemos and most of the sailors were cleanshavenbut sostratos had never been one to care much for fashion trust you to come up with that particular comparison he said at last i havent the faintest idea what youre talking about menedemos replied with a chuckle sostratos snorted its plain youre no persian at any rate persian i should hope not menedemos said what are you talking about anyhow you pull the strangest things out from under your hat herodotos says persians learn three things when theyre growing up sostratos said to ride to shoot and to tell the truth oh menedemos said well to the crows with you o cousin of mine they both laughed what menedemos didnt tell sostratos was that he was glad to be leaving rhodes not because of what he had done this winter but because of what he hadnta sizable departure from his norm his cousin knew nothing of that no one but menedemos knew of the passion hed conceived for his fathers young second wife unless baukis herself had some inkling of it but whatever he thought whatever he felt he hadnt done anything about it and the strain of doing nothing had made living with his father even harder than it would have been otherwise he would have known blindfolded the instant when the aphroditeglided out between the fortified moles that sheltered the great harbor and onto the open waters of the aegean the akatos motion changed inside the space of a heartbeat real wavesnot big ones but waves nonetheless driven by a brisk northerly breezeslapped her bow and foamed over the threefinned bronze ram she carried there she began to pitch going up and down up and down under menedemos feet now were really on the sea he said happily so we are sostratos sounded less delighted the merchant galleys motion remained quite mild but menedemos cousin had an uncertain stomach till he got back his sea legs at the start of each new sailing season menedemos thanked the gods that that affliction didnt trouble him the chop made the aphrodites timbers creak menedemos cocked his head and smiled at the familiar sound the mortises and tenons and treenails that held plank to plank hadnt taken any strain since the akatos came back from great hellas the autumn before indeed shed been beached all winter for all the world as if she were a warship to let her dry out she would be uncommonly fast for a while till the pine got waterlogged again fishing boats bobbed on the swells seeing the aphroditeoutbound from the harbor at rhodes they knew the galley was no pirate ship a couple of fishermen even waved at her menedemos lifted his right hand from the steering oar to wave back he loved eating fish what hellene didntbut nothing could have made him catch them for a living endless labor poor reward he tossed his head no anything but that diokles said pity the winds straight in our face otherwise we could lower the sail from the yard and give the rowers a rest it usually blows out of the north at this season of the year menedemos answered and the oarmaster dipped his head in agreement menedemos went on but i will take half the men off the oars now well make kaunos by sundown without hurrying wed better diokles said he left off clanging his mallet on bronze and called out oop the rowers rested at their oars the akatos eased to a halt diokles went on starting from the bow every other man take a rest the rowers coming off hauled in their long dripping oars and stowed them atop mediumsized jars of crimson dye small round pots of ink and oiledleather sacks full of papyrus from egypt rhyppapai the keleustes sang out rhyppapai the men left on the oars went back to work the aphroditebegan to move again not with the speed shed shown before but still well enough to suit menedemos well practice tactics for a sea fight a good deal on this cruise he told the crew never can tell when well need them except right around rhodes pirates are thick as flies round a dead goat no one grumbled anybody who went to sea knew he told the truth sostratos said if anybody besides our polis cared about keeping those vultures off the water he clicked his tongue between his teeth but no one does menedemos called to one of the sailors whod just stopped rowing aristeidas go up to the foredeck and keep an eye on things youre the best lookout weve got right captain the young sailor answered and hurried forward hed proved on the aphroditeslast voyage how sharp his eyes were menedemos wanted a pair of good eyes looking out for pirates the mountainous seaside district of lykia lay just east of kaunos and as far as he or any other rhodian could tell piracy was the lykians chief national industry any headland might shelter a long lean fiftyoared pentekonter or a hemioliashorter than a pentekonter because its oars were on two banks rather than one but even swifter the pirate ship par excellencelying in wait to rush out and capture a prize spotting a raider in good time might make the difference between staying free and going up on the auction block naked and manacled in some secondrate slave market menedemos eye went from the sea to the karian coastline ahead mist and distancekaunos lay about two hundred fifty stadia north and slightly east of rhodesshrouded his view but his minds eye supplied the details he couldnt yet make out as in lykia the mountains of karia rose swiftly from the sea the lower slopes would show the green and gold of ripening crops at this season of the year farther up grew cypress and juniper and even a few precious cedars woodcutters who went up into the mountains after the timber shipwrights had to have might face not only wolves and bears but lions as well when he thought of lions he naturally thought of homer too and murmured a few lines from the eighteenth book of the iliad with them peleus son began endless lamentation setting his murderous hands on his comrades breast he groaned again and again like a wellmaned lion from whom a man who hunts deer has taken its cubs from the thick woods it coming later is grieved it goes through many valleys seeking the man by scent if it might find him anywhere for anger most piercing seizes it why are you going on about lions sostratos asked menedemos explained ah his cousin said do you have a few lines from homer that you trot out for everything under the sun not for everything menedemos admitted but for most things if you know the iliad and the odyssey youll come up with some lines to help you figure out how it all goes together but thats something you should do for yourself sostratos said you shouldnt need to find your answers in the words of an old blind poet hellenes have been doing it ever since he sang menedemos said tell me any of your precious philosophers and historians will last as well he was much more conventionalhe thought of himself as much more practicalthan sostratos and enjoyed twitting his cousin why go to athens to study the way you did when most of what you need is right there under your nose sostratos exhaled angrily through that nose for one thing a lot of homers answers arent so good as people think they are and for another who says herodotos and platon and thoukydides wont last thoukydides wrote his history to be a possession for all time and i think he did what he set out to do did he menedemos jabbed a thumb at his own chest i dont know what all he wrote and im not exactly ignorant but you can take any hellene from massalia on the coast of the inner sea way north and west of great hellas and drop him into one of the poleis alexander founded in india or one of those other countries out beyond persia and if he recites the lines i just did somebody else will know the ones that come next go ontell me im wrong he waited sostratos sometimes irked him but was always painfully honest and now with a sigh menedemos cousin said well i cant do that and you know it perfectly well homer is everywhere and everybody knows hes everywhere when you first learn to read if you do what do you learn the iliad of course and even men who dont have their letters know the stories the poet tells thank you menedemos made as if to bow without letting go of the steering oar youve just proved my case for me no by the dog of egypt sostratos tossed his head what people think to be true and what is true arent always the same if we thought this ship were sailing south would we end up at alexandria or would we still go on to kaunos regardless of what our opinion was it was menedemos turn to wince after a moment he pointed to starboard theres a fisherman with a false opinion of us were a galley so he thinks were pirates and hes sailing away as fast as he can sostratos wagged a finger in his face oh no you dont best one you cant slide out of the argument that way he was annoyingly as tenacious as he was honest people may believe things because theyre true things arent true because people believe them menedemos pondered that a dolphin leaped into the air near the aphrodite then splashed back into the sea it was beautiful but he couldnt point to it and talk about truth at last he said no wonder they made sokrates drink hemlock that at least started a different argument with the wind dead against her the aphrodites crew had to row all the way to kaunos the akatos got into the town on the coast of karia late in the afternoon sostratos spoke without thinking as they glided past the moles that closed off the harbor and neared a quay we wont have time to do any business today he was angry at himself as soon as the words passed the barrier of his teethanother phrase from homer he thought and wished he hadnt hed stayed away from menedemos as well as he could in the cramped confines of the merchant galley ever since they wrangled about sokrates theyd had that quarrel before sostratos suspected no he was certainhis cousin had trotted it out only to inflame him the trouble was it had worked menedemos answered as if he hadnt noticed sostratos avoiding him youre right worse luck but i hope the proxenos will have room for us at his house tonight so do i sostratos accepted the tacit truce his cousin pulled in on one steering oar and out on the other guiding the aphrodite towards a berth diokles mallet and bronze square got a couple of quick strokes from the rowers then the keleustes called back oars three or four such strokes killed the ships momentum and left her motionless beside the quay very nice as usual sostratos said thank you young sir diokles replied as toikharkhos sostratos outranked him and was of course the son of one of the aphrodites owners but sostratos would never be a seaman to match the oarmaster and they both knew it differences in status and skill made for politeness on both sides a couple of round shipsordinary merchantmenand a sharkshaped hull that looked as if it would make a hemiolia were abuilding in the dockyard not far away one of the round ships was nearly done carpenters were affixing stiffening ribs to the already completed outer shell of planking other men drove bronze spikes through the planking from the outside to secure it to the ribs the bang of their hammers filled the whole town up on the hills above seaside kaunos the gray stone fortress of imbros squatted and brooded the soldiers in the fortress served oneeyed antigonos who had overrun all of karia three years before kaunos still proclaimed itself to be free and autonomous in these days of clashing marshals though many towns claims to freedom and autonomy had a distinctly hollow ring while sostratos eyed the dockyards and the bills and mused on world affairs menedemos briskly went ahead with what needed doing like a lot of hellenes he carried small change in his mouth between his cheek and his teeth he spat an obolos into the palm of his hand you know who the rhodian proxenos is dont you he asked a man standing on the pier who wasnt busy securing the aphrodite certainly kissidas son of alexias the olive merchant the kaunian replied thats right menedemos tossed the little silver coin to the local he gave the fellow the name of the ship his own name and sostratos ask him if hes able to put my cousin and me up for the night ill give you another obolos when you come back with his answer youve got a bargain pal the man stuck the obolos into his own mouth and trotted away he came back a quarter of an hour later with a bigbellied bald man whose bare scalp was as shiny as if hed rubbed it with olive oil menedemos gave the messenger the second obolos which disappeared as the first one had the bald man said hail im kissidas which of you is which im sostratos sostratos answered menedemos also named himself pleased to make your acquaintance kissidas said though he didnt sound particularly pleased that worried sostratos what was a proxenos for if not to help citizens of the polis he represented in his own home town the olive dealer went on youll want lodging you say no he didnt sound pleased at all if youd be so kind sostratos replied wondering if kissidas bore a grudge against his father or menedemos neither of the younger men had set eyes on the proxenos before menedemos has never tried seducing his wife sostratos thought tartly i suppose i can get away with it kissidas said but hipparkhos hes antigonos garrison commanderdoesnt much like rhodians hes made it hard to keep up the proxeny he really has were glad you have kept it up best one sostratos meant every word of that neither a buggy noisy crowded inn nor sleeping on the hard planks of the poop deck much appealed to him and what has old oneeyes officer got against rhodians what would you expect kissidas answered he thinks your polls leans toward ptolemaios that held a good deal of truth considering how much egyptian grain went through rhodes for transshipment all over the aegean sostratos city had to stay friendly with ptolemaios nonetheless sostratos spoke the technical truth when he said thats foolish were neutral we have to stay neutral or somebody would gobble us up for leaning to the other side my cousins right menedemos said he and sostratos might squabble with each other but they presented a united front to the world menedemos went on we even built some ships for antigonos two or three years ago how does that make us lean toward ptolemaios you dont need to persuade me friends kissidas said and you wont persuade hipparkhos for his minds made up will you have trouble with him because youre taking us in sostratos asked i hope not the proxenos answered bleakly but whether i do or dont its my duty to help rhodians here the same as its the duty of the kaunian proxenos in rhodes to help men from this city there come along with me best ones and use my home as your own as long as youre in kaunos before leaving the aphrodite menedemos made sure diokles would keep at least half a dozen sailors aboard her wouldnt do to come back and find half our cargo had grown legs and walked off now would it menedemos said not hardly skipper especially when we havent got any peafowl along with us this spring diokles said we havent got em and weor i anyhowdont miss em either sostratos said hed had to care for the birds till they sold the last of them in syracuse and hadnt enjoyed the experience as far as raucous stupid bipeds go theyre even worse than sailors he thoughta bit of fluff he wisely didnt pass on to the oarmaster come along my friends kissidas repeated more urgently than before maybe he didnt want to be seen hanging around a rhodian ship would informers denounce him to antigonos garrison commander as sostratos went up the gangplank onto the quay he thanked fortune and the other gods that rhodes really was free and autonomous and that rhodians didnt have to worry about such nonsense as far as the look of both buildings and people went kaunos might have been a purely hellenic city the temples were older and plainer than those of rhodes but built in the same style houses showed the world only blank fronts some whitewashed and red tile roofs as they would have back home all the signs were in greek men wore thighlength chitons a few wrapped hitmatia over the tunics womens chitons reached their ankles if prosperous or prominent women came out in public they wore hats and veils against the prying eyes of men just thinking about what might be under those wrappings builds a fire under you doesnt it menedemos murmured after one such woman walked by under you maybe sostratos said his cousin laughed at him as sostratos walked along the narrow muddy winding streets he realized the karians who shared kaunos with the hellenes also made their presence felt though they were hellenized as far as dress went more of their men wore beards than was true at rhodesthe fad for shaving hadnt caught on among them some of them wore short curved swords on their belts too outlandish weapons to a hellenes eye and even if they didnt write their own language they did speak ita gurgling tongue that meant nothing to sostratos tell me he said to kissidas suddenly curious do men and women and even children here in kaunos sometimes get large drinking parties together for friends of about the same age the rhodian proxenos stopped in his tracks and gave him an odd look why yes he answered but how could you know that youve never been here before i dont believe and thats not the custom anywhere else in karia ive heard it said and i wondered if it was true sostratos answered explaining hed stumbled across it in the history of herodotos was likely to spawn as many questions as it answered so he didnt bother when they got to the olive merchants home a slave greeted kissidas in bad greek before barring the door after him and his guests kissidas led the two rhodians across the rather bare courtyard to the andron the slave brought a jar of wine another of water a mixing bowl and three cups to the mens room supper soon he said mixing wine and water in the bowl and filling the cups from it to what shall we drink sostratos asked to peace among the marshals that would be wonderful it would also be too much to hope for kissidas said bleakly he lifted his own cup here is a prayer the gods may hear to staying out from underfoot when the marshals clash he drank so did menedemos and so did sostratos the proxenos toast summed up his own hope for rhodes menedemos raised his cup too to making a profit while we stay out from underfoot they all drank again warmth spread outward from sostratos belly he guessed the mix was one part wine to two of water a little stronger than usual kissidas said i can have couches brought if you like gentlemen but i usually dine sitting unless im giving a real symposion dont trouble yourself best one sostratos said at once youre doing us the kindness of putting us up we dont want to disrupt your household any more than we must good of you kind of you the wine seemed to hit kissidas even harder than it hit sostratos my dear fellow some people imagine that staying at a proxenos house means they own the place he rolled his eyes the stories i could tell you after another cup of wine he started telling those stories sostratos heard a good one about a longwinded rhodian of his fathers generation whom he already disliked a pleasure sweeter than most at kissidas wave his house slave set a threelegged round table in front of each chair the sitosthe main part of the mealthe slave fetched in was wheat bread still warm from the oven the opsonthe relish that accompanied itconsisted of plates of small squids fried in olive oil till they were golden brown like any mannerly person sostratos ate sitos with his left hand opson with his right and was careful to eat more bread than squid as menedemos popped a squid into his mouth with the thumb and first two fingers of his right hand he inclined his head to kissidas and said youll make an opsophagos out of me with a supper like this not wanting to be taken for someone who ate opson at the expense of sitos helped keep sostratos mannerly he dipped his head to show his host he agreed with menedemos comment actually he thought his cousin was exaggerating for politeness sake the squids were goodlike most hellenes sostratos was very fond of seafood but nothing exceptional youre too kind kissidas said i forgot to ask before what have you got aboard with an akatos i wouldnt expect you to be carrying grain or timber or cheap wine or oil no the aphrodites not a bulk hauler though shes carried grain before menedemos said weve got perfume from rhodian roses and some of the finest crimson dye to come out of phoenicia since alexander sacked tyre twenty years ago and papyrus out of egypt and pots of firstquality ink from rhodes sostratos added a few other odds and ends too things for men who arent satisfied with the everyday menedemos said the luxury trade sure enoughi knew it as soon as i saw your ship kissidas said and what do you hope to get here this isnt a town with a lot of luxuries to sell we make our living from our crops and from the timber and mines in the mountains sostratos and menedemos shrugged in such perfect unison they might have been actors on the comic stage well go into the agora tomorrow and see what your traders have sostratos said and well gladly sell for silver too plenty of that in these parts if we can pry it out of people i wish you the best of luck kissidas said but antigonos squeezes us pretty hard he he broke off as the house slave came in to light lamps and torches and didnt resume till the man had left the andron even afterwards he kept the conversation innocuous for a while he had to be worrying about informers menedemos if sostratos knew his cousin had to be thinking about taking one of kissidas slave girls to bed but no women showed themselves and the fellow who took sostratos and menedemos out of the andron led them to a pair of beds in one crowded room the lamp flickering on the table between the two didnt throw much light but did shed enough to show menedemos expression it was so eloquent sostratos snickered oh shut up menedemos told him youre not a pretty girl im not even an ugly girl sostratos agreed though i suppose i would be were i a girl that oldfashioned beard you wear certainly wouldnt help menedemos said sostratos snorted things could be worse we could be lying there on the planks of the poop deck he pulled his chiton off over his head wrapped himself in his himation and lay down menedemos did the same both bed frames creaked as the leather lashings supporting the woolstuffed mattresses sagged under the mens weight menedemos blew out the lamp the room plunged into blackness sostratos fell asleep almost at once when menedemos woke up in the rhodian proxenos guest bedchamber he needed a moment to remember where he was his cousins snores from the other bed soon gave him a hint gray morning twilight was leaking through the wooden shutters over the window outside not very far away a jackdaw started screeching chak chak chak the birds racket made sostratos snores falter he tried to wrap the himation around his head and sleep through the noise but had no luck when he muttered something unpleasant and sat up menedemos said good day not too bad sostratos answered around a yawn is our host awake i havent heard anything stirring except for that jackdaw menedemos reached down and felt around under the bed till he found the chamber pot he stood up to use it then passed it to sostratoskissidas hospitality hadnt extended to one for each guest miserable noisy bird sostratos said if i could see it instead of just listening to it id try to drown it in here he set down the pot menedemos shrugged on his tunic lets find the kitchenand seen if we can get some bread and oil and olives or maybe an onion kissidas slaves will be up whether he is himself or not then we can go back to the aphrodite get some sailors to haul things for us and see what kind of luck we have in the agora and what the kaunians are selling sostratos said and what the kaunians are selling menedemos agreed never can tell what youll find in a place like this things from the town things from the rest of kariaand no matter what kissidas says things from the other end of the world ever since alexander kicked the persian empire open for us hellenes weve come across all sorts of strange things wed hardly known about before peafowl for instance they were nothing but trouble sostratos said not quite nothingwe turned em into silver menedemos waited to see what sort of argument his cousin would give him about that when sostratos didnt argue menedemos concluded hed made his point he went off toward kissidas kitchen in a good mood he didnt win arguments from sostratos every day kissidas himself came into the kitchen just as menedemos and sostratos were finishing their breakfasts you boys are up early he said as he tore a chunk from a loaf of last nights bread weve got a lot to do today menedemos said the sooner we get started the sooner well get it done he was always full of driving energy on the sea less often on landwhen he wasnt chasing some woman or other but this morning he wished he could do everything at once havent you finished yet sostratos sostratos spat a last olive pit onto the rammedearth floor i have now i thought you were just my cousin and my captain not my master shows what you know come on lets get moving he swept sostratos along in his wake as the aphroditebrought her boat along in her wake with the tow rope over his shoulder he called back to kissidas well see you in the evening best one wish us luck i do not that i think youll need too much the olive merchant answered men who push as hard as you do make their own luck menedemos hardly heard him he was hustling sostratos out the front door to kissidas house only then did he hesitate nowto find the harbor kaunos streets did not run on a neat grid in fact they ran on no pattern known to geometry this was an old town unlike modern rhodes which had gone up only a century before and whose streets went at right angles to one another as long as we go east were fine sostratos said the shadows will tell us which way that is good enough menedemos laughed i usually steer by the sun out on the sea not here on land but youre rightit should work and it did menedemos wasnt so sure hed be able to find kissidas house again but the rising sun did lead him to the harbor and to the aphrodite a few sailors aboard the merchant galley were still snoring on the rowers benches leaning up against the planking of the ships side more were up and about but moving with the slow care of men whod had too much wine the night before diokles predictably was both awake and undamaged hail skipper he boomed making several men wince i was hoping youd get here about now plenty of things to do today thats right menedemos agreed pick me six or eight men to haul jars of dye and perfume and pots of ink and a couple of these sacks of papyrus to the agora dont choose any of the fellows who stayed on the ship last nighttheyre entitled to their fun today right you are the keleustes told off several sailors they grumbledthey wouldnt have been free hellenes if they hadntbut they did as they were told leading their little procession menedemos and sostratos headed back into kaunos from the harbor district menedemos had to ask how to get to the agora no steering by the sun there the first man he asked babbled at him in karian which he didnt understand the next plainly followed greek but made a production of having to think things over till menedemos handed him an obolos once hed popped the little coin into his mouth he gave quick clear directions that also proved accurate menedemos silently thanked the gods hed known lots of quick clear directions that had the sole flaw of not taking him where he needed to go the market square was still nearly empty when the men from the aphroditegot there that let them stake out a good spot one that would give them shade for most of the day they arranged the jars and pots and sacks the sailors had carried menedemos started crying his wares perfume from rhodian roses fine phoenician crimson dye papyrus from the nile fine ink none better a good many other people were shouting too for things like pots and figskaunos was famous for its figsand leather and wool cloth those shouts would have gone up in any city around the inner sea menedemos for goods out of the ordinary drew the curious and he hoped the slaves of the wealthy wheres your crimson from a man asked just saying phoenician now that doesnt mean a thing plenty of towns in phoenicia and every one of em has its own style of fixing up the shellfish byblos sostratos said since alexander sacked tyre everyone agrees that byblian crimson is the best oh i dont know about that the kaunian replied ive always been partial to sidons dye myself but i might use byblian on my wool if t can get a halfway decent price for it what do you want for one of your jars theyll be a rhodian kotyie apiece wont they thats right sostratos replied about the size of a big drinking cup of wine but you can get your wine for a few oboloi crimson dye is dearershellfish arent so easy to come by as grapes i know i know the wool merchant sounded impatient tell me what you want for a jar ill tell you what a godsdetested thief you are and well go from there sostratos smiled so did menedemos the kaunian didnt believe in wasting time just as you say best one sostratos told him thirty drakhmai the jar seems a fair price thirty the local howled you are a godsdetested thief i expected you to say fifteen and idve laughed at that ten would be too much by zeus labraundeus he spoke doric greek not much different from menedemos or sostratos but the god by whom he swore was karian nice of you to stop by sostratos said pleasantly the wool merchant made no motion to leave the little crowd that had gathered leaned forward for the next move in the dicker sostratos merely waited he was good at that better than menedemos who was an impulsive plunger by temperament looking like a man with a sour stomach the kaunian wool dealer said i suppose i might go up to twelve sostratos hardly seemed to hear him as if every word hurt the local added or even thirteen well sostratos plucked at his beard everyone waited how much would he come down sometimesoftenmenedemos stuck his oar into the bargaining too but this didnt seem to be the moment in tones of mild regret sostratos said i dont suppose my father would take a strap to me if i got twentyeight drakhmai the jar he didnt sound sure about that though he didnt drive the wool merchant away either the spectators smiled and nudged one another this would be a loud long entertaining haggle one man whispered to the fellow beside him offering a bet on what price the dye would finally bring plainly the dicker would tie things up for a while menedemos walked away judging he had time for a quick look around the agora he ate a fig candied in honey he had to work to keep from exclaiming at how good it was maybe we should talk he told the man selling them i might try bringing a few of those to rhodes on the off chance some people would like them dont wait too long my friend the dealer answered they always go fast ive already sold a lot let me see what else i might be interested in menedemos said this fellow next to you has are those really lion skins and whats that one with the stripes thats from the indian beast called a tiger the man at the next stall said if i were to stretch the skin out you would see its even bigger than the ones from the lions theyre local they were killing sheep up in the hills till a whole mob of men took after em with spears eryes menedemos said no lions on rhodes there never had been not so far as anyones memory reached here on the anatolian mainland though it was a different story he recalled the verses hed recited on the sea homer had known the beasts well they didnt live in hellas these days though some were still supposed to lurk in the back woods of macedonia menedemos was about to ask a price for the hides hellenes didnt wear fursthat was the mark of thracians and skythians and other barbariansbut images of zeus and herakles could be decked in lion skins and he supposed in a tiger skin as well or maybe that would do for dionysos who was also said to come from india before he put the question to the merchant though he noticed another item by the mans sandaled foot what exactly is that and where did it come from he asked i can answer the second question easier than the first the fellow replied the fellow who sold it to me said he got it from a man whod lived in alexandria eskhate the last alexandria menedemos echoed alexander named towns for himself all over the east wheres that one way off near the edge of the worldin sogdiana on the iaxartes river the merchant said the hellene who lived there got it from the sakai who roam the plains to the north and east where the nomads found it the man who sold it to me couldnt say i guess the fellow who sold it to him didnt know either what is it menedemos asked again what did it come from the merchant told him his eyes widened youre joking looks like one doesnt it the kaunian said i dont know ive never seen one before menedemos answered i dont know anybody who has or maybe i do he glanced over toward sostratos his cousin looked to have just struck a bargain with the wool merchant that meant he could come over and take a look menedemos whistled shrilly then waved to draw his notice oë sostratos he shouted come here sostratos was more than a little pleased with himself hed got the kaunian wool merchant up to twentytwo drakhmai a jar for six jars of crimson dye anything over eighteen drakhmai the jar was profit so hed done pretty well now that the wool merchant had gone off to get the silverone mina thirtytwo drakhmai said the calculating part of sostratos mind that rarely restedhe wanted a moment in which he could relax and be proud of himself he wanted one but he didnt get it from halfway across the agora menedemos started waving and whistling and generally acting the fool oe sostratos he called come here what is it sostratos shouted back he doubted whether anything in kaunos market square was worth getting excited about his cousin though evidently disagreed with him come here his cousin repeated youve got to take a look at this take a look at what sostratos asked irritably menedemos didnt answer he just waved and called again muttering under his breath sostratos went over to see what besides a pretty girl could get his cousin in such an uproar when he got to the flimsy stall by which his cousin was standing menedemos pointed dramatically and said there sostratos stared staring didnt tell him what he needed to know so he asked the question he had to ask what is that thing a gryphons skull menedemos and the local merchant answered together they might have come from the chorus in a revived tragedy of euripides a gryphons skull sostratos echoed as if he couldnt believe his ears as a matter of fact he couldnt but i always thought everyone always thoughtgryphons werent real herodotos puts them at the end of the world with the oneeyed arimaspioi and other unlikelihoods this skull comes from the end of the world menedemos said and told sostratos what the kaunian had told him before sostratos could say anything his cousin added and if thats not a gryphons skull my dear id like you to tell me what it is i dont know sostratos squatted beside the extraordinary skullit was definitely the skull of some sort of beast whether gryphon or notfor a closer look after a moment menedemos crouched down beside him what have you come across here sostratos asked his cousin i already told you menedemos said you didnt want to believe me thats all do you blame me sostratos said menedemos only shrugged the skull itself said nothing at all of course it only lay on the muddy ground in the middle of kaunos agora and stared back at sostratos out of large empty eye sockets the skull itself was impressively large too perhaps two cubits long and almost a cubit and a half wide at the broadest point though it narrowed at the front to a curved beak almost like that of an eagle growing astonishment and awe prickled through sostratos gryphons were supposed to have just that sort of beak unlike an eagles though this beak held teeth sostratos tilted the skull for a better look he would have expected fangs to put a lions to shame but these flattopped square teeth looked more like a cows or a goats isnt that interesting sostratos murmured no matter what weve heard the gryphon may graze instead of killing what makes you say that menedemos asked its teeth sostratos answered and explained his reasoning menedemos pursed his lips as he thought then dipped his head in agreement youre a clever fellow the kaunian merchant said that never would have occurred to me a clever fellow eh sostratos tossed his head if im so clever why did i never imagine this he reached out and rested his palm on the skulls projecting beaky snout the feel of it surprised him anew it was cooler and heavier more solid than hed expected from old bone it might almost be stone under my ringers he said and glanced toward menedemos you dont suppose some sculptor no his cousin cut him off thats impossible best one and you know it as well as i do who could have imagined such a thing let alone carved it those teeth are teeth a man would break his heart and go blind trying to shape them and the broken horn that sticks up and back from the skull dont be absurd sostratos sighed he would have loved to tell menedemos he was wrong but couldnt you have me im afraid he straightened picked up the skullit weighed about a third of a talent he guessedand turned it all the way over wondering if the underside would tell him anything the top hadnt on closer inspection he discovered the teeth werent quite so much like a cows as hed first thought but he still couldnt imagine the gryphon eating meat with them menedemos pointed to some reddish dirt clinging to the bottom of the skull there you see its not carved its been buried underground for a long time well maybe sostratos tried to scrape off the dirt with his finger it didnt want to be scraped he broke a fingernail trying in fact and had to gnaw at it to get some sort of even edge its not dirt its stone he tried scraping more cautiously with his other index ringer a little of the stuff came away but not much soft sandy stone but stone no doubt about it after reaching out himself and scraping a bit menedemos dipped his head youre right how long do you suppose a skull would have to stay underground to have bits of stone stuck to it i couldnt begin to guess sostratos answered herodotos says the egyptians say their kings and priests go back generations which he makes out to be something over years some good part of that time anyway probably menedemos whistled softly over years thats a long time i dont suppose its been even one thousand years since the trojan war has it you know things like that before sostratos could tell him it hadnt been a thousand years or even quite nine hundred since the trojan war the kaunian merchant said so what will you give me for this gryphons skull and before sostratos could even ask him how much he wanted menedemos laughed and said oh my dear fellow that old bone is interesting to look at but i dont think we want to buy it what in the name of the gods is it good for except maybe as the strangest decoration for an andron anyone ever saw now the lion skins youve got and the one from thetiger did you call itthose i might be interested in talking about with you menedemos sostratos said his cousin ignored him menedemos was turning into a haggler right in front of him examining the skins with a critical eye he clicked his tongue between his teeth in dismay id pay more if it werent for this poorly repaired hole here where a spear went in i suppose menedemos sostratos said again rather louder the next time he would scream his cousins name he was sure of it but for a wonder menedemos deigned to notice him yes what is it best one you wanted something he was the picture of slightly distracted good will sostratos took him by the arm walk with me for a moment if youd be so kind he led his cousin out of earshot of the local before speaking in a low voice i want that skull what as hed thought it would that got rid of menedemos distraction why what would you do with it take it to athens sostratos replied at once id want theophrastos and the other philosophers at the lykeionand the ones at the academy tooto see it and study it and learn from it most philosophers have always thought the gryphon a mythical beast like a centaur or a cyclops but thathe didnt point back toward the skull for fear of showing the merchant how much he wanted it proves its as real as a horse dont you see how important that is maybe menedemos said what i dont see is how well make any money from it to the crows with money sostratos started to say but he didnt let the words out his cousin understood silver much better than he understood the relentless drive of curiosity and so sostratos chose a different tack we might get the lykeion and the academy bidding against each other to see who would own it do you think so menedemos quirked an interested eyebrow upward why not sostratos said do you suppose philosophers have any less desire for fame and any less desire to get a leg up on their rivals than ordinary men you would know better than i menedemos answered my dear you have no idea sostratos said some of the things the men of the academy did to us when i was in athens and what did your side do to them his cousin asked shrewdly oh this and that sostratos said in innocent tones but if you buy those hidesand i think you can make money from themby all means get that skull too well ill see what i can do menedemos replied but if he asks a couple of talents for it the philosophers will have to do without because i dont believe theyll come up with that kind of money now you go on back and tend to what we brought to the agora we dont want to lose customers of our own ill take care of this fellow go on now reluctantly sostratos went he wanted to stay and do the dickering himself menedemos after all didnt really care about the gryphons skull but after a moment sostratos realized that gave his cousin an advantage if he haggled himself the merchant would see how much he wanted it and would charge accordingly what better shield against gouging than indifference to his surprise the first kaunian who came up to him was interested not in dye or in perfume but in papyrus and ink in short order sostratos had sold him two round pots of ink and three twentysheet rolls of papyrus and made fifteen drakhmai what will you do with it he asked the local i aim to copy out all the city laws the man replied as things are now theyre either carved in stone or written out on wooden tablets and theyre scattered all over kaunos if we have them all in one place we can refer to them whenever we need to and the papyrus wont take up nearly so much space that sounds sostratos cast about for a word and found one that fit efficient very efficient indeed its a new world the local said seriously if we dont change with the times well go under looking pleased with himself he carried his purchases out of the market square sostratos cried the virtues of crimson dye and perfume and papyrus and inkif hed sold those to one man here he might sell them to another at the same time he kept an eye on menedemos and the man with the skins and the gryphons skull they both gestured with considerable animation they were to sostratos annoyance too far away for him to hear what they were saying then a burly man came up and asked about his perfume and he lost any sense of the dicker across the agora because he had to pay attention to the one at hand he soon recognized his customer as a brothel keeper if the girls smell good theyll get more trade and theyll be able to charge more too the fellow said of course if you try and charge me too much for your rosewater here ill never make back the price so you cant squeeze me too hard sostratos felt like squeezing the local by the neck for distracting him from the deal in which he was more interested he ended up selling the perfume for less than he might have both because he was distracted and because the brothel keeper quibbled over oboloi with the dogged persistence of a man who struck a dozen bargains every afternoon sostratos didnt lose money on the deal but he didnt make any to speak of either at last after what seemed like forever menedemos ambled back from the kaunian merchants stall aristeidas teleutas come on back to the ship with me we need to get some silver and then we need to pick up some things he led the two sailors off toward the aphroditewithout telling sostratos which things they would pick up and without giving him the chance to ask he did that on purpose sostratos thought with no small annoyance he didnt mind menedemos always taking the lead though he himself was older than his cousin he didnt enjoy standing in front of men and shouting and gesturing to urge them on to pay higher prices while menedemos relished nothing moreexcept perhaps seducing their wives but when he gives orders deliberately intended to drive me mad kaunos wasnt a big city menedemos didnt need long to return to the agora coins clinking in a leather sack he carried in his left hand his right hand rested on the hilt of a sword hed belted on aristeidas was similarly armed teleutas carried a belaying pin with the air of a man who knew what to do with it it would have taken a large band of determined robbers to separate menedemos from his money along with the sailors he strode over to the stall of the merchant with the hidesand the gryphons skull sostratos watched anxiously and tried to listen but got distracted again when a local came up and wanted to talk about the best way to make crimson dye fast to koan silk normally sostratos would have been delighted to talk shop with the fellow as things were hed never had a customer he wanted less even when the man bought a jar of dye he had to make himself remember to take the money here came menedemos carrying the striped tiger skin rolled up and tied with rope at another time thai hide by itself would have been plenty to rouse sostratos always lively curiosity here came aristeidas with a rolledup lion skin under each arm and here came teleutas lugging the gryphons skull and looking put upon as anyone who got stuck with the heaviest piece of the work would have sostratos hurried over to menedemos and kissed him on the cheek thank you o best one he exclaimed then pragmatism returning he asked what did you pay for it thirty drakhmai menedemos answered polluted whoreson wouldnt go any lower not even when i asked him if he felt like waiting twelve years or so till another mad philosopher wandered into the agora here he probably gave twentyfive to the hellene he bought it from and didnt want to part with it at a loss sostratos said exactly what i was thinking his cousin grinned at him i notice you dont deny being a mad philosopher i do love wisdom or the chance to gain some sostratos said seriously as for mad he shrugged id rather call myself mm inquisitive thoukydides had had some sharp things to say about men who called a thing by one name when it manifestly deserved another but sostratos honestly didnt think he was mad for knowledge the way say sokrates had been of course what madman ever believes be is one teleutas said ive sailed up past byzantion onto the pontos euxeinos and ive seen gryphons painted on plates along that coast and done up in jewelry up there they make em out to be pretty but any beast with a skull like thisd have to be the ugliest thing that ever hatched out of an egg now theres a question my wisdomloving cousin menedemos said do gryphons hatch from eggs or are they born alive its a question with a simple answer as far as im concerned sostratos replied i dont know an honest answer anyway menedemos said come on boys back to the akatos again well stow these prizesand the skull and then see what else we can get prizesand the skull sostratos echoed unhappily why did you buy it if you didnt think wed make anything from it because my dear youd have fussed and fumed this whole sailing season if id left it sitting there on the ground thirty drakhmai isnt too high a price to pay for a summers worth of peace and quiet menedemos answered sostratos ears got hot there were times when his cousin knew him much too well oh that thing kissidas said when menedemos and sostratos went back to the rhodian proxenos house for supper that evening ive seen it in the agora everybody in kaunos has seen it in the market square by now i daresay why in the name of the gods did you want it well menedemos usually so glib found himself at a loss for words you see that is i bought it to keep sostratos happy didnt seem reason enough not when he sat in the olive merchants andron instead of bargaining in the market square sostratos was glib enough here i want the philosophers in athens to see it it answers many questions about gryphons starting with whether theyre real or mythical beasts id always thought they were the stuff of story myself but i see i was wrong hard to have a real skull for a mythical beast kissidas said with a dry chuckle exactly so best one sostratos agreed he would have made a better merchant if everyday affairs roused the same passion in him as this oddity did of course he needs oddities to interest himhes odd himself menedemos thought his cousin went on at the same time though having a veritable gryphons skull raises as many questions as it answers those questions were for the moment forgotten when kissidas cook brought in a dogfish smothered with melted cheese and leeks to accompany his freshbaked bread menedemos made sure he ate enough bread so as not to seem a shameless opsophagos but the portion of dogfish set before him vanished with marvelous haste to his relief his host and his cousin ate their fish just as fast but after kissidas licked his fingers clean he asked what sort of questions does the gryphons skull raise it just looks like ugly old bones to me to me too menedemos thought but sostratos answered well for one thing why would gryphons make good guards for the gold of the skythians they haveor this one has at any rateteeth that would be better for grazing than for ripping and tearing as a lion might do kissidas blinked i never would have thought to look at its teeth who would sostratos is like that menedemos murmured he didnt think the olive merchant heard him to his relief he didnt think his cousin did either sostratos went on and youre right to say it looks like old bones but it doesnt feel like old bones it feels like stone and it has bits of stone stuck to it here and there why should gryphons have skulls made of stone when all other beasts have theirs made of bone all other beasts i dont know about that kissidas said name another beast with a skull of stone sostratos challenged well theres hipparkhos up in the fortress on the hill the rhodian proxenos said deadpan menedemos guffawed hes got you so he has sostratos had the grace to chuckle but then he got back to the business at hand you see why i want the philosophers to be able to examine it old bones kissidas tossed his head youll never make any silver with old bones we didnt pay that much menedemos said stretching a point and sostratos hopes we can get a couple of the philosophical schools in athens bidding against each other to see who gets to keep the gryphons skull so we may turn a profit yet he didnt really believe it but he would back his cousin against a nearstranger for your sake i hope your cousin is right the proxenos didnt sound convinced but he didnt sound as if he wanted an argument either and i hope the rest of your business went well pretty well menedemos said we dont get the prices for perfume that we would if we were farther away from rhodes but we cant do anything about that people here who want it badly can sail down to the polis and get it in the agora for the same price a rhodian would pay pity we cant let the lykeion and the academy bid up the price of that tiger hide too sostratos said wistfully well we cant menedemos wanted to make sure his cousin had no doubts about that im sure we can get more for it somewhere else sostratos dipped his head but didnt look happy menedemos went on gods only know if well ever see another gryphons skull my dear but you can be sure more tiger skins will make their way towards hellas theyre beautiful and theyre bound to make money for the fellow selling them you cant say either of those things about the skull thats true sostratos sounded a little more cheerful one of the lamps in the andron burned out making shadows swell and swoop and filling the room with the scent of hot olive oil menedemos expected kissidas to call for a slave to refill it and light it again instead the rhodian proxenos put a hand in front of his mouth to hide a yawn voice still blurry he said your pardon best ones but im going to bed its been a busy day and i have another one in front of me tomorrow he picked up another clay lamp and handed it to menedemos im sure you two can find your way to your own room tonight good night out he went thriftily dousing torches on the way not the most subtle hint ive ever seen sostratos remarked anger and amusement warring in his tone anger triumphed in menedemos as it had in akhilleus in the iliad menedemos reckoned he had better reason for it than the hero of old he didnt much want us here in the first place he growled now hes treating us shabbily on purpose some proxenos he is i dont know sostratos said he would have given us salt fish for opson were that so not that lovely little shark you cant blame him for being nervous about antigonos garrison in the fortress above the town who says i cant menedemos returned we might as well go to bed now though unless youd sooner sit in a dark andron here when this lamp goes out he got to his feet so did sostratos theyd just left the andron when someone knocked on kissidas front door whos that sostratos said softly whoever it is ill bet kissidas wishes hed go away good news doesnt come by night it isnt our worry and im not sorry it isnt menedemos headed back toward the cramped guest room they shared theyd just undressed and lain down when a cry of anguish and alarm rent the nighttime stillness gladder than ever that it wasnt his worry menedemos blew out the lamp black night enfolded the room it didnt last long someone came rushing back toward the little chamber torchlight sneaked under the bottom of the door kissidas knocked and called open up in the name of the gods menedemos got out of bed without bothering to put his chiton back on he spoke to sostratos maybe its our worry after all opening the door he addressed the rhodian proxenos in more normal tones good heavens whats happened ill tell you what kissidas was practically hopping in agitation the torch trembled in his hand ptolemaios has brought an army and a fleet up to phaselis in eastern lykia the town fell to him a few days ago and hes heading westheading this way oimoi menedemos whistled lykia like most of anatolia was held by antigonos the summer before ptolemaios general leonides had struck at alexanders oneeyed general in kilikia farther east along the southern anatolian coast antigonos son demetrios promptly drove him away but ptolemaios who ruled cyprus as well as egypt didnt seem ready to give up the fight kissidas wasnt worrying about the larger shape of the war between the marshals his concern was more immediate more personal when hipparkhos hears about this hes going to nail me to a cross he moaned i give thanks to zeus that the first man here with the news was a fellow whos bought my oil and olivesfor years from behind menedemos sostratos said if antigonos captain here in kaunos suspects the rhodian proxenos of favoring ptolemaios hell suspect a couple of real rhodians even more just my thought kissidas eagerly dipped his head you have to get awaythis very moment if you can and take me and mine with you awkwardly he went to his knees and embraced menedemos around the legs in supplication get up menedemos told him his wits worked furiously his cousin and the olive merchant were rightto a point we cant flee in the night not with half my crew in the taverns and the brothels here not unless i want to leave them behind this customer of yourshe wont go to the garrison commander with this word will he no kissidas said he does not love antigonos ah right then well sail at first light tomorrow if you and yours are aboard when we leave well take you down to rhodes menedemos said the proxenos gabbled out thanks sostratos made approving noises menedemos hardly heard either one of them only he knew how little he wanted to return to his home town sostratos stood on the aphrodites tiny foredeck peering into kaunos where is he he grumbled twilight was coming on paling the waning crescent moon kronos wandering star not far from it and zeus bright wandering star now low in the west i dont know where he is menedemos answered from the poop sostratos voice must have carried better than hed thought his cousin continued i dont much care either if hes not here by the time the sun climbs up out of the sea were sailing anyhow furies take me if im going to risk my ship in this stupid war you risked it last year in the war between syracuse and carthage sostratos thought hed reckoned menedemos utterly mad but his cousin had got away with it and made a fat profit beside maybe menedemos had learned his lesson maybemore likelyhe just saw no money in staying in kaunos aristeidas arm shot out someones coming this way stand by to cast off diokles rasped rowers be ready if those were hipparkhos soldiers approaching the merchant galley rather than kissidas and whatever companions he had with him the aphroditecould flee in a hurry along with aristeidas and everyone else aboard the akatos sostratos tried to make out who those shapes were his eyes werent bad but the lookouts were better whoever they are theyve got women with them aristeidas said see the long chitons after a moment sostratos did unless antigonos has amazon mercenaries thatll be the proxenos and his family he said a couple of rowers chuckled once sostratos had spoken though he wondered if that wasnt possible with a gryphons skull there among the aphrodites cargo what had seemed obvious myth suddenly looked like something else altogether three men three women a little boy a baby of indeterminate sex in one of the womens arms one of the men the biggest and squarest was undoubtedly kissidas one of the women would be his wife one might be a daughter the other almost without a doubt would be a daughterinlaw hardly any families reared two girls as the day got brighter and the women got closer sostratos saw they were veiled against the prying eyes of men not of their household kissidas called thank you for waiting for us my guestfriends come aboard and quickly menedemos said from his station at the stern weve got no time to waste youre probably right kissidas agreed with a sigh chances are good a slave in one of our houses will have gone up the hill to hipparkhos by now he and his companions hurried along the quay toward the ship as they boarded the olive merchant introduced the males my son hypermenes my grandson kissidas my soninlaw lykomedes son of lykophron he did his best to pretend the women werent there menedemos followed custom too doing his best not to look as if he was trying to see through those veils but be is sostratos said hes bound to be the more women cover up the more he wants to know what theyre hiding a lot of men among the hellenes felt that way but his cousin did so to a greater degree than most why dont you all go up to the foredeck menedemos said like kissidas he didnt acknowledge the women with any special words the closest he came to it was a brief addition no one will bother you there thank you kissidas said sostratos hastily descended from the foredeck and made his way back toward the stern as the rhodian proxenos and his kinsfolk came forward at least one of the women wore perfume the sweet scent of roses made him whip his head around but he couldnt even be sure which one it was cast off diokles called and the lines tying the aphroditeto the pier thumped down into the akatos at almost the same moment aristeidas said i see more people coming down toward the harbor sostratos saw them too the horsehair plumes in their bronze helmets made them look taller and more fearsome than they really were they arent coming to invite us to symposion menedemos said with commendable calm lets get out of here back oars diokles said and set the stroke with his mallet and bronze square he also called it out rhyppapai rhyppapai come on you lugs put your backs into it as if sliding through glue the aphroditebegan easing away from the pier each stroke seemed to push her a bit faster than the one before but she needed a little while to build up momentum kissidas sonor maybe it was his soninlawspoke in a nervous tenor theyre starting to run rhyppapai rhyppapaidiokles called you there someone shouted from the shore who us sostratos called as the aphroditeeased another few cubits away from the pier yes you that had to be a soldier no one else could hope to put so much authority into a shout are you the polluted rhodians more soldiers trotted down to the end of the wharf most of them carried spears which would do them no good but a few had bows and the merchant galley wasnt out of arrow range yet rhodians sostratos answered are you daft were the thetis out of kos want to buy some silk that made the fellow with the big voice pause for a moment to talk to one of his comrades then he started yelling again liar we know youve got that godsdetested kissidas on board bring him back or youll be sorry what sostratos artfully cupped a hand to his ear say that again i couldnt hear you his performance might have won applause on the comic stage but it failed to impress antigonos soldiers they wasted no time in consultation now one word came very clearly over the widening expanse of water shoot the handful of archers on the shore drew their bows and did their best sostratos thought the aphroditehad got safely out of range indeed most of the arrows splashed into the sea well short of the akatos but one shaft either shot with a superhuman tug on the bow or pushed along by a vagrant puff of breeze thudded into the ships planking a few cubits from sostratos that could have killed me he thought with a sick dizziness he recognized only belatedly as fear menedemos pulled in on one steeringoar tiller and out on the other till the aphrodites bow swung toward the south regular stroke diokles commanded and the rowers shifted from backing oars as smoothly as if theyd been working together for years the archers kept on shooting but now all their shafts fell short lower the sail from the yard menedemos called and the sailors leaped to obey the great linen square sail descended from the yard as the men released the brails that had tightly held it there the sail wasnt a single piece of linen for strength it was sewn from many smaller squares it also had light lines stretched horizontally across its front perpendicular to the brails giving it something of the appearance of a pavement made from square slabs of stone the breeze blew from the north as it usually did at this season of the year as the sail filled with wind the lines thrummed and the mast grunted in its socket as it leaned forward under the pull of the wind and got to work sostratos ascended to the poop deck menedemos grinned at him you did a good job with those soldiers he said you kept them confused till we were too far away for it to matter he snickered want to buy some silk that was foolish of me sostratos was never satisfied with his own performance i should have said we came from haiikarnassos or knidos antigonos holds all the mainland cities but kos belongs to ptolemaios dont worry about it it didnt matter his cousin said a new and unpleasant thought occurred to sostratos you dont suppose theyll send a trireme after us do you i hope not menedemos exclaimed and spat into the bosom of his tunic to avert the evil omen sostratos was a modern man who prided himself on rationality but he did the same thing itcant hurt he thought with a twinge of guilt i didnt see any triremes in the harbor diokles said before that could do much to reassure sostratos the oarmaster went on i dont know how much it matters though a pentekonter or a hemiolia packed with soldiers could do for us nicely just depends on how bad that captain wants us he was right sostratos felt it at once by menedemos dismayed expression so did he when diokles spoke of matters pertaining to the sea he almost always knew what he was talking about menedemos called oë kissidas what is it the olive merchant asked how bad does hipparkhos want you dead will he throw some of his mercenaries into a ship and come after us the blunt question made one of the women up on the foredeck begin to wail but kissidas tossed his head i dont think so now that im gone from kaunos hell just go on about his business he suspected me because i was rhodian proxenos not because i was myself if you know what i mean he paused then snarled a curse but ill bet he steals my groves and my oil press the son of a whore if ptolemaios really is coming west through lykia nobody who backs antigonos will have long to enjoy them sostratos said thats true kissidas brightened he asked how long a sail is it to rhodes do you know ive never been to your polis even though ive represented her in kaunos for years ive never been farther away than the edge of my groves if the wind holds we should be in the harbor in the early afternoon menedemos answered even if the wind doesnt hold well make it before nightfall ill put men at the oars to make sure we do in case youre wrong and hipparkhos does try to come after us the rhodian proxenosnow the exilebowed from the bottom of my heart i thank you for rescuing me and mine my pleasure menedemos replied then mischief glinted in his eyes in a voice only sostratos and diokles could hear he murmured from the heart of my bottom youre welcome diokles guffawed sostratos snorted and gave his cousin a severe look you really have read too much aristophanes for your own theres no such thing as too much aristophanes menedemos said before sostratos could rise to thatand he would have as surely as a tunny would rise to the anchovy impaled on a fishermans hookkissidas called back to the poop in plaintive tones excuse me gentlemen but does this boat always jerk and sway so he followed the question with a gulp audible all the way from the foredeck he hasnt got any stomach at all has he menedemos muttered no sostratos said he sometimes got sick in what most sailors reckoned moderate seas but this light pitching didnt bother him in the least good thing it is only a days journey to a seasick man of course only was the wrong word the voyage would seem to last forever his cousin must have been thinking along the same lines for he spoke up urgently if you have to heave o best one in the name of the gods lean out over the rail before you do good thing weve got a following breeze diokles said with wry amusement otherwise youd have to explain the difference between leeward and windwardif he didnt find out by getting it blown back into his face menedemos laughed the callous laugh of a man with a bronze stomach one lesson like that and you remember forever well before noon kissidas and one of the women of his household bent over the rail puking from his post at the steering oars menedemos avidly stared forward trying to see what she looks like without her veil sostratos asked his voice dry well of course his cousin answered how often do you get the chance to look at a respectable woman unveiled unwrapped you might say you might sostratos said as another spasm of vomiting wracked the woman tell me though my dearif she came back here right now and wanted to give you a kiss how would you like that menedemos started to say something then checked himself mm maybe not right now but he kept looking ahead after a moment he gave a dismissive shrug besides shes not very pretty she must have brought a fat dowry the familiar bulk of the island of rhodes swelled in the south dead ahead sostratos said we will get in not long after noon so we will menedemos replied sostratos gave him a curious look arent you glad to be able to spend a couple of extra days at home no menedemos said goodness sostratos thought as his cousin steered the akatos south without another word and with his face as set and hard as iron hisquarrel with his father must he worse than i thought oöp diokles called and the rowers rested at their oars sailors tossed lines to a couple of longshoremen who made the aphroditefast to one of the quays in the great harbor of rhodes what are you doing here one of the longshoremen asked looping the coarse flax rope round a post nobody thought youd be back till fall get in trouble up in kaunos he leered at die merchant galley and at menedemos in particular we had to get out in a hurry all right menedemos said and the longshoremans leer got wider you havent heard the news then menedemos thought he smiled too but only to himself after a suitably dramatic pause he went on ptolemaios has an army and a fleet operating in lykia hes taken phaselis and hes heading west hell probably take the whole country antigonos garrison commander in kaunos was going to seize the rhodian proxenos there and maybe us too so we grabbed kissidas and his family and got away ptolemaios is in lykia that wasnt just the one longshoreman that was almost everyone within earshot speaking as if in chorus heads swung to the northeast as if men expected to see ptolemaios from where they stood an excited gabble rose that will be all over the polis by sunset sostratos remarked it should be its important menedemos said now we ought to take kissidas and his people to the kaunian proxenos here do you know who handles kaunos affairs in rhodes isnt it that moneychanger named hagesidamos sostratos said hell be easy to findhell have a table in the agora where foreigners can turn their silver into rhodian money and where he can turn a profit menedemos added moneychangers never starve he raised his voice kissidas oe kissidas gather up your kin and come along with us well take you to the kaunian proxenos here hell make arrangements for all of you send the gangplank across to the pier kissidas said when i reach dry land again ill kiss the ground menedemos gave the order bald head shining in the sun kissidas hurried up onto the quay followed by his kinsfolk he bustled down it to the end stepped off onto the soil of rhodes and kept his promise sostratos took an obolos out of his mouth and gave it to a fellow standing on the wharf go to my fathers house near the temple to demeter in the north end of the city let him know weve returned and that well see him soon menedemos father lives next door tell him too yes tell my father were home menedemos echoed with a singular lack of enthusiasm eager to put off the moment when he saw philodemos again he went on lets go scare up old hagesidamos he started up the gangplank himself his cousin followed but kept looking back over his shoulder are you sure things will be all right here i know you menedemos laughed in his face you dont mean things you mean your precious gryphons skull answer me this my dear what thief would be mad enough to steal it sostratos ears turned red i think the skull is worth something he said with dignity i think the philosophers in athens will agree with me too anyone else menedemos asked sostratos proved his basic honesty by tossing his head menedemos laughed again it wasnt likely and he knew it he waved to kissidas come along with my cousin and me well take you to the proxenos having done that though he had little choice but to go home his father waited for him in the courtyard i heard you were home philodemos said when he came in but i havent heard why yet ill tell you menedemos said he plunged into the tale heading for the andron as he did and so he finished a little later i didnt see what else i could do except bring kissidas and his family back here to rhodes his father studied him hes looking through me not at me menedemos thought nervously somewhere outside the mens room a woodpecker drummed on a tree trunk the sudden noise made menedemos start no need to jump son philodemos said i dont see what else you could have done either if a mans made himself your guestfriend you cant very well leave him behind to be harmed by his enemies menedemos tried not to show how relieved he was my thought exactly he took us in even though he knew it might anger antigonos captain and then this news of ptolemaios yes philodemos dipped his head thats part of the picture too if ptolemaios is coming west across lykia it puts the war right on our doorstep i wish it were farther away if he and antigonos start hammering away at each other next door to us one of them or the other is bound to notice what fine harbors we have and what useful subjects wed make i wish i thought you were wrong sir menedemos wished that for more reasons than one not only did he worry about his polis he also worried about agreeing with his father to keep from thinking about it he changed the subject what sort of opson will sikon have for us tonight i dont know philodemos replied he ran out to the market square as soon as that fellow from the harbor came here shouting that the aphroditehad come in he was muttering something as he went something about why hadnt anyone told him he rolled his eyes you know what cooks are like everybody knows what cooks are like menedemos said like any prosperous households cook sikon was a slave but because he ruled the kitchen like a king he often acted as if he were master of the whole house menedemos rose from his chair if youll excuse me father i think ill go in there and find out what hes up to good luck even ironwilled philodemos often lost his skirmishes with sikon the cook was a middleaged man on the plump sidewho would have wanted a man who didnt care for the meals he turned out snooping are you he said when menedemos stuck his head in the door i live here every now and again menedemos said mildly he didnt want to quarrel with the cook either a man who did that often regretted it in short order oh its you young master sikon relaxed i thought itd be your stepmother he snorted sounding amazingly like a badtempered donkey philodemos second wife was ten years younger than her stepson the cook went on you wont pitch a fit if i spend a couple of oboloi so the house has something better than sprats or salt fish for opson baukis takes the business of being a wife seriously menedemos didnt want to criticize the girl what he wanted to do had she been another mans any other mans wife he would have gone after her without hesitation he knew himself well enough to be sure of that but even he fought shy of adultery with his own fathers new spouse seriously sikon threw his hands in the air youd think wed all eat nothing but barley porridge for the next ten years if i buy something tasty can you talk some sense into her young master your father doesnt want to do it thats pretty plain she just looks down her nose at me the way free people do with slaves sometimes but maybe shed listen to you maybe menedemos said uncomfortably he didnt want reasons to talk with baukis he wanted reasons to stay away from her but sikon had given him an opening to shift the subject and he seized it what sort of tasty things did you find this afternoon some nice shrimpthey were still wriggling when i got em sikon answered im going to glaze them with honey and oregano the way your father likes and a fellow there in the market had the first good eels ive seen this spring what do you say to eel pie baked with cabbage and mushrooms and silphium from kyrene and a cheesecake to use up the rest of the honey i got for the glaze what do i say i say hurry up and cook and quit wasting your time talking to me eels menedemos had all he could do not to lick his chops like a hungry dog he didnt ask what the seafood had cost all he wanted to do was eat it and he did along with his father in the andron he supposed sikon also sent some of the splendid supper to baukis in the womens quarters she would surely find out from philodemos what the cook had bought sharing the bounty might make her better inclined to him if anything could that would as he usually did menedemos woke before sunrise the next morning he went to the kitchen for some barley rollsleftovers from sitos at supperand olive oil and wine for breakfast carrying them out to the courtyard he sat down on a stone bench there and watched the sky get light he would have done the same thing lying on the aphrodites poop deck after a night spent at sea a couple of slaves dipped their heads to him as they ducked into the kitchen for their morning meal they ate the same sort of breakfast he did philodemos wasnt the sort of master who gave them a precisely measured ration of flour every day and made sure they didnt sneak into the kitchen to supplement it to make up for that generosity he worked them hard when a laughing dove fluttered down into the courtyard menedemos tossed a small chunk of roll onto the ground in front of it it walked over head bobbing examined the morsel and ate it they were very tame birds had sikon tossed it crumbs it would have been with a view toward netting it for a meal someone came down the stairs and out into the courtyard tame or not the dove took off wings whirring good day menedemos baukis said good day menedemos answered gravely how are you his stepmother asked the title applied to a girl who couldnt have had more than sixteen years was as absurd as sikons snort had made it she was no great beauty and even at sixteen had hardly more breasts than a boy im well thanks menedemos kept his tone formal he knew what his father saw in her dowry family connection the chance for another son or two he was much less sure what he saw in baukis himself maybe nothing but the chance to outrage his father in the greatest possible way but maybe something more too doing his best not to think about that he asked and you she thought before answering well enough she was no fool the way she said even commonplace things showed that and so menedemos jeered at himself are you sostratos to look for what a woman has between her ears before you look for what she has between her legs baukis went on i didnt expect to see you back in rhodes so soon i didnt expect to be in one of antigonos cities so close to where ptolemaios started his campaign menedemos replied this endless war is liable to be the death of trade she said that would be bad for rhodes and especially bad for this family true menedemos agreed no she was no fool plenty of men who stood up and blathered in the assembly couldnt see so clearly her expression sharpened you surprised sikon when you came home too do you know how much he paidfor last nights shrimp and eels menedemos tossed his head no all i know is they were delicious expensive too baukis said if we make less money because of the war how long can we afford such fancy opson quite a while menedemos said in some alarm however young she was his fathers second wife took her duties as household manager most seriously shed already had several rows with the cook menedemos went on were still a long way from poor you know now we are baukis answered but how long will we stay that way if we make less and spend more id better have a word with sikon sooner or later hell have to listen to me she strode off toward the kitchen menedemos gaze followed her she didnt have a boys hips and backside not at all and here inside the house she didnt veil herself against the prying eyes of men it was practically like seeing her naked all the time menedemos manhood stirred baukis came out of the kitchen with bread wine and an indignant expression on her face hes not in there yet she complained he spends too much money and hes lazy too she sat down on the bench hardly more than a cubit away from menedemos and began to eat her breakfast does she know what i feel menedemos wondered as he had ever since realizing it himself the autumn before he didnt think so but is she sitting there to tease me is she sitting there because she has something in mind too he had more than a little practice seducing other mens wives here he didnt want to use what he knew he wished he were aboard the aphrodite a steeringoar tiller in each hand wave and wind and the chance of pirates all he had to worry about none of them seemed so dangerous as the woman beside him gulping down the last of his wine he got to his feet and said im off as long as im back in rhodes i have a couple of men i need to see all right baukis went on eating menedemos withdrawal felt uncomfortably like headlong retreat one of the advantages of being a free hellene was having slaves to do the work one didnt care to do oneself sostratos took that for granted his slave a karian named arlissos did not is it much farther boss he whined in almost unaccented greek this polluted thing gets heavier every step i take such illogical arguments were the wrong sort to use against sostratos who answered thats impossible and for good measure added and since no place inside the walls of rhodes is more than about ten stadia from anywhere else inside the walls youre not walking all that far i bet it seems farther to me than it does to you arlissos said darkly sostratos didnt deign to reply to that he was just glad hed had arlissos drape the gryphons skull in a square of sailcloth before taking it through the streets of rhodes otherwise people would have stopped him every plethronmore likely every few cubits and pestered him with questions arlissos seemed more inclined to pester him with complaints and then once we get where were going ill have to lug it all the way back not if i break it over your head sostratos thought but he couldnt do that no matter how tempting it might be so far as he knew this was the only gryphons skull ever seen by hellenes he couldnt afford to have anything happen to it youll have plenty of time to rest and loaf when we get where were going he said in fact if you slide back to the kitchen you can probably wheedle the cook out of some wine and maybe some figs or some nuts while youre at it the slave brightened though he didnt seem to want to show sostratos he was any happier my arms are going to come out of their sockets he grumbled oh be quiet sostratos said and then theres that little temple to hephaistos so its only another couple of blocks theyd come into the western part of the city most of the way from sostratos house to the gymnasion but sostratos didnt intend to strip off his clothes and run or wrestle he exercised as little as he could get away with not least because menedemoseasily outdid him when they went to the gymnasion together sostratos was larger than his cousin but menedemos was far quicker and more graceful i think this is the house sostratos said he had trouble being sure one blank housefront looked very much like another if im wrong he thought as he knocked on the door whoever answers can probably set me right somewhere inside the house a dog started barking arlissos set down the gryphons skull so he could stretch and show how putupon he was hed just picked up the skull again when somebody said yes what is it through the door is this the house of damonax son of polydoros sostratos asked yes who wants to know the door still didnt open sostratos gave his own name adding ive brought something your master may be interested in seeing wait said the man on the other side of the door sostratos duly waited so did arlissos who exuded silent reproach after a bit the door did swing open on the lengths of doweling that turned in holes in the floor and the lintel hell see you damonaxs slave reported by his guttural accent and narrow swarthy face he was probably a phoenician hes in the courtyard come with me hail sostratos damonax said when the doorman brought the newcomers into the courtyard he was a handsome man about ten years older than sostratos his hairline beginning to recede at the temples pointing to the sailclothshrouded bundle arlissos bore he asked what have you got there like sostratos his doric greekthe dialect spoken in rhodeshad an attic overlay hed studied at the lykeion for several years returning to his home polis the year after sostratos arrived like a conjurer performing at a symposion sostratos whipped away the square of sailcloth behold he said a gryphons skull really youre joking damonax got up off the bench where hed been sitting and came over for a closer look he tapped the skull with his fingernail no by the dog of egypt i see youre not where on earth did you find it kaunos sostratos answered and explained how he and menedemos had come by the skull i brought it here because you also studied under theophrastos what do you make of it i wish you could have brought that tiger skin you mentioned too damonax said wistfully if going out to trade can lead to such marvels as this the hellenes who look down their noses at it may have to think again most upperclass hellenes looked down their noses at merchants the life of a gentleman farmer was the ideal with an overseer and slaves to do the actual work giving the gentleman farmer himself the money and leisure he needed to live as he would beholden to no one damonax wore two heavy gold rings the clasps of his sandals were likewise golden roses scented the olive oil he rubbed into his skin he lived the ideal acknowledging that envying it sostratos said thank you o best one thank you for letting me see this damonax pointed to the bench on which hed been sitting then spoke to arlissos why dont you put the skull down there so your master and i can examine it as we please ill gladly do that sir the karian sighed with relief as he set down the skull to his own slave damonax said bring us some wine phelles and some olives or whatever else you find in the kitchen nodding his head as barbarians often did to show agreement the phoenician hurried away damonax leaned close to the gryphons skull and tapped it again it feels more like stone than bone he remarked noticed the same thing sostratos answered i dont know what it means except that the skull is old and was buried for a long time not just old arlissos muttered heavy who was the philosopher damonax asked who found petrified seashells on the mountainside and realized the ocean must have covered it long ago i should know that sostratos thumped his forehead with the heel of his hand a pestilence i do know that he snapped his fingers then suddenly grinned xenophanes of kolophon thats who it was euge damonax exclaimed very well done indeed in fact i couldnt have come up with the name if youd given me to antigonos nastiest torturer phelles came back with a wooden tray on which he carried a bowl of olives and two cups of wine he set them down on the bench by the gryphons skull seeing no wine for himself arlissos took the tray from phelles startled hands here my friend sostratos slave said let me carry this to the kitchen for you sostratos popped an olive into his mouth to hide a smile if arlissos didnt end up with a snack he would be surprised damonax pointed to the backprojecting horn pity this bit seems broken off i wonder what the beast would have looked like when it was alive not so pretty as gryphons are supposed to be i suspect sostratos said and what do you make of its teeth i didnt pay any attention to them damonax confessed as sostratos had in the market square at kaunos the other rhodian picked up the skull and turned it over for a closer look when he put it down on the bench again his face was thoughtful doesnt have much in the way of fangs does it i thought the same thing sostratos said how is it supposed to guard the gold at the edge of the world and fight off thieves with its claws perhaps damonax suggested and sostratos dipped his headthat was a good idea and it hadnt occurred to him the older man looked from him to the gryphons skull and back again tell me best one now that youve got this remarkable thing here what did you have in mind doing with it are you going to keep it at your house and tell stories about it the rest of your life no by zeus sostratos exclaimed ah damonax looked wise then youll want to sell it i expect try as he would he couldnt keep a slightly dismissive tone from his voice no matter what he says he really does look down on traders sostratos realized smoothly damonax went on i could give you a good price for it myself as a matter of fact so you can keep it here and tell your own stories about it sostratos thought he tossed his head i was going to take it to athens to let the philosophers at the lykeion and the academy examine it as if he hadnt spoken damonax said how does two minai sound two hundred drakhmai sostratos tried hard not to show how startled he was menedemos he was certain would have sold the gryphons skull on the spot and spent the next year bragging about the profit hed squeezed from worthless ugly bones damonax must have taken astonishment for rejection for he said well if you wont take two what about three part of sostratos the part that made him a pretty good merchant wondered how high damonax would go to buy the skull the other part the part that valued knowledge for its own sake quailed in horror gods be praised my family is well enough off that i dont have to sell it for the first decent offer that comes along youre very kind he said by which he meant youre very greedy but i really do intend to take it to athens id be on my way there now if my ship hadnt had to bring the rhodian proxenos and his kin here from kaunos four minai damonax said hopefully sostratos tossed his head again damonax sighed youre serious about going to athens arent you yes of course i am sostratos replied isnt that interesting and here i thought someone who traded things for money would trade anything for money damonax didnt seem to think sostratos might take that for an insult the older man hadnt quite called him a whore but hed come close damonax continued you never did explain why you had to get the rhodian proxenos out of kaunos didnt i thinking back sostratos realized he hadnt he told the other man about ptolemaios descent on lykia ahthat was news to me damonax said are you sure you wont reconsider my offer i wish you luck getting to athens from here as soon as the word spreads the aegean will be full of war galleys how much will ptolemaios and antigonos sailors care about a gryphons skull sostratos grimaced ptolemaios fleet was based on kos while antigonos navy sailed from ports on the ionian islands farther north and on the mainland of anatolia damonax was bound to be right those ships would clash sostratos said were free were autonomous were neutral no ones ships have any business interfering with us certainly thats how we rhodians feel damonax was polite as the ideal landed gentleman too that didnt keep him from asking the next obvious question do you think the marshals captains or the pirates they hire to do their scouting and raiding will agree with us i cant answer that sostratos answered in lieu of saying not a chance they will but he went on the aphroditewill try to get to athens though you are a stiffnecked fellow arent you damonax said suppose i were to give you six minai for that skull i didnt bring it here to try to sell it to you sostratos raised his voice arlissos where have you gone and disappeared to when the karian slave emerged his cheeks were full as a dormouses are we leaving already he asked in disappointed tones around a mouthful of something or other im afraid we must sostratos pointed to the gryphons skull wrap the sailcloth around that and lets gets going he wanted to get out of there as fast as he could damonax had shown even more interest in the skull than hed expected and not of the sort hed looked for if the gentleman farmer suddenly called out half a dozen hulking slaves if that idea hadnt yet occurred to damonax sostratos thought it wise to leave before it did are you sure i cant persuade you to let me take that skull off your hands damonax said i offered a good price six minai is a lot of money i know o best one sostratos answered but i want to take it to athens and who knows i may do better there he didnt believe it for a moment by damonaxs expression neither did he but the older man didnt try to keep sostratos from leaving and no burly slaves appeared to rape away the gryphons skull once out in the street again sostratos breathed a long sigh of relief he and arlissos hadnt gone more than a few steps back toward his own house before the slave asked did he really say hed give you six hundred drakhmai for these miserable old bones yes thats what he said sostratos dipped his head and you turned him down arlissos sounded disbelieving he sounded more than disbelieving he sounded as if hed just witnessed a prodigy by zeus labraundeus master i dont think youd turn down six hundred drakhmai for me he might well have been right karian slaves were cheap and easy to come by in rhodes while the gryphons skull wasand sostratos was convinced would remainunique instead of saying so straight out sostratos tried a joke well arlissos you have to understand it eats a lot less than you do six hundred drakhmai arlissos said sostratos wondered if the slave had even heard him six hundred drakhmai and he said no he looked down at the shrouded skull and spoke to it as if they were equals in more than price hellenes are crazy old bone you know that sostratos indignantly started to deny it then he thought about what menedemos would say if his cousin found out hed turned down six minai for the gryphons skull menedemos would be certain at least one hellene was raving mad no menedemos said impatiently when sostratos began to pester him again we cant sail for athens as soon as you want but his cousin began no he repeated i want to get out of rhodes too but we cant not right now have you seen these new gemstones coming in from egypt the ones called emeralds ive heard of them i havent seen any yet sostratos replied well my dear youd better if you think you can pry me out of rhodes before i pry some emeralds out of this roundship captain who has some menedemos declared but the gryphons skull sostratos protested no menedemos tossed his head his shadow tossed too and frightened a butterfly from a flower in the courtyard garden of lysistratos house he watched it flitter away then resumed the skulls been buried since before the trojan war we talked about that whether it gets to athens now or next month or month after that doesnt matter so much whether i can get my hands on these emeralds does that is logical sostratos admitted then when menedemos hoped that meant he would be reasonable he added but i still dont like it too bad menedemos said heartlessly too heartlessly he put his cousins back up what makes these emeralds so special sostratos demanded theyre fine gems thats what menedemos answered theyre as fine as rubies except theyre green not red theyre greener than green garnets theyre as green as as he was stuck for a comparison till he plucked a leaf from one of the plants in the garden as this thats my sisters mint and shed give you a piece of her mind if she saw you picking sprigs sostratos said how immodest menedemos said except for her wedding he hadnt seen erinna unveiled since she was a little girl she does speak her mind sostratos said not without a certain pride and she was probably up there in the womens quarters listening to every word said here in the courtyard women of good family might not get out much but that didnt mean they had no way to find outand to influencewhat went on around them lets give her a chance to talk behind our backs then menedemos said till youve seen these stones you have no idea why im in such an uproar about them thrasyllos has no idea im in such an uproar you understand and ill thank you kindly not to give the game away you know me better than that i hope sostratos sounded affronted thrasyllos is the man who has these emeralds thats right hes just in to rhodes from alexandria with a round ship full of egyptian wheat why has he got them then sostratos asked he gets cagey about that menedemos answered i think one of his kinsmen works in the mine somewhere out in the desert east of the nile so these may be unofficial emeralds then that thought did cross my mind yes sostratos eyes narrowed craftily lots of hellenes from egypt who can get ptolemaios ear come through rhodes if you have to you might want to point that out to the marvelous thrasyllos youre a demon arent you menedemos voice rose in admiration i should have thought of that myself they left the house and headed down toward the harbor a route menedemos had taken ever since he was old enough to toddle along after his father he didnt care to think about that now he didnt like to think about anything having to do with philodemos but the journey was as familiar to him as any in the polis could be there stood mnesipolis the smith banging away at something while his fire sent smoke up into the sky there was the usual crowd of gabbers and loungers outside the shop of pythion the cobbler sostratos made the remark he usually made too sokrates taught outside a cobblers shop just like this one in athens they still show you the place that used to be simons pythion can teach you everything you want to know about shoes menedemos said can he teach me whats true and whats good and whats beautiful and why certainlyabout shoes youre no help and neither is pythion yes he is if the sole of my sandal is rippednot that i wear sandals very often what about your own soul instead of playing word games with his cousin menedemos picked a stone up out of the street and chucked it at a couple of scrawny dogs that were squabbling over some garbage by a wall the stone hit the wall with a sharp crack one of the dogs ran off the other gulped down whatever theyd been fighting about then it too trotted away agathippos bakery was as smoky as mnesipolis smithy but the sweet smell of baking bread made menedemos forgive the smoke a goggleeyed gecko clung to the wall at agathippos a crow tried to grab it but it scurried into a crack in the mud brick and the bird flew away unhappy down by the great harbor every other building seemed to house a tavern a man stood pissing against a wall by one of them a drunk lay asleep in the street outside another sostratos clucked disapprovingly and said there is a man with no selfcontrol cant argue with you menedemos said getting a bellyful of wine is one thing getting blinddrunk in the morning he tossed his head no thanks gulls and terns wheeled overhead mewling and skrawking a pelican its wingspan as wide as a man was tall flapped majestically by shorebirds skittered here and there with nervous little steps now and then pausing to peck at bugs or small crabs menedemos pointed ahead theres thrasyllos ship the aura fair wind eh sostratos lip curled he ought to call her the breaks wind menedemos let out a yip of startled laughter sostratos went on how can the skipper of a ship that looks like that have any real jewels hes probably trying to sell you green glass the ship wasnt much to look at the eyes at the bow needed repainting which gave her a sad half blind appearance the goosehead ornament on the round ships sternpost hadnt been touched up any time lately either her unpainted timber was gray with age even so menedemos said youll see he raised his voice oë thrasyllos you there where else would i be the auras captain came up on deck he was a lean little man with a sailors sundarkened skin and a narrow worried face hail menedemos whos your friend my cousin menedemos answered and introduced sostratos he wanted to see your stones too that seemed better than saying he thinks youre a fraud hail sostratos said politely but his voice held no warmth at all well come aboard both of you thrasyllos didnt sound especially happy either he wasnt shy about explaining why either the fewer people who know about this business the better come on come on my crews off getting drunk and getting laid we can talk the aura could probably carry ten times as much as the aphrodite even so menedemos wouldnt have traded his akatos for the merchantman for anything in the world the round ship lived up to her description with a beam close to a third of her length even with a fair wind behind her she would waddle along like a fat old man and shed be slower yet struggling to make headway against contrary breezes an amphora with a sail menedemos muttered as he strode down the gangplank amphorai have better lines than this floating hipbath ever dreamt of sostratos answered also in a low voice but thrasyllos big ugly ship had certain advantages of its own he had a much smaller crew than menedemos needed on the aphrodite for he required no rowers only men to handle the enormous square sail now brailed up against the yard that kept his expenses down and meant he could haul cargo that wouldnt have been profitable aboard the merchant galley thrasyllos also enjoyed more comfort than menedemos did he had a real deckhouse on the poop and could sleep in a bed even if the aura had to spend a night at sea menedemos didnt mind occasionally wrapping himself in his himation and sleeping on the timbers but he could see how other men might show my cousin these emeralds he said as he came up to the round ships captain lets go inside the deckhouse thrasyllos said nervously you never can tell who might be watching menedemos was willing but sostratos tossed his head no the light wont be any good in there if im going to look at these stones i want to be able to do a proper job of it my cousin has a point menedemos said oh all right thrasyllos didnt sound happy about it he kept peering around the harbor as if he expected ptolemaios himself to emerge from behind a careened fishing boat here he reached into a leather sack with a drawstring mouth took out a couple of stones and set them in menedemos palm as if not trusting sostratos to touch them let me see sostratos said menedemos handed him the emeralds whether thrasyllos did or not he knew his cousin was almost painfully reliable he also knew just at a glance that thrasyllos was showing his biggest and finest gems one of them was wide as his fingernail the other only a tiny bit smaller both had the astonishing deep rich green color that had drawn his eye when the captain from egypt first showed him the stones interesting sostratos said keeping his voice as neutral as he could make it he was a merchant he knew better than to show any sort of enthusiasm but he couldnt help adding they are gemstones of a sort no doubt about it i said so menedemos told him so you did sostratos gave him a measuring stare but youve been known to how should i put it to let your enthusiasm run away with you at least i have enthusiasms youre as coldblooded as a frog were they alone menedemos might have had a good deal more than that to say sostratos wasnt the real opponent here though thrasyllos was and so menedemos contented himself with adding you see why im interested in them i can see why you might be anyhow sostratos looked at thrasyllos my cousin didnt tell me what youre asking for them thrasyllos licked his lips a mina apiece he said a pound of silver sostratos made a production of returning the emeralds im sorry o marvelous one but i have to tell you i think youre quite mad brekekekex koax koax menedemos said softlythe noise of the chorus of frogs in aristophanes play sostratos ignored him and thrasyllos plainly had no idea what the nonsense words meant the captain of the aura said you wouldnt talk like that if you know what my nephew went through to sneak these out of the mines he stuck em up his arse is what he did then dosed himself with poppy juice so he wouldnt have to take a shit for a couple of days till he was well away from there sostratos unobtrusively rubbed the palm of his hand on his chiton menedemos fought down laughter his cousin had always been a little on the prissy side but menedemos was using sostratos as a weapon against thrasyllos here and so he said they are interesting but your price is way out of line somebody will pay it thrasyllos said but he sounded none too confident somebody will give your name to ptolemaios is what will happen menedemos said and thrasyllos flinched as if hed hit him pressing his advantage menedemos went on hes not down in alexandriahes right over there in lykia with a big fleet you think you can outrun his war galleys in this wallowing scow good luck best one menedemos and i now we know how to keep quiet sostratos added his tone suggesting they were the only people in the whole world who did menedemos dipped his head in solemn agreement thrasyllos licked his lips again his shoulders stiffened though menedemos would have bet he was going to be stubborn but one of the rhodian dock loungers chose that moment to wave and call out oë menedemos what is it moiragenes menedemos asked impatiently the shabby skinny man couldnt have played his part better had menedemos paid him a mina of silver you hear the latest he said ptolemaios just took xanthos in lykia away from old oneeye and they say hes going to move on kaunos too no as a matter of fact i hadnt heard that menedemos answered watching thrasyllos much more closely than he seemed to the news hit the merchant skipper like a twentymina rock flung from a catapult how do you know its true sostratos asked moiragenes menedemos wished his cousin hadnt chosen that moment to play the historian fellow who brought the news is called euxenides of phaselis moiragenes answered he got out of his home town two jumps ahead of ptolemaios got out of xanthos one jump ahead of him and he didnt want to try his luck at kaunos so he came here instead he waved and went on down the pier to pass the news to someone else well well menedemos said to thrasyllos isnt that interesting ptolemaios wont come here thrasyllos said of course not menedemos said in soothing tones gods be praised rhodes really is a free and autonomous polis but sooner or later youre going to have to sail away do you want to deal with traders whose grandfathers were in the business of buying and selling things or will you take a chance on getting a little more from somebody who might cut your throat or might just blab instead to the crows with you thrasyllos whispered youre not a man youre an evil spirit all right if you dont want to dicker menedemos took a few steps toward the gangplank sostratos followed him he hadnt left the auras deck before he heard the word hed been hoping for wait thrasyllos croaked for dramatic effect menedemos did take a couple of steps up the gangplank before pausing even then he asked sostratos do you think its worth our while no sostratos said and menedemos could have kissed him in lieu of that he spent a little while taking his cousin around so he could stay and haggle with thrasyllos sostratos did such a good job of acting reluctant menedemos wondered if he really was no matter menedemos got his own way as he was accustomed to doing well if you wont pay a mina apiece what will you pay thrasyllos demanded when menedemos and sostratos finally came back to him how many of those emeralds have you got to sell menedemos asked in turn fourteen thrasyllos said how big an arsehole do you think my nephew has youd know that better than i o best one menedemos murmured sostratos almost succeeded in turning a guffaw into a cough the joke fortunately went right by thrasyllos menedemos said i havent seen all fourteen of these stones yet you know im sure the ones i have seen are the best youve got so the others are going to be worth less no such thing thrasyllos said but his show of indignation couldnt have sounded convincing even to himself for he didnt push it ill give you oh two minai for the lot of em menedemos said two pounds of silver free and clear for youor one for you one for your nephew if youre in a generous mood two minai the captain of the aura echoed this time his anger was altogether unfeigned you timewasting whipworthy bastard get off my ship and take your kinsman with you if i had a dog id set him on you both well what do you think theyre worth i already told you a mina apiece fourteen minai all told and i already told you im not going to pay that much what would you take im gambling remember these stones are new so i dont know what i can resell them for to the crows with you palthats not my worry thrasyllos hesitated then went on i wouldnt take a khalkos not a single copper less than twelve minai for the lot of them still too much still far too much menedemos said hed been afraid the roundship captain wouldnt come down at all that would have meant hed have to go up first and would have shown weakness for he would have gone uphe wanted those stones now he could say i might give you three and not worry thrasyllos had weakened first he got the emeralds for five minai fifty drakhmai thief thrasyllos ground out even as he clasped menedemos hand to seal the bargain by no means menedemos said though he was sure he would turn a handsome profit on the deal ptolemaios wont hear about this even if he brings his whole fleet into the harbor here that made thrasyllos nervous all over again as menedemos had hoped it would he turned to sostratos would you be so kind as to get the gentleman his silver while i wait here with him ill make sure he doesnt change his mind was what he meant sostratos knew as much he knew more than that for as he dipped his head he said if i get it your father wont hear about it quite so soon maybe menedemos waved him away sostratos went a grin on his face menedemos didnt like yielding him the last word but liked squabbling with him in front of a stranger even less when sostratos got back he wore a sword on his hip and had a couple of burly slaves with him even in lawabiding rhodes carrying five and a half minai of silver was not to be taken lightly here you are sostratos said handing thrasyllos the fat leather sack hed brought menedemos held out his hand and thrasyllos gave him the much smaller sack with the emeralds before leaving the auras deck menedemos opened the sack poured the stones into the palm of his hand and counted them dont you trust me thrasyllos asked in aggrieved tones twelve thirteen fourteen menedemos muttered then having satisfied himself he replied of course i do best one now i trust you better to be safe though safe the roundship captain echoed i dont think ill ever feel safe again youd better go now before one of my sailors comes back and wonders who you are and what youre doing here just as you say menedemos answered if this wasnt thrasyllos first smuggling venture he would have been amazed i wonder if i could blackmail him into giving us the emeralds for nothing he thought more than a little reluctantly he tossed his head hed made a bargain come on sostratos thrasyllos dashed into the deckhouse with his silver no doubt to stow it in the safest most secret place he could find as menedemos and sostratos went down the pier sostratos said you were thinking about squeezing him even harder werent you i saw it in your eyes who me menedemos said in his most innocent tones they both laughed when menedemos got home he found his father waiting for him in the courtyard lets see those gemstones you just bought philodemos said so much for keeping things quiet menedemos thought sostratos must have told his father why he needed the money and uncle lysistratos would have hotfooted it next door to give philodemos the news here you are sir menedemos said and handed his father the little sack hed got from thrasyllos as he had himself philodemos poured the emeralds out into the palm of his hand menedemos had brought them up close to his face for a better look his father didnt philodemos held them out at arms length even then he grumbled his sight had lengthened over the past few years but at last he dipped his head youll get some money from jewelers and rich men sure enough how much did you pay for the lot of em six minai five and a half father menedemos answered you could have done worse philodemos allowed high praise from him inspiration smote menedemos he said why dont you keep one of the stones father and get it made into a ring or a bracelet for your new wife shed like that id betitd be something not many rhodian women could match only after the words were spoken did he pause to wonder what sort of inspiration that had been but philodemos to his great relief noticed nothing out of the ordinary do you know thats not a bad idea his father said women are fond of trinkets he eyed menedemos you know all about what women are fond of dont you that was just general sarcasm philodemos sounded about as pleased as he ever did no man knows all about what women are fond of menedemos said with great conviction i may have found out a little something though his father snorted enough to get you into trouble from halikarnassos to taras enough to get me into worse trouble right here at home if i let it menedemos thought his father went on here pick a nice one for me and held out his hand my eyes arent up to such things these days this one has a fine color menedemos said holding up an emerald so it does philodemos agreed i can see it better when you hold it than when its in my own hand isnt that a sorry business old age is bitter no doubt about it baukis will be happy i think menedemos said will she find out this was my idea and not my fathers i cant very well tell her and half of methe sensible half im suredoesnt want her to philodemos thoughts were going down a different track whats a fourteenth part of five hundred and fifty drakhmai i cant do that in my head neither can i menedemos said sostratos probably could never mind theres a counting board in the andron ill figure it out there his father walked over to the mens chamber where sure enough an abacus lay on a table philodemos flicked beads back and forth in their grooves thirtynine drakhmaia couple of oboloi over in fact ill have to move the silver from my own money to the business why bother menedemos said because im buying it from the business thats why philodemos said because lysistratos would bellow like a bull and roar like a lion if i didntand because hed be right when he did never cheat the business son not if you want to stay in business all right menedemos dipped his head father is as stern with himself as he is with everybody else he thought that made philodemos more admirable but hardly easier or more comfortable to live with his father pointed to the leather sack that held the rest of the emeralds where do you think you can get the best price for those well sostratos is wild to go to athens on account of his gryphons skull that thing philodemos snorted once more on a different note he ought to pay for it from his personal funds instead of sticking the business with the cost he thinks he can get these two different schools of philosophy bidding against each other menedemos said his father snorted again moonshine nothing else but i dont know menedemos said you never can tell with philosophers who can guess what they might want and how much theyd pay for it he quoted from aristophanes clouds i walk the air and contemplate the sun for never might i rightly discover the astronomical phenomena if i didnt hang up my mind and mix up my subtle thought with the air it resembles but if i examined whats up above while i was down on the ground id never find anything for the earth by force drags toward itself the juice of thought this same thing happens also with cresses he couldnt held smiling he loved aristophanes absurdities cresses his father said whats he talking about philosophy or salad some of each i think menedemos answered but athens has some of the best jewelers in the world i dont know what philosophers will pay for a stone skull but i think jewelers will pay plenty for emeralds philodemos pursed his lips you may be right he said at last if you can get to athens that is menedemos thumped his forehead with the heel of his hand oimoi that reminds me father he passed on the news hed got from moiragenes at the harbor ptolemaios has xanthos you say philodemos whistled theres all of lykia near enough stolen away from antigonos just like that he snapped his fingers and kaunos is next on the list menedemos said the fight between the marshals is so close now we can see it from here this is not good for rhodes not good at all his father said the last thing we want is for the war to come to our door the longer it stays close to us the likelier someone will try to kick the door down that thought had occurred to menedemos too he didnt like agreeing with his father it didnt happen very often so he seldom needed to worry about it here though he found himself saying i know its not easy staying a free and autonomousa really free and really autonomouspolls these days it puts me in mind of being a sprat in the middle of a school of hungry tunny if you want to know the truth i wont quarrel with you philodemos said again no small concession coming from him when it comes to rhodes we can see eye to eye menedemos thought when it comes to the two of us he wished he hadnt suggested that his father mount the emerald and give it to baukis his father was liable to tell her hed done so as proof he wasnt worried about sharing an inheritance with any sons she might bear and she might even take it that way and be relieved or she might think menedemos gave me this lovely stone and if she thought that what would she do then and what would he sostratos had already checked everything aboard the aphroditethree different times that didnt keep him from checking things once more there was the gryphons skull securely wrapped in canvas and stowed near the poop all they were waiting for was a few more sailors and some fresh water then sostratos said as if the old old bone could understand people will try to figure out what to make of you from his station on the raised poop deck menedemos called are you talking to that polluted thing you need a hetaira to take your mind off what youre doing screwing isnt the answer to everything sostratos said with dignity if it isnt you tell me what is his cousin retorted before sostratos could replyand very likely before the argument could heat upa man standing on the pier said hail hail sostratos and menedemos said together even as menedemos asked what can we do for you sostratos found himself disliking the newcomer on sight the fellow was close to forty mediumsized handsome well built and carried himself like an athlete jealous me sostratos thought and then well maybe a little i hear youre sailing north and west the stranger said will you be putting in at miletos he had an odd accent basically doric but with a hissing sneezy overlay hes spent a lot of time in lykia sostratos thought hadnt planned to sostratos said blandly but i might the man on the quay dipped his head its like that is it whats your fare then menedemos flicked sostratos a glance as toikharkhos sostratos had the job of charging as much as the passenger could bear to pay instead of answering directly he asked a question of his own whats your name o best one me im euxenides of phaselis the stranger replied that made menedemos blink sostratos smiled to himself the fellows accent and his bearing had made sostratos think that was who he was and antigonos held miletos one of his officers might well want to go there sostratos enjoyed being right no less than any other man he said perhaps you should know its almost certain we will put in at kos kos was ptolemaios chief base in the aegean euxenides asked are you saying youd betray me there thats not how neutrals should behave no nothing of the sort sostratos replied but youd best remember well have a big crew on boardall our rowers they will go into the taverns and they will gossip i dont think anyone could stop them and ptolemaios men will have ears around to hear such things euxenides finished for him sostratos dipped his head euxenides shrugged chance i take im not of a rank to make it likely that anyone much would have heard of me how much for my passage you still havent said to miletos sostratos plucked at his beard considering twenty drakhmai should do it thats outrageous euxenides exclaimed most of the time sostratos would have asked half as much and might have let himself be haggled down from there now he just shrugged and answered i have two questions for you o marvelous one first when do you think another ship will sail from rhodes to miletos and second dont you think a trip to miletos puts us in danger of ending up in the middle of a sea fight between antigonos ships and ptolemaios euxenides looked around the great harbor as if hoping to find another ship on the point of sailing there werent more than a handful of akatoi in port though and he would have a long slow journey on a round ship that had to tack its way up to miletos against the prevailing northerly winds with a scowl he said youre enjoying this arent you no one goes into business intending to lose money sostratos replied twenty drakhmai pheueuxenides sounded thoroughly disgusted but he said all right twenty it is when do you sail soon i hope sostratos said as far as he was concerned theyd already stayed in rhodes much too long he looked toward menedemos being captain his cousin had the last word in such things tomorrow i hope menedemos said well share our water but you do know youll have to bring your own food and wine oh yes ive traveled by sea a good many times before euxenides replied if we have to spend a night on the water i expect ill sleep on the foredeck i wonder if it stilt stinks of peafowl dung when you lie down on it sostratos thought he didnt say that to antigonos officer all he said was thats right ill be here in the morning then euxenides went off down the pier twenty drakhmai menedemos said thats more than i thought youd squeeze out of him euge thanks sostratos said he wants to get back to antigonos and probably to tell him everything he saw of ptolemaios fleet and his army no doubt menedemos agreed hell likely tell him everything hes seen of rhodes too i hadnt thought of that sostratos eyes went to the moles protecting the great harbor from the sea and to the walls and towers fortifying them maybe we shouldnt take him i think its all right his cousin said our works arent exactly secret antigonos is bound to know about them about as well as our generals do that made more sense than sostratos wanted to admit i dont much care for the side trip though menedemos laughed at him of course you dont my dear it means you take a day or two longer to get to athens believe me nobody in miletos will steal the gryphons skull and sostratos couldnt very well argue with that either back before the persians came the polis was a hotbed of philosophy herodotos said thales of miletos had been the first man to predict an eclipse of the sun an eclipse that also awed the warring lydians and medes to make peace with each other having seen an eclipse himself the year before sostratos understood how one might awe men into almost anything but these past couple of hundred years miletos had been just another city since he couldnt directly disagree he shifted his ground arent you curious to see what the philosophers will make of the skull and what theyll be able to learn about gryphons from it oh a little menedemos answered what im really curious about though is how much theyll pay us and if theyll pay us the only way to find out is to get to athens sostratos said not kos not miletos athens were sailing tomorrow can you be patient that long ive been patient long enough i want to know you sound like me when im chasing a pretty girl thats ridic sostratos broke off it wasnt ridiculous it was when you got down to it a pretty fair comparison he did chase knowledge as ardently as his cousin chased women philosophy doesnt have a husband to shove a radish up my arse if he catches me in bed with her philosophy wont suck you off either menedemos retorted sostratos cheeks got hot he couldnt even complain not when hed been crude first menedemos laughed and clapped him on the shoulder dont you worry about a thing my dear we really do sail tomorrow tomorrow sostratos echoed dreamily and believe me his cousin added im as glad to be going as you are sostratos heard the truth in his voice for the life of him though he couldnt figure out why it was there if it wouldnt have made people talk menedemos would have spent his last night in rhodes wrapped in his himation on the aphrodites poop deck he would indeed have spent most of his nights thus but someone might have figured out why he was doing so and gossip with truth behind it was the last thing he wanted and so when he went downstairs before dawn to head for sostratos house next door and then down to the harbor he found baukis already in the courtyard with some bread and a cup of wine from the kitchen hail he said he couldnt ignore her she would complain to his fatherand shed have reasonwhich would only touch off more trouble hail she answered gravely a safe trip to you come back as soon as you can and with plenty of silver thanks menedemos turned toward the kitchen himself im going to get some breakfast too to eat on the way down to the ship she dipped her head everything she did it seemed was serious to the point of solemnity what would she be like kindled and wanton menedemos wondered would she burn all the hotter because shes so quiet the rest of the time he all but fled into the kitchen running from his own thoughts he would have stayed in there too hoping she would go back upstairs but the aphroditewouldnt wait and if he didnt go get sostratos sostratos would come get him out he went a chunk of bread in his hand baukis remained still busy with her own breakfast be careful she told menedemos all the things we talked about beforethey all look like theyre coming true and theyre all bad for rhodes and theyre all bad for trade i know menedemos tore into the bread eating as fast as he could his mouth full he went on but ill come back i have to if i didnt father wouldnt have anyone to yell at baukis drew in a sharp breath menedemos realized he hadnt criticized his father where she could hear before when hed complained about philodemos it had always been to sostratos till now and complaining about a man to the mans wife was not the ideal way to enlist her sympathy she said he wants the most for you from you anything less makes him angry and he picks the worst possible ways to try to get it menedemos thought but he didnt say that to baukis he stuffed the last of the bread into his mouth chewed quickly and swallowed it scraped down his throat like a boulder id better go he said baukis dipped her head safe journey she repeated swift journey too she got to her feet he might have hugged her she was his stepmother oh yes he jeered at himself and what would you do if father came downstairs and saw that youd need to sail away and never come home hed never had such attacks of nerves pursuing other mens wives in other towns he headed for the doorway at something close to a run whenever he went away from baukis he felt as if hed just been routed getting out into the street was a relief getting out onto the open sea a thousand stadia from rhodes would be a bigger one he closed the door behind him then turned to go next door and gather up sostratos he took a stepand almost ran into his cousin hail sostratos said you dont need to jump like that i was just coming to get you i was just going to get you menedemos answered i didnt hear your footsteps that wasnt surprising neither of them wore shoes menedemos went on now that weve got each other lets head down to the ship what do you bet that euxenides fellow will be waiting on the quay i have better things to do than waste my money sostratos said have you got the emeralds menedemos tapped a little leather sack dangling from the belt that confined his tunic at the waist theyre here all but the one father bought for his new wife he kept his voice down not wanting his words to travel back to baukis the stone was still at the jewelers pity he decided to do that its one fewer we can sell sostratos spread his hands what can you do though not much menedemos answered sostratos didnt know he was the one whod suggested giving the emerald to his father and he wasnt about to tell him come on lets go mnesipolis was already banging away when they walked by the smithy he waved hammer in hand they were as familiar to him as he was to them give him a limp and hed make a good hephaistos menedemos remarked why so he would sostratos said theres a game who of the people we know best matches the olympians he eyed menedemos eh wingfooted hermes menedemos strutted with pride for a few paces he was a formidable sprinter even if he hadnt been quite fast enough to go to the olympic games to run for rhodes he hadnt thought of his chance remark as the start for a game but was quick to fall in with it weve got poseidon as keleustes so we do sostratos said and aristeidas will do for allseeing argos they went past agathippos the bankers still playing the game menedemos said i know who grayeyed athene would be too who sostratos asked menedemos pointed at him you me athana his cousin was so surprised the goddess name came out in a broad doric drawl he hardly ever used youre out of your mind ive got a beard in case you hadnt noticed its the theater my dear menedemos said airily actors play all the female roles with your face behind a mask no one would care for youve got the quickdarting mind the part needs thanks very much sostratos said and kissed him on the cheek i dont think anyone has ever said anything kinder about me ive never denied you have a clever mind the cleverest i know menedemos replied but if he gave sostratos two undiluted compliments in a row his cousin might die from the shock so he added now if you only had the good sense the gods gave a gecko youre a fine one to talk sostratos shot back youre the one who jumps out of secondstory windows to get away from a husband home too soon and youre the one whos been mooning over an old skull as if it were a young hetaira menedemos said they chaffed each other all the way down to the harbor menedemos hurried down toward the aphrodite euxenides had better not keep us waiting i want to get out on the open sea again so do ii want to sail for athens sostratos pointed ahead isnt that the man himself already on the foredeck you were right up by our houses dip me in dung if its not and so i was menedemos said good for him i dont expect he got out of phaselis and xanthos by being late to his ship and now hell get out of rhodes too he started up the pitchsmeared planks of the pier that led out to the akatos calling ahoy the aphrodite diokles gave answer in his raspy bass ahoy skipper passengers already aboard yes we saw him menedemos said do we have all the rowers all but one the oarmaster replied no sign of teleutas yet menederaos eyed the sun which had just climbed up out of the sea well give him a little whilehalf an hour maybe if hes not here by then well hire one of the harbor loungers and many goodbyes to him rhodes has plenty of men who know how to pull an oar thats how we got teleutas a year ago sostratos said hes a funny one he will work if you put him to it but to him getting paid is the only part of the job that really matters i still think he ran away in the market square in kallipolis too menedemos said he came back with more sailors so fast i couldnt really call him on it but i think he left us in the lurch i wouldnt be sorry to see somebody else on his bench he walked down the gangplank and onto the aphrodites poop deck standing between the steering oars even with the ship still tethered to the pier was in its own way almost as satisfying as lying between a womans legs fishing boats made their way out of the great harbor and onto the waters of the aegean gulls followed them overhead like gleaners in the fields knowing the pickings would be good menedemos drummed his fingers on the steeringoar tillers and gauged the creeping shadows if he doesnt get here soon i will sail without him teleutas came up the pier and aboard the aphroditejust before menedemos set about replacing him by the dog of egypt where have you been menederaos snapped the rower flinched sorry skipper he said with a placating gesture he kept his own voice low and soft he also squinted as if even the earlymorning light was too bright to suit his eyes you knew we were going out this morning menederaos said why did you get drunk last night i didnt mean to teleutas answered it just sort of happened he gave menedemos a sickly ingratiating smile menedemos wasnt about to let himself be appeased so readily go to your oar he said i hope you hurt as much as you deserve all day long that hangdog smile still on his face teleutas hurried off the raised poop deck and down into the waist of the merchant galley cast off diokles called once the lines that had moored the aphroditeto the quay were aboard the keleustes smote his little bronze square back oars rhyppapai rhyppapai the akatos slid away from the pier once menedemos had room to do so he swung the ship about till her bow pointed out toward the mouth of the harbor but he hadnt even passed out beyond the moles before he said i want everybody to do lookout duty on this voyage its not just pirates we have to be careful ofits antigonos war fleet and ptolemaios too if you see anything sing out you may be saving all of our necks including your own were rhodians and neutrals sostratos added that may help us in case of trouble because neither side much wants to offend our polis but some captains may not care about that wed rather not take the chance if we dont have to as it had a few days before the motion of the waves changed as soon as the akatos left the sheltered waters of the great harbor menedemos smiled he liked the livelier feel to the ship sostratos looked less happy he would have preferred the sea as quiescent as the land menedemos glanced toward crapulent teleutas the rower had already gone a delicate green too bad menedemos thought its his own foolish fault rhyppapai rhyppapai clang clang diokles beat out the stroke once they were outside the harbor diokles cut the rowing crew down to eight men on each side he left teleutas at his oar the rower sent him a look of appeal he ignored it euxenides of phaselis made his way back to the stair that led up to the poop may i come up he asked politely menedemos dipped his head and euxenides joined him and dioldes the passenger said youve got a good crew here he spoke in tones of professional appraisal thanks menedemos answered were rhodians remember we go to sea a lot he pointed to the mouth of the naval harbor which lay just northwest of the great harbor a trireme was coming out all three banks of oars manned each stroke enviably smooth not lifting his hands from the steering oars menedemos pointed toward it with a thrust of his chin most of my men have rowed in one of those or else in a five i hadnt thought of that euxenides said now that i do though i see that you could put together a formidable little fleet little menedemos said indignantly but the indignation didnt last antigonos had all of anatolia to draw upon ptolemaios the endless wealth of egypt next to theirs rhodes fleet would be small too small menedemos wondered he hoped hed never have to find out sostratos stood on the aphrodites little raised foredeck peering north and west as if he expected to see cape sounion the headland that announced one was coming up on athens appear over the horizon at any moment part of him did most of him the rational part knew perfectly well that athens lay some days journey from rhodes and that trading on the way would further delay the akatos arrival but the childlike part that never quite dies in any man insisted cape sounion would be there because he so badly wanted it to be there and so he kept on looking the wind blew hard and steady out of the northeastif anything a little more out of the east than usual the sailors had swung the yard from the starboard bow back toward the portside rear to take best advantage of it the big square sail full of the brisk breeze pulled the aphroditealong sostratos eyed the creamy wake thrown back from the ram and the cutwater she was going about as fast as she could by sail alone euxenides of phaselis came up to stand not far from sostratos the leather sack that held his food and whatever meager belongings he owned lay on the foredeck like any sensible passenger he kept an eye on it hail he said hail sostratos echoed a bit embarrassed he probably should have spoken first but his mind had been elsewhere euxenides pointed whats that island there off to the right the way he said it proved to sostratos that even if hed traveled by sea he was not a naval officer thats syme sostratos answered we stopped there our first night out of rhodes last year but with the breeze so steady well go farther today i dont know whether menedemos will make for knidoshe pointed too toward the end of the long finger of mainland north of symeor whether hell put in somewhere on telos he pointed again this time toward the island dead ahead i was in knidos for a little while three years ago i think it was when antigonos took karia away from that traitor asandros euxenides said telos i dont know at all whats there nothing much sostratos answered no polis a few herders a few farmersnot many for its not a wellwatered island but sometimes a quiet place where you can beach yourself and let your ships timbers dry for a night is nothing to sneeze at euxenides drummed his fingers on the rail i want to get to miletos i need to get to miletos i want to get to athens sostratos said with a smile i need to get to athens and i willeventually sometimes eventually isnt fast enough euxenides said well best one you wont get from rhodes to miletos any faster than you will in the aphrodite sostratos said yes i found that out euxenides told him he drummed his fingers some more he might not be able to help it but that didnt make him happy about it he looked due north as avidly as sostratos looked northwest as usual most of the fishing boats whose crewmen saw the aphroditefled from her fearing she was a pirate that made the rowers laugh it made sostratos sad here close to rhodes even men feared sea raiders he feared sea raiders himself as a matter of fact he just knew he wasnt one of their number menedemos held the merchant galley steady on a westerly course and didnt swing north toward knidos sostratos walked back to the stern youre going to put in on telos he asked his cousin dipped his head thats right were not heavily laden so ill beach her for the night itll be good for the planking and telos is about as safe a place to put in as any under the sun true enough sostratos said it hasnt got enough people to make up a decentsized band of robbers just what i was thinking and this splendid breeze is taking us straight there menedemos said only drawback i can see is that itll be a longer pull to kos tomorrow and the men will have to do more rowing but were still early in the season and getting the crew beaten in so even that wont be so bad diokles chuckled easy for you to say skipper youre not one of the hornhanded bastards pulling an oar i know how menedemos said sostratos and i both know how as a matter of fact our fathers made sure we do he took his hands off the steeringoar tillers to show their palms and ive got calluses of my own sostratos looked down at the palms of his own hands they were fairly smooth and soft he would blister if he ever had to do any rowing the only real callus he had was one just above the first knuckle of the middle finger of his right hand a callus showing where a pen or a stylus spent a lot of time but menedemos was righthe did know how the wind held telos drew near the sun dropping down the sky towards it the island was long and thin and curved rather like a strigil lying in the water only a couple of fishing boats bobbed offshore they were plenty to bring home opson for the inhabitants of the village near the north coast that was telos largest settlement a stretch of beach in front of the village was the most common spot for ships to put in but menedemos sailed past it why did you do that sostratos asked something one of the sailors told me while you were on the foredeck his cousin answered once we get past this rocky stretch herehe waved at the forbidding coastline they were passing theres another good bit of beach one where sea turtles come ashore to lay their eggs they ought to make good eating we can boil up a mess of them and have opson for the whole crew turtle eggs eh sostratos felt the lure of the exotic ive never tried them lead on o best one he patted his stomach its been a long time since bread and wine back on rhodes hasnt it just menedemos agreed from the bow aristeidas pointed ahead and to port theres the beach skipper the sharpeyed sailor sang out good menedemos said and then started calling out orders brail the sail up to the yard rowers every other bench come on move faster there do it as if you had pirates breathing down your neck to sostratos the men seemed to be moving quite fast enough but menedemos drove them like the commander of a trireme the sailors didnt grumble they knew they would have to be able to work together without thinking if they ever did need to flee pirates or fight them this length of beach was considerably shorter than the one near the village peering toward it sostratos exclaimed in excitement that fellow was right i just saw a turtle crawling back into the sea whistling his cousin swung the ship so that her stern pointed toward the beach and her bow out to sea a couple of men got into the boat she towed and rowed it ashore back oars diokles called the rowers reversed their stroke after the aphroditebeached pushing her into the sea again come morning would be easier bowfirst menedemos kept stealing glances back over his shoulder at the beach as the aphroditecovered the last couple of plethra plovers scurrying along the sand took to the air when the merchant galley drew too close to suit them thats fine menedemos said just fine keep it going and a grinding scraping noise interrupted him whats that sostratos asked at the same time as his cousin exclaimed in surprise and dismay have we struck a rock it didnt feel like that and the akatos still moved backwards through the water we havent menedemos answered but our starboard steering oar just did almost tore my arm out of the socket when it hit too sure enough the steering oar was torn out of the housing that secured it to the ship and another crackle of splintering timber said the narrow length of the tiller hadnt come through undamaged either the rock missed impaling the aphrodites flank a moment later soft sand scrunched under her false keel as she beached herself as prettily as anyone could have wanted well thats a nuisance sostratos said it certainly is menedemos said i can guide the ship well enough with only one steering oar but its not something i want to do if youve only got one and something goes wrong hes a sensible and cautious seaman sostratos thought most of the time anyway why doesnt his mind work the same way when hes on dry land one more crackle and the steering oar fell away from the tiller and onto the sand leaving menedemos holding what was left of the tiller with an oath he threw it down onto the poop deck narrowly missing sostratos toes what a miserable piece of luck he said it was only a year old and part of the best pair we ever had you want to make repairs here skipper or go on up to kos and have the shipwrights there do a proper job of it diokles asked im going to have to think about that menedemos answered for now lets push her farther out of the water ill be able to take a better look at the damage then too makes sense the oarmaster agreed he angled the gangplank down from the deck to the beach and descended sostratos and menedemos followed sailors in the undecked waist of the ship simply scrambled over the side and dropped to the sand sostratos menedemos and diokles added their weight and strength to those of the sailors sostratos hands gripped the thin lead sheathing that helped hold shipworms at bay his toes dug into the sand digit by digit the aphroditemoved up the beach euxentdes of phaselis helped too and had plainly done such work before after theyd shifted the ship far enough to suit menedemos the passenger asked have you got woodworking tools aboard of course we do sostratos answered if we end up in trouble we may not find a kindhearted nymph like kalypso to lend us axe and adze and drill as resourceful odysseus did im usually the one who quotes homer menedemos said and youre usually the one who says i shouldnt and that it doesnt fit what have you got to say for yourself now quoting him does fit here sostratos admitted to keep from admitting any more he turned back to euxenides are you a shipwright yourself then no no the passenger tossed his head but i make and i serve catapults im a good carpenter if i cant repair that steering oar i can certainly make you another to match it that wasnt sostratos choice to make he glanced over to menedemos his cousin rubbed his chin he didnt want to be beholden to euxenides sostratos could see as much weve got men aboard who can do the same job menedemos said at last no doubt euxenides answered but i can do it right he has a point sostratos said there isnt much in the way of carpentry thats more complicated than what goes into catapults thats right euxenkles said no offense to your trade captain but shipbuilding is childs play beside it menedemos grimaced sostratos turned away so his cousin wouldnt see him smile more often than notalmost all the time in factmenedemos did the pushing here he was being pushed and he liked it no better than anyone else did lets talk about it in the morning he said nothings going to happen till then anyhow as you say best one euxenides answered politely sostratos didnt think he could have phrased his own indecision as smoothly as menedemos had done the aphrodites crew had already realized they werent going to get anything much in the way of repairs done before sunset some of them were gathering brush and driftwood for fires others went up and down the beach thrusting spearshafts and sticks into the sand in search of seaturtle nests a couple of plethra away from the akatos one of them stooped to dig with his hands then whooped and waved found some eggs he called sostratos trotted over let me have a look at those pasiphon before you throw em in a pot he said pasiphon had pulled an oar on the aphroditethe year before and knew of sostratos everwakeful curiosity sure thing he said and tossed sostratos an egg as he might have thrown him a ball awkwardly and as much by luck as anything else sostratos caught it without breaking it it turned out to differ in several ways from the birds eggs he already knew for one thing it was round not pointed at one end it cant very well roll out of an underground nest he thought but a round egg wouldnt be good up in a tree creatures were surely shaped to suit the situation in which they found themselves he hadnt imagined that extended to eggs but saw no reason it shouldnt the eggshell was leather not hard and brittle like that of a birds egg he wondered why no explanation immediately occurred to him the egg was also larger than any birds egg hed seen that did make sensesea turtles were large creatures themselves a little later just as the sun quenched itself in the waters of the aegean another sailor found a nest like the first it held a couple of dozen eggs everybody could have one to go with the barley bread cheese olives and wine the aphroditecarried to keep her sailors fed euxenides proved adept at more than carpentry he twirled a fire drill and got a blaze going from scratch as fast as anyone sostratos had ever seen searching for the lushest bushes the sailors found a spring a stadion or so inland from the beach they filled pots with fresh water and brought them back when sostratos got his boiled egg he discovered a couple of other differences between it and a birds egg the white didnt coagulate to nearly the same degree as a birds egg would have and the yolk was a deeper richer orange than that of any birds egg hed ever seen even by firelight he was sure of that the egg tasted fine though menedemos and diokles told some men to serve as sentries through the night i dont think anyone on telos will bother us menedemos said but i dont want to wake up with my throat cut and find out i was wrong sostratos was immune to such duties he found a spot not too far from one of the fires and curled up by it the sand wasnt so soft as a proper bed but made a better mattress than the planking of the poop deck the thick wool of his himation held the night chill at bay he stared up at the stars but not for long when menedemos woke in the predawn twilight he needed a moment to remember that the aphroditewouldnt be leaving telos as soon as her crew shoved her back into the aegean his yawn turned into a curse miserable polluted rock he muttered and got to his feet to go over and inspect the damage to the steering oar most of the sailors were still snoring but menedemos found euxenides of phaselis already crouched by the oar examining it hail he said coolly oh hail euxenides answered i should be able to give you something that will serve you pretty well if you dont mind my taking a few hours to make it forgive my saying so but next to catapults this isnt very fancy work thats what you think menedemos said if you dont get the shape of the blade exactly right it wont cut the water the way it should and if the weight isnt distributed the way it should be it wont pivot properly and the fellow steering the shipme i mean will have to work a lot harder than he would otherwise yes yes euxenides said impatiently as to a child that kept pointing out the obvious i expect i can take care of all that only drawback of doing it right here is that ill be working with green timber but he raised an eyebrow ill work for free and the shipwrights on kos surely wont he was right about that and he sounded so certain he could do what he said he could he won menedemos over all right menedemos said well see what you come up with if euxenides proved more wind than work his crewmen would be able to improvise something that would serve till they got to kos but euxenides quickly showed he knew what he was doing after bread and wine for breakfast he used one of the ships hatchets to knock down a pine whose trunk was about the right size to shape into a steering oar once hed lopped off the branches that grew from it sailors dragged it to the beach with ropes using the sound steering oar as his model euxenides trimmed the trunk to the proper length with the hatchet then set to work with the adze to give it the shape he wanted chips flew in all directions perhaps halfway through the work he looked up and remarked i may not be as resourceful as longsuffering odysseus was but by the gods i know what to do with a piece of wood so you do best one menedemos admitted he made a tolerably good woodworker himself good enough to recognize a master of the craft when he saw one euxenides shaped the pine with the same offhand brilliance a sculptor showed with marble watching him was an education watching him kept menedemos too interested to look out to sea he jumped when somebody shouted sail ho a pirate couldnt hope to do better than to descend on a merchant galley beached how was he supposed to fight back this is what happened to the athenian fleet at the end of the peloponnesian war sostratos said the spartans caught them ashore at aigospotamoi and had their way with them only after hed finished was menedemos sure their thoughts had gone in the same direction then the cry of sail ho changed to sails ho instead of getting ready to scramble back onto the aphrodite belt on his sword and make what fight he could menedemos stared out to sea himself he couldnt possibly hope to fight off more than one pirate ship the sound he made was halfway between a sigh of relief and an exhalation of awe he wouldnt have to do any fighting the fleet sailing west past the north coast of telos cared no more about a beached akatos than zeus cared about a flea on the skinny rump of a scavenger dog those werent round ships out there or even pirate pentekonters and hemioliai they were war galleys dozens of them a fleet bigger and stronger all by itself than rhodes could hope to put to sea triremes served as escorts for the bigger beamier warships that formed the heart of the fleet were those monsters fours fives sixes did they carry even more than six rowers for each bank of oars they were ten or fifteen stadia out to sea menedemos couldnt be sure whose fleet is that somebody askedanother good relevant question before menedemos could reply euxenides of phaselis said it has to be ptolemaios if antigonos had that many ships in these waters they would be sailing toward battle with ptolemaios over lykia not heading away from there sostratos added they look as if theyre making for kos too and kos is ptolemaios chief stronghold in the aegean menedemos dipped his head that all makes sense for all we know ptolemaios is aboard one of those ships they say he came up from egypt himself this year instead of giving the job to one of his admirals he did euxenides said antigonos officer coughed a couple of times he turned toward menedemos youve been saying you planned on stopping at kos if ptolemaios whole naval expedition is there i dont think i want to visit the place thank you very much can you put me ashore at knidos instead you can stop there before going on to kos yes ill do that menedemos said at once with ptolemaios whole great fleet and perhaps ptolemaios himself at kos city he didnt want to get there with antigonos officer on board i thank you euxenides drummed his fingers on the adze handle i shouldnt have to pay twenty drakhmai for the trip either not when im not going to miletos had euxenides not gone to work on the new steering oar menedemos might have argued with him but sostratos who was scrupulously fair dipped his head in agreement with the officers words so menedemos just said ah right ill cut the price in half euxenides looked half pleased ten drakhmai to knidos is as outrageous as twenty drakhmai to miletos he paused his nails clicked rhythmically on the axe handle its no more outrageous i suppose a bargain captain ten drakhmai he soon finished the steering oar and set to work repairing the pivot on which it would turn he was as swift and deft there as he had been while turning a tree trunk into something useful the sun had just swung past noon when he set the new steering oar in its place menedemos went back aboard the aphroditeto see how the new steering oar felt the tiller seemed strange under his palm it was a loppedoff branch from the tree that had made the steering oar with the bark still on it the new steering oar was a little heavier than the old one it would be he thought being made of green wood but the balance was everything it should have been and the makeshift only had to last to kos menedemos tossed his head no to knidos if it turns out not to serve he dipped his head to euxenides of phaselis many thanks its plenty good enough antigonos officer seemed more embarrassed than pleased youre welcome though i hate to take thanks for anything that simple the joinery that goes into catapults never mind menedemos said i believe you youve made me believe you he raised his voice and called out to the aphrodites crew come on boys lets get her back into the water half a dozen men shoved the merchant galleys boat back out into the aegean they made the boat fast to the aphrodites bow with a line the rest of the sailors along with menedemos sostratos and euxenides stationed themselves along the length of the akatos hull and at the stern ready menedemos waited a heartbeat then raised his voice to a shout push he put his own shoulder against the lead plates that sheathed the ship and shoved with all his might the men in the boat rowed with all their strength pulling the aphroditewhile everyone else pushed she didnt move at the first try menedemos hadnt expected that she would she was more heavily built than a war galley or a piratical pentekonter and she still carried her cargo had she had more of it menedemos would have had the crew do some unloading before trying to refloat heror he might not have beached her at all but left her anchored offshore instead push he called again his shoulder complained as he set it against the ship his feet dug into the sand his grunt was one of a chorus that rose from the straining men telos was a barren place nowhere anybody could possibly want to be stranded sand ground under the oak of the akatos false keel shes stirring sostratos gasped from his place a couple of men over from menedemos that she is menedemos agreed also gasping he paused for a couple of breaths then managed a shout put your backs into it you lazy whoresons something creaked in his own back as he shoved but he didnt let that keep him from giving the work all he had in him little by little and then it seemed all at once the aphroditewent into the aegean the sailors raised a cheer and waded out after the ship scrambling aboard wet and naked and dripping menedemos took his place on the poop deck his face wore a curious frown as he reached for the steeringoar tillers one pale and sweatstained the other barkbrown sostratos understood him perfectly lets find out how that new one does now that its really in the sea menedemos dipped his head just so he called out to the crew ten men on a side to the oars diokles give us the stroke right you are skipper the oarmaster replied he took out his mallet and square of bronze come on you lugspay attention to me rhyppapai rhyppapai as the merchant galley slid forward over the blue blue sea menedemos pulled and pushed on the steering oars sending her now to the left now to the right he made sure to steer clear of the rock that had hurt the ship before sostratos asked how does she feel fine menedemos answered a little odd because the two steering oars dont weigh the same and i can tell but the makeshift does its job he raised his voice many many thanks euxenides antigonos officer stood on the foredeck he gave menedemos half a bow i told you youre welcome i didnt want to stay on telos any longer than i had to either i think a dead man would be bored on telos sostratos said i think youre right menedemos replied he turned to diokles do you expect well make knidos by nightfall if we dont well be pretty close the keleustes gauged the breeze which blew straight into his face itll be rowing all the way though if you want to go north during the sailing season thats mostly how it is menedemos dipped his head i know if we were a round ship wed spend forever tacking back and forth back and forth sailing four or five stadia maybe more for every one we went forward he paused of course if we were a round ship we wouldnt have tried beaching ourselves and we wouldnt have lost that steering oar he eyed his cousin who was peering ahead with a hand to his forehead to shield against sun glare whats chewing on you sostratos i was just wondering how big a fleet old oneeye has in knidos sostratos answered if its big enough it might have come out against ptolemaios we dont want to wander into the middle of a sea fight no eh menedemos said slyly think what it would do for your history if you ever get around to writing it sostratos raised an eyebrow wandering into the middle of a sea fight is one of the best ways i can think of to make sure i dont live long enough to write a history menedemos would have argued with him but found no way to do it the aphroditecame into knidos with the sun low in the northwest and the sky streaked with red and gold sostratos let out a sigh of relief he didnt mind the discomfort of a night at sea reaching port so late he would probably sleep on the poop deck tonight anyhow but out on the aegean the merchant galley was hideously vulnerable to any storm that might blow up better far better to spend the night tied up at a knidian quay knidos was sort of a double city like syracuse in sicily though the offshore island that formed a part of it lay a little farther out in the sea than did syracuses ortygia moles improved the harbor and connected the island to the mainland sostratos counted about twenty ship sheds the sort in which war galleys stayed to keep their timbers dry when they werent on campaign no wonder they didnt sally against ptolemaios he thought he bad to have twice that many ships maybe three times as many the passage of ptolemaios fleet hadnt gone unnoticed and had understandably left antigonos garrison in knidos nervous no sooner had the aphroditefound a berth than an officer in corselet and helmet came storming up the pier toward her what ship are you he barked where are you from were the aphrodite out of rhodes sostratos answered soothingly we spent last night on telos rhodes eh the officer said ptolemaios catamites are you were a free and autonomous polis and were neutral sostratos said knowing he had to hold his temper antigonos officer snorted probably a pack of stinking spies hail aristarkhos euxenides of phaselis said havent seen you for two or three yearsnot since we took back karia euxenides the officeraristarkhossaid uncertainly when the aphrodites passenger dipped his head aristarkhos went on zeus euxenides what are you doing here getting us out of a nasty spot went through sostratos mind euxenides answered getting away from ptolemaios what else i was in phaselis when he took it and in xanthos when he took it by now hell have kaunos too the rhodians here were taking me up to miletos but when ptolemaios fleet came by this morning t thought theyd do better to drop me off here that way i dont have to run the gauntlet heading north oh aristarkhos said after the single syllable came out a long silence followed he looked as if hed bitten off a big mouthful of bad fish a largesouled man or even an honest man would have apologized aristarkhos plainly knew it and as plainly couldnt bring himself to do it sostratos prodded him a little you see o marvelous one we really are neutrals making sure antigonos officers understood that might be important for rhodes it could be aristarkhos said after another pause sostratos decided not to push any further that was too likely to make an enemy aristarkhos turned back to euxenides so you saw ptolemaios fleet go by too did you i certainly did euxenides replied we were on the north coast of telos they couldnt have been more than fifteen or twenty stadia offshore as they went past i counted fiftyfive ships how professional of you sostratos thought no matter how useful euxenides had been he couldnt warm to the man who struck him as almost too competent to tolerate aristarkhos dipped his head that sounds about right he frowned it must have been close to midday why were you still aground did you have trouble getting this ship back in the water it wasnt that euxenides said we needed some repairs the steering oar and its housing menedemos said hurt em on a rock backing the akatos onto the beach ill tell you this best onehe was more polite to aristarkhos than sostratos had been if antigonos doesnt need euxenides he can come to rhodes and make a good living for himself as a ships carpenter euxenides the catapult man aristarkhos exclaimed now his memory was fully jogged not likely rhodian antigonos rewards men who are good at what they do and euxenides is one of the best euxenides gave back half a bow acknowledging the compliment i believe it menedemos said sostratos believed it too whether he liked him or not euxenides was a consummate craftsman an artist with adze and drill if he was ignorant of anything having to do with woodworking sostratos couldnt imagine what it would be he wondered if that made euxenides also think he knew a great deal about matters in which he had less experience he wouldnt have been surprised that was the craftsmans besetting flaw as sokrates had pointed out in his apology i was worried about these rhodians too but they treated me as well as if i were one of ptolemaios men euxenides said and sostratos couldnt fault him for that he went on they really did act as neutrals should and i expect youll show them every kindness here that expect held the snap of command and told sostratos which of antigonos officers owned the higher rank just as you say aristarkhos answered still sounding unhappy about it for now though come with me why dont you well send a messenger to antigonos first thing in the morning hell be pleased to know you got away euxenides picked up the leather sack that held his worldly goods thank you for my passage he said waving first to sostratos and then to menedemos as he went up the gangplank to stand on the quay beside aristarkhos thank you for your help on telos menedemos replied thank you for your help here sostratos thought maybe jealousy had made him misjudge euxenides they could have made their own steering oar on the island even if it wouldnt have been so perfect as the one the officer had turned out but for euxenides acquaintance with aristarkhos here in knidos though things might have gone hard for them aristarkhos asked what cargo are you carrying rhodians perfume and purple dye menedemos answered papyrus and ink sostratos added his cousin shot him a warning look he realized he might have done better to keep quiet about the papyrus it came from egypt ptolemaios stronghold reminding antigonos captain about it might cause trouble aristarkhos only grunted where are you bound he asked athens sostratos and menedemos said together sostratos wondered if that admission were wise for the past eight years demetrios of phaleron had ruled athens as kassandros puppet and kassandros was no friend to antigonos either but aristarkhos merely grunted again remarking with that cargo you would be he leaned forward trying to see better as twilight thickened will you stop at kos on the way anther dangerous question lying might be safer but also might be more dangerous sostratos decided to tell the truth as calmly and reasonably as he could of course we will o best one we are traders and we are neutral they make silk on kos and you cant get it anywhere else in the world well buy some to take with us and well sell crimson dye there when i left rhodes bound for miletos they warned me ahead of time they planned to put in at kos euxenides said this was before we knew ptolemaios whole war fleet was heading that way all right fair enough aristarkhos said his suspicions finally seemed to have dissolved will you want to spend a day in the market square here before you go on sostratos and menedemos looked at each other sostratos could think of nothing he wanted less what he wanted was to get to athens as fast as he could but what he wanted and what was expedient were liable to be two different things thank you he said thats very kind hed made the right choice he saw that at once by the way aristarkhos relaxed the officer turned to euxenides saying come on lets get you back to the barracks before its too dark for us to see where were going they walked down the quay together just what i wanta day in knidos market square menedemos said it would take a special miracle from zeus to make enough to pay the whole crew an extra days wages he reached up and set a hand on sostratos shoulder and im sure youre even happier about the layover than i am oh of course sostratos sounded even glummer than his cousin had but then he brightened you never can tell what we might find though who would have thought wed come across the gryphons skull in kaunos yes who would menedemos tone suggested he would have been just as well pleased never to have set eyes on it he sighed we couldnt even hope to find the rhodian proxenos house without a torchbearer now do you feel like going to an inn or will the poop deck do for the night the poop deck is fine as far as im concerned sostratos said nothing but bugs and noise and thieves at an inn not quite nothing his cousin observed weve got wine here and im not so mad for girls that ive got to have one the instant i come into a port sostratos replied well i dont have to have one either menedemos said in tones of affronted dignity sostratos smiled to himself that gibe had gone home menedemos stripped off his chiton crumpled it up and set it on the deck to serve for a pillow he wrapped himself in his himation and lay down sostratos did the same there was room on the deck for diokles too but the keleustes perched on a rowers bench and leaned against the aphrodites side planking as he usually did when spending a night aboard ship hed got into the habit years earlier when he still pulled an oar and hed never been able to get out of it sostratos peered up into the night sky aphrodites wandering star brightest of them all blazed in the west following the sun down toward the horizon that of zeus less brilliant but able to travel all around the heavenly sphere shone low in the east distant music from the double flute and voices raised in song argued that more than a few people preferred revelry and wenching to this almost lakedaimonian simplicity to the crows with them he thought and fell asleep menedemos was anything but enthusiastic about spending a day in knidos agora hawking the aphrodites goods not your fault he said to sostratos as they set up their little display of dye and perfume and papyrus and ink you couldnt afford to make that aristarkhos angry at us but even so even so sostratos agreed mournfully i want to go on to athens he sounded like a small boy who wanted a sweet and was about to throw a tantrum because his pedagogue wouldnt buy one for him menedemos chuckled if there were thinkingbrothels like the thinkingshop aristophanes had given sokrates in his clouds nothing would have kept sostratos aboard the aphroditethe night before hed practically boasted about not caring whether he got laid but he would have been gone like a dart from a catapult if hed seen a chance to argue about the whichness of what well go through the motions menedemos said then we can prowl the market square for a while and then well head back to the ship fair enough but sostratos heaved a sigh we could be most of the way to kos by now he exaggerated but not by a great deal the island lay less than half a days journey north and west of knidos local merchants started crying the virtues of their olives and onions and drinking cups and wool cloth and not too far away a couple of bearded phoenicians in anklelength linen robes and brimless caps called out balsam fine balsam the finest incense and medicine the gods ever made hearing that sostratos perked up we ought to see what sort of bargain we can strike with them a mina of balsam goes for two minai of silver youre right menedemos said well have time to dicker i expect it wont move fast in a little town like this but theyd hardly begun singing the praises of their own goods before a man with the careful forwardleaning walk of the shortsighted came up to them and said youd be the rhodians who got in last night thats right best one menedemos answered what can we do for you papyrus the fellow answered that surprised menedemos the man went on aristarkhos said you had papyrus that surprised menedemos even more this fellow looked about as much like a soldier as a black ethiopian looked like a fairhaired kelt thats right menedemos repeated cautiously who are you im diodoros son of diophantos the nearsighted man said leaning closer to menedemos for a better look at him then he explained himself im antigonos paymaster hereabouts ah menedemos dipped his head that made diodoros a customer all right yes best one we do have papyrus quite a bit of it as a matter of fact gods be praised diodoros exclaimed my dear fellow do you have any idea how difficult it is to keep proper records when your commander is at war with egypt ive been writing on leather on boards even on potsherds the way they did in the old days when they decided whom to ostracize he spoke attic greek athens was the home of ostracism we can probably help you menedemos said diodoros might be the paymaster but he was too excited to make much of a bargainer menedemos asked sostratos how much papyrus have we got left i know you sold some in kaunos oh dear diodoros sounded horrified at the thought of any of the stuff slipping through his fingers we still have seventyone rolls left sostratos answered menederaos had been sure hed have the number at his fingertips his cousin added we have some excellent ink too he pointed to one of the little round pots that held it diodoros dipped his head ink is all very well but i can make my own at a pinch i wish i could make my own papyrus how much do you want per roll how hard can i bit him menedemos wondered it was a nice calculation true diodoros was a paymaster and knew how much things cost but hed also made it plain he badly needed what menedemos had for sale still if menedemos asked too high a price antigonos officer was liable to set soldiers on him and simply take what he wanted yes a nice calculation indeed menedemos made it between one breath and the next six drakhmai he replied you said it yourself sir theres a war on once i sell what weve got who knows when ill see more youre a rhodian dealing with egypt that gives you an advantage diodoros said he could remember business at least to some degree sostratos chose that moment to take a roll of papyrus out of a sack and examine the smooth creamy writing surface without saying a word he smiled and put it back diodoros eyes followed it as if it were a beautiful hetaira closing a door behind her he sighed necessity is the master of us all ill give you four drakhmai a roll for fifty rolls even that was above the going rate the dicker that followed didnt last long they settled on five drakhmai two oboloi per roll after some thought diodoros decided to buy sixty rolls not fifty menedemos felt like jumping for joy as the paymaster went off to get the silver and a sailor hurried back to the ship for the requisite rolls of papyrus he turned to sostratos and said we made a profit here who would have believed it they were wild for papyrus in syracuse last year too after the carthaginian siege cut them off from it sostratos answered if youre going to keep records you really cant do without it more people are reading and writing these days too its a good thing for us to carry i cant tell you youre wrong menedemos said and diodoros was rightwe do have the inside track on bringing it out of egypt a round ship hauling grain could carry plenty for us to resell without even noticing the burden his cousin dipped his head true enough and now shall we see what those barbarians want for their balsam certainly menedemos said he and sostratos walked over to the phoenicians one of whom was tallalmost as tall as sostratos and thin the other short and even thinner menedemos bowed hail he named himself and his cousin hail the shorter phoenician replied as he bowed he touched his forehead lips and heart in turn i am abibaalos son of gisgon here with me you see my brother abimilkios he spoke good if guttural greek and even gave the foreign names endings a hellene might have used how may we serve you my masters no free hellene would have called another man master as far as menedemos was concerned the phoenicians carried flowery politeness too far he said you have balsam do you ah balsam indeed we do abibaalos bowed again we have the finest fragrant balsam from the garden of engedi clear and yellow as fine honey from hymettoshe really did know hellenes well to come up with that comparisonburning with a sweet smoke and also useful in medicines of all kinds for epilepsy for pain as an antidote against deadly poisons to warm the stomach and the liver to heal inflamed eyes to keep wounds from going bad and to cure pleurisy and make a mans prong rise it is effective if the gods will that was a longer catalogue of virtues than menedemos had bargained for almost longer than the catalogue of ships in the iliad he said we might be interested in some if the price is right abimilkios spoke for the first time in a hollow rumbling bass the price is two of silver for one of balsam by weight his greek was less fluent than his brothers but he sounded more determined and that was indeed the going rate for balsam we are traders too menedemos said abibaalos and abimilkios both smiled menedemos had seen that smile on phoenicians before it said hellenes couldnt be traders or at least not good ones he leaned forward responding to the silent challenge hed won some dickers from the men of the east if hed lost some too he chose not to dwell on those abibaalos said we heard you calling out your wares you have perfume and dye and papyrus and ink is it not so only a little papyrus now sostratos answered we just sold most of it to an officer here you would have got a good price for it too with ptolemaios and antigonos at war abibaalos remarked he was no fool he went on crimson dye i can lay my hands on straight from the source perfume now these are the roses of rhodes menedemos dipped his head just so best one even more fragrant than balsam but less rare abimilkios put in more people want perfume than balsam sostratos said more people can afford it abibaalos replied in what size jars is the perfume each one holds two kyathoi menedemos answered the jars werent very big the standard size abibaalos said nodding as barbarians often did one of those jars for each drakhmas weight of balsam then outrageous menedemos cried though he wasnt particularly outraged we ought to get three drakhmai by weight at least after half an hour of insults and howls he and his adversary settled on two drakhmai and one obolos weight of balsam per jar of perfume for a hellene you are not a bad bargainer abibaalos remarked as they clasped hands from a phoenician that is high praise menedemos said he and abibaalos both smiled the same sort of smile which meant they both thought theyd won the dicker sostratos enjoyed watching kos rise up out of the sea as the aphroditedrew near it was one of the most beautiful islands of all it was famous for fruit of all kinds and especially for its wines a good many mulberry orchards now springtimebright with new leaves grew within easy walking distance of the city of kos a little farther inland on higher ground stood the marble majesty of the asklepeion as the akatos sailed past the healing gods shrineeasily visible from the southmenedemos remarked all sorts of offerings in there from people the god cured and i know just which one in particular youre thinking of too sostratos said do you menedemos sounded particularly innocent which convinced sostratos he was right i certainly do he said the aphrodite rising from the sea that apelles painted his cousin grinned unabashed a painting of a beautiful girla beautiful goddesswith no clothes on is a lot more interesting than all those terracottas of knees or feet that people cured of sore joints or bunions give the god it does make you wonder what apelles was cured of though sostratos said the clap maybe scoffer menedemos said his portrait of antigonos is in the asklepeion too so it is sostratos agreed now if the whole hellenic world could just be cured of not only old oneeye but all the marching generals menedemos laughed and clapped his hands now theres a wish my dear too much to hope for though im afraid sostratos dipped his head in agreement he thought it was too much to hope for too and one thing a love for history had taught him was that poleis didnt need competing marshals to give them excuses to fight among themselves the wars nowadays however were on a larger scale thoukydides whod reckoned the peloponnesian war the greatest the hellenes had ever waged would have been horrified and amazed at the sheer scale of the fighting among alexanders successors several of ptolemaios fives patrolled the waters outside the harbor of the city of kos sostratos would have been astonished had ptolemaios not had ships ready to fight on the sea at all times kos looked northeast toward halikarnassos on the mainland only a little more than a hundred stadiatwo or three hours journeyaway antigonos surely kept a fleet of his own there and as surely had ships on patrol in front of his own harbor neither general would risk a surprise from the other one of those prowling galleys spotted the aphroditeand came centipedewalking across the sea toward her three banks of big oars rising and falling in the smooth unison that bespoke a well beatenin crew the five was fully decked her oarbox also encased in timber to protect the rowers from missiles she mounted a catapult near the bow its crew stood by to send darts farther than any archer could armored marines the plumes on their helmets waving in the breeze strode here and there across the planking you couldnt pay me enough to wear a corselet aboard ship menedemos said one slip and splashright down to the bottom of the sea a swimmer sometimes has a chance sostratos agreed before his cousin could answer an officer aboard the war galley cupped his hands in front of his mouth and bellowed you there heave to diokles looked a question to menedemos who dipped his head oöp the keleustes called and the rowers rested at their oars the aphroditeslid to a halt bobbing in the light chop sostratos stomach tried to complain he ignored it up came the five a wooden cliff rising from the sea she had twice the freeboard of the aphrodite her deck stood six or seven cubits above the sea the officer peered down from the deck at the merchant galley so did her marines some armed with bows some with javelins some with thrustingspears who are you and where are you from the officer demanded were the aphrodite out of rhodes sostratos answered that impressed ptolemaios officer less than hed hoped it would all the stinking spies and pirates say theyre rhodians the fellow said whose ship is this my cousins fathers and my fathers sostratos said philodemos and lysistratos by his accent the officer wasnt a rhodian he turned and spoke in a low voice to some of the marines one of them dipped his head asking if theyve ever heard of our fathers sostratos thought the answer the officer got must have satisfied him for his next question was less hostile what are you carrying crimson dye papyrus ink fine rhodian perfume sostratos replied balsam from engedi a couple of lion skins a tiger skin from faroff india menedemos added he said not a word about the thirteen emeralds in the pouch on his belt sostratos would have been astonished if he had since theyd been smuggled out of egypt these servants of the master of egypt were all too likely to confiscate them sostratos hadnt said anything about the gryphons skull either his reasons were different from the ones menedemos likely had he simply couldnt imagine a naval officer caring about old bones or being able to see that the skull might be valuable a tiger skin the officer said you show me a tiger skin and ill send you right on in to the harbor just as you say o marvelous one menedemos replied sostratos wouldnt have used that sarcastic formula to a fellow aboard a war galley that could have crushed the aphroditelike a man stamping on a mouse but his cousin always liked to push things menedemos waved to him show the gentleman the skin sostratos certainly sostratos said menedemos assumed he knew exactly where it was stowed and menedemos was right he got out the large oiledleather sack that protected the tiger skin from seawater and undid the rawhide lashing holding the sack closed the rank odor of a not quite perfectly cured hide and he supposed of tiger itself wafted out a couple of sailors helped him spread out the great striped skin the officer leaned forward staring so hard he almost fell into the sea the marines aboard the galley gaped too finally the officer blinked a couple of times and seemed to come back to himself im a man of my word he said and waved toward the harbor of kos city a few stadia away pass on rhyppapai rhyppapai diokles called beating out the stroke with his mallet and bronze square as the rowers began to work the oarmaster aboard the war galley also began his endless chant those three banks of sweeps bit into the aegean ptolemaios galley resumed its patrol and the aphroditeglided into the harbor finding a place to tie up took a deal of time and a deal of shouting the harbor was much smaller than that of rhodes it didnt have nearly enough shipsheds to accommodate all the triremes and bigger galleys from ptolemaios fleet close to half of them had to moor at the quays like so many merchantmen because of that space for real merchantmen was at a premium menedemos almost rammed a round ship in his haste to seize a spot near the end of a pier the round ships sailors who stood on deck ready to fend off the aphroditewith poles screamed curses at him the akatos rowers screamed back louder and more foully since the aphroditehad five or six times as many crewmen aboard they shouted down the sailors on the other ship as had happened at knidos an officer came hurrying up to the end of the quay to question the men of the aphrodite on where she was from where shed been whither she was bound and what she was carrying sostratos patience frayed no one hounded us like this when we came here a year ago he complained ptolemaios officer shrugged the war hadnt come to these parts a year ago either that held some truth but only some as he had at knidos sostratos said its not our war we rhodians are free and autonomous and neutral kos is free and autonomous too the officer said sostratos almost laughed in his face free to obey ptolemdios he thought autonomous as long as it does what he wants the fellow said nothing whatever about koan neutrality menedemos had been drumming his fingers on the mismatched steeringoar tillers for a while too now he inquired do we pass muster i suppose so ptolemaios officer said grudgingly then as the fellow aboard the war galley had done he asked have you really got a tiger skin aboard by the dog of egypt we do menedemos answered do you want to show him sostratos why not sostratos said thinking he shouldnt have bothered rolling up the skin and stuffing it back into its sack after displaying it to the naval officer as he had out on the aegean he called on a couple of sailors to give him a hand they soon had the skin stretched out not only the officer but his retinue and the usual gaggle of portside loungers crowded up to the edge of the quay for a good look we ought to charge a khalkos or two for a peek the way we did with the peafowl last year sostratos thought the officer stared and stared its a very big beast isnt it he said at last seeing the hide shown that way made it seem even bigger than it was sostratos gravely dipped his head even so bigger and fiercer than a lion he said he had no idea whether a tiger really was fiercer than a lion he did know this hide was bigger than either lion skin aboard the aphrodite when he started to stow the skin in its sack once more the officer sighed as if sorry to have to come back to the mundane world all right rhodians he said good trading here in kos he turned and walked back down the quay his hangerson following some of the loungers drifted away too others crowded forward hoping for something else new that might make interesting gossip they were disappointed perfume and balsam and papyrus and dye were much less interesting than tiger skins again no one had said a word about emeraldssostratos hoped nobody would not hereand the gryphons skull remained in its wrappings this wasnt the place to take it out at least theyre still willing to let us trade sostratos said once we talk them into it yes menedemos said i wonder how much longer they will be though i dont know which is worse for people like us pirates prowling as they please or war among the marshals sostratos eyed his cousin in some surprise menedemos didnt usually think in such terms sostratos said they go together if the marshals werent warring someone would put down the pirates as things are the marshals use them and so they flourish youre probably right menedemos waved around the crowded harbor ptolemaios could put them down if he had a mind to hes got the fleet for it right here so could antigonos though his ships are more scattered but who does the piratehunting around these parts our little rhodes thats who if one of the marshals won he might care more about proper rule for the lands he held sostratos sighed but theyve been fighting among themselves ever since alexander died and even the truces theyve made havent been much more than breathing spells no end in sight either menedemos said sostratos wished he could have argued with his cousin but he clipped his head in agreement instead whitewash and marble and bright tile roofs against the lush green of springtime made kos one of the prettier cities around the aegeanindeed around the whole of the inner sea menedemos hurried down the quay from the aphrodite sostratos close behind i even remember how to find old xenophanes place menedemos said two streets in turn right three streets over and its right across from the boy brothel like rhodes kos city was built on a sensible grid it was an even newer town than rhodes the earlier polis on the island meropis had lain in the far southwest but an earthquake and a spartan sack during the peloponnesian war had put paid to it the new polis looked forward to anatolia not back toward hellas going two streets up and three streets over produced no sign of the silk merchants establishmentor of the boy brothel either menedemos dug his toes into the dirt of the narrow street im sure thats how we got here he muttered remember last year we had to pay somebody an obolos to tell us the way i remember sostratos said in fact i remember the fellow saying three streets up and two streets over if we go up one more street and back to our left im sure it was two up and three over menedemos looked around then shrugged but it couldnt have been could it he gave his cousin a glance half respectful half rueful ah right my dear well try it your way i know youve got the same nose for details as a fox does for chickens one block farther up one block back to the left and there was the boy brothel with the slaves lounging about in an anteroom open to the street waiting for whoever might want them sostratos didnt say i told you so menedemos wished he would have he would have preferred it to the smug expression sostratos wore the house across from the brothel was also familiar menedemos knocked on the door there before long a plump karian opened it he smiled at them well if it isnt the gentlemen from rhodes hail both of you welcome come in he spoke almost perfect greek hail menedemos said stepping forward as the karian slave stood aside to let him and sostratos into the house how are you pixodaros sostratos asked menedemos smiled his cousin did have the nose for details hed come up with the slaves name the year before too menedemos had heard it and promptly forgotten it again sostratos went on and hows xenophanes these days pixodaros expressive black eyebrows leaped toward his hairline havent you heard he began but then he shook his head proving he remained a barbarian no matter how long hed lived among hellenes no of course you wouldnt have for it happened a couple of months after the end of the sailing season xenophanes took sick with an inflammation of the lungs and died he had no living children of his own you know in his will he was kind enough to manumit me and leave me his business i see menedemos said slowly such things happened all the time if his father or sostratos had been childless he didnt want to think about that what he did think was wont forget pixodaros name now here we are the slaveno the freedmanled them to the parlor where theyd dickered with xenophanes the year before he waved them to stools sit down best ones he called for a slave to bring wine the year before hed done it himself when the wine came he splashed out a small libation my master had more than seventy years when he died well be lucky if we match him thats so menedemos poured a little wine onto the floor in xenophanes memory so did sostratos menedemos glanced over to his cousin both our fathers are past fifty how long will they live how long will we live he shivered as if hed heard an owl hoot in daylight and took a long pull at the wine again sostratos did the same thing maybe he was thinking along similar lines menedemos wouldnt have been surprised such thoughts fit his cousin better than him im not made for looking deep he thought and drank again presently pixodaros said and what is the news from the wider world menedemos laughed living here on kos youll know more of it than we will for ptolemaios has been making most of it so he has pixodaros didnt look delighted a moment later he explained why even more drunken sailors than usual making a racket in the street at all hours of the day and night he shrugged what can a peaceable man do pointing to menedemos he went on you were heading far into the west last year how did your journey fare what is the news from those places it was still early in the sailing season no ship from great hellas was likely to have come into these waters yet menedemos told of the romans war against the samnites and the larger and more important war syracuse was waging against carthage he spoke of the aphrodites journey into besieged syracuse with the grain fleet and of agathokles escape from syracuse and invasion of africa and there was the eclipse of the sun after we got into syracuse sostratos added pixodaros eyes widened i have heard of them but i have never seen one they really do happen then they really do sostratos said solemnly and theyre even more awesome to see than you would think from the tales about them menedemos thought about that then dipped his head in agreement well well pixodaros said and then again well well he chuckled and i think i go traveling when i leave the city to check the fields and orchards that are mine now you make me feel like a child in his cradle with a shrug menedemos said some people do one thing some another im glad xenophanes left his business in such good hands thank you xenophanes freedman looked from menedemos to sostratos and back again the two of you didnt come to kos just to chat no sostratos said we do have a certain interest in your silk we did well with it last year wed like to do well with it again what are you carrying pixodaros asked we have more of the crimson dye of byblos that xenophanes always liked to use menedemos answered as pixodaros dipped his headhe did it selfconsciously as if reminding himself to behave like a hellenesostratos added and we also have fine rhodian perfume i remember you were interested in it last year even though xenophanes wasnt menedemos hadnt remembered that hed kept xenophanes views in mind then but not those of the man whod been a slave then pixodaros dipped his head again yes i was i still amor i could be if the price is right we agree more or less on what silk is worth in terms of dye but in terms of perfume he leaned forward on his stool eager anticipation in his eyes we have a new dicker my friends he called to his slave who brought in more wine and olives and onions to go with it a new dicker indeed menedemos thought and this must be his first big one as a freedman he wants to start things off the right way he filled his cup from the mixing bowl and bit into an onion when you buy our perfume you know just what youre getting he said silk now id like to see what you want to sell us it shall be as you say pixodaros clapped his hands looking a little harassed the slave came back into the room pixodaros told him what he needed the slave nodded and hurried away he came back with a bolt of the rare fabric pixodaros held it up for his guests top quality o best ones as you see xenophanes showed me everything he knew it did look very good it was filmier than the gauziest linen menedemos could see pixodaros through it yet it also shone and sparkled as linen never did brothel keepers paid high prices to deck their girls in the stuff hetairai bought it for themselves and men eager for display or simply to have something few others in their polis did also set down their silver for silkcommonly in thicker grades what do you weave it from sostratos murmured he couldnt have expected an answer it was only his curiosity talking for a moment though pixodaros face went hard and hostile behind the transparent cloth that is the secret of kos he said the most i will ever say is that i was so surprised when i learned it you could guess from the fall of troy till now and you would never once come close as may be sostratos said i dont need to know in order to want it he turned to menedemos shall we get a hundred bolts as we did last year that suits me well enough menedemos said we wont be going into the west this trip but theres always a strong market for silk in athens he raised an eyebrow at pixodaros you do have it certainly the karian started to nod then caught himself and dipped his head all right then sostratos said shall we trade dye for half and perfume for the other half dye at the same rate we gave xenophanes last year i thought the old man could have done a little better pixodaros replied but let it be as you say now though the perfume top grade just like your silk menedemos said an akatos cant afford to carry anything but the best we make our money from quality a roundship captain with a load of olive oil in his hold can take along a little junk to peddle on the side because its not where most of his profit will come from we dont dare sell junk we always want the good and the beautiful sostratos stirred at thatthe words came right to the edge of philosophybut didnt speak and how much do you want for one of your jars of perfume as compared to the price for one of your jars of dye pixodaros asked menedemos smiled thats where the dickering comes in wouldnt you say pixodaros smiled too oil and wheat might have something close to a fixed price except in times of dearth but luxuries luxuries brought what the seller could get what the buyer could afford they drank they ate they haggled pixodaros flicked stones in the grooves of a countingboard he didnt offer it to the rhodians every so often sostratos would look up toward the ceiling lips moving not quite silently eyes far away he was better than anyone else menedemos had ever seen at working with numbers in his head he was slower than pixodaros with the advantage of the board but he got right answers at last as evening neared pixodaros held out his hand to menedemos and sostratos a bargain he said and menedemos dipped his head so did his cousin smiling pixodaros added xenophanes used to complain about how hard a dicker the two of you gave him i see he was right it works both ways menedemos returned flattery for flattery pixodaros beamed what would please you he asked would you stay to supper here or should i give you a guide to the rhodian proxenos house perhaps wed better see the proxenos sostratos answered hell wonder if hes done something to offend unless we call on him but would you be kind enough to send someone to the aphroditeto let our men know where well be menedemos might have been tempted to stay and see how the freedmans kitchen did but sostratos was formally correct and he knew it so did pixodaros who dipped his head playing the hellene again as you wish of course he called for a couple of slaves a year before they would have been his fellows now he owned them menedemos wondered what they thought of that did one of them hope to inherit the business as pixodaros had whatever they thought they obeyed one headed down to the harbor the other took menedemos and sostratos to the house of kleiteles son of ekdikos the wineseller who looked out for rhodian interests on kos menedemos gave the slave an obolos and sent him back to his master kleiteles was a plump happy man of about forty who looked to enjoy having guests pleased to see you my friends he said i heard you were in port and told the cook to make sure we had plenty thank you very much menedemos and sostratos said together my pleasure believe me kleiteles answered dont just stand there in the front hallcome along to the andron with me come come he shooed them along as if they were children he had practice at such things in the courtyard a boy of about eight and another perhaps five were playing in the fading light run upstairs kleiteles told them youll eat in the womens quarters tonight i have company your sons menedemos askedthey had the look of the koan kleiteles dipped his head promising lads menedemos remarked youre too kind best one kleiteles waved toward the andron go on in both of you use my home as your own a slave was lighting lamps and torches in the andron in one corner of the room stood a wickerwork cage with a jackdaw inside the gray and black bird hopped up and down a little ladder with a tiny bronze shield in its beak kleiteles laughed and tossed it some seeds it dropped the shield with a clink and started pecking them up such things always fascinated sostratos sure enough he asked how long did it take you to train the bird less time than youd think only a couple of months kleiteles answered theyre surprisingly cleverand of course the toy shield is shiny and jackdaws like such things how interesting sostratos said menedemos wondered if he would try to buy a jackdaw for himself when he got back to rhodes they ate reclining on couches with only three men in the andron each had one to himself the sitos was barley porridge flavored with onions and mushrooms and fennel for opson the cook brought in a casserole of shrimp and cheese and olives if nothing was spectacular everything was tasty and the wine which came out after the supper dishes were cleared away was very good indeed menedemos and sostratos traded news with kleiteles who said ah so you saw ptolemaios fleet go by did you i dont know how long hell stay here but business will surely be fine for as long as that is ive heard his wife is with him and that shes with child hadnt heard that myself menedemos said sostratos tossed his head to show he hadnt heard it either i dont know its true mind you kleiteles said if berenike is here she doesnt do her own shopping in the agora he chuckled so did menedemos but sostratos said oh berenike thats not ptolemaios wife thats his concubine hes married to eurydike old antipatros daughter he kept track of such things as carefully as he kept track of the relative values of silk and perfume is he kleiteles said in a slightly crestfallen voice hed had his news oh not quite turned false but at least weakened with a little thought menedemos might also have remembered to whom ptolemaios was married he didnt think he would have come out and said so though relentless precision could make a man harder to get along with but the proxenos fortunately didnt seem much offended after a few sips of wine his smile came back like the sun returning from behind a small cloud he called for a slave spoke briefly to the man and sent him away the fellow returned a bit later saying everything is ready master good good go on off to bed thenwe wont need you any more tonight kleiteles said the slave nodded and disappeared kleiteles turned to the rhodians i know youve had a busy day your rooms are waiting for you thank you for your kindness menedemos said and drained his cup he wouldnt have minded drinking a bit longer but he knew a hint when he heard one sostratos might not have but did own wit enough to get to his feet when menedemos did he cast a last glance at the jackdaw as kleiteles led them out of the andron and into the courtyard a couple of torches flickering there gave the wineseller enough light to lead the two cousins back to their rooms have a pleasant evening he said and ill see you in the morning off he went whistling a bawdy tune good night sostratos said and went into one of the chambers good night menedemos replied and went into the other the room held a stool a small clay lamp perched on it and a bed the bed held a woman not far from menedemos ageone of kleiteles slaves without a doubt she smiled at him hail she said hail menedemos answered with a smile of his own he wondered if sostratos had company in his bedroom too probably kleiteles was indeed a considerate host whats your name sweetheart im called eunoa the woman answered well eunoa get out of your chiton and well go on from there menedemos pulled his own tunic off over his head as soon as the woman was naked too he lay down on the bed beside her he took her hand and set it on his manhood while he kissed and caressed her breasts and rubbed her between the legs as most women did shed singed off the hair there her flesh was soft and very smooth presently menedemos stood her up and had her lean forward against the bed he poised himself behind her he was about to thrust home when she looked back over her shoulder and said i wish i didnt have to worry about making a baby he could have ignored her she was there to do as he wanted not the other way around but he shrugged and said bend a little more then and after spitting on himself to ease the way a little went in at the other door there is that better i suppose so eunoa answered it does hurt some though it was your choice menedemos said not pausing to wonder whether shed had a choice about coming to his bed he went on it didnt hurt him at all on the contrary after he finished he patted her round bottom here dear this is for you he said and gave her a couple of oboloi you dont need to tell kleiteles you got them from me thank you eunoa said it wasnt so bad the little silver coins evidently made it a good deal better menedemos had thought they would he lay down on the bed sleep with me well do it again in the morning whichever way you like he didnt say he would give her more money then but he didnt say he wouldnt either she lay down willingly enough the bed was narrow for two but not if they snuggled together his arms around the slave girl menedemos fell asleep sostratos woke up when the woman kleiteles had lent him for the night almost kicked him out of bed he had to clutch at the frame to keep from landing on the floor his sudden motion woke the slave up too they both needed a moment to remember what they were doing there lying side by side sostratos needed another moment to remember her name good day thestylis he said when he did good day sir she answered sitting up and yawning her breasts sagged a little her nipples were wide and dark he guessed shed borne a child before maybe it hadnt lived when he reached out and idly stroked her she said just a minute sir let me use the pot first if you dont mind he wasnt sure he wanted her again till she said that then he decided it would be a nice way to start the day go ahead he told her and after youre done ill use it myself and then but hed just set down the pot when brisk footsteps resounded out in the courtyard someone knocked first on his door then on the one beside it it the door to menedemos room thestylis let out a startled squeak she plainly hadnt expected anyone to disturb them so early the light leaking out through the shutters was predawn gray whos there sostratos asked his eye went to the little knife he carried now lying on the floor it was a tool much more than a weapon he heard menedemos asking the same question with the same undertone of worry after kaunos who could be sure staying in a proxenos house was safe its me kleiteles came the answer you gentlemen need to get dressed right away and come out why sostratos asked in some irritation he looked back at thestylis who lay naked and waiting on the bed not getting the chance to dip his wick after hed made up his mind that he was going to annoyed him but kleiteles answered because one of ptolemaios servants is standing here beside me ptolemaios wants to speak to you as fast as you can get to him ice ran through sostratos zeus has he found out about the emeralds how could be have found out about the emeralds but what else would he want to talk about he had no idea but he realized he was going to have to find out astonishment widened thestylis eyes as sostratos put on his chiton menedemos spoke from the other room ptolemaios wants to talk to us his cousin sounded unwontedly subdued nothing like being discovered or worrying that youve been discovered to put the fear of the gods in you sostratos thought the fear if not of the gods then of a power greater than his own was certainly in him thats right kleiteles answered along with another man presumably ptolemaios servant sostratos touched the hilt of that little knife much good it would do him against one of the great marshals of the hellenic world ill see you again sostratos told thestylis and hoped he meant it he opened the door and stepped out into the courtyard the fellow standing beside kleiteles reminded him of euxenides of phaselis without looking like him he was solidly made erect alert he looks like a soldierthats what it is sostratos thought hail the stranger said im alypetos son of leon sostratos gave his own name menedemos came out alypetos went through introductions again then gestured toward kleiteles doorway come with me best ones can you tell us why ptolemaios wants to see us sostratos asked as they went out onto the street i can make some guesses alypetos answered but i might be wrong and its not my place to gab anyhow something else occurred to sostratos weve just made a bargain with pixodaros the silk merchant hell probably bring his cloth to the aphroditethis morning expecting to pick up dye and perfume in exchange for it can you send someone to his house asking him to wait till were back to look things over for ourselves ill take care of it alypetos promised he didnt sound as if ptolemaios intended to do anything dreadful to sostratos and menedemos that left sostratos slightly reassured but only slightly he wouldnt would he if he did we might try to run away kos was waking up women with water jars gathered at a fountain some of them pausing to chat before they took the water back to their homes a farmer in from the countryside with a big basket of onions trudged toward the market square a stonecutter pounded away with mallet and chisel at a memorial stone a little naked boy pecker flapping as he ran chased a mouse till it slipped into a crack in a wall and got away the child burst into tears like any house in a polis the one where ptolemaios was staying presented only a blank whitewashed wall and a doorway to the world unlike any house sostratos had seen though this one had a couple of hoplites in full panoplycrested helm bronze corselet greaves shield spear sword on the hipstanding sentry in front of it hail alypetos said to them these are the rhodians ptolemaios wants to see hail the sentries said together then one of them added something that sounded as if it ought to be greek but made next to no sense to sostratos theyre macedonians he realized well no surprise that ptolemaioswould use his countrymen for bodyguards unless you were used to it the dialect macedonians spoke among themselves might almost have been another language alypetos had no trouble following it he says to bring you right on in he told sostratos and menedemos inside the house proved large and spacious with a fountain and a bronze of artemis with a bow in the courtyard alypetos ducked into the andron sostratos wondered whose home this was and where hed gone while ptolemaios was using it not a question to which youre likely to find an answer he thought alypetos emerged hes eating breakfast he said plenty of bread and oil and wine for the two of you as well go on in thank you menedemos said sostratos dipped his head now he knew real relief ptolemaios by all accounts was not the sort of tyrant who broke bread with a man one moment and ordered him tortured the next go on go on alypetos shooed them toward the andron menedemos put a bold front on things and strode into it sostratos followed content here to let his cousin take the lead ptolemaios looked up from dipping a chunk of bread in a bowl of olive oil ah you must be the rhodians he said speaking attic greek with a slight accent that put sostratos in mind of the way the bodyguards outside the house talked two more guards stood stolidly in the andron hail both of you have something to eat hail sir menedemos said hail sostratos added as he sat and reached for some bread he studied the ruler of egypt out of the corner of his eye ptolemaios was somewhere in his mid to late fifties but strong and vigorous for his years though his hair was gray he had all of it he wore it rather long with locks falling over his ears he had an engagingly ugly face with a big nose and a jutting chin a scar on one cheek a wide fleshy mouth and alert dark eyes under shaggy eyebrows to sostratos way of thinking he looked more like a peasant then a general a slave poured the rhodians wine from the mixing bowl sounding apologetic ptolemaios said its not very strong im afraid i dont care to start getting drunk first thing in the morning macedonians had and often lived up to a reputation for drunkenness but sure enough when sostratos sipped he discovered ptolemaios didnt live up to it the wine was cut three or four to one with water a thin mix indeed it was very good wine though and he said so thank you kindly ptolemaios smile was engagingly ugly too for it showed a couple of broken teeth hes no youth sostratos thought but he fought his way across persia and into india with alexander the great more scars old and white and puckered seamed his arms the bread was good too of wheat flour soft and fine and the oil had a sharp green tang that said it was squeezed from the first olives picked in the fall none of that surprised sostratos if the lord of egypt couldnt afford the best who could ptolemaios let him and menedemos eat and drink for a while then after sipping from his own cup and setting it down he said you boys are probably wondering why f sent for you this morning sostratos dipped his head his cousin said yes sir we were well id better tell you then hadnt i ptolemaios chuckled you looked a little green around the gills when you came in here but dont worry youre not in trouble leastways not with me i was talking with an officer from the nikelast night and he said you showed him a tiger skin is that right yes sir sostratos and menedemos said together menedemos sounded enormously relieved sostratos supposed he did too now they knew this had nothing to do with emeralds smuggled out of egypt where on earth did you find one ptolemaios asked in the market square in kaunos sir sostratos answered we got there a little sooner than you did menedemos added risking a smile yes the place is mine now ptolemaios agreed one of the fortresses above it surrendered to me i had to storm the other one but a tiger skin there really isnt that something he scratched his nose then asked what did you have in mind doing with it dionysos is supposed to have come from india sir menedemos said we thought we might sell it to a shrine of his for the cult statue to wear ah not a bad notion ptolemaios dipped his head when he looked up again his eyes were far away i hunted tigers a time or two in india formidable beaststhey make most lions seem like the little cats egypt is full of beside em never thought to see a tiger hide this far west though and thats the truth we were surprised too sostratos said we might have been more surprised than you in factweve never been to india after all thats true ptolemaios chuckled again the two of you wouldnt even have had hair on your balls yet when alexander led us there sostratos had a sense of great deeds undone a sense that the men of his own generation would always lag behind those of ptolemaios in glory before he could say anythingbefore he could even fully formulate the idea in his mindthe ruler of egypt went on would you boys sell that tiger skin to me instead of to a temple sostratos leaned forward in his chair so this isnt just a social call he thought menedemos sounded alert too as he answered we might sir as long as the price is right oh yes i understand that ptolemaios still looked more like a peasant than a general but he looked like a very shrewd peasant indeed well what sort of price did you have in mind you said it yourself its a oneofakind item menedemos said which means youre going to gouge me those shaggy eyebrows of ptolemaios came down and together in a frown the thing you need to remember is this is something id like to have not something ive got to have you stick me too hard ill say nice meeting you and send you on your way now lets try it againwhat do you want for the skin sostratos did some rapid mental calculating menedemos had got the tiger hide along with the two lion skins and the gryphons skull had he bought it by itself it would have cost about and that meant eight minai sir ptolemaios tossed his head nice meeting you he said have some more bread have some more wine and my man will take you back to your proxenos house he dipped another piece of bread in olive oil then slowly and deliberately ate it only after hed swallowed did he grudgingly add i might give you half that very nice meeting you sir menedemos said we have to make a profit ourselves you know one of the guards growled something in macedonian that didnt sound pleasant his hand slid toward the hilt of his sword relax lysanias ptolemaios said in his clear greek its only a haggle not a fight another question whose minai are we talking about sostratos asked now ptolemaios jabbed a thumb at his own chest why mine of course fair enough sostratos dipped his head it does help to be clear in advance it took five of ptolemaios drakhmaior multiplying a hundredfold five of his minaito make four of their attic equivalent the most commonly used weights among hellenes but since the rhodian drakhma was slightly lighter even than ptolemaios sostratos couldnt complain and the ruler of egypt didnt seem displeased at the question youre one of those fellows who likes to have everything just so alphabetagamma arent you thats not a bad thing especially in a young man i suppose i could give you four minai fifty drakhmai im certain wed do better somewhere else sostratos got to his feet so did menedemos sostratos turned to alypetos if youd be so kind as to guide us back to kleiteles theyd taken a couple of steps out of the andron before ptolemaios called after them wait he was smiling when they came back you like to play on the edge of the roof too dont you sostratos didnt menedemos he knew did but his cousin said sostratos is right well do better than that in athens say he sounded very sure of himself ptolemaios smile disappeared all right then you say you want eight minai and you dont think four and a half are enough somewhere in between there is a number that will make you happy lets find out what it is he proceeded to do just that looking back on it later sostratos realized it was funny here he sat facing what had to be the richest man in the worldand ptolemaios haggled like a poor housewife trying to knock a couple of khalkoi off the price of a sack of barley he gestured extravagantly he shouted and stamped his feet his eyebrows twitched he cursed in greek and then when he was really angryor trying to pretend he was really angryin macedonian he came up in the dicker as if every extra drakhma were pulled out of his belly sostratos did his best to bargain the same way menedemos backed him magnificently of course as ptolemaios had seen menedemos really did like taking chances and didnt seem to worry that infuriating the ruler of egypt might prove more dangerous than outraging a husband with a young pretty wife the dicker stretched through the whole morning at last sostratos said well best one shall we split the difference ptolemaios counted on his fingers he was good with numbers almost as good as i am sostratos thought without false modesty that would make whatsix minai thirtyfive drakhmai right yes sir sostratos dipped his head ill tell you what else it would make ptolemaios grumbled itd make you boys two of the biggest bandits left uncrucified he raised a hairy caterpillar of an eyebrow i could take care of that you know so you could sostratos said evenly if you want to make rhodes lean toward antigonos i cant think of a better way to go about it ptolemaios grunted just joking maybe he had been maybe he hadnt he went on this would have been easier if only you were fools all right six minai thirtyfive drakhmai a bargain a bargain sostratos agreed he stuck out his hand so did menedemos ptolemaios clasped each of theirs in turn his grip was hard and firm the grip of a man whod spent a lot of time with weapons in his hand sostratos said im sure i can get back to the harbor by myself if youd be so kind as to give me a man to guide me back here with the tiger skin right ptolemaios pointed a blunt shortnailed finger at the man whod gone to kleiteles house for sostratos and menedemos alypetos see to that yourself as you say sir alypetos replied he got to his feet ready when you are best one he told sostratos then lets go sostratos said he wished menedemos were getting the hide he would have liked sitting around and chatting with ptolemaios better it cant be helped he told himself and weve turned a nice profit too but he still knew regrets as he started off toward the harbor chances for buying and selling came every day butwhen would he next be able to talk with a man like the ruler of egypt ever again he had his doubts when he got to the aphrodite diokles gave him a curious look theres been a lot going on this morning hasnt there young sir the oarmaster said oh you might say so sostratos did his best to keep his tone casual by diokles expression his best wasnt good enough first kleiteles slave came saying ptolemaios had summoned your cousin and you then pixodaros slave showed up saying he knew hed have to wait with his silk on account of ptolemaios it was like pixodaros wanted to get huffy about that but didnt have the nerve i should hope not sostratos said a karian freedman wouldnt care to measure his privileges against those of alexanders marshal ptolemaios heard about our tiger skin from the officer who questioned us after the war galley made us heave to and hes bought it ah is that whats been going on diokles slowly dipped his head i did wonder and im not lying but thats good news then real good news it certainly is im going to take the skin now and get our pay for it sostratos boarded the aphrodite found the leather sack with the right hide and brought it back onto the quay alypetos didnt say anything but looked about to burst from curiosity taking pity on himand also realizing he might make a useful connection sostratos undid the rawhide lashing that held the sack closed and gave him a look at the tiger skin isnt that something ptolemaios man said softly he reached out and stroked the fur and the beast is as big as a lion we have two lion skins aboard too and this ones bigger than either sostratos answered the tiger doesnt seem to have a mane though as lions do isnt that something alypetos repeated he needed a moment to gather himself well lets get on back i can see why ptolemaios would pay for a hide like that indeed i can at the house the ruler of egypt had taken for his own more leather sacks these fat with silver lay waiting on a table in the andron ptolemaios had a couple of his men take the hide from the sack and spread it out so he could examine it he sighed thats a tiger skin sure enough been fifteen years since i last saw one of the beasts but im not likely to forget have you a scale sir so i can weigh the coins sostratos asked that would go much faster than counting them menedemos looked horrified sostratos had almost got himself into trouble with a request like that the summer before in syracuse and ptolemaios was vastly more powerful than agathokles of syracuse even dreamt of being but the marshals tone was mild as he asked dont trust me eh i didnt say that sir sostratos replied anyone can make a mistake or have servants who make a mistakeand i like to keep things straight yes ive noticed that ptolemaios said lets see what we can do his men found a balance in the kitchen but the weights werent of the proper standard count the drakhmai in one sack he suggested and then weigh the others against it just as you say sir sostratos agreed the sack he checked held a hundred drakhmai by the scale so did the othersexcept for the odd one which he also counted thank you for your patience sir everything is fine glad you approve ptolemaios voice was dry but he added if my men were as zealous in my service as you are in your own havent got so many men in my service sostratos thought i have to do more for myself who will if i dont but he wouldnt say that not even to so goodnatured a ruler as ptolemaios had proved to be on the way back to the aphrodite menedemos said i almost hit you when you wanted to start counting coins i do like having things straight and now i know they are sostratos answered what did ptolemaios talk about while i was getting the tiger skin oh this and that menedemos answered whereupon sostratos wanted to hit him he did his best to amplify some about hunting in india and the funny smells in the air there ah sostratos said thats interesting but it doesnt seem too historical why should it his cousin asked in a way menedemos question made perfect sense ptolemaios could talk about anything that crossed his mind and hed been thinking about tigers and distant india in another way because men will probably remember ptolemaios a hundred years from now the way we remember lysandros the spartan nowadays who menedemos said at first sostratos thought he was joking and laughed then he realized his cousin meant it he was very quiet all the way back to the merchant galley that evening menedemoswas all smiles for kleiteles no no my dear fellow he told the rhodian proxenos at supper it was barley bread cheese and fried spratsgood enough sitos but not much of an opson he heard we had a tiger skin and wanted to buy it from us he did too and gave us a nice price im glad to hear it kleiteles replied his garrison could have done worse than it has i dont deny that but people have disappeared when you two got summoned that way i feared the worst and i wont tell you any different he might almost have caught you in bed with his mistress are you all right best one just swallowed wrong answered sostratos whod choked on a sprat and suffered a coughing fit menedemos sent his cousin a venomous look sostratos gave back an innocent smilemuch too innocent for menedemos peace of mind and your dealings with pixodaros went well kleiteles asked oh yes menedemos dipped his head pity old xenophanes finally got ferried across the styx but the business seems in good hands pixodaros is a sharp fellow sostratos agreed no doubt but hes a foreigner kleiteles said too many freedmen holding down businesses that used to belong to citizens im glad ive got a couple of sons and i burn incense to the gods every day to keep them safe he sighed so many things can happen to children when theyre growing up and thats in time of peace with the war heating up again he grimaced and sighed again incense cant hurt sostratos said gravely menedemos knew his cousin meant it probably wouldnt help either but the proxenos didnt take it that way sostratos went on we just got some fine balsam from a couple of phoenicians in knidos id be pleased to give you a drakhmas weight of it tomorrow to help repay your kindness to us thank you very much kleiteles said with a broad smile ive been burning myrrh im sure the gods would fancy a fresh scent in their nostrils remind me in the morning best one before we go back to the aphrodite and ill take care of it sostratos said im a little absentminded im afraid and so he was but only in matters having to do with history or philosophy or birds or beastsnever in business menedemos dipped his bead in unreserved approval the balsam was a nice touch i should have thought of it myself the rhodian proxenos slave brought in the wine kleiteles ordered a stronger mix than he had the night before after a couple of cups he sang a bawdy song in a strong true baritone it wasnt a regular symposion but it came close kleiteles looked expectantly toward menedemos thinking of xenophanes crossing the styx gave menedemos his inspiration he quoted kharon the ferryman of the dead from aristophanes frogs whos off to a rest from evils and affairs whos off to the plain of oblivion or to take the fleece from a donkey or to kerberos crew or to the crows or to tainaron hed been to cape tainaron himself the year before these days instead of being nowhere to speak of it was a hiring center for mercenaries menedemos rolled on with the frogs going through dionysos preposterous confrontation with the chorus of croakers kleiteles laughed out loud thats good stuff he said raising his cup in salute to menedemosand perhaps to dionysos too koaxkoax he chuckled again then swung his gaze toward sostratos and what have you got for us best one menedemos wondered if his cousin would lecture as he often liked to doperhaps about lysandros the spartan whod evidentlybeen an important fellow a hundred years before but sostratos had something else in mind me he said im going to talk about gryphons and he did at some length about the goldguarding gryphons of the north and the oneeyed arimaspioi who were supposed to steal their hoarded gold from them about the way the nomadic skythians and the hellenic artists in their pay portrayed gryphons hes listened more to teleutas than i thought went through menedemos mind and about the way gryphons if there were such things really lookedall without mentioning that the aphrodite carried a gryphons skull along with its other cargo menedemos had heard the pieces of the talk before but never all together he was impressed almost in spite of himself when sostratos talked about something that interested him he interested those hearing him too he certainly interested kleiteles euge the proxenos exclaimed how do you go on about beasts you say are mythical as if youd seen one just the other day do i to menedemos ear sostratos sounded a little too bland to be convincing but kleiteles whod been drinking hard wasnt a critical audience he just dipped his head to show he thought sostratos did menedemos cousin smiled a small secretive smile homer was blind they say he never saw the things he sang about but hes made others see them ever since thats twice lately youve had praise for the poet menedemos said sostratos stuck out his tongue as far as it would go as if he were a hideous gorgon painted on a hoplites shield he and menedemos both laughed so did kleiteles even if he didnt understand all of the joke the cousins shared hed drunk himself thoughtful as he proved when he told sostratos you have a gift for explaining things do you know your letters you must a clever fellow like you when sostratos didnt deny it the rhodian proxenos went on you ought to write down what you just said so it doesnt get lost maybe i will one day sostratos replied ive thought about it you should kleiteles swigged from his cup shall we have another round of songs and such if youve got the girls waiting in our bedrooms i wouldnt mind going back there now menedemos said i do the proxenos laughed you two can screw yourselves silly with them if i brought a house slave to bed though my wife would never let me hear the end of it come on he picked up a lamp from a table ill take you back there when menedemos went into his chamber he nodded to the slave on the bed hail eunoa hail she said we didnt get a chance to do it this morning by that she doubtless meant you didnt get the chance to give me anything this morning menedemos dipped his head thinking if she were a man shed be at cape tainaron now shes mercenary enough she asked did ptolemaios really want to see you yes menedemos said and eunoa looked impressed and also proud as if giving herself to someone whod met the great man somehow made her more important slaves often basked in their masters reflected glory this seemed more of the same menedemos stripped off his tunic and lay down on the bed beside her as she had the night before eunoa fought shy of simply letting him take her i dont want to have a baby she repeated menedemos frowned she was supposed to be there for his pleasure not the other way round but he humored her sitting at the edge of the bed with his legs splayed wide eunoa scowled she liked that less than giving him her backside she finally squatted between his legs though and bent her head over his manhood his fingers tangled in her hair guiding her and urging her on before long she pulled back coughing and choking a little she found the chamber pot under the bed and spat into it sated and lazy menedemos gave her half a drakhma he would have had to pay a good deal more for the same pleasure in a brothel they stretched out on the bed side by side menedemos ran a hand along the sweet bare curve of her flank then blew out the lamp the room plunged into blackness he fell asleep almost at once when the sharp knock woke sostratos he thought for a moment he was dreaming of what had happened the morning before as he had then he lay tangled with kleiteles slave thestylis he and the woman both looked around in bleary surprise dawn was trickling in through the shutters another knock sounded this one next door alypetos is here again kleitejes said which convinced sostratos he really was awake ptolemaios wants to see both of you gentlemen at once but do i want to see ptolemaios sostratos muttered he tossed his head in annoyance that didnt matter even a free hellene found limits to his freedom when he dealt with a macedonian marshal sostratos patted thestylis saying go back to sleep if you can this has nothing to do with you he threw on his tunic and went out into kleiteles courtyard menedemos came out of the adjacent room at the same time he too looked unhappy what is it now he demanded of alypetos ptolemaios henchman only shrugged come with me he said grumbling and yawning sostratos and menedemos went as they had the day before they found ptolemaios at breakfast this morning though he offered them none but fixed them with the sort of glare calculated to make them remember all their sins and fear punishment for everyone sostratos did his best to show no expression at all does he know about the emeralds he wondered nervously his eyes flicked to menedemos his cousin fortunately was not a man to show guilt even if he felt it ptolemaios thrust out his boulder of a chin and growled why didnt you two tell me you had one of that oneeyed bastards officers aboard your ship when you sailed into knidos he doubtless meant to intimidate them but since it had nothing to do with the gems his blunt question came more as a relief than anything else why should we have sostratos answered rhodes is free and autonomous and neutral we can carry whoever pays our fare he paid ten drakhmai too menedemos added ten drakhmai for passage from rhodes to knidos you cheated him right and proper ptolemaios said his anger seemed to evaporate he might have donned it as a man dons a himation on a chilly morning and sheds it when the sun climbs higher he eyed the two traders free and neutral rhodians eh yes sir sostratos said stoutly all right then ptolemaios said if you did a service for antigonos and made a profit will you do one for me as well if we profit from it menedemos answered you will ptolemaios said in a voice that brooked no contradiction ill pay you a talent of silvertwenty minai in advance to give you whatever money youll need on the way with the other forty waiting for you when you come back here to kos a talent sostratos and menedemos both whispered the words sixty minai six thousand drakhmaithat was a lot of money slowly sostratos said you wouldnt offer us so much silver for just anything sir what have you got in mind youre a clever fellow arent you i thought so before by the way you haggled ptolemaios said yes youre right i wouldnt pay so much for anything easy youll know that antigonos nephew polemaios broke with his uncle last year and went over to kassandros menedemos dipped his head at the same time as sostratos said yes we did know chat all right then ptolemaios said briskly hes holed up in khalkis these days on the island of euboia and hes decided he doesnt like kassandros any better than he liked his uncle he was jealous of antigonos sons i dont know what his quarrel with kassandros isi just know he has one hed make me a useful ally i think wed make you a useful tool is what you mean sostratos thought he wondered how wise the ruler of egypt was if polemaios had fallen out with both antigonos and kassandros in a years time he was liable to turn in the hand of anyone who tried to wield him but that was ptolemaios worry not his he said and you want us to go up to khalkis and get him and bring him back down here to me thats right ptolemaios said he needs to slide out of the place without anyones being the wiserhe hasnt got the fleet to just up and sail away no he wouldnt have the ships for that sostratos agreed hed have to come past the coast of attica on the way south athens isnt what it was in the days of perikles but it still has a decent navy and demetrios of phaleron is kassandros creature exactly i have officers who wouldnt see it that fast ptolemaios said polemaios soldiers can get out a few at a time in small craft once hes escaped hell lose some but a lot of them will join him here polemaios himself is the man i really want what do you say rhodians sostratos knew what he wanted to say he wanted to say no to another delay in reaching athens with the gryphons skull and this one would be all the more frustrating because the aphroditewould go past the eastern coast of attica on the way to and from khalkis but ptolemaios had given him and menedemos one big reason to say yesor looked at another way six thousand little reasons that thought had hardly crossed his mind before menedemos who as captain of the akatos had the final word gave it sir we say yes good i thought you would once i made sure you werent really on antigonos side ptolemaios said he snapped his fingers and called for a house slave the man hurried away returning with bread and oil and wine for sostratos and menedemos aside from trying to put us in fear as long as he was feeling us out about euxenides he didnt want to eat with us sostratos realized sir can we get a steering oar made before we sail menedemos asked were carrying one thats a makeshift of green timber it got us here but ill send a carpenter to your ship right away ptolemaios said he ordered another slave off with the message anything else i can do for you i want polemaios back here as soon as may be the money sostratos said ptolemaios smiled ah yesthe money dont you worry about that it will reach your ship before the day is out sostratos believed him a lot of men even those who had a great deal would have lied about such a sum others would have haggled endlessly ptolemaios himself had haggled endlessly over the tiger skin the skin though had been something he wanted but not something he felt he had to have getting antigonos nephew here to kos was different something else occurred to sostratos how will polemaios know were working for you sir how do we convince him were not in his uncles pay or kassandros i said you were a clever fellow didnt i ptolemaios beamed at him ill give you a letter and seal it with my eagle he held out his right fist on one thick finger he wore a gold signet ring whose design was an eagle like the ones on the reverse of his coins itll come to your ship with the first installment of the money anything else after glancing at menedemos sostratos tossed his head no sir i think thats everything good enough then ptolemaios was all business would you care for anything else to eat or drink no do you need alypetos to take you back down to the harbor no very good very good a pleasure talking to you the two rhodians found themselves on the street in front of ptolemaios residence in a matter of moments a talent of silver menedemos said softly well earn it sostratos answered were running the gauntlet for him we can do it menedemos sounded confidentbut then he usually did he went on what we need to do though is stop at pixodaros home on the way to the ship we want to make sure we get the silk aboard before ptolemaios men finish their deliveries right sostratos said and wed better hurry too because i dont think theyll waste much time i dont either menedemos said as they headed toward the harbor he went on now was it two streets up and three over from the seaside or the other way round three up and two over sostratos answered why cant you remember something like that i dont know my dear menedemos answered but i dont need to bother not when ive got you around it was praise of a sort about as much as sostratos ever got from his cousin they went down toward the sea together as the aphroditemade her way north and west the rowers taking turns at the oars when the wind faltered menedemos waited for the trouble he was sure he would have hed guessed it would come before the end of their first day out of kos and his guess proved a good one not long after noon sostratos ascended to the poop deck he peered off to starboard at the island of kalymnos then ahead toward the smaller more distant island of lebinthos where theyd probably pass the night he coughed a couple of times i know what youre going to say menedemos told him the answer is no his cousin jerked in surprise how do you know what im going to ask you because o best one youre transparent as air menedemos answered youre going to say something like we could stop in athens on the way up to khalkis it wouldnt take long and we could get rid of the gryphons skull arent you sostratos turned red as a roof tile well what if i am he muttered his voice gained strength its true so it is menedemos said but weve got forty minai waiting for us in kos how much do you suppose that precious skull will bring if were lucky something on the order of six minai sostratos answered lucky thatd take a miracle from the gods menedemos said whod be mad enough to pay such money for an old bone what he meant was no one would pay such money for an old bone sostratos understood him perfectly well too but he said youre not always as smart as you think you are damonax son of polydoros offered me that much back on rhodes menedemos stared and you told him no you must have told him no sostratos dipped his head still astonished menedemos asked but why you cant think well get more than that in athens i dont his cousin admitted but i took the skull to show it to him not to sell i dont want it gathering dust in a rich mans andron or on display at drinking parties like kleiteles jackdaw with the little bronze shield i want men who truly love wisdom to study it you must menedemos said and then im glad no mosquito bite ever gave me the itch for philosophy he gathered himself but even if we got ten minai for the gryphons skull thatd only be a quarter part of forty we can pick up polemaios bring him back to kos and then we can head for athens am i right or am i wrong with a longing sigh sostratos said oh youre right i suppose but that doesnt mean i have to like it scuffing his feet on the planking he descended from the poop deck into the waist of the merchant galley did i hear right skipper diokles asked in a low voice six minai of silver for that silly skull and he turned it down whos crazier that other fellow for saying hed pay it or your cousin for telling him no to the crows with me if i know menedemos answered also quietly and the oarmaster laughed but menedemos went on he really does chase philosophy the way i chase girls doesnt he in an odd sort of way the way he would have admired a boy who declined an expensive gift from a suitor he didnt fancy he found himself admiring sostratos for rejecting damonaxs enormous offer you have more fun diokles said that made menedemos chuckle well i think so too he said but if sostratos doesnt who am i to tell him hes wrong diokles grunted i can think of a good many hetairai whod be happy if a fellow gave em half a dozen minai fact is i cant think of any so grand that they wouldnt be menedemos only shrugged maybe thais whod talked alexander the great into burning persepolis but maybe not too the aphroditeneared lebinthos as the sun neared the aegean sea to the west menedemos steered the akatos toward a nice little harbor on the southern coast of the island both steering oars felt alike in his hands again with seasoned timber at their disposal ptolemaios carpenters hadnt needed long to replace the makeshift euxenides of phaselis had made but even theyd praised it as they took it off the pivot aristeidas go forward menedemos called if a pirates lurking in that bay youd be the first to spot him not likely skipper diokles said as aristeidas went no water to speak of on lebintnos if its got more than a family of fisherman living on it id be amazed so would i menedemos answered but i dont want any nasty surprises the keleustes could hardly argue with that and didnt but the small sheltered bay was empty save for shore birds which flew up in whitewinged clouds as the aphroditebeached herself the beach seemed so deserted menedemos wondered if sea turtles laid their eggs here too ill send out some men to probe the sand with sticks he thought sostratos came over to him lebinthos he said pronouncing the name of the island like a man prodding his teeth with his tongue feeling for a bit of food that might have got stuck there and then being the sort of fellow he was he found what he was looking for didnt ikaros fly past this place on his way north from crete menedemos looked up to the sky stars would be coming out very soon now i dont know he answered if he did fly by he probably took one look at it and pissed on it from up high scoffer sostratos laughed he seemed to have forgotten he was supposed to be angry at menedemos and menedemos didnt remind him its true menedemos said well it could be true anyhow maybe thats why this is such a blighted little place his cousin laughed again but then turned serious if a few people did live on lebinthos theyd probably turn that into a myth to explain why more people couldnt that made a certain amount of sense but being sensible didnt make menedemos comfortable with it you called me a scoffer he said i was just making a silly joke you sound like you mean it dont you think thats how a lot of myths got started sostratos asked as explanations for the way things are i mean maybe i never worried about it much though menedemos answered the idea of asking why about a myth as one might to a story of how a cart broke a wheel made him nervous myths are just myths thats all do you really think so sostratos said even at sunset and the beginning of twilight his eyes gleamed ob dear menedemos thought ive found an argument that interests him will i get any sleep tonight sostratos went on how do you know that till youve examined them trying to head him off menedemos chuckled and said you sound like you come straight out of sokrates thinkingshop in the clouds that didnt work he should have known it wouldnt sostratos said you know what i think of aristophanes for that theyd argued over the play before with a small sigh menedemos dipped his head yes i do he tried again this time by pointing into the eastern sky theres zeus wandering star he poked his cousin in the ribs with an elbow and what else could it possibly be but zeus wandering star i dont know sostratos admitted but we cant get close enough to examine it so how can we be sure he sent menedemos a sly look maybe ikaros could have given you a better answer the same as he would have about the sun look what he got for flying too close to that menedemos mimed falling from a great height then toppled onto the sand in lieu of splashing into the sea youre impossible but sostratos was laughing in spite of himself a sailor with a pole in his hand came up to menedemos and said doesnt seem like there are any turtle eggs on this beach oh well menedemos shrugged weve got enough bread and oil and olives and cheese for sitos and a sort of opson and enough water to mix with the wine for one night ashore here thatll do well enough up the beach from the aphrodite the men fed bits of dry shrubs to a couple of fires theyd got going menedemos didnt think the night would be very cold but fires always made a place more comfortable and then someone with a bronze hook and a line hauled a fish out of the sea before long it was cooking over one of those fires back home on rhodes menedemos would have turned up his nose at such a meager supper out on a trading journey he ate with good appetite he was spitting an olive pit onto the sand when sostratos came up to him and asked where will we head for tomorrow naxos i think menedemos answered i dont know whether well get therethats got to be something like five hundred stadia but we can put in there the next morning if we dont have we got enough water aboard for another day at sea he asked menedemos dipped his head for one more day yes for two i wouldnt want to push it but we can fill up when we get into port there naxos is the best watered of the kyklades thats true sostratos agreed its certainly not a driedup husk like lebinthos here with a shrug menedemos said if this place had a couple of springs it would just be another pirates roost its out in the sea by itself but close enough to the other islands to hunt from the way things are though the bastards cant linger here sostratos sighed i suppose youre right my dear too bad we have to worry about things like that i didnt say it wasnt menedemos replied now im going to finish eating and then go to sleep he wondered if he would have to be blunter than that sostratos didnt always take a hint but his cousin said all right and found his own place on the sand to lie down menedemos wrapped himself in his himation the days warmth was seeping out of the air faster than hed expected next thing he knew morning twilight brightened the eastern sky a brisk breeze from out of the northeast sent the aphroditebounding across the waves even before noon sostratos said i think we will make naxos by nightfall if this wind holds we will menedemos agreed the wind tousled his hairand sostratos too it thrummed in the rigging and filled the sail the rowers rested at their oars a breeze like this pushed the merchant galley along as well as they could have sostratos finally had his sea legs the aphrodites pitching and rolling had left him queasy at the start of the sailing season now he didnt even notice them till he realized he would have noticed them before he wondered if that realization would bring back the queasiness but it didnt he was over it for another year naxos crawled up over the western horizon central mountain first and then the rest of the island its polis lay in the northwest beyond the northernmost headland the aphroditerounded the headland and dropped down toward the port with the sun at least an hour away from setting menedemos took his hands off the steering oars long enough to clap them together thats one of the nicest days runs ive ever made he said euge o best one sostratos said agreeably and now here we are in a place where all sorts of interesting things used to happen his cousin raised a quizzical eyebrow used to happen he echoed i suppose everyone knows this is where theseus abandoned ariadne sostratos said and menedemos dipped his head sostratos went on this is also one of the places where the hellenes first rebelled against the persians a generation later the naxians sent four ships to fight for xerxes the great king at salamisbut they went over to the hellenes instead and a few years after that the athenians laid siege to naxos and took it because it tried to secede from the delian league nobody knew it then but that was one of the first steps on the road that led to the peloponnesian war menedemos only grunted he was intent on getting the aphroditea berth in naxos little harbor diokles gave sostratos a curious look you dont mind my asking young sir he said but how do you know all that with a shrug sostratos answered well you know about theseus and ariadne yourself dont you i suppose id heard it the keleustes said but i cant say i remembered it and as for the rest thats in the writings of herodotos and thoukydides sostratos said i just put it all together like a man making a table from the top and the legs diokles scratched his head with a carpenter you can see the pieces beforehand the way you go on its like youre grabbing them out of the air sostratos collects funny facts the way a carpenter collects fancy pieces of wood menedemos said and a carpenter can only use a piece of wood in one table or chair but sostratos gets to use his facts over and over again he grinned at sostratos it was a half mocking grin or more than half but the figure was so apt sostratos just grinned back if that disappointed menedemos he didnt show it he went back to steering the merchant galley a fishing boat that spotted the aphroditelater than it should have loweredall but droppedits sail from the yard and did its best to get away from what it thought to be a pirate ship had the akatos really been a pentekonter it would have run down the tubby little fishing boat inside a couple of stadia some of the rowers jeered at the fleeing fishermen theyre running now teleutas said but when they tell about it in a tavern tonight theyll all be heroes that made the aphrodites crewmen laugh and send more jokes after the fishing boat sostratos laughed too but he eyed teleutas thoughtfully he sounds like a man who knows what hes talking about went through his mind no sooner had the merchant galley tied up at a naxian quay than an officer came up and started asking questions naxos favored antigonos it belonged to the island league hed started in the kyklades a few years before out of kos eh the officer said suspiciously what were you doing there buying silk sostratos answered doing his best to sound impatient rather than nervous were bound for athens always a good market for silk in athens athens was as much a thing of kassandros as naxos was of antigonos still the lie seemed far better than saying they were going to euboia to get antigonos unloved and unloving nephew and the officer didnt pursue it he had other things on his mind nervously licking his lips he asked is it true has ptolemaios really come to kos sostratos dipped his head its true he made his voice deep and solemn with a fleet with a big fleet thats true too this time menedemos beat sostratos to the punch he by contrast sounded amused with a big fleet ptolemaios could sweep the island league off the face of the earth menedemos knew it sostratos knew it the officer talking with them knew it too he looked very unhappy do you know what his plans are he asked after a pause oh of course now sostratos sounded sardonic ptolemaios invited us to breakfast so we could talk things over sometimesoftenthe truth served up with irony made the most effective lie antigonos officer turned red all right all right he said roughly sure enough he didnt believe the truth where doubtless he would have accepted any number of falsehoods sostratos wondered what sokrates would have had to say had someone wondered about this while he was close by something worth hearing the rhodian was sure the officer went on will you trade here tomorrow now sostratos hesitated ptolemaios would want polemaios back on kos as soon as possible but naxos was a big enough polis that passing up a chance to do business here would make people like this fellow wonder why while sostratos weighed advantages and risks menedemos cut through them as alexander was supposed to have cut through the gordian knot saying well spend the morning here anyhow best one while we fill our water jugs after that well we want to get to athens as fast as we can as irony had glibness satisfied the officer he walked back down the pier can we make mykonos in half a day sostratos asked from here i expect so menedemos answered and who knows maybe we really will sell some silk in the agora tomorrow maybe sostratos didnt believe it but he didnt argue theyd already been surprised a couple of times this sailing season he did point north and ask if we leave tomorrow a bit after noon are you really sure we can get up to mykonos by sunset hazepurple in the distance the other island heaved itself over the seasmooth horizon with tiny holy delos and the altogether mundane rheneia off to its left i told you once that i think so his cousin answered with a grin menedemos went on remember what a hard time we had last year convincing the people there that we werent a pack of pirates i sure do sostratos said we almost had trouble with pirates ourselves in those waters i could do without that a lot of bald men on mykonos menedemos ran a hand through his thick dark hair i could do without that laughing sostratos said be careful my dear or your beauty will make me swoon how can i possibly lie down on the poop deck beside you tonight and hope to go to sleep that made menedemos laugh too it also made him preen a little he was a handsome man and had had more than his share of suitors as a youth for a while a good many walls in rhodes had had beautiful menedemos and other such endearments scrawled on them hed basked in his popularity too tall and plain and gawky sostratos had hidden jealousy behind a mask of indifference eventually the mask became the thing itself but it took a while with aphrodites wandering star already glowing in the west it was too late to go looking for the rhodian proxenos here they did sleep on the poop deck with the stars and mosquitoes for company in the morning menedemos sent a party of sailors into the polis with water jars with a chuckle he said you boys can surprise the women who gossip around whatever fountain you find now youve done it sostratos said watching the rowers straighten up and start to primp well be lucky if they dont jump ship theyd better not his cousin said anybody whos not aboard by noon gets left behind that means they wont be able to get away from her husband or her father or her brothers he spoke like a man with considerable experience in such matters sostratos knew he was more sailors carried silk and dye and balsam and perfume and papyrus and ink behind sostratos and menedemos as they made their way to the naxian market square sostratos had to give a local an obolos for directions naxos was an old town with streets running every which way men in the agora shouted about their garlic and cheeses their barley and wool their olives and olive oil their raisins and the local wines just another smalltown market sostratos said menedemos chuckled well take care of that by the gods as soon as theyd found a place that would stay shady all morning long and the sailors had set up the goods theyd brought along he sang out koan silk rhodian perfume crimson dye from byblos balsam from engedi finest in the world for a moment everybody else in the market square stopped and gaped menedemos went right on crying his wares he liked being the center of attention he liked few things better in fact having all the people within earshot crane their heads his way was sitos and opson and unwatered wine to him papyrus from egypt sostratos added for good measure its been going fastget it while weve still got some left best quality ink silk perfume crimson balsam before long they had quite a crowd around their little display people eager to feel and to sniff and to gawk the naxians were ionians and dropped their rough breathings ere be careful get off my foot e meant you no e didnt e meant you watch where you put your ands pal youve got nutting wort watching lady people did plenty of looking yes they were less eager to part with their silver though a physician did buy a couple of drakhmais worth of balsam good to see it here he said gravely i find it very useful but i seldom have a chance to buy any you should get more then sostratos said so i should the fellow smiled a sweet sad smile trouble is i cant afford to necessity is master of us all he took the little bit of balsam he had bought and went on his way sostratos also sold a pot of ink and menedemos sold a couple of jars of perfume but business was slow when aristeidas made his way into the market square to report that the water jars were filled sostratos and his cousin breathed identical sighs of relief menedemos glanced at the sun not quite noon yet but close enough lets pack up and head back to the ship sostratos said not a word in protest before long the aphroditeglided north over the waves diokles called out the stroke for the rowers they were heading straight into the wind so they went by oars alone with the sail brailed up to the yard sostratos said well have an easier time bringing polemaios back to kos his cousin gave him an odd look as far as wind and weather go yes menedemos said after a brief pause sostratos ears burned a lot of other things besides wind and weather might be involved at panormos on the north coast of mykonos the aphroditegot mistaken for a pirate ship again that amused menedemos and saddened him at the same time he needed all his persuasive talent to keep the townsfolk there from either fleeing into the interior of the island or else attacking his ship good thing we dont want anything more than an anchorage for the night he told sostratos after the locals calmed down i know his cousin answered i hope we dont run into any of the real searaiders as we head up towards euboia may it not come to pass menedemos exclaimed and spat into the bosom of his tunic to turn aside the evil omen so did sostratos menedemos smiled for all of sostratos philosophy he could act as superstitious as any other seaman sostratos coughed and looked faintly embarrassed though he had a sailors superstitions he didnt wear them comfortably as most sailors did he seemed to be looking for a way to change the subject another night aboard ship panormos had no rhodian proxenos to menedemos way of thinking the place barely counted as a polis were probably better off here than we would be on dry land he said i should think so sostratos sent menedemos a sly look no girls aboard the aphrodite though any girls in a backwater place like panormos would likely be ugly anyhow menedemos replied he spread out his himation on the poop deck lay down on it and wrapped it around himself and fell asleep when he woke up sostratos was snoring beside him he got to his feet and pissed into the sea the sky was lightening toward dawn diokles was awake too he looked back over his shoulder from the bench on which hed been resting and waved to menedemos who dipped his head in return he let those sailors who could sleep till the sun followed rosyfingered aurora up over the horizon then the men whod already wakened roused those whod stayed asleep they ate bread and oil and olives and onions with diokles beating out the stroke they headed north and west toward euboia a year before the aphroditehad sailed past delos on her way toward cape tainaron now she left the sacred island and its ordinary neighbor behind pushing up toward tenos and andros the ship hadnt even come close to tenos one of the larger of the kyklades before menedemos told diokles stop us for a bit all right skipper the oarmaster said and called out oöp to the crew the eight men on the oars on each side rested they and the rest of the sailors looked back expectantly at menedemos time to serve out weapons he said i just dont like the way things feel if were ready for trouble maybe we can hold it away from us probably not a bad idea diokles said men put on sword belts and leaned pikes and javelins by their benches or in other spots where they could grab them in a hurry menedemos set his bow and a full quiver of arrows on the poop deck behind him he could string the bow and start shooting in the space of a couple of heartbeats aristeidas go forward he called i want the best lookout weve got up there the sharpeyed sailor waved and hurried to the foredeck menedemos dipped his head to diokles all right we can get going again rhyppapai the keleustes sang out rhyppapai the oars bit into the blue water of the aegean the merchant galley slid forward again sostratos came back to the raised poop he had a sword on his hip and contrived to look foolish with it like an actor in a role he hadnt rehearsed in athens he said they talk about nervous men who see every distant headland as a pirate ship menedemos declined to get ruffled in athens from what i hear they dont do much of anything bat talk he said tell me best one how many islands in the kyklades some say twelve others fifteen his cousin answered thats about what ive heard menedemos agreed but when they make that count do they reckon in rocks like the one ahead he pointed to an islet just big enough to support a handful of bushes certainly not sostratos said as if making a rejoinder in a philosophical discussion but this was property not philosophy freedom or slavery not words could pirates hide behind that nasty rock and come charging out when they see a merchantman go by menedemos asked yes without a doubt sostratos laughed i sound like one of sokrates foils dont i i was thinking the same thing as a matter of fact menedemos said youd know better than i would thoughim sure of that but it doesnt really matter what matters is that you take my point sostratos set a hand on his swordhilt he still didnt look very warlike but he said would i be wearing this if i didnt no hemiolia or pentekonter emerged from behind the rock but another rock lay ahead only fifteen or twenty stadia away beyond that one was the bulk of tenos whose jagged west coast offered raiders countless lairs the polis of tenos like panormos hardly rated the name it had no fleet to speak of and didnt even try to keep pirates down andros the next island to the north and west might have been tenos twin and a pirate ship based on syros off to the west toward attica might spot the aphroditecoming by and dash out to try to seize her its not just aristeidas up by the stempost menedemos said we all have to keep our eyes open because well all pay for it if we dont well certainly sostratos said menedemos frowned you say certainly now a moment ago you were talking about nervous athenians and what they think they see what if i washis cousin said youre neither nervous nor an athenian so whats that got to do with you after a moments thought menedemos decided he meant it maybe i was looking for an argument where there wasnt one to find he thought maybe he still had trouble believing it more likely sostratos was just finding smoother ways to get under his skin the akatos slid past the city of tenos the great temple to poseidon a few stadia to the west and the hills rising up behind she found no trouble a few fishing boats fled from her menedemos had grown used to that they might spread the word that a pirate galley was brazenly cruising in the neighborhood he shrugged the more ships that run from us the fewer ships we have to run from having passed tenos town menedemos looked up into the bright blue bowl of the sky and drummed his fingers on the steeringoar tillers they both felt the same again and he was still getting used to that he drummed some more he didnt think the merchant galley would get all the way up to andros polis by nightfall that meant finding an anchorage somewhere short of the city plenty of promontories without a doubt making sure he found one no raiders were already using his fingers went up and down up and down sostratos pointed west toward the headland of attica clearly visible though misty with sea haze sighing menedemos cousin said we could be heading there we should be heading there and we will be heading there my dear menedemos said we have to pick up polemaios and bring him back to kos then we come back to athens he drummed on the steeringoar tillers yet again we get to come through the kyklades twice i could live without that before sostratos could answer aristeidas and several other sailors shouted ship ho and ship to starboard and pirate coming at us others added curses that would have sunk the hemiolia sprinting out from behind a spit of land if only the gods were listening all men to the oars menedemos called and the crew scrambled to obey as soon as every oar was manned he turned to diokles and barked give us the stroke keleustesthe best we can do right you are skipper rhyppapai rhyppapai the oarmaster struck urgent notes from die bronze square the rowers grunting with effort pulled hard and the aphrodite which had been ambling over the winedark aegean seemed to gather herself and then leap forward since theyd been going against the wind the sail was already brailed up to the yard menedemos glanced over toward the onrushing pirate ship her crew had taken down her mast and stowed it before sallying forth and however fast the akatos was going the hemiolia by the nature of things had a better turn of speed the aphroditeneeded to carry cargo as well as rowers and was beamier than the lean predator knifing through the water propelled by its two banks of oars menedemos smile went wolfish relative speeds would have mattered more had he been trying to run away but that wasnt what he intended he yanked hard on the steeringoar tillers swinging the aphroditestraight toward the pirate ship going to ram eh sostratos said if those bastards dont sheer off i will menedemos answered hed played this game before pirate galleys werent warshipsthey wouldnt strike home without counting the cost they wanted easy victims not fights show them you were ready to give them all they could handle and they werent so likely to want anything to do with you that was the theory on which menedemos operated anyhow it had worked for him more than once this time this time his ship and the piratical hemiolia closed with each other at a truly frightening clip the wind of the aphrodites passage blew against his face and ruffled his hair the hemiolia showed no signs of backing away she swelled with each stroke of the merchant galleys oars with each stroke of her own she had archers on the foredeck and a blackbearded ruffian at the steering oars bawling orders to his crew archers menedemos said sostratos duck under me here grab my bow and arrows and go forward youre a decent shot and youre not rowing or steering certainly his cousin answered and did it he fumbled a little as he strung the bow but he was ready to shoot by the time he got to the aphrodites foredeck menedemos knew he was a better archer than sostratos but he was also the akatos best shiphandler and that counted for more only a couple of stadia separated the two galleys now less every heartbeat the rowers gasping and drenched with sweat couldnt see that but menedemos could he bit his lip till he tasted blood had he outsmarted himself the hemiolia carried more men than his akatos if it came to that kind of fight he would likely lose but if i ram or if i can scrape my hull along her side and break half her oars hed done that to a roman trireme the summer before an astonishing victory for an akatos but those italians had been amateurs on the sea by the way she was rowed by the way she steered the hemiolia had a solid crew now whos got more nerve menedemos wondered me or that son of a whore over there theyre shooting diokles said the rhythm of mallet on bronze never faltered i see em menedemos answered grimly the arrows splashed into the sea ahead of the aphrodite sram archers always started too soon menedemos raised his voice to a shout give em a couple sostratos show em weve got teeth too his cousin waved drew the bow back to his ear and let y to menedemos astonished delight one of the bowmen on the pirate ship clutched at his shoulder his howl of pain came loud and clear across the water sostratos whooped joyfully and shot again he had no luck that time or none menedemos could see and then instead of going on to make a ramming attack against the aphrodite the hemiolia heeled sharply to starboard the pirates oarmaster screamed at his men to get the last little bit of speed from them and make sure the merchant galley couldnt ram their ship the blackbearded chieftain lifted a hand from the steering oars to shake a fist at menedemos menedemos lifted his hand too to blow the pirates a kiss that hemiolia was faster than the aphrodite even had menedemos wanted to pursue the pirates which he didnt he couldnt have caught them let the men ease off diokles he said thinking if iwere the captain of a trireme i would go after those bastards but even a trireme as swift a naval vessel as there was couldnt always keep up with a hemiolia menedemos scowled wishing there were a ship that could scour swift pirate galleys from the seas but his scowl didnt last the rowers raised a panting cheer and diokles said that was nicely done skipper most of those abandoned catamites havent got the stomach for a real fight thats what i was counting on menedemos answered the son of a whore with the whiskers made me nervous though i wondered if he really did want to mix it up he raised his voice so everyone on board could hear lets have a cheer for sostratos who shot a pirate with his first arrow the rowers hadnt seen that of course theyd been looking back toward the stern the cheer they gave menedemos cousin was louder than the one hed got himself they had some of their wind back menedemos watched with amusement as sostratos still up on the foredeck gave a wave the rowers also couldnt see and stammered out thank you very much even when he gets a chance to shine he doesnt know what to do with it menedemos thought carrying the bow and quiver sostratos made his way back toward the stern menedemos greeted him with a line from the iliad hail best of the akhaioi in archery im not you know sostratos answered with his usual relentless honesty youre a better shot than i am though not by a lot and hitting anything when youre shooting at a moving target from a moving ship is as much a matter of luck as anything else both those things were true neither of them mattered even an obolos worth not right now menedemos tossed his head you wont get out of it that easily my dear like it or not youre a hero he would have basked in the acclaim himself what was a man worth unless his fellows praised him not much not as far as menedemos was concerned but sostratos turned as red as a handsome youth importuned for the first time by an older man menedemos swallowed a sigh there were times when his cousin took modesty much too far the channel between andros and euboia had an evil reputation but its waters were calm enough when the aphroditecrossed it once euboia lay on the ships right hand and the coastline of attica on the left sostratos allowed himself the luxury of a sigh of relief we dont have to worry about that anymore he remarked menedemos tossed his head of course we dounless you hadnt planned on going back as sostratos cheeks heated his cousin let him down easy tm not sorry to get to leeward of euboia myself i will say that nor i sostratos said the long narrow island lay like a shield to the northeast of attica khalkis tomorrow i expect so menedemos answered and began to quote from the iliads catalogue of ships the abantes breathing fury held euboia khalkis and eiretria and hisitaia rich in grapes coastal kerinthos and the steep city of dion they also held karystos and dwelt in styra their leader was elephenor descendant of ares the son of khalkedon lord of the greathearted abantes him the swift abantes followed with their hair long in back spearmen with ash spears ready to rend the corselets on the chests of their foes forty black ships followed him old cities sostratos murmured but he looked west toward attica toward the land to which he wished the aphroditewere going he pointed theres a place thats not so old but it bears a name that will live as long as troy marathon his cousin cared little for history but even he knew what that meant where the athenians gave the persians the first lesson on what it means to tangle with free hellenes he said sostratos dipped his head thats right and so it was though things werent quite so simple up till the battle at marathon the persians had won their fights against the hellenes with a monotonous regularity no one cared to remember these days sostratos asked do you know the story of pheidippides oh yes his cousin said hes the fellow who ran from marathon to athens with news of the fight gasped out rejoice we conquerand fell over dead thats right sostratos said when i was in athens i went out to marathon once to see with my own eyes what the battlefield looks like it was most of a day on the back of a mulea long days march for a hoplite i dont wonder that pheidippides dropped dead if he ran it all at once what on earth made you want to go all that way menedemos asked i told youto see it for myself sostratos answered its just a place menedemos said the battle happened a long time ago they eyed each other in perfect mutual incomprehension with an amused shrug menedemos went on well to each his own i think ill put in at rhamnous up past marathon on the attic side of the strait here thats a better anchorage than i could get on the euboian side youre trying to drive me mad arent you my deareither that or to tempt me to jump ship sostratos said menedemos laughed and sostratos was joking he wouldnt snatch up the gryphons skull tuck it under his arm and run like pheidippides down to the lykeion no iwont he thought however much i want to not quitechanging the subject he went on a little inland from the seaside village at rhamnous theres a temple to nemesis with the goddess statue carved from a block of parian marble the persians had brought along for the victory monument they would set up in athens some say pheidias carved it others his pupil agorakritos youve seen it his cousin asked oh yes on the trip to marathon i stopped there too its very fine work shes wearing a crown ornamented with tiny victories and with deer in one hand she holds a bowl carved with figures of ethiopians in relief in the other an apple branch ethiopians menedemos said why to the crows with me if i know sostratos replied a priest said it was because okeanos is nemesis father and the ethiopians live alongside okeanos but that seems like a stretch to me its just as likely pheidias felt like carving ethiopians and so he did rhamnous was a sleepy fishing village the arrival of a merchant galley that looked a lot like a pirate ship created a small sensation to explain the aphrodites presence in those waters menedemos displayed some of the most transparent silk hed got from pixodaros and said were bringing it up to khalkis for polemaios favorite hetaira if i told you how much hes paying youd never believe me let him waste his money somebody said to which there was a general mutter of agreement sostratos hadnt expected anything else polemaios had broken with kassandros whose puppet ruled athens and attica demetrios of phaleron was a popular leader too if he and polemaios didnt get along the people of attica wouldnt have much use for antigonos nephew a good story sostratos murmured to menedemos no one will go hotfooting it back to athens to let demetrios know were on our way up to khalkis to see polemaios no not for some silk his cousin agreed stowing the filmy fabric once more i wonder how fancy the hetairai in khalkis are of course you do sostratos said menedemos clapped both hands over his chest and staggered as if sostratos had hit him with an arrow as hed hit the pirate in the hemiolia sostratos laughed he couldnt help himself youre impossible thank you menedemos said which set them both laughing all over again menedemos got the aphroditeout of rhamnous not long after sunrise the akatos neared khalkis not long after noon a wooden bridge spanned the euripos the narrow channel separating euboia from the mainland of hellas the fortress of kanethos on the mainland protected the bridge and was reckoned part of the city of khalkis putting in at khalkis proved a good deal harder than getting to it had been a strong current flowed south through the euripos the rowers had to pull hard to hold the merchant galley in place let alone make headway against the rushing water you couldnt even get near this place from the south in an ordinary round ship menedemos said be patient best one sostratos told him sure enough after something less than an hour the current abruptly reversed itself and began flowing north it almost carried the aphroditepast khalkis only some smart rowing let her ease her way alongside a pier by the dog of egypt id heard of that but i wasnt sure i believed it menedemos said he raised his voice to call out to the sailors make sure shes securely moored we dont want her swept away now you see its true sostratos said as the men checked the lines and the knots the current in the euripos changes direction six or seven times a day sometimes moresometimes even twice that why would it do such a mad thing his cousin asked i havent the faintest idea and i dont think anyone else has either sostratos replied one of your philosopher friends ought to look into it menedemos said either its something natural in which case hell figure it out or its a god putting his finger in there in which case a philosopher wont do anybody much good a cause could be natural without being easy to understand sostratos said his cousin didnt rise to the argument instead menedemos said get that letter from ptolemaios and come on weve got to find polemaios the winding streets of khalkis were full of soldiers who followed antigonos rebellious nephew they all had swords or spears quite a few of them had taken on too much wine ordinary khalkidians mostly stayed indoors seeing how quarrelsome the soldiers were sostratos couldnt blame the locals one of the soldiers though directed him and menedemos to a house not far from the market square as at ptolemaios residence back on kos sentries stood guard in front of this one one of theman immense man three or four digits taller even than sostratosrumbled yes hes here why should he want to see you people though i have a letter for him sostratos showed it to the sentry hell have some kind of answer to give us i expect give me the letter the big guard said ill take it to him you wait here he held out his hand that was plainly the best offer sostratos would get he handed the fellow the letter the big man went into the house the remaining guard set a hand on his swordhilt as if expecting sostratos and menedemos to try to leap on him and beat him into submission polemaios sostratos reflected had burned two bridges in rapid succession maybe it was no wonder that his men seemed jumpy antigonos and kassandros both wanted their commander dead how could they be sure a couple of rhodians werent a couple of hired murderers that was simple they couldnt and polemaios himself had to feel more hunted than any of his soldiers that thought had hardly crossed his mind before the door opened again out came the bodyguard followed by a man bigger still by a digit or two hail the newcomer said im polemaios youre the rhodians eh thats right sostratos said hed heard that antigonos and his sons demetrios and philippos were big men it evidently ran in the family demetrios was supposed to be very handsome polemaios wasnt he had a broken nose and what looked to be a permanent worried expression he was sostratos judged getting close to forty youd better come in he said now i think weve got some things to talk about like ptolemaios he spoke an attic greek with a faint undercurrent of his half barbarous northern homeland hed been drinking wine in the andron at his gesture a slave poured cups for sostratos and menedemos then left the room in a hurry polomaios picked up his cup and took a long pull after pouring a small libation sostratos drank too the wine was sweet and thick and strong and quite unmixed with water after a small sip he set down the cup he also shot menedemos a warning glancepolemaios seemed to live up to or down to stories about macedonian drinking habits he didnt seem drunk though as he leaned toward the two rhodians and said so ptolemaios will take me in will he thats right sir sostratos said something glinted in polemaios eyes maybe it was the wine maybe it was even fiercer he wants to use me he said in tones that brooked no contradiction my uncle thought hed use me kassandros thought hed use me too sostratos judged he was bound to be right about ptolemaios even if the word he chose for use was the one that described what a man did with a boy menedemos spoke quickly ptolemaios spoke to us of an alliance between the two of you he sounded more solicitous than usual sostratos didnt need long to figure out whyif polemaios decided not to go back to kos on the aphrodite that threw forty minai of silver into the sea only goes to show he knows how to tell lies too antigonos nephew said with a bitter laugh but ill tell you something rhodians his intent solemn stare showed the effects of the neat wine so did his being rash enough to jab his thumb at his chest and speak his mind to strangers im all done with being used im no widearsed slave boy not me from now on i do the using ptolemaios wants this fellow around sostratos thought doing his best to hold his face steady me id sooner pet a shark his cousin still had his eye on the ruler of egypts fee o best one will you sail with us he asked oh yes polemaios replied oh yes indeed im squeezed here i wont be squeezed over there hed paused there quite noticeably what was he going to say till he changed it sostratos wondered i wont be squeezed once i hold egypt something like that or i miss my guess and ptolemaios asked him to come to kos the man must be raving mad menedemos mind was elsewhere on the practical details of getting polemaios out of khalkis and across the aegean come to our akatos a little before dawn he told antigonos nephew well have you out past attica before demetrios of phaleron is any the wiser and you can make whatever arrangements suit you best to have your men follow you to kos good enough polemaios rumbled youre a little chap but you get things done even with his passage worth a talent of silver polemaios was asking for trouble by calling menedemos a little chap before menedemos could lose his temperor at least before he could show hed lost itsostratos said well have you out past attica provided the euripos cooperates that is if the current is flowing north well just have to wait till it turns around a pestilence his cousin snapped his fingers in annoyance id forgotten that he eyed polemaios i dont suppose youd like to go north around euboia antigonos nephew tossed his head not likely id be heading straight up toward kassandros if i did and i want to get away from him id sooner wait till the euripos turns around all right menedemos said mildlyso mildly sostratos shot him a sharp look had he been thinking something like if polemaios is worth a talent to ptolemaios how much is he worth to kassandros no way to prove it something else occurred to sostratos he spoke with as much diplomacy as he had in him you do know sir well be sailing through the kyklades on our way back to kos and through my godsdetested uncles polluted island league polemaios might have been harsh and crude but he wasnt stupid he went on dont you worry about that i wont travel under my right name he looked from sostratos to menedemos and back again and i will bring some bodyguards with me of course best one the two rhodians spoke together if they hadnt promptly agreed to that sostratos doubted they would have got back to the aphroditealive as things were polemaios said ill see you in the morning early and called for the slave at his brusque gesture the fellow led sostratos and menedemos out of the house and all but slammed the door in their faces outside the big bodyguard barked you find out what you needed to know sostratos dipped his head the guard said why dont you get lost then he set a hand on his swordhilt to let them know it wasnt a suggestion they left in a hurry what a charming fellow menedemos said once they were around a corner and out of earshot who sostratos asked the man himself or his comrade in a polis full of polemaios soldiers he didnt name antigonos nephew i had the man himself in mind menedemos answered but his comrades just as delightful isnt he every bit sostratos walked on for a few paces then turned to his cousin i wonder just how many friends the man himself will bring to the symposion he didnt mention bodyguards or the merchant galley either but menedemos had no trouble following him what an interesting question he said brightly not so many that they get in the way of the slaves i hope so do i sostratos said this gets more and more complicated doesnt it his cousin flashed him a smile well my dear have you ever heard of anything that didnt menedemos had a knack for waking up whenever he told himself to do so as if somewhere in the back of his mind there were a klepsydra like the one used to time speeches in the athenian law courts it was still dark when his eyes came open the next morning a glance at the stars and the moon told him dawn wasnt far away though he peered into khalkis no sign of polemaios yet sostratos lay on his back on the poop deck snoring like a stonecutters saw working its way through a block of marble menedemos shook him the snores rose in pitch but didnt stop menedemos gave another shake his cousins eyes opened what in the name of the sostratos spluttered good day menedemos said cheerfully were waiting for a friend remember oh thats right sostratos yawned till the hinges of his jaw creaked no sign of him yet you dont see him do you menedemos said he paused to gauge the feel of the water under the aphrodite i wish hed get here too because the euripos is going our way right now if it switches back to the north well be stuck here for hours thats true sostratos said around another yawn this one not quite so enormous he got to his feet and as menedemos had done a moment before stared into khalkis the town was dark and quiet an owl hooted a baby wailed a dog barkedthree individual widely spaced sounds against the background of silence where is he i hope he hasnt changed his mind hed better not menedemos exclaimed in horror the elemental entirely understandable horror of losing forty minai of silver cheer up sostratos said if he does we can just drop down to athens and go on about our business you dont care about business all you care about is that miserable old skull we got in kaunos im beginning to wish id never set eyes on the stinking thing it wont make up for what polemaios will cost us if he doesnt comeand nothing else will either instead of answering sostratos pointed into the sleeping polls what was that what was what menedemos had been eyeing the gray starting to seep up into the eastern sky light moving lookthere it is again youre right excitement filled menedemos voice thats torchlight on walls sure as surewe just cant see the torches themselves yet and then a moment later as the men carrying them rounded a corner he could a dozen at least they flickered like bright stars on a cold night and they were without a doubt heading for the aphrodite from one of the rowers benches diokles spoke up looks like were in business skipper and the currents flowing our way too menedemos smiled i might have known youd be awake too he told the keleustes lets get the men up and get ready to go they were waking sailors when feet thudded on the planks of the quay ahoy the aphrodite polemaios called he towered over all the men with him except that one big bodyguard he had ten soldiers in full hoplites gear plus a couple of torchbearers who were probably servants and menedemos saw with surprise one woman veiled against the prying eyes of men after a moment the surprise evaporated he is of an age to have a wife menedemos said to himself aloud he answered hail best one youre in good time and the euripos is with us then lets be off polemaios said he spoke to his men in a low voice they threw their torches into the sea the torches hissed as they were quenched polemaios followers came down the gangplank and into the aphrodite antigonos nephew followed them as he stepped down onto the poop deck he murmured better glory than length of days akhilleus might have said the same thing camped by the beached ship on the windy plain of troy and alexander might have said the same thing too menedemos realized polemaios is old enough to have gone east with him if just barely even fourteen years dead alexander still cast an enormous shadow across the hellenic world cast off menedemos called a couple of his sailors scrambled up onto the pier undid the lines securing the merchant galley and came back down again they stowed the gangplank as they did so menedemos glanced up the length of the ship polemaios had done a good job of herding his menand the one womanwell forward i as much out of the rowers way as possible menedemos caught diokles eye and dipped his head back oars the oarmaster bellowed beating out the stroke with mallet and bronze back hard you lazy bastards its like getting away from a pier on a river it put menedemos in mind of escaping the quay at pompaia on the sarnos the summer before this was even more nervewracking though for the euripos flowed harder than the river hadand because the channel between euboia and the mainland had a couple of rocky islets right in the middle of it menedemos kept looking back over his shoulder as he handled the steering oars ready boys diokles called the rowers heads came up to them the world held nothing but their oars and the keleustes voice are you ready diokles repeated then normal stroke the men went from backing oars to pulling the aphroditeforward as smoothly as if theyd been doing it for years and indeed almost all of them had been doing it for years aboard one ship or another menedemos pulled in on one steering oar and pushed out on the other bringing the akatos bow around so she aligned with the way the water was racing very neat sostratos said a little lucky to have the euripos flowing in the direction we needed but very neat the winds with us too menedemos said in a little while ill have the men lower the sail from the yard what with oars and wind and current well be practically flying along we still wont get clear of euboia by nightfall sostratos said well no menedemos admitted but we might make it all the way down to karystos at the south end of the island no one could hope to get from there to khalkis and back by the time were away the next morningor from there to athens and back either karystos his cousin said musingly theres a marble quarry nearby i know that and theres something else about the place too something he snapped his fingers in annoyance unable to come up with it theyve got that strange stone there the stuff that wont burn menedemos said they weave from it and when the towels get dirty they just toss em in the fire asbestos thats right sostratos said thank you i was going to be worrying at that all day like a dog with a bone now i dont have to that stuff sells well and its not very bulky we might do some business we might menedemos said dubiously nothing to make us late back to kos though especially not in country kassandros holds sostratos looked forward to where polemaios was pointing something on the euboian coast out to one of his henchmen in a low voice menedemos cousin said if ptolemaios decides he wants anything to do with that fellow once he gets a good look at him im a trouserwearing persian menedemos knew he wouldnt have wanted anything to do with polemaios nevertheless he said my dear thats not your worry or mine either our job is to get him there and get paid for it and thats what i intend to do menedemos kept a wary eye on the coast himself as the aphroditemade her way south especially when the merchant galley neared one of the many headlands or little offshore islands lots of those little islands speckled the channel between euboia and the mainland sheep or cattle grazed on some of them others seemed just as the gods had made them a piratical pentekonter or hemiolia might have used any one of them for concealment before rushing out against a merchantman youre getting as nervous as that athenian sostratos was talking about menedemos thought he wouldnt have fretted so much without such a valuable passenger aboard polemaios bodyguards made the aphroditebetter able to fight off marauders than she would have been otherwise but menedemos didnt want to have to put that to the test as he had when kissidas brought his kinsfolk aboard at kaunos he kept trying to get as many glimpses as he could of polemaios wife he had little luck there she stayed up on the foredeck and the crowd of armored bodyguards did a good job of shielding her from his gaze even if he had got a clear look it wouldnt have told him much not when like any respectable woman who had to leave her house she kept on the veil that shielded her from the gaze of lustful men he knew as much but kept peering her way anyhow presently polemaios came aft and ascended to the poop deck antigonos nephew towered over menedemos he was one of the biggest men the rhodian had ever seen he wasnt lean and gawky like sostratos either but massively built broad in the shoulders and thick through the chest he made a host in himself he was so massively made in fact that menedemos lifted a hand from a steeringoar tiller made a brushing motion with it and said excuse me best one but please step to one side or the other i do need to be able to see straight ahead oh right polemaios didnt apologize menedemos would have been surprised if hed ever apologized to anyone but he did move and had the sense to move to starboard rather than to port if trouble suddenly boiled up it was much more likely to come from euboia on menedemos left hand than from the attic mainland to his right after a couple of minutes of silence antigonos nephew asked how big a fleet did ptolemaios bring to kos close to sixty ships menedemos answered for the first time in their brief acquaintance polemaios smiled even smiling he remained formidable plenty to give my dear uncle a kick in the balls he said not half what he deserves either you say that now menedemos thought a couple of years ago you were your dear uncles righthand man i think hes not your dear uncle anymore because hes got new righthand men in his two sons he said none of that polemaios was not the sort of man who invited such opinions do you know who any of ptolemaios shipcaptains are antigonos nephew asked menedemos tossed his head sorry sir im just a trader youre not just a trader or ptolemaios wouldnt have sent you after me polemaios gaze was as hard and bright and predatory as an eagles did you meet any of his commanders of marines only one and then only in a manner of speaking menedemos answered he was the fellow whose five stopped us on the way into the harbor at kos he asked the sort of questions youd expect an officer to ask strangers ah polemaios leaned forward with a nowweregettingsomewhere expression on his face what was his name did you bribe him to let you go on how much silver did it take to get him to look the other way i never found out what his name was menedemos said in some exasperation and he never came aboard so i couldnt very well bribe him antigonos nephew looked as if he believed not a word of that how did you get him to let you pass then ptolemaios officers are paid to be suspicious just like any others they wouldnt be much use to him if they werent how o marvelous one menedemos patience began to slip he didnt like being grilled like this aboard his own ship especially when he saw no point to polemaios questions i showed him a tiger hide thats how after that he let me alone and didnt bother me anymore polemaios didnt take the hint he did shift the aim of his questions where did you get a tiger hide have you ever been to india you couldnt have gone with alexanderyoure not old enough men whod gone conquering with the great king of macedonia were going to throw that in the younger generations face as long as they lived menedemos had already heard it more often than he would have liked he answered no i havent been to india this hide came west i bought it in the market square at kaunos oh polemaios didnt bother hiding his disappointment he turned away and went forward again with a silent sigh of relief menedemos gave all his attention back to guiding the aphroditedown the channel between euboia and the mainland fishing boats fled back to eiretria the other prominent polls on the island when they spotted the akatos and the armed and armored men aboard her to menedemos relief no war galleys came striding over the sea to investigate they must figure were just another pirate and not worth bothering about the thought saddened and angered him at the same time dystos south of eiretria lay inland on the shore of a small marshy lake its walls shaped like some sort of polygonsostratos would know its name hes the one who cares for such things menedemos thoughthad ten or twelve towers to help hold foes at bay they might not have done their job any too well though the walls hadnt been breached dystos seemed halfmore than half abandoned presently sostratos came back to the poop deck menedemos greeted him with a smile by the dog of egypt im glad of your company he said are you his cousin raised an eyebrow he set a hand on menedemos forehead as if checking to see if he had a fever do you feel well laughing menedemos said better anyhow he lowered his voice you and polemaios both ask lots of questions but youre friendly about it and hes fierce what sort of questions was he giving you sostratos said also softly i did mean to ask you about that as a matter of fact menedemos explained when he finished sostratos let out an unmusical whistle isnt that interesting do you know what hes doing being nosy to not much purpose menedemos answered being nosy yes but i think he has a purpose sostratos glanced forward to make sure antigonos nephew wasnt paying undue attention it sounds as though hes trying to find out whether ptolemaios has any officers who can be corrupted menedemos whistle was even more discordant than sostratos i think youve fit that together like a mortise joining a couple of ships timbers thats just what he was doing furies take me if its not he whistled again hes a piece of work that one many are the marvels sostratos began and none is more marvelous than man menedemos finished the quotation from sophokles for him he clipped his head in agreement too all the same though ive never seen anyone more eager to bite the hand that feeds him you were clever to figure him out so fast he sent sostratos a curious glance his cousin wasnt usually so sharp a judge of people hes like someone from thoukydides come to life sostratos said now a man whos practically nothing but plots and ambitions an ordinary chap is much harder to make out at least for me thats because youre not an ordinary chap yourself menedemos thought more often than not he would have twitted sostratos about it now when sostratos had solved a puzzle that baffled him he kept quiet his cousin had earned a respite for a little while as the aphrodite made her way south and east through the kyklades toward kos polemaios took to calling himself alkimos of epeiros hes a mercenary captain in my uncles pay he explained to sostratos and menedemos and a big big man himself he let more of his macedonian accent come out to an ordinary hellene it might well do for the speech of a man from another equally barbarous place he is shrewd sostratos thought reluctantly odds were that ran in the family like height antigonos was outstandingly clever and his sons demetrios and philippos also seemed able and polemaios had been one of antigonos leading officers till he chose to turn against his uncle no one had ever said old oneeye suffered fools gladly whether a fool or not though polemaios alarmed sostratos ambition blazed from the man as light blazed from a bonfire would he be able to conceal it when he got to kos if he couldnt how long would ptolemaios take to notice it the ruler of egypt struck sostratos as a very canny fellow of course polemaios soldiers would be following him to kos how many men did he have sostratos didnt know how many did ptolemaios have on the island sostratos didnt know that either though he could make a guess from the size of ptolemaios fleet would all of them stay loyal or could polemaios seduce them away from his nearnamesake an interesting question sure enough to keep from drawing undue attention to the return menedemos chose a route different from the one hed used going up to khalkis no one would be able to note how many days lay between his westbound and eastbound visits to a port and as a result make guesses about where hed been from karystos on the southern coast of euboia he took the aphroditedue south across the rough strait and aided by a brisk northerly breeze made the island of kythnos by nightfall fig orchards and vines straggled across the sandy hills of kythnos looking north and west sostratos could see cape sounion the great rocky headland that marked attica he sighed i should be showing he gryphons skull to theophrastos he thought but instead im sailing away again where is the justice polemaios and his wife and bodyguards slept aboard the merchant galley antigonos nephew took it in stride hed doubtless found worse places to lay his head on campaign but from sostratos place on the poop deck he could hear the womans shrill complaints at the other end of the ship polemaios sounded much less imperious with her than he did speaking to mere rhodians with a soft chucklevery soft to make sure polemaios didnt hearsostratos murmured to menedemos every hero has his weakness his cousins snort of laughter seemed much too loud to him agamemnon lord of men had his vanity akhilleus his angerand his heel menedemos agreed great aias went mad he reached out and tapped sostratos on the shoulder but what of resourceful odysseus he was always right or as near as makes no difference and he came home safe where most of the others died and he paid the price for always being right too sostratos said after a little thought of his own hes a hero in the iliad and the odyssey but the playwrights make him out to be a villain too clever for his own good nobody likes a man whos right all the time you would know wouldnt you menedemos said sostratos grunted that arrow hit too close to the center of the target for comfort he had learned most people didnt take kindly to being corrected even when they were wrongoften especially when they were wrong he didnt do such things nearly so often as he had when he was younger and if i hadnt done them so often then i might be happier now he shifted on the planks of the poop deck trying not only to get comfortable but also to escape his own thoughts like the furies they pursued him whether he wanted them to or not but he could escape them unlike the kindly ones by falling headlong into sleep and he did when he woke it was to the sound of menedemos cursing as if those kindly ones were hot on his trail yawning sostratos asked whats wrong call yourself a seaman menedemos snarled which was most unfair sostratos was suddenly roused from sleep and still flat on the deck besides upright and irate menedemos went on theres no polluted wind thats what none oh sostratos uncocooned himself from his himation and got to his feet too he wasnt naked as he would have been most mornings aboard ship out of deference to polemaios wife hed left his chiton on menedemos was right not a breath of breeze stirred his hair oimoi this isnt good well have a hard time making paros by sundown on oars alone isnt that the sad and sorry truth his cousin agreed and even if we do the men will be worn to nubs and in a dreadful temper to the crows with me if i blame em either rowing all day is a hard way to make a drakhma and a half i know sostratos set a consoling hand on menedemos shoulder well my dear we got this job because we can go against the wind or even without it we could give the rowers a couple of days to roister in kos once we get there not a bad notion menedemos dipped his head then smiled a wicked smile there you go being right again im sorry ill try not to let it happen again sostratos said and thought he came out of the exchange fairly well menedemos had the pleasure of waking diokles who wasnt up quite so fast as usual the oarmaster noted the calm as fast as the captain had the menll have their work cut out for em today if things dont pick up he said and set about shaking sailors out of sleep we cant afford to waste time then polemaios and his bodyguards also roused so did polemaios wife who was no more happy about waking up aboard ship than she had been about the sleeping arrangements the aphroditeoffered barley rolls and raisins and olives for breakfast didnt seem to be to her taste either and she had some sharp things to say about the wine the akatos carried itll be hot work sostratos said the sun was just climbing over the horizon but with the air so still he could feel the furnace of noontime in his mind hours before it turned real have we got enough water and wine to get us to paros were carrying all those extra passengers for one day well be all right menedemos answered sostratos dipped his head that was likely true his cousin went on besides if i water the ship here we lose that much traveling time and we havent got much to spare today diokles put eight men at the oars on each side of the aphrodite at his orders the oarblades bit into the sea the galley glided out of kythnos harbor past the southern tip of the island and then south and east toward paros navigating in the kyklades was easy enough a sailor rarely found himself out of sight of land there was seriphos due south of kythnos and there due east lay syros a tiny islet between them gave a good course for paros and in the distance sostratos could see clouds hovering about mount marpessos paros central peak before long the mountain itself came into view the sea seemed smooth as a polished piece of parian marble the oars rose and fell rose and fell diokles gave the rowers shifts of about two hours keeping them as fresh as he could polemaios wife amused herself by complaining his bodyguards prowled the ship like so many feral dogs on the prowl for something they could eat they were going to steal this and that sostratos knew as much he couldnt keep his eye on all of them all the time they couldnt steal too much if only because they had nothing but their alreadyfull sacks of personal goods in which to conceal their loot not all of them seemed to realize that onethe big fellow whod been standing outside polemaios front doorbent down under an unoccupied rowers bench and came up holding the big leather sack that contained the gryphons skull sostratos jerked as if stuck by a pin put that down he yelped whos going to make me the guard demanded his free hand went to the hilt of his sword he hadnt doffed his armor aboard ship under the brim of his bronze helmet his face twisted into a nasty grin sostratos wore only a wool tunic and had nothing but a knife on his belt he bit his lip in humiliation from the stern menedemos called well best one if you want what youve got so much why dont you see what it is i will the macedonian undid the lashing that held the sack closed the gryphons skull stared out at him from empty eye sockets now he was the one who yelped in surprise and superstitious fear dont you dare drop that sostratos warned this time he managed to put a snap rather than a whine in his voice put it back where you got it perhaps too startled not to the bodyguard obeyed he didnt close the sack but that could wait once the gryphons skull was stowed under the bench once more the fellow managed a question of his own what do you want with that horrible ugly thing sostratos smiled his most sinister smile before we got the commission to bring your master back to kos i was going to take it up to thessalia to sell it to one of the witches there northeastern hellas was notorious for its witches sostratos didnt believe in witchcraftnot with the top part of his mind anyhowbut to protect the precious gryphons skull he grabbed any weapon that came to hand and this one worked the big fierce macedonian went pale as milk his ringers writhed in an apotropaic gesture he said something in macedonian that sostratos couldnt understand once he got it out of his system he switched to a dialect of greek that made more sense i hope the witches turn you into a spider you widearsed son of a whore grinning sostratos said i love you too my dear behind the grin was a fright he wouldnt show if the bodyguard got angry enough or frightened enough he would draw that sword and sostratos couldnt do much to fight back but the big man only shuddered and made another warding gesture before turning and stomping back up toward the foredeck a couple of minutes later polemaios strode toward the stern thessalian witchcraft he said how superstitious was he sostratos couldnt tell by the tone of the question he just said thats right and waited to see what happened next polemaios grunted ascended to the poop deck and pissed into the sea then he too returned to his station on the foredeck he and his bodyguard got into a shouting match to sostratos frustration it was in macedonian the bodyguard wasnt shy about saying whatever was on his mind waving his hands in polemaios face and bunching them into fists polemaios showed no more restraint a charming people the macedonians sostratos remarked in a low voice as he went up to stand near his cousin arent they though menedemos rolled his eyes and they rule almost the entire civilized world sostratos said mournfully he drew himself up with more than a little pride but not rhodes gods be praised menedemos exclaimed and sostratos dipped his head oöp dlokles called and the aphrodites weary rowers rested at their oars behind them the setting sun streaked the aegean with blood and fire a couple of harbor men took the lines sailors tossed them and made the akatos fast to a quay in the polis of paros up at the top of mount marpessos the sunlight remained a good deal brighter than it was down here on the sea menedemos clapped his hands together euge he called to the merchant galleys crew very well done its a long haul from kythnos to here dont we know it somebodyteleutassaid menedemos would have bet hed be the one to speak up and carp but hed done as much as anybody else at the oars and so hed earned the right amorgos tomorrow menedemos said then kos and a layover you boys will have earned it til say we will again teleutas took it on himself to speak for the rest of the sailors and to make agreement sound halfway like a threat we wont make kos in one day from amorgos not unless we get a gale out of the west diokles remarked not likely although the oarmaster tasted the air wetly smacking his lips a couple of times well have wind i think tomorrow wont be a deadcalm day like this one i think youre right menedemos said the faintest ghost of a breeze brushed against his cheek softer than a hetairas hand he looked north a few clouds drifted across the sky they didnt hang in place as they had all through this long hot day be good to let the sail down thatll be fine sure enough diokles agreed still and all though even amorgosh be a push because we will have to spend some time filling our water jars before we sail tomorrow cant let ourselves go dry i know i know menedemos consoled himself as best he could paros has good water not the brackish stuff wed have got on kythnos he stayed aboard the aphroditeagain that night he didnt want to he wanted to go into one of the harborside taverns drink himself dizzy and sleep with a serving girl or find a brothel he hadnt had a girl since putting in at kos for a man in his midtwenties going without for several days felt like a hardship but somebody would ask say whos that big son of a whore with those soldiers answering alkimos of epeiros might serve on the other hand it might not and he might talk too much if he got drunk he knew himself well enough to understand that and so he wrapped himself in his himation on the poop deck stared up at the stars for a little while and fell asleep when he woke up only the faintest hint of gray touched the jagged eastern horizon he felt like cheering for a brisk northerly breeze ruffled his hair with sail and oars together they had a much better chance of making amorgos by nightfall then he took a deep breath and frowned a little the air felt damp as if it was the harbinger of rain he shrugged it was late in the season for a downpour but not impossibly so as soon as it got light enough for colors to start returning to the black and silver world of night he started shaking sailors and sending them into paros with the aphrodites water jars how will we find a fountain teleutas whined ask somebody menedemos said unsympathetically here he gave the grumbling sailor an obolos now you can give something for an answer and its not even coming out of your own pay teleutas no doubt liked lugging a hydria no more than anybody else but menedemos had quashed his objections before he could make them he popped the obolos into his mouth and went off with his comrades menedemos imagined the surprise at a fountain when the sailors descended on women filling their water jars for the days cooking and washing then he tossed his head as at naxos a lot of ships put in at paros the local women would be used to such visits sostratos pointed north i wonder if well get some rain he said some of those clouds look thicker and grayer than the usual run i was thinking the same thing menedemos answered it would be a nuisance trying to figure out a course when we cant see more than a couple of stadia isnt easy itd slow us down too if the sail got soaked the men might not mind not after rowing all day in the hot sun his cousin said cool weathers more comfortable at first maybe menedemos said but its easy to take a chill when you come off your stint at the oars and to cramp up too rains no fun when you havent any way to keep it off your head they left paros almost as early as hed hoped they would as soon as they were out of the harbor he ordered the sail lowered from the yard the freshening breeze thrummed in the rigging the mast creaked in its socket as that breeze filled the sail and pulled on it the merchant galley ran before the wind till she slid through the channel between paros and oliaros the smaller island to the southwest ive heard theres a cave full of spikes of rock sticking up from the floor and down from the ceiling on oliaros sostratos said thats the sort of thing id like to see why menedemos asked at his orders the sailors swung the yard so that it stretched back from the port bow to take best advantage of the wind why sostratos echoed it might be pretty it would certainly be interesting and they say some men alexander the great was after hid out there for a while do they menedemos lifted his right hand off the steeringoar tiller to wag a forefinger at his cousin youre always going on about how they say all sorts of things and most of the time what they say turns out to be nothing but a pack of nonsense so why do you believe them now theres supposed to be some writing inside the cave sostratos answered but i guess youre rightthat doesnt have to mean anything people could have written it in the years since alexander died why would they menedemos asked to draw visitors to these caves if you ask me anybody who wanted to go crawling through them would have to be daft he gave sostratos a meaningful look having been on the receiving end of a lot of those looks sostratos ignored this one maybe he said though youd need more than scratchings on a stalactite to get anyone to come to oliaros youd need divinities born there the way delos has apollo and artemis menedemos who was much more conventionally religious than his cousin bit down on that like a man unexpectedly biting down on an olive pit by the way sostratos said it the god and goddess might not actually have been born on delos but the delians might have claimed they were for no better reason than to draw people to the island and separate them from their silver menedemos didnt ask if he did mean that for fear he would say yes he did ask what other reason would somebody have for writing something that wasnt true perhaps just for the sake of fame sostratos replied you know like that madman who burned down the temple back before the peloponnesian war he did it just so hed be remembered forever herodotos found out what his name wasand then didnt put it in his history euge menedemos exclaimed the more he thought about it the more elegant he reckoned that revenge several small islands lay south of naxos on the way to amorgos they were like telos over by rhodes they had villages not poleis and a few people scratched out a living in their hinterland they drew steadily nearer as the aphroditeglided east so did the clouds the rising breeze brought down from the north those clouds covered the sun the day went from bright to gloomy before long rain started pattering down light at first but then increasing a little rain made a sail perform better holding more of the wind than the weave of the linen could by itself more than a little and the sail got heavy and saggy menedemos could only try to wring as much advantage from what was going on as he could hed known visibility would shrink in case of rain the islands ahead disappeared in the veils of masking water falling from the sky so did kos to the south of them and so did naxos itself menedemos sent sharpeyed aristeidas up onto the foredeck to look out for unexpected trouble in a while ill send a leadsman up there with him to take soundings too he thought he hadnt got round to giving the order for that before he found himself in unexpected trouble of his own polemaios made his ponderous way back to the poop deck and stomped up to menedemos how dare you place a man up there to spy on my wife he demanded what for a moment menedemos had no idea what the macedonian was talking about then he did and wished he hadnt best one i sent aristeidas up there to look for rocks and islands not for women visibilitys gone to the crows what with this rain i want to see something before i run into it thank you very much you should have spoken of this to me polemaios said looking down his long bent nose at menedemos one of my guards could do the job perfectly well menedemos tossed his head no for one thing aristeidas has some of the sharpest eyes ive ever found in anyone for another hes a sailor he knows what hes supposed to see on the water and what hes not your bodyguards are hoplites theyd do fine on land but not here this isnt their place a slow flush rose from polemaios neck all the way to his hairline menedemos wondered how long it had been since anyone told him no antigonos nephew set a hand on the hilt of his sword little man youll do as i say he growled either that or youll feed the fish before menedemos could lose his temper sostratos spoke in calm reasonable tones consider best one by rejecting the best lookout in dirty weather you endanger the ship your wife and yourself is that a choice a man who loves wisdom would make polemaios turned red all over again he said im going to tell that sharpeyed son of a whore to keep his eyes on the sea and not on other mens wives and stormed back toward the foredeck thank you menedemos said quietly youre welcome his cousin replied if polemaios endangers the ship he endangers me too you know his shoulders shook menedemos realized he was fighting not to laugh out loud and if hes going to tell somebody not to look at another mans wife he could do worse than to start with you menedemos glowered at him in mockwell mostly mockrage furies take you i knew you were going to say that will you tell me im wrong ill do worse than that ill tell you youre boring menedemos said but sostratos hadnt been wrong and he knew it he couldnt help looking at polemaios wife not when he faced forward from the steering oars all day and she hadnt thought to bring along a pot she had to hang her bare backside over the rail when she needed to relieve herself the same as any sailor menedemos hadnt stared that would have been rude and might well have brought polemaios wrath down on his head polemaios was the worst sort of jealous husband the large violent dangerous sort menedemos had no trouble seeing as much but he hadnt looked away you never could tell sostratos did know him pretty well for he said do you recognize the notion of more trouble than its worth occasionally menedemos said when i feel like it he grinned sostratos spluttered that made his grin wider they scudded on under sail and oars together the wind whipped up the surface of the sea the aphroditerolled as wave after wave slapped the planks of her port side menedemos adjusted to the motion as automatically as he breathed and with as little notice on his part so did most of the merchant galleys crew sostratos looked a trifle pale under his seamans tan but even he shifted his weight as the ship shifted beneath him polemaios wife hung over the rail again giving back whatever shed eaten menedemos noticed that too but it didnt stir him not even to much sympathy for shed shown herself a badtempered woman polemaios had the sense to get out of his corselet before leaning out beside her menedemos wouldnt have minded seeing him go straight into the sea except that that would have meant forty minai going in with him then aristeidas sang out land land dead ahead menedemos couldnt see it the rain chose that moment to start coming down harder but as hed told polemaios he had aristeidas up on the foredeck precisely because the sailors sight was keen back oars he shouted to the rowers brail up the sail he called to other sailors who hauled on the lines with all their strength bringing the great square sail up to the yard and spilling wind out of it leadsman forward menedemos added kicking himself because hed thought of doing that and then forgotten about it he pulled one steering oar in and pushed the other out swinging the aphrodites bow away from the danger aristeidas had seen as the ship came around he did spy the little islandor maybe it was nothing more than a big rock perhaps a plethrons worth of jaggedness jutting up above the waves it would have been plenty to do in the merchant galley no fresh water on it of course and nowhere to beach twelve cubits the leadsman called out bringing up his line and tossing it into the sea again with a splash he hauled it in again ten cubits and a half regular stroke diokles bawled as soon as the akatos bow pointed away from the islet pull hard you bastards rhyppapai rhyppapai nine and a half cubits the leadsman yelled full crew to theoars menedemos ordered the sailors scrambled to obey more oars jutted from each side of the ship with every stroke till all forty were manned no one fouled anybody else theyd been beaten in well enough to perform in smooth unison even in an emergency a trierarch aboard a rhodian war galley might have found something about which to complain menedemos couldnt eleven cubits the leadsman called and then fourteen cubits were going to get away diokles said as the danger receded yes it looks that way menedemos agreed by the dog of egypt though im glad im in an akatos and not a wallowing round ship i wouldnt want to try to claw away from there without oars no indeed skipper the keleustes scowl mirrored menedemos that wouldnt be any fun at all a round ship might have been able to swing away to southward if somebody spotted that polluted thing soon enough might i say i know menedemos dipped his head but the other side of might was might not as sure as the other side of the image of apollo on a rhodian drakhma was a rose polemaios and the other passengers stayed up near the bow menedemos had hoped antigonos nephew might come back to the stern and apologize for complaining about ansteidas placement the big macedonian did no such thing well to the crows with him then menedemos thought as he brought the merchant galley back toward the west i know what an ass he made of himself whether he does or not two days after almost going aground in the kyklades the aphroditecame back to kos sostratos watched polemaios staring north and east across the narrow channel that separated the island from halikarnassos on the mainland of anatolia had antigonos war galleys in halikarnassos known who was aboard the aphrodite they surely would have swarmed out to try to seize the smaller ship but except for those on patrol in front of the city they stayed quiet as polemaios looked toward his uncles stronghold his great hands folded into fists he growled something in macedonian sostratos couldnt understand it but didnt think it any sort of praise for antigonos or his sons a couple of stadia outside the polis of kos a five flying banners with ptolemaios eagle on them came striding across the sea to challenge the aphrodite what ship shouted an officer on the war galleys deck cupping his hands in front of his mouth to make his voice carry farther were the aphrodite back from khalkis on euboia sostratos yelled in return hoping ptolemaios men had been told to expect the akatos and i polemaios cried in a great voice am polemaios son of polemaios come to join in equal alliance against my polluted accursed godsdetested uncle with ptolemaios son of lagos back on khalkis polemaios had remembered he wouldnt be an equal partner in an alliance here he traveled in a small merchant galley with a double handful of bodyguards along for protection ptolemaios had his whole great fleet and the army that went with it in and around kos the war galley approaching the aphroditecould have smashed her to kindling with its great threefinned ram the archers and catapult aboard the five could have plied the akatos with darts till she looked like a hedgehog the marines from ptolemaios ship could have boarded and slaughtered every man on the merchant galley all that being so sostratos doubted whether in polemaios place he would have dared claim equality with the ruler of egypt but for the time being antigonos renegade nephew got away with it welcome welcome thrice welcome o best and most brilliant of men ptolemaios officer exclaimed as if he were greeting alexander the great or a veritable demigod like herakles the fellow went on we had not looked for you for another few days he waved to sostratos whod spoken up first congratulations on your fine sailing sostratos in turned waved back to menedemos at the steering oars my cousins the captain im just toikharkhos euge ptolemaios man called to menedemos who lifted a hand to acknowledge the praise pass on into the harbor ptolemaios will be very pleased youve brought his ally to kos he said nothing about polemaios being an equal ally sostratos noticed that he wondered whether polemaios did the officer strode across the war galleys deck toward the stern he spoke to another man one who wore a crimsondyed cloak fastened around his neck the captain of the five sostratos judged that worthy called out an order sostratos could hear his voice but couldnt make out the words figuring out what it was didnt take long though the fives oarmaster began beating out the stroke the warships big oars bit into the sea two of its the banks had two men on each oar only the thalamite rowers on the lowest level pulled alone with so much muscle power propelling her the five quickly built up speed and slid away from the aphrodite you boys heard him menedemos called to his own crew lets take her on in to port keleustes give us a lively stroke right you are skipper diokles replied as it had been before kos harbor was packed as tight with ships as an amphora might be with olives masts reared skyward like a leafless forest there sostratos exclaimed pointing as he spotted an opening menedemos steered the akatos towards it sailors on ships already tied up to that quay shouted warnings and stood by with poles and sweeps ready to fend her off but menedemos made her fit without scraping against the vessel to either side thanks for spying the space he told sostratos youre the one who got us into it sostratos replied his cousin grinned oh i can always find a way to get it in sostratos made a face at him menedemos laughed an officer came hurrying up the pier toward the aphrodite the same one sostratos saw whod interrogated them on their previous arrival the officer recognized them too saying youre back and have you got antigonos nephew with you zeus of the aegis polemaios boomed who dyou think i am little man go tell your master im here yes go tell him by the gods menedemos echoed looking sostratos way he spoke in a lower voice tell him he owes us forty minai heres hoping he doesnt need reminding sostratos said thats right heres hoping menedemos sounded worried his next words explained why what can we do if he stiffs us now that weve delivered the goods to ptolemaios himself nothing at all we cant even go to law against him as far as egypts concerned he is the law sostratos had been thinking about that all the way back from khalkis but we can make his name a stench in the nostrils of every rhodian merchant we know and everybody our fathers know i dont think hed like that he needs rhodes friendly menedemos considered then dipped his head blackening a mans name isnt the worst weapon no it isnt sostratos agreed we go round and round about what aristophanes did to sokrates in the cloudsand sokrates didnt even deserve it thats what we go round and round about whether he deserved it or not i mean menedemos held up a hand i dont want to start doing it now thank you very much since sostratos didnt feel like taking up the argument just then either he turned away from his cousin ptolemaios officer still stood on the pier but a fellow in a plain chiton was hurrying back onto solid ground and into the city ptolemaios himself would soon know the aphroditehad returned well get paid sostratos murmured i really think we will and then we can head back towards athens and see what the philosophers there think of the gryphons skull well see what we get for it too he added hastily forestalling menedemos so we will menedemos said and ill be able to do some other business in athens too his eyes flicked toward the officer only the slight pause showed he meant the smuggled emeralds and only someone who already knew he had them would understand what it showed polemaios wife started complaining when she and her man werent immediately taken off the akatos and brought before ptolemaiosor maybe she was complaining because ptolemaios didnt come hotfooting down to the harbor to meet them antigonos nephew did what he could to calm her down thinking i doubt hes had much practice playing peacemaker sostratos hid a smile after half an hour or perhaps a bit more the officers man returned in the company of a couple of dozen armed and armored hoplites sostratos and menedemos exchanged a glance that said ptolemaios isnt going to take any chances with his new ally the forcewhich looked like a guard of honorwas plenty to take care of polemaios bodyguards in case they proved troublesome now sostratos judged they probably wouldnt the messenger said ptolemaios is pleased to welcome another foe of the vicious tyrant antigonos to kos and summons polemaios son of polemaios and his party to his residence as a seeming afterthought the fellow added ptolemaios also summons the two rhodians who brought polemaios here so very promptly oh good sostratos thought he is going to pay us but that wasnt the only reason he was beaming he would have paid a good deal to watch the meeting between the two macedonians with similar names bribery though wouldnt have let him do it ptolemaios generosity did he and menedemos went up the gangplank and onto the quay as polemaios and his companions came back from the bow once everyone had left the ship antigonos nephew took the lead behind the messenger and ptolemaios officer menedemos a proud and touchy man in his own right seemed inclined to dispute polemaios place catching his cousins eye sostratos tossed his head polemaios was the tunny here the captain and toikharkhos of the aphroditewere just a couple of sprats to sostratos relief menedemos didnt push it but hung back with him they all went up to ptolemaios residence the ruler of egypts soldiers surrounding polemaios bodyguards who in turn formed up around their master and his wife after watching all those nodding horsehair plumes and all that gleaming bronze for a while sostratos glanced from his ordinary chiton to menedemos and back again were underdressed he murmured i dont care menedemos answered even more than sostratos he had a seamans indifference to fancy clothes and abhorrence of armor were not baking like a couple of loaves in the oven either with the sun high and hot in the sky sostratos wassweating by the time the procession got to the house ptolemaios was using as his own the soldiers surely were baked by then at the doorway polemaios got into an argument with ptolemaios officer who refused to let any of his bodyguards into the house the officer said if you think you need bodyguards when dealing with ptolemaios o best one you shouldnt have come to kos polemaios fumed but had to yield so much for that equal alliance sostratos thought antigonos nephew shifted his ground will ptolemaios at least have a slave girl waiting to take my wife to the womens quarters by the nature of things shes been out among men and under their eyes more than she should have since i left khalkis certainly sir let me go take care of that by yielding at once on the smaller point ptolemaios officer emphasized how unyielding he was on the larger he disappeared into the house returning a moment later to say a girl will be there waiting for your wife just come along with me he started to turn back then snapped his fingers annoyed at himself and you rhodians you come along too sostratos and menedemos made their way through the soldiers to get to the door ptolemaios men simply stood aside polemaios bodyguards glared they were trained and paid to keep their master safe and here they couldnt do their job even if they had been allowed into the residence ptolemaios men would have preceded them and outnumbered them but they didnt think in those terms they didnt want to be on one side of a wall when antigonos nephew was on the other and resented anyone who could go in while they couldnt when sostratos walked along the entrance hall and into the courtyard he got a glimpse of an unveiled slave woman taking polemaios wife to a stairway that would lead up to the womens chambers polemaios stood in the courtyard looking after her ptolemaios courteously waited in the andron till his new allys wifewas out of sight then he emerged saying hail polemaios welcome to kos he held out his hand polemaios clasped it antigonos nephew was more than a head taller than the lord of egypt and twenty years younger besides neither size nor youth mattered a khalkos worth here ptolemaios solid and blocky was the stronger of the two he took that for granted too going on without giving polemaios a chance to speak well strike some heavy blows against your uncle ill fuck his asshole instead of a sausage skin polemaios declared the gross obscenity staggered sostratos he hadnt dreamt even a macedonian could come out with anything so crude but ptolemaios just chuckled and so did menedemos sostratos horror must have shown on his face for menedemos leaned toward him and whispered thats aristophanes is it sostratos whispered back menedemos dipped his head sostratos eyed polemaios with new respect not only had he quoted the comic poetthough what a line to choosebut hed been shrewd enough to guess that ptolemaios would know he was quoting and wouldnt be disgusted youll have your chance the ruler of egypt said i can use every talented officer i can get my hands on and as your men drift in i expect ill get good service from them too antigonos nephew looked as if hed bitten into an unbaked quince what ptolemaios was talking about didnt sound like anything close to an equal alliance evidently it didnt sound like one to polemaios either he said i thought wed be partners in this and so we will ptolemaios said easily he reached up and clapped polemaios on the back come on into the andron and well drink to everything were going to do to antigonos he waved to sostratos and menedemos you boys come along too dont you worry about a thingi promise i havent forgotten you in the andron a slave poured wine for ptolemaios and polemaios and then for the two rhodians sostratos poured out a small libation when he drank his eyebrows rose for one thing the wine was strong one to one wine to water or somewhere close to it for another very fine sir sostratos said if this is koan id like to know from whom you got it i wouldnt mind carrying some on the aphrodite wed get a good price for it its better than that pitchflavored vinegar you and your sailors drink thats for sure polemaios said it is a local wine i think but youll have to ask my steward for the details ptolemaios waved a negligent hand one corner of his mouth quirked upward in an engagingly wry smile figuring out how to spend die silver youll get from me eh yes sir why not sostratos said not getting the silver from ptolemaios was one obvious reason why not he didnt want to think about that no reason at all young fellow ptolemaios answered youre doing your job the best way you know how cant ask for more than that from a man and you and your captain got this big fellowhe pointed with his chin at polemaioshere in fine time for which i thank you kindly what did you think of them polemaios they both have tongues that flap too free and this oneantigonos nephew glowered at menedemoswill not keep his eyes to himself but he added reluctantly they do handle their ship well rhodians have that knack must come of their being islanders ptolemaios said two of his servitors came in each carrying four goodsized leather sacks when they set the sacks down in front of sostratos they clinked ptolemaios eyes glinted here is the balance of your fee i suppose youll want to count and weigh to make sure i havent cheated you no sir sostratos answered if youre ready for me to do it thats the best sign i dont need to you see what i mean polemaios rumbled tending to ones business isnt insolence ptolemaios said he pointed north and east in the direction of halikarnassos you and i have some business in common some business with antigonos so we do antigonos renegade nephew agreed but wed do better not to talk about it where these fellows can listen he pointed to sostratos and menedemos as if they were pieces of furniture unable to understand anything that made sostratos want to bristle but he didnt show his anger his cousin did snapping you trusted us far enough to let us bring you here what makes you think weve suddenly turned into antigonos spies since we found a berth in the harbor polemaios surged to his feet ive had everything im going to take from you you pretty little catamite and enough ptolemaios deep angry rasp effortlessly dominated every other voice in the room the rhodian asked a fair enough question he brought me here for pay polemaios pointed to the leather sacks full of coins if my uncle gives him silver hell sing for pay too what can he say that youre here ptolemaios shrugged antigonos will know that by this time tomorrow hell have men here the same as i do on the mainland some boat or other will sneak away from kos and get over there with the news cant be helped antigonos nephew scowled he was plainly not a man who liked disagreement or back talk being who he was being part of his family he wouldnt have heard much of it and he would have been able to ignore more of what he did hear but he couldnt ignore ptolemaios not here in the middle of the ruler of egypts stronghold all right thenfine he said not bothering to hide his disgust tell them everything why dont you i didnt say a word about telling them everything ptolemaios replied i did say you were silly to insult them for no good reason i said it and i still say it could looks have killed ptolemaios would have been a dead man with sostratos and menedemos lying lifeless on the floor beside him sostratos would have liked nothing better than hanging about and listening to the two prominent men wrangle if that wasnt the raw stuff from which history was made what was but he didnt want polemaios any angrier at his cousin and him than he was already and he didnt want to make ptolemaios angry by overstaying his welcome reluctantly he said menedemos and i had better get back to the aphrodite good idea ptolemaios said youll probably want an escort too i would if i were walking through the streets with so much silver thank you siryes sostratos said and if i might speak to your steward for a moment about the wine certainly ptolemaios gave a couple of crisp orders one slave went outside presumably to talk to some of the soldiers there another led the rhodians out into the courtyard where the steward met them he was a plump fussy little man named kleonymos and had the details of koan winesellers at his fingertips sostratos found out what he needed to know thanked the man and left ptolemaios residence by the time he got back to the aphrodite he discovered that lugging twenty minai of silver through the streets of kos had other drawbacks besides the risk of robbery his arms felt a palm longer than they had been when he set out menedemos seemed no happier the concentrated mass of the silver made it seem heavier than if hed been carrying say a trussed piglet of like weight after the soldiers headed back toward ptolemaios residence menedemos said well i can certainly see why antigonos nephew makes himself loved wherever he goes cant you yes hes a very charming fellow sostratos agreed they could say what they wanted about polemaios now they didnt have him aboard the aphroditeany more sostratos would have been just as well pleased never to have made his acquaintance too but hed made them a profit once aboard the akatos they stowed the sacks of coins with the rest of their silver in the cramped space under the poop deck where raidersand any lightfingered sailors they happened to have in the crewwould have the hardest time stealing the money when they emerged once more sostratos said and now we can do what we should have done the last time we left kos whats that o best one menedemos asked innocently drill the crew harder on getting away from pirates and fighting them off if we cant no doubt youre right sostratos fortunately wasnt holding one of those fivemina sacks of silver any more had he been he might have tried to brain his cousin with it as things were the smile he gave menedemos was as wolfish as he could make it that too of course he said as we go to athens no matter what menedemos cousin wanted the aphrodite didnt immediately make for athens for one thing menedemos kept the promise hed made to let the crew roister in the city of kos for a couple of days to make up for the hard work theyd done rowing east from kythnos in the calm for another menedemos eyed sostratos with amusement as they walked through the streets of kos this is your own fault my dear he said youve got no business twisting and moaning as if you were about to shit yourself the way dionysos does in the frogs oh to the crows with aristophanes sostratos snarled and to the crows with di you dont want to say that menedemos broke in before his cousin could curse the god of wine you mean you dont want me to say that sostratos understood him well enough all right i dont want you to say that however you please just dont say it menedemos was a conventionally pious young man he believed in the gods as much because his father did as for any other reason sostratos he knew had other notions most of the time his cousin was polite enough to keep from throwing those notions in his face when sostratos started to slip menedemos wasnt shy about letting him know he didnt care for such remarks coming out a woman yelled from a secondstory window and emptied a chamber pot into the street below the warning call let menedemos and sostratos skip to one side a fellow leading a donkey wasnt so lucky the stinking stuff splashed him he shook his fist up at the window and shouted curses you see menedemos said as he and sostratos walked on aristophanes was as true to life as euripides any day his cousin didnt even rise to that which showed what a truly evil mood he was in its your own fault menedemos repeated if you hadnt asked ptolemaios steward about the wine we were drinking oh shut up sostratos said but then relenting a little he pointed to a door i think thats the right house lets find out menedemos knocked who is the question in accented greek came from within the door didnt open is this the house of nikomakhos son of pleistarkhos the wine merchant menedemos asked who you the door still didnt open but the voice on the other side seemed a little less hostile two rhodian traders menedemos gave his name and sostratos wed like to talk to nikomakhos about buying some wine you wait after that menedemos heard nothing he started drumming his fingers on the outside of his thigh sostratos looked longingly back toward the harbor if the door didnt open pretty soon menedemos saw he would have trouble persuading his cousin to hang around just when sostratos grumbles were starting to turn into words the door did open the fellow standing there was a hellene with a beard streaked with gray he had a goodnatured smile that showed a broken front tooth ail my friends im nikomakhos ow are you today most people on kos used a doric dialect not far from that of rhodes but he spoke an ionian greek dropping his rough breathings hail menedemos said a little sourly he introduced himself and sostratos then added your surly slave there almost cost you some business ibanollis is a karian as stubborn as kerberos nikomakhos said with a sigh es been in the ouseold since my fathers day sometimes youre stuck with a slave like that but do come in and well talk ive eard of you avent i you were running some kind of errand for ptolemaios thats right menedemos answered we just fetched antigonos nephew here from euboia sostratos raised a finger to his lips as they followed nikomakhos into the courtyard but menedemos shrugged and tossed his head that polemaios was here wouldnt stay secret not when hed tramped through the polis on his way to the ruler of egypts residence ptolemaios himself had known as much why not take credit for bringing him then nikomakhos whistled old oneeye over on the mainland wont like that a bit of course e wont like anything ptolemaios as done to him this campaigning season the androns over this way he turned left in the middle of the courtyard stood a bent skinny old man with a bald head a bushy white beard and the angriest glare menedemos had seen this side of an eagleibanollis without a doubt the slave looked daggers at him and sostratos menedemos wondered why he seemed so hateful did he think they would cheat his master or was he just angry because hed had to answer the door probablybetter not to know menedemos thought sostratos didnt ask any questions either a cleanshaven young manyounger than the two rhodians joined nikomakhos in the andron this is my son pleistarkhos the wine merchant said im teaching im the business same as your fathers were doing with you not too long ago tell me what i can do for you and i will if i can we drank some of your wine at ptolemaios menedemos replied we liked it enough that sostratos got your name from his steward if we can make a deal wed like to buy some to take aboard our akatos a merchant galley eh then youll want the best nikomakhos said menedemos dipped his head in an aside to his son nikomakhos went on akatoi cant carry much they make money selling topoftheline goods to the folk oo can afford to buy them there was one last yearremembercame into the arbor with peacocks aboard of all the crazy things bound for italy they were to make the most they could that was our ship as a matter of fact sostratos said is that so nikomakhos exclaimed both rhodians dipped their heads and did you do well with em the wine merchant asked we did splendidly menedemos would have boasted even if he were lying that was how the game was played he would have sounded sincere too every bit as sincere as he did while telling the truth well good for you the koan said and now its wine is it fine wine menedemos turned to pleistarkhos your fathers right we carry the best last year we had ariousian from khios it cost us a lot but we made a profit from it everybody around the inner sea makes wine but most of its pretty nasty stuff when youve got something that isnt people will pay for it ariousians firstrate nikomakhos agreed id like to say that what i make is just as good but youd call me a liar to my face still and all though im not ashamed of it he eyed menedemos you cant think its too bad either or you wouldnt be ere menedemos grinned at him i told you it was sostratos idea its good wine sostratos said id like to get someif we can afford it nikomakhos eyes glinted youre not poor men to begin with or you wouldnt be in the trade youre in and if you tell me ptolemaios didnt pay you well to bring antignnos nephew ere ill be the one calling you a couple of liars what you say may be true my friend but that doesnt mean we can throw our money away either menedemos said we couldnt stay in business if we did and even if i wanted to my cousin would beat me he pointed to sostratos he doesnt look it but hes terribly fierce sostratos didnt look fierce he did look annoyed he didnt like being twitted menedemos didnt let that worry him not when he was getting a dicker going pleistarkhos took menedemos literally and eyed sostratos with a wary respect he hadnt shown before nikomakhos seemed more amused than anything else cant ave any beatings he said well what do you suppose a fair price would be then he raised a hand no dont answer that why dont you taste some first he called for a slavenot the badtempered ibanollisand told him to bring back samples and some bread and oil to go with them the wine was as sweet and strong as it had been in ptolemaios andron it wasnt the magnificent golden anousian but what was after a few sips menedemos said i can see how you might get four or five drakhmai for an amphora four or five pleistarkhos turned red thats an insult his father tossed his head no it isnt son its just an opening offer e knows its worth three times that much but e cant come out and say so its a good wine sostratos said its not worth three times what my cousin offered if you think it isgood luck finding buyers at that price we can do it pleistarkhos said maybe so but we wont be among them menedemos said thats the kind of money we paid for the ariousian last year this is good but it isnt that good they haggled for most of the morning nikomakhos came down to ten drakhmai the amphora menedemos and sostratos went up as high as eight and there they stuck im sorry my friends but i dont see ow i can sell for any less nikomakhos said menedemos glanced at sostratos unobtrusively his cousin tossed his head that fit in with menedemos view of things im sorry too he told the koan i dont think we could show a profit if i went higher if we were heading off to italy again i might take the chance but not for the towns round the aegean if tens really as low as youll go very often a threat like that would make the other side see things your way this time nikomakhos sighed and said im afraid it is he turned to his son sometimes the best bargain is the one you dont make thats true menedemos got to his feet so did sostratos menedemos dipped his head to nikomakhos a pleasure to have met you best one we often come by kos maybe well try again another time ibanollis the karian slave was still standing in the courtyard when menedemos and sostratos headed for the door with his dour expression and forwardthrusting posture he reminded menedemos oi a frowzy old stork perched on a rooftop waste of time he croaked to the rhodians as they left had he stood on one leg the resemblance would have been perfect lovely fellow menedemos remarked once they were out on the street isnt he just but sostratos sounded embittered not amused he explained why a moment later however charming he is he was right we did waste our time and we could have been twiddling our thumbs aboard the aphrodite menedemos broke in you were going to say heading for athens werent you but youre wrong we couldnt have sailed this morning anyhow not unless we wanted to break our promise to the crew remember and that was your idea too oh sostratos said in a small voice thats right he breathed a sigh of relief good i dont feel so bad now about getting nikomakhos name from ptolemaios steward they walked along toward the harbor after a while menedemos said ive been thinking euge sostratos replied his tone suggesting he was offering the praise because menedemos didnt do it very often refusing to rise to the bait menedemos went on i was thinking about the best way to get to athens from here same route we used to pick up polemaios of course sostratos said though theyll probably be sick of seeing us in the kyklades thats what i was thinking about menedemos said those are dangerous waterswe saw it for ourselves and theyre going to be more dangerous than usual polemaios men or some of them will be heading this way i dont want to run into them the only real difference between mercenaries and pirates is that pirates have ships when mercenaries take ship theyre liable to turn pirate too you have been thinking sostratos said thats well put and of course on our way back the cities of the island league may have learned we smuggled antigonos nephew past them menedemos continued since the league is antigonos creature they may not be any too happy with us sostratos finished for him menedemos dipped his head his cousin scowled how do we get to athens then thats what ive been thinking about menedemos replied suppose we go on up to miletos and do some trading there suppose we dont sostratos said thats one of old oneeyes chief strongholds and he broke off looking foolish oh i see word of what weve done wont have got there yet now menedemos indulged himself with a sarcastic ettge his cousins scowl returned i still dont like it laughing menedemos said of course you dont my dear it means one more pause before your precious gryphons skull can be formally introduced to athenian society but consider from miletos we can sail northwest to ikaria either stopping at samos on the way or spending a night at sea and then strike straight across the aegean for the channel between andros and euboia instead of hopping from island to island traders hardly ever use that route which means pirates dont either we could get almost to attica without having anybody notice he watched sostratos contemplate that it wasnt what his cousin wanted menedemos knew as much most men when thwarted in their desires lashed out at whoever held them back menedemos had seen that too sostratos mouth twisted but he didnt let loose whatever curses he was thinking instead he said well i dont like to admit it but thats likely best for the ship and best for business let it be as you say i did think you would fuss more menedemos said sostratos smiled a crooked smile i will if you like dont bother menedemos smiled too im glad youre being so reasonable i was just thinking that not many men would oh ill fight like a wild boar when i think im right and ill rip the guts out of the hunting dogs of illogic that nip my heels sostratos said but whats the point in getting hot and bothered when that would be wrong you might win anyhow some would say you had a better chance in fact menedemos answered look at what bad logic did to good logic in the clouds you keep coming back to that polluted play sostratos said you know its not my favorite but theres a lot of good stuff in it menedemos said by the time bad logic is done good logic sees that practically all the athenians are a pack of widearsed catamites thats not true though sostratos protested its what people think menedemos applied the clincher and its funny what people think to be true often influences what they do or say and so becomes a truth of its own sostratos said thoughtfully ill chase truth where it leads me and it leads me there he wagged a finger at menedemos but i would never throw truth over the rail for the sake of getting a laugh youre the soul of virtue menedemos could have spoken mockingly his cousin did get tiresome at times but sostratos really did have a great many virtues and menedemos was more willing than usual to acknowledge them because his cousin wasnt fussing about heading up to miletos sostratos pointed theres the aphrodite a couple of sailors aboard the merchant galley spotted their captain and toikharkhos and waved menedemos waved back he also wiped his forehead with the back of his hand hot and muggy he grumbled it is isnt it sostratos looked north breeze is picking up a little bit too i think he spoke as if hoping menedemos would tell him he was wrong menedemos unfortunately thought he was right i hope we dont get a blow he said it would be late in the year for one but i dont like the feel of the air no neither do i sostratos said and then we might have done better not to let the crew do its celebrating here menedemos shrugged if it is a storm wed get it in miletos too just as well not to get it out in the middle of the aegean though his feet went from the gravelly dirt of the street to the planks of the quay hot under the sun but worn smooth by the passage of countless barefoot sailors when he and sostratos came up to the aphrodite aristeidas asked will they bring some of this famous koan wine aboard tomorrow afraid not menedemos tossed his head nikomakhos wouldnt come down far enough to make it worth our while to buy ah too bad the lookout said a fair number of sailors had a lively interest in the business end of what the aphroditedid aristeidas was one of them maybe he dreamt of owning a merchantman himself or maybe of serving as captain aboard one and going on trading runs for the owner the first was unlikely the second was by no means impossible had things gone better for diokles he would have been doing that this sailing season his time might probably wouldstill come in his turn menedemos asked see anything interesting across the water at halikarnassos no skipper aristeidas answered everythings quiet over there ptolemaios war galleys go back and forth outside the harbor here and you can see antigonos little as bugs doing the same thing over there they dont even move against each other just as well menedemos said i wouldnt want to sail out of here and end up in the middle of a sea fight i should hope not aristeidas exclaimed in a low voice sostratos said oh you had warships in mind when you asked about halikarnassos i thought you were still worrying about the husband you outraged a couple of years ago funny menedemos said through clenched teeth very funny if he hadnt got out of halikarnassos in a hurry he might not have been able to get out at all that husband had wanted his blood but he made himself look northeast toward the city on the mainland ill get back there one of these days not under your right name you wont sostratos said not unless you come at the head of a fleet yourself he was probably right no he was almost certainly right menedemos knew as much he didnt intend to admit it though i could do it this year if i had to i think in a couple of years that fellow wont even remember my name his cousin snorted he wont forget you till the day he dies and even then his ghost will want to haunt you i doubt it now menedemos spoke with more confidence hell have another man or more than one to be angry at by then if his wife bent over forward for me shell bend over forward for somebody else too women are like that and shell probably get caught again shes pretty but shes not very smart as was sostratos way he met that thoughtfully character doesnt change much true enough he admitted but then he pointed at menedemos that holds for men as well as women you in taras last summer i didnt know phyllis was that fellows wife menedemos protested i thought she was just a serving girl the first time you did yes sostratos said but you went back for a second helping after you knew who she was thats when you had to jump out the window i got away with it menedemos said and he set bully boys on you afterwards his cousin said itll be a long time before you can go back to taras too in how many more cities around the inner sea will you make yourself unwelcome he wanted to make menedemos feel guilty menedemos refused to give him the satisfaction of showing guilt unwelcome what are you talking bout the women in both towns made me about as welcome as a man can be you can do business with women sure enough sostratos said but you cant make a profit from them you sound like my father menedemos said an edge to his voice sostratos for a wonder took the hint that proved he wasnt philodemos the older man never would have sostratos looked up at the early morning sky and clicked his tongue between his teeth it was after sunrise but only twilight leaked through the thick gray clouds do we really want to set out in this he asked menedemos the air felt even wetter than it had a couple of days before it hasnt rained yet his cousin answered maybe it will hold off a while longer even if it doesnt making miletos is easy enough from here and besidesmenedemos lowered his voicepaying the sailors for sitting idle eats into the money we make that struck a chord with the thrifty sostratos an akatos was expensive to operate no doubt about it the sailors earned about two minai of silver every three daysand as menedemos had said earned their pay whether the aphroditesailed the aegean or sat in port you think its safe to go then sostratos asked once more we should be all right menedemos said he turned to diokles if you think im wrong dont be shy i wouldnt be skipperits my neck were talking about you know the oarmaster replied i expect we can make miletos too and if the weather does turn really dirty we can always swing around and run back here i was thinking the same thing menedemos said he raised an eyebrow at sostratos satisfied certainly sostratos answered he didnt want menedemos reckoning him a wet blanket if we can do it we should do it and it puts us one day closer to athens menedemos laughed and clapped him on the shoulder i thought that might be somewhere in the back of your mind he raised his voice to the sailors forward cast off the mooring lines rowers to their places no more swilling and screwing till the next port the sailors had moved quicker a good many of them had spent everything theyd made so far this season in their spree in the polis of kos nobody was missing though dioldes had a better nose than a kastorian hunting hound for sniffing men out of harborside taverns and brothels come on you lugs the keleustes rasped now time to sweat out the wine youve guzzled a couple of groans answered him he didnt laugh hed done his share of drinking too the thick ropes thudded down into the waist of the aphrodite sailors who werent rowing coiled them and got them out of the way back oars diokles called and struck the bronze square with the mallet rhyppapai rhyppapai menedemos slid one steeringoar tiller in toward him the other out swinging the aphroditearound till her bow pointed north a round ship that had been lying at anchor a couple of plethra away from the pier sculled toward the spot the merchant galley had vacated with ptolemaios fleet here kos harbor remained badly overcrowded just for a moment the sun peeked through the dark clouds highlighting the karian headland north of kos on which halikarnassos and farther west the smaller town of myndos lay the yellow stubble of harvested grainfields and the grayish green leaves of olive groves seemed particularly bright against the gloomy background of the sky sostratos hoped that shaft of sunlight meant the weather would clear but the clouds rolled in again and color drained out of the landscape menedemos took the aphroditeup the channel between myndos and the island of kalymnos to the west when the akatos came abreast of myndos sostratos pointed toward the town and said look antigonos has war galleys patrolling there too so would i in his place menedemos answered he blinked a couple of times a comical expression whats that about sostratos asked raindrop just hit me in the eye menedemos said he rubbed his nose theres another one a moment later one hit sostratos in the knee another on the forearm and a third gave him a wet kiss on the left ear a couple of sailors exclaimed here comes the storm sure enough sostratos said the aphrodites sail was already up against the yard for she was heading straight into the wind after those first few scattered drops the rain came down hard far harder than it had in the kyklades very late in the year for one like this menedemos said sostratos could hardly hear him raindrops were drumming down on the planking of the poop deck and hissing into the sea it is isnt it sostratos said i hope all the leather sacks are sound otherwise were liable to have some waterdamaged silk you look waterdamaged yourself menedemos said its dripping out of your beard how can you tell the way its coming down out of the sky sostratos replied instead of answering directly menedemos raised his voice to a shout aristeidas go forward the sailor waved and hurried up to the foredeck polemaios cant complain about him this time menedemos said no sostratos agreed but how much good will he do with the rain coming down like this i can hardly see him up there and hes onlywhatthirty or thirtyfive cubits away hes the best set of eyes weve got menedemos said i cant do any more than that sostratos dipped his head i wasnt arguing pie pulled off his chiton and threw it down onto the deck in the warm rain going naked was more comfortable than wet wool squelching against his skin he looked back toward the aphrodites boat which she towed by a line tied to the sternpost i wonder if youll need to put a man with a pot in there to bail it is coming down isnt it menedemos said an unspoken thought flashed between them iwonder if well need to start bailing out the ship sostratos knew he hadnt expected weather this nasty and his cousin couldnt have either or he wouldnt have set out from kos menedemos quickly changed the subject take the steering oars for a moment would you i want to get out of my tunic too of course my dear sostratos seized the steeringoar tillers with alacrity menedemos usually had charge of them all the way through the voyage sostratos didnt have to do any steering past holding the merchant galley on her course even so the strength of the sea shot up his arms informing his whole body its like holding a conversation with poseidon himself he thought menedemos soggy chiton splatted onto the planks of the deck beside his own thats better his cousin said thanks ill get back where i belong now all right sostratos said though his tone suggested it was anything but laughing menedemos said you want to hang on for a while do you well i cant say that i blame you its like making love to the sea isnt it that wasnt the comparison sostratos had thought of but it wasnt a bad one and it suits my cousin too he thought may i stay for a bit he asked why not menedemos said laughing still but then he grew more serious probably not the worst thing in the world for you to know what to do i do know sostratos answered but theres a difference between knowing how to do something and having experience at it before menedemos could reply aristeidas let out a horrified cry for the foredeck ship by the gods a ship off the port bow and shes heading straight for us sostratos head jerked to the left sure enough wallowing through the curtain of rain and into sight came a great round ship her sail down from the yard and full of wind as she ran before the breeze straight for the aphrodite sostratos knew what he had to do he pulled one steering oar in as far as it would go and pushed the other as far out desperately swinging the akatos to starboard that wasnt making love to the sea but wrestling with it forcing it and the ship to obey his strength and the sea fought back pushing against the blades of the steering oars with a supple power that appalled him had menedemos snatched the steeringoar tillers from his hands he would have yielded them on the instant but his cousin seeing that hed done the right thing said only hold us on that turn no matter what and sostratos did though he began to think he was wrestling a foe beyond his strength pull hard you bastards pull menedemos screamed to the rowers and then to the men who werent rowing grab poles grab oars fend that fat sow off he cupped his hands and screamed louder still at the round ship sheer off sheer off you widearsed tawnyturded chamber pot a couple of naked sailors on the round ship were yelling too sostratos could see their open mouths they were so dose he could see that one of them had a couple of missing teeth he couldnt hear a word they said though one of them ran hack and snatched up a pole too to try to push the aphroditeaway but the big beamy ship lumbered on right toward the merchant galley right toward at first sostratos had been sure she would simply trample the aphroditeunder her keel as a war galley might have done but his hard turn gave him hope he had to turn his head farther to the left every moment to keep an eye on the round ship maybe she would slip past the akatos stern but she was close now so close port oarsin diokles yelled not wanting them broken and crushed by the round ships hull with only the starboard rowers working the aphroditetried to slew back to port sostratos held her on course against the new pressure poles probed out from each ship trying to hold the other off sostratos felt two or three thud against the merchant galleys flank with a far larger crew the aphroditehad more men straining to push away the round ship sailors on both ships cursed and called on the gods sometimes both in the same breath they almost got their miracle had the rain been even a little lighter had lynxeyed aristeidas spied the round ship even a handful of heartbeats sooner the two vessels would have missed each other but with a grind of timbers the round ships side scraped against the aphrodites stern sostratos jerked his arm off the port steering oar an instant before the other ship carried the oar away had he been late he would have had the arm torn from its socket the round ship sailed on as if without a care in the world sostratos shook himself as if waking from a bad dream but a dream wouldnt have left him naked on a pitching rolling deck both hands now on the tiller of the surviving steering oar you did well there menedemos said quietly you did as well as anyone could ill take it now duck under the poop deck and see if were taking on water to the crows with me if that fat piga word with a lewd double meaningdidnt stave in some of our planking all right sostratos said why didnt you take the steering oars away from me maybe the round ship would have missed menedemos tossed his head you had us going hard to starboard that was the right thing to do and i couldnt have done anything different i didnt want the tillers without hands on em for even half a heartbeat there so i just left you alone now go see how were doing under here as sostratos went past diokles the oarmaster clapped him on the back that made him so proud he all but flew down the steps from the poop deck to the waist of the ship diokles was not a man to show approval when it hadnt been earned ducking under the poop deck sostratos found the one drawback to sending a tall man down therehe banged his head twice in quick succession on the underside of the deck timbers the second time hard enough to see stars he wished he had some of menedemos aristophanic curses handy then he found more reason to curse than a lump on the head for his cousin had known whereof he spoke the collision had staved in three or four of the timbers near the stern cracking the tenons and breaking open the mortises that held them together seawater came throughnot in a steady stream but by surges so the damage was close to the waterline but not below it sostratos backed out from under the decking and not being the most graceful of men hit his head once more for good measure he went up onto the poop deck and gave menedemos the news i knew it menedemos said savagely and what do you bet we didnt do a thing to that stinking round ship itll have timbers as thick as its skippers head how much waters coming in its not too bad sostratos answered its leaking in spurts not steadily if we patch it with sailcloth and bail do you think we can turn back and make kos i suppose so sostratos said myndos is a lot closer though he pointed east i know it my dear menedemos answered ill go there if i have to but id rather not damage like that takes a while to repair and word will get to myndos that we were the ones who brought polemaios to kos if i have a choice id sooner not be there when it does if i donthe shruggedthats a different story and ill do what i have to do ah sostratos dipped his head that makes good sense as i say its not too bad we got off easier than we might have you might want to go under there and see for yourself i suppose id better menedemos said all right take the steering oarsuh oar who wouldve thought wed lose two on the same voyage long odds there by the gods swing her around to southward to run with the wind well make for kos unless i decide we cant get there when menedemos came back up onto the poop deck he was rubbing the top of his head seeing that made sostratos feel better about his own bumps menedemos said theyre sprung sure enough but i think we can plug em youre rightthats not too bad a leak well make kos easy as you please he shouted commands sending a couple of sailors under the poop deck with sailcloth to stuff up the sprung seams and ordering the sail lowered from the yard sostratos peered forward whatll we do if we spot the round ship we ought to ram her menedemos growled see how she likes it by the gods in more thoughtful tones he went on if we find out who she is maybe we can go to law with her skipper or her owner maybe sostratos knew he sounded dubious going to law against anyone from another polisand collecting a judgment if you wonwas often a task to make sisyphos seem easy by comparison often but perhaps not always sostratos brightened a little if she puts in at kos we could go straight to ptolemaios so we could menedemos smiled a predatory smile hard to find a better connection than that isnt it before sostratos could answer a sailor came out from under the poop deck and called to menedemos skipper weve plugged up the sprung seams as best we can but were still taking on some water how much is some menedemos demanded he waved a hand never mindill see for myself sostratos take the steering oar again and keep us on our course as soon as sostratos had hold of the tiller his cousin disappeared under the deck once more when he emerged his expression was as gloomy as the weather pestilence take it i dont want to have to make for myndos diokles said skipper why not fother a square of sailcloth smeared with pitch over the damage war galleys will do that when theyre rammedif they have the time before theyre rammed again i mean hold the sailcloth against the ship with ropes you mean menedemos said and the oarmaster dipped his head menedemos looked thoughtful ive never tried that you know how to go about it i sure do diokles answered some men would say as much regardless of whether it was true sostratos didnt think the keleustes was one of them evidently his cousin didnt either all right take charge of it menedemos said ill learn from you along with the sailors right diokles said getting pitch on the sailcloth will be a bastard in this rain but what can you do as some of the sailors started that messy job he ordered the sail brailed up again and took all but four rowers off the oars hold her course steady he told sostratos we dont want much speed on her right now on account of well bring the boat alongside and itll have to keep up i understand sostratos said the oarmaster called to the crew now who can swim we have anybody whos ever dived for sponges one naked sailor raised a hand diokles waved to him good for you moskhion he spoke quietly to sostratos hell be swimming under the hull he ought to have something for it of course sostratos dipped his head and raised his voice two days pay bonus for you moskhion with a grin moskhion went down into the boat along with the sailcloth to be fothered over the sprung seams and the lines to make it fast to the hull he had a line tied around his own middle too and carried one tied to a belaying pin on the aphrodite a couple of rowers kept the boat alongside the akatos another pair of sailors wrestled the sailcloth against the damaged planks sostratos got all this from diokles and menedemos comments he wished his cousin would take back the surviving steering oar so he could see for himself but no such luck splash moskhion went into the sea a surprisingly short time later he scrambled over the starboard gunwale he undid the line from his own waist and wrapped the one hed carried round another belaying pin then he hurried over to the port side got down into the boat again hauled in his safety line and tied it round himself again after four trips under the hull he said that ought to do it lets see what weve got then menedemos hurried down off the poop deck to go below and see what the fothering had done over his shoulder he added you earned your three drakhmai moskhion wasnt as hard as sponge diving the sailor said there you go down so deep your ears hurt and your chest feels like somebody piled rocks on itand you carry a rock yourself to sink faster you keep that up youre an old man before youre forty tin glad to pull an oar instead when menedemos came out from under the decking he looked pleased down to just a trickle now thanks dioklesi wouldnt have thought of that trick two days bonus for you too remember it sostratos as sostratos dipped his head diokles said thank you kindly skipper ill take the steering oar now menedemos said and he did he raised his voice to call out to the crew eight men a side on the oars and well lower the sail from the yard again now the sooner we get back to kos the sooner we can get patched up and be on our way again tin beginning to wonder if the fates ever intend to let me get to athens sostratos said heres one more delay and not even one where we can turn a profit this ones not our fault by the gods menedemos said he raised his voice again two days pay to whoever spots the ship that hit us when we find out who she is we will take it up with ptolemaios that had the sailors avidly peering out to sea all the way back to kos but no one spied the round ship maybe the weather was too dirty or maybe shed been making for kalymnos not kos maybe she sank sostratos said as the aphroditeneared the port from which shed set out early in the morning too much to hope for menedemos said i dont see any of ptolemaios war galleys on patrol outside the harbor they ought to be the weather isnt too nasty to keep antigonos from giving him a nasty surprise if hes so inclined when the akatos came into the harbor itself sostratos exclaimed in surprise where did all the ships go theres space at half the quays where this morning everything was tight as a pretty boys backside menedemos finished for him that wasnt what hed been about to say nor anything close to it but it did carry a similar meaning a fellow who wore a broadbrimmed hat to keep the rain off his face came up the pier to see who the newcomers were sostratos asked him the same question what happened to all the ships the man pointed north and east theyre all over there by the mainland ptolemaios used the cover of the storm to mount an attack on halikarnassos menedemos scowled at the koan carpenter what do you mean you cant do anything for the aphrodite he demanded what i said the koan answered i usually mean what i say were all too busy repairing ptolemaios warships and transports to have any time left over to deal with a merchant galley well what am i supposed to do till you find the time menedemos said hang myself its all the same to me the carpenter told him the fellow picked up his mallet and drove home a treenail joining a tenon and the plank into which it was inserted then he reached for another peg muttering menedemos walked away it was either that or snatch the mallet out of the koans hand and brain him with it but that wouldnt do any good either it wouldnt get the man to work for him which was what he needed in the harbor of halikarnassos carpenters were probably just as busy repairing antigonos war galleys that also did menedemos no good he looked northeast toward the city on the karian mainland a plume of smoke marked any city at any time smoke was a distinctive city smell along with baking bread and the less pleasant odors of dung and unwashed humanity but a great cloud of black smoke rose from halikarnassos now did it come from inside the place or had the defenders managed to fire a palisade ptolemaios men had run up from this distance menedemos couldnt tell he hoped halikarnassos fell and fell quickly his reasons were entirely selfish if ptolemaios ships werent constantly limping back to the harbor of kos with sprung timbers or smashed stemposts or outandout holes from stones thrown by engines the carpenters here wouldnt be working on them at all hours of the dayand sometimes by torchlight at night they would have a chance to fix the aphrodite but ptolemaios had hoped to seize the town by surprise that hadnt worked now his men had to settle down to besiege it which could take a long time troy took agamemnon and odysseus and the rest of the akhaioi ten years menedemos thought and wished he hadnt things would go faster than that nowadays homers hexameters said nothing of catapults that flung javelins or stone balls weighing thirty minai or more homers hexameters as a matter of fact said next to nothing about siege warfare itself even though the iliad was about the siege of troy alexanders army could probably have stormed hektors city in ten days not ten years menedemos paused to scratch his head at that thought agamemnon and akhilleus and the aiantes and diomedes and the rest might have been heroes some of them the sons of gods but they hadnt known a lot of things modern soldiers took for granted alexander had admired akhilleus hed taken a copy of the iliad with him on his campaigns in the trackless east had he ever realized his men could have thrashed the warriors whod sailed the black ships to troy menedemos doubted it the next thing that went through his mind was i cant tell sostratos about this his cousin might shrug and say hed thought of the same thing years before if sostratos hadnt thought of it though menedemos knew he would get no peace till his cousin had squeezed the whey out of every single related possibility keeping quiet was a better bet his own thoughts returned to the aphrodite he didnt want to try making those repairs himself he wasnt worried about the steering oar he was confident the amateur carpenters aboard the akatos could fashion a substitute but the planking at the stern had taken even more damage than hed thought with seams sprung tenons cracked and mortises broken open for several cubits distance from the actual point of the collision he wanted those planks repaired properly if the merchant galley started taking on seawater halfway across the aegean he shuddered not all ships came home i need real carpenters but i cant get them so what do i do now only one thing i can do i have to wait till i can get them that was logical it made menedemos hate logic i le stiffened when a pentekonter that might have come straight out of the catalogue of ships glided into the harbor such singlebanked galleys were the only warships homer had known these days though they were pirate ships not naval vessels no pirate would have been mad enough to raid kos harbor and this ship peaceably tied up at a quay and started disgorging hoplites an officer rushed up the quay and took charge of the soldiersor rather tried to for they eyed him with contempt veiled as thinly as the most transparent koan silk might have done only after several minutes talkand only after the officer pointed back into the city of kos as if threatening to call for reinforcementsdid the newcomers let him lead them away more of polemaios men id say sostratos remarked id say youre right menedemos agreed theyre slipping out of khalkis a shipload at a time and heading this way his cousin pointed toward the smoke rising from halikarnassos if i were ptolemaioshe pronounced the ruler of egypts name with care so menedemos couldnt doubt which macedonian he meantid send polemaios men across to the siege and wouldnt it be a shame if they got used up menedemos didnt need to think about that for very long before dipping his head id do the same but ptolemaios doesnt seem to want to hes just getting them out of the polis making them encamp outside the walls that doesnt seem safe enough to me nor to me sostratos said if he trusted polemaioshe named antigonos nephew carefully toothat would be one thing but polemaios turned on antigonos and then he turned on kassandros too ptolemaios would have to be feebleminded to think the man wont also turn on him the moment he sees a chance ptolemaios isnt feebleminded menedemos said hes one very sharp fellow he certainly is now sostratos dipped his head thats why im assuming hes got somebody keeping an eye on polemaios and his soldiers remember how polemaios tried to see if we knew which of ptolemaios officers would take a bribe that i do menedemos answered i thought wed be out of kos and across the aegean before it could possibly matter but the stinking collision put paid to that the collision and the fight across the channel that cisternarsed scowi hope it did sink in the storm maybe it did sostratos said no sign of it here anyhow gods only know how long well be stuck here though menedemos drummed his fingers on the outside of his thigh his cousins voice was tart believe me my dear i like it no better than you do i want to be in athens i burn to be in athens as a matter of fact i burn to be anywhere but here we ought to start going to the agora and selling what we can well make something that way not much menedemos said in dismay ships from rhodes put in here ail the time we wont get much of a price for perfume or inkand how can we hope to sell the silk we just bought except at a loss koans can buy direct from the folk who make it they dont need to deal with middlemen i understand that believe me his cousin replied but we have to pay the sailors no matter where we are or what were doing and that talent we got from ptolemaios is melting away like the fat in a fire at a sacrifice to the gods instead of drumming his fingers menedemos suddenly snapped them i know what would bring us some moneyweve got those two lion skins no lions on kos somewhere in town therell be a temple to zeus cant go wrong with a real lionskin mantle for the gods image true sostratos smiled and youre rightwe ought to get a good price for at least one of the hides good idea thanks menedemos said now if only i could come up with eight or ten more wed be fine pity that fellow back in kaunos didnt have a leopard skin to go with the others sostratos said i know where the temple to dionysos is yes i remember going by it too on the way from ptolemaios residence down here to the harbor menedemos shrugged all we can do though is make the best of what weve got as often happened in a town of hellenes finding out where zeus temple was cost menedemos an obolos knowledge was a commodity like any other and seldom given away for nothing after hed paid out the little silver coin he was annoyed to discover that the temple lay only a couple of blocks beyond the market square it was a small building but elegant in the modern corinthian style with columns whose capitals looked like inverted bells and were ornamented with acanthus leaves pretty said sostratos who was fond of modern architecture if you like that sort of thing menedemos said it looks busy to me i like the good old doric order betterno bases to the columns and plain capitals that just go on about the business of holding up the architrave and the frieze these fancy corinthian columns he made a facethey look like a garden that wants pruning theres a difference between plain and too plain if you ask me sostratos said and doric columns are squat these corinthian ones can be taller for the same thickness they make the building more graceful more likely to fall down in an earthquake you mean menedemos said then he and sostratos both spat into the bosom of their tunics to avert the evil omen in the lands around the inner sea temblors came too often even without invitation a young priest greeted them as they came up the steps and walked into the shrine good day he said have you come to offer a sacrifice to the god no menedemos tossed his head then pointed toward the lifesized marble cult image of the king of the gods as a matter of fact weve come to adorn your statue there show him sostratos i will his cousin undid the lashing that closed the leather sack he carried he drew out the lion skin menedemos helped him spread it on the floor oh very good the priest clapped his hands id loved to see that draped over the gods shoulders but i fear im not the one with whom youll have to haggle youll need to talk with my father diogenes im diomedon by the way pleased to meet you after giving his own name menedemos went on as i said this is my cousin sostratos where is your father can you fetch him hes sacrificing at the altar behind the temple diomedon replied as soon as hes finished im sure hed be pleased to talk with you i hope you can make a bargain painting isnt enough to make the statue very impressive im afraid smiling menedemos said i think id sooner dicker with you than with your father of course diomedon smiled too you can tell im a soft touch you wont have such an easy time with him as you would with me why is your altar at the back of the sacred precinct instead of in front or inside the temple sostratos asked the other two arrangements are more common diomedon dipped his head i know they are when this temple was going upits almost sixty years ago now when this whole polis was being builtone of the priests went to zeus oracle at dodona and placing it there was part of the advice the god gave cant argue with that menedemos said sostratos looked as if he wouldnt have minded arguing about it but a glance from menedemos kept him quiet they were here to sell the priests a lion skin after all annoying or angering them wouldnt make that any easier here comes my father diomedon said the man who walked into the temple through a doorway next to the cult image was a grizzled version of diomedon himself not noticing his son or the two rhodians inside diogenes turned back to the man who had offered the sacrifice and said the god was glad to receive your offering i was glad to give it the man replied he was so tall he had to duck his head to get through that doorway menedemos nudged his cousin sostratos hadnt needed any nudging hed recognized polemaios too father diomedon called these men want to sell the temple a fine lion skin to drape over the gods shoulders do they diogenes said and then what makes it such a fine skin hearing that menedemos knew hed have a harder dicker with the older priest than he would have with his son polemaios came up through the naos in diogenes wake ah the rhodians he rumbled i might have known hail menedemos said politely you know these men sir diogenes asked antigonos nephew oh yesa pair of whipworthy rascals if ever there were any polemaios replied a nasty grin on his face but then relenting slightly he went on theyre the captain and toikharkhos who brought me here from khalkis on the sea they know their business why were you sacrificing here best one sostratos asked polemaios grin turned into a scowl on the land they want to know everybody elses business he growled and strode out of the temple a badtempered man diogenes remarked which would do for an understatement till a bigger one came along the priest gathered himself im diogenes as my son will likely have told you he waited for menedemos and sostratos to give him their names then said so youve got a lion skin do you lets have a look as theyd done for the younger priest menedemos and sostratos displayed the hide isnt it splendid father diomedon said right now i dont know whether it is or not diogenes answered what i do know is you probably just tacked an extra twenty drakhmai on to the asking price his gaze half annoyed half amused swung to menedemos didnt he sir i dont know what youre talking about menedemos said as innocently as he could diogenes snorted oh no not much you dont he bent toward the hide then tossed his head if im going to see how splendid it is i want a proper light bring it out by the gods altar fatwrapped thighbones smoked on that altar the hot metallic smell of blood still filled the air flies buzzed as a couple of temple attendants butchered polemaios sacrificial offering it was a bullock the macedonian could afford the finest menedemos said didnt he take any of the meat for himself no diogenes said he gave the whole beast would you and your cousin care for a couple of gobbets we wouldnt want it to go to waste thanks thats most generous of you like most hellenes menedemos seldom ate meat though he liked it very much smiling he said youll make me feel like one of the beefmunching heroes in the iliad he cast about for some appropriate lines and found them this is agamemnon talking remember for you are first when hearing of my feast when we akhaioi prepare a feast for the elders then you are happy to eat roast meat or drink a cup of wine sweet as honey for as long as you like but now you would happily see ten lines of akhaioi get ahead of you and fight with pitiless bronze diogenes smiled you know the poet well i should hope so menedemos said my cousin here can give you practically anything new and fancysostratos stirred at that but kept quietbut homers good enough for me he didnt mention how fond he was of the bawdy aristophanes diogenes didnt strike him as a man who would laugh at jokes about shitting oneself the priest asked what do you want for your lion skin four minai menedemos answered ill give you three diogenes said briskly they settled at three minai fifty drakhmai almost at once diogenes wagged a finger at the bemused menedemos you were expecting a long noisy haggle werent you well yes best one since you ask menedemos admitted i dont like them diogenes said nothing but a waste of time we would have come to the same place in half an hour so why not use that half hour for something else i agree sostratos said but only a few men do and so we spend a lot of time dickering some people make a game of it as if it were dice or knucklebones foolishness die priest of zeus declared menedemos dipped his head but he didnt really think diogenes was right had the priest made an opening offer of two minai and bargained hard he might have got his hide for three minai instead of three and a half hed saved time and cost himself money which was more important menedemos knew his own opinion diomedon went off to get the payment from the temples treasury when he came back with it sostratos quickly counted out the drakhmai diogenes said youre a careful man this is a fine trait in one so young thank you sir sostratos said can i have that sack to carry the coins in of course diogenes replied ill wrap up the meat in some cloth too so you wont get blood on your chiton youre very kind sostratos said having done what theyd set out to do menedemos and sostratos left the temple a tavern stood only a few doors away shall we get our meat roasted there menedemos asked he leered at his cousin if the barmaids are pretty maybe they can roast our meat too i knew you were going to say that sostratos told him you read the poet all the time do you where does homer use a line like that i didnt say homer was the only thing i read menedemos answered if diogenes wanted to take it that way thoughhe shruggedi wouldnt argue with him hes not so careful as he thinks he is sostratos said in a low voice plenty of athenian owls and turtles from aigina and other coins a lot heavier than ptolemaios standard in among the ones his son gave us by weight we made more than we did by price alone good menedemos said i was hoping that would happen to some people especially people who dont travel one drakhmas the same as another you can do pretty well for yourself if you know better he strode into the tavern sostratos followed how dyou do friends the tavernkeeper said his doric drawl so strong that even menedemos who used a similar dialect himself had to smile the fellow pointed to the cloth in which sostratos carried the meat if you boys aint been sacrificin im downright crazy want me to cook that there stuff up for you if you please menedemos answered he looked around the barmaids were plain he sighed to himself id be right glad to the taverner said and then with hardly any drawl at all he added two oboloi sostratos set the meat on the counter he spat a couple of small coins into the palm of his hand and put them beside the clothcovered gobbets here you are thank you kindly the taverner dropped the money into a cashbox he unwrapped the meat and dipped his head thatll roast just as nice as you please you dont want to eat it all by its lonesome now do you youll want to wash it down with some wine eh you boys look like you fancy the best ive got some fine khiancant get better this side of the gods ambrosia and thats a fact what that was without a doubt was a lie in a tavern like this one the proprietor would charge strangers and the naive three times as much for a local wine as he could hope to get if they knew what it really was menedemos tossed his head just a cup of your ordinary if you please he said same for me sostratos said whatever you like friends the taverner told them and dipped out two cups of some of the nastiest wine menedemos had ever drunk it was to begin with shamelessly watered but it would have tasted worse if it were stronger as it was well on the way to becoming vinegar he couldnt even throw it in the taverners face and walk out because the man had skewered the meat and set it over his fire the savory smell helped make menedemos forget the sour tang of the stuff in the cup dont leave it on the flames too long sostratos told the taverner the gods may like their portion burned black but i dont i reckon i know how to cook up a piece of meat i do the fellow said hes going to get it too done sostratos grumbled i know he will even if he does youre still ahead of the game menedemos answered it wasnt our sacrifice the tavernkeeper took the meat off the fire and put the chunks on a couple of plates which he set in front of the rhodians there you go friends enjoy it now sostratos blew on his gobbet then cut it with the knife he wore on his belt gray clear through he complained i like it pink before menedemos could answer a skinny man tapped his elbow and said thats a big chunk of meat youve got there o best one could you spare a bite for a hungry fellow meat from a sacrifice was supposed to be shared menedemos dipped his head here you go pal he cut off a strip and gave it to the man another customer came over to sostratos and said if you dont fancy the way your meats cooked sir ill help you get rid of it that made sostratos laugh he said ill bet you will but as menedemos had he gave some to the man they both ended up serving out about half the meat theyd brought into the tavern at last menedemos got to eat some he sighed at the luxurious taste and feel of hot fat in his mouth if the warriors in front of troy ate beef all the time no wonder they were so strong he thought more wine the tavernkeeper asked no thanks menedemos and sostratos said together in tones of such emphatic rejection that the tavernkeeper looked wounded menedemos only snorted either the fellow was playing for sympathy or he didnt know what slop hed just served them neither possibility impressed the rhodian who turned to his cousin and pointed to the door sostratos dipped his head they left as they headed toward the harbor sostratos said you werent sharing out drakhmai the way we shared out the meat were you no by the gods menedemos held up the leather sack diomedon had given him unopened unslit unplundered still a maiden very good sostratos made as if to applaud then gestured for menedemos to get the money out of sight as menedemos lowered the sack to his side once more sostratos went on i do wonder why polemaios was sacrificing there of course you do since he wouldnt say it is an interesting question isnt it menedemos thought for a couple of paces then suggested in thanks for getting here to kos in one piece no he would have said if it were something simple like that sostratos reply was quick and certain and you saw him on the ship you saw him when he met ptolemaios too he wouldnt waste a bullock on anything like running away he had that done to him hes a man who wants to do things himself well youre probably right menedemos said which leads to the next question what does he want to do and to whom sure enough sostratos agreed ill tell you one thing though only one menedemos said his cousin ignored that continuing ptolemaios is a lot more interested in the answer than we are precise as usual he checked himself perhaps hes not more interested in it but hes more concerned about it youre right menedemos said they went on down to the aphroditetogether sostratos sucked the flesh from the tail of a roasted prawn then tossed the piece of shell on the floor of kleiteles andron another lovely opson best one he told the rhodian proxenos on the couch next to his menedemos dipped his head your hospitality almost makes being stranded here worthwhile youre very kind my friends the oliveoil merchant said in the cage in the corner of the mens chamber his trained jackdaw hopped up and down its ladder carrying the toy shield in its beak pointing to the grayeyed bird sostratos said we feel caged ourselves youre a koan you have connections here that we dont can you find us a ships carpenter hed be well paid for his work believe me i do believe you the proxenos said but i dont think it can be done not till ptolemaios takes halikarnassos you think the city will fall then sostratos said kleiteles dipped his head dont you antigonos hasnt even tried to relieve it from what i hear most of his army is away in the east fighting whatshisnameyou know the fellow who set himself up in babylon last year seleukos sostratos said thats the name kleiteles agreed you can count on sostratos to remember such things menedemos said sostratos couldnt tell whether his cousin meant that for a sneer or a compliment hed heard both from menedemos lips kleiteles said good thing somebody can keep all these generals straight they say antigonos sent his son demetrios off to fight uh seleukos i bet he wishes he still had polemaios on his side now i dont know sostratos said you havent met polemaios have you he waited for the proxenos to toss his head then added i dont think he can be on anyones side except his own menedemos said sostratos and i find all sorts of things to argue about but hes dead right here if polemaios thinks youre in his way hell give you the fastest hardest knee in the nuts youd ever get from anybody but ptolemaios wanted him here and wanted him here badly enough to send the two of you after him kleiteles said and more of polemaios men keep coming in from euboia another two shiploads of them today in fact ptolemaios usually knows what hes doing usually sostratos agreed if hes not keeping an eye on what his new allys up to though hes not as smart as everybody says he is he he fell silent for a couple of slaves came in to clear away the supper dishes and clean up the mess on the floor you never could tell who paid slaves to listen their entrance also startled the jackdaw the shield fell out of its beak and clanked against the ladder in the cage chaka it cried spreading its wings chakachakachack its all right you stupid bird kleiteles said the jackdaw calmed when the slaves went away but screeched again when they came back with wine water a mixing bowl and cups sostratos imagined polemaios as a bird in a cage too only he wouldnt be a jackdaw hed be a hawk of some kind all beak and talons and glaring eyes if anyone tried to loose him would he do anything but fly straight at the hawkers face kleiteles dipped out a little neat wine for his guests sostratos poured a libation to dionysos and drank almost absently once the mixed winenot too strongstarted going around he did his best to bring his mind back to the andron he couldnt know what was going on inside ptolemaios residence and whatever house antigonos nephew was using he couldnt know but wished he could he suddenly noticed the rhodian proxenos eyeing him the last time we drank together you talked about gryphons as though youd seen one just the other day kleiteles said what other strange things do you know menedemos snickered now youve gone and done it he said and to the crows with you my dear cousin sostratos said which only made his dear cousin laugh out loud he thought for a bit then went on herodotos says a persian king sent some phoenicians to sail all the way around africa he says they went so far south that when they were sailing east around the bottom of it they had the sun on their left hand thats impossible the proxenos exclaimed i think so too menedemos said taking a pull at his wine he pointed an accusing finger at sostratos ill bet you believe it i dont know sostratos said if it happened at all it happened a long time ago and we all know how sailors like to make up stories but thats such an odd thing to make up you do have to wonder maybe you do menedemos said its impossible kleiteies repeated how could it be if the earth is a sphere and not flat like most people say sostratos tried to visualize it he might have done better if he hadnt been drinking wine at the end of a long day he shrugged and gave up i dont know menedemos emptied his cup set it on the table in front of him and yawned maybe its that meat we ate he said it can make you feel heavy i told my slave women to go to your bedrooms kleiteles said if youre too sleepy to enjoy them you can always send them back to the womens quarters my dear fellow menedemos exclaimed i didnt say we were dead he turned to sostratos isnt that right what sostratos wanted to do was go to sleep admitting as much would make him look less virile than menedemos he didnt want kleiteles thinking that of him even more to the point he didnt want menedemos thinking that of him his cousin would never let him live it down i should hope it is he said while he really hoped he sounded hearty enough to be convincing he must have for the rhodian proxenos chuckled indulgently and said have fun boys when i was your age i was that cockproud too he sighed he was feeling the wine even if it was well watered cant get it up as often as i used to worse luck onions menedemos said eggs mussels and crab meat sostratos added ive tried em kleiteles shrug said the sovereign remedies had done no good pepper and nettle seed sostratos suggested the proxenos looked thoughtful that might be worth a go itd be bound to heat up my mouth and my stomach so why not my vein too he used a common nickname for the prong kleiteles glanced toward sostratos and menedemos nettle seed is easy enough to come by but peppers foreign i dont suppose youve got any in your akatos do you i wish we did sostratos said he looked at menedemos pepper balsamall sorts of interesting things come out of the east we ought to think about that not this sailing season of course he added hastily next one his cousin laughed you mean you dont want to sail off for sidon and byblos tomorrow morning i cant imagine why we are going to athens sostratos said firmly if we ever find a carpenter that is he got to his feet and i am going to bed kleiteles led sostratos and menedemos back to the guest rooms good night he said he doused one of the torches burning in the courtyard in the fountain and carried the other one upstairs darkness abruptly descended sostratos had to grope for the latch to his relief a lamp was burning inside the proxenos slave woman lay on the bed waiting for him hail she said yawning you spent so long in the andron i almost fell asleep sostratos didnt want to apologize to a slave but he didnt want a quarrel either trying to avoid both he asked how are you tonight thestylis sleepy like i told you she answered but she added its nice that you remember my name and smiled at him the smile was probably mercenary still he preferred it to a scowl i dont think ill forget you he said he remembered all the women hed bedded he remembered all sorts of things but thestylis didnt need to know that her smile softened what a sweet thing to say she told him nobody ever told me anything like that before most men its just take off your clothes and bend over and they never even find out what your name is let alone remember it the light from the lamp suddenly sparkled off tears in her eyes dont cry sostratos said i didnt think somebody being kind could hurt so much she mumbled and buried her face in the cloth covering the mattress a muffled sob rose dont cry sostratos repeated he got down on the bed beside her and awkwardly patted her hair even as he did so he wondered if her tears were a ploy to pry an extra obolos or two out of him anyone who dealt with slaves had to make such calculations slaves he knew perfectly well made calculations of their own about free men she sobbed again and made as if to push him away now see what you made me do she said as if her tears were his fault maybe in a way they were if you want to go back up to the womens quarters tonight thats all right he said why not he was tired and shed be there tomorrow and so would he because he still didnt know when a ships carpenter would be able to work on the aphroditeor when menedemos would get so fed up hed have some of the sailors make repairs that might at least carry the merchant galley to another less crowded polis thestylis twisted now he could see her face and the alarm on it she tossed her head i dont dare do that she said who knows what kleiteles would do to me more tears slid down her face leaving bright tracks in the lamplight he leaned over and kissed her if shed pushed him away then he would have lain down beside her and gone to sleep but her arms went around him his hand closed on her breast through the wool of her long chiton she sighed deep in her throat and squeezed him tighter again he wondered if she really meant it but with his own excitement rising he didnt much care he reached under the hem of her tunic his hand sliding up the smooth flesh of her thigh to the secret place between her legs the flesh there was smooth too shed singed away the hair with a lamp before long her tunic and his both lay on the floor he kissed her breasts she sighed again as her nipples grew stiff to his caresses he grew stiff too and took her hand and set it on his manhood she stroked him easing his foreskin back here he said ride me like a racehorse all right she straddled him he held his erection as she impaled herself on him as she began to move he squeezed her breasts and leaned up to tease their tips with his tongue ah she said softly and moved faster at the end she threw back her head and made a little mewling cry by the way she squeezed him inside herself he thought her pleasure real his hands clutched her meaty backside as his seed shot into her she toppled down onto him all warm and soft and sweaty as he was sweaty too but then even when he might have started a second round she scrambled off took the chamber pot out from under the bed and squatted over it her legs splayed wide apart a wet plop and a muttered well thats most of it said what she was doing ill give you half a drakhma sostratos said you dont need to tell kleiteles you got it from me thank you sir thestylis said reaching for her tunic you are a kind man some people you might as well be a piece of meat for all they care about what you feel it wasnt a complaint about mens treatment of women worthy of those euripides had put in the mouths of his female characters but sounded heartfelt even so dont put the chamber pot away sostratos said after using it he put on his chiton too thestylis would be lying beside him if he wanted that second round in the morning meanwhile meanwhile he yawned and lay down no need to wrap himself in his himation on a warm summer night blow out the lamp she did then got into bed in the dark sostratos patted her yawned again and fell asleep menedemos crouched under the aphrodites poop deck mournfully eyeing the sprung planks the sailcloth stuffed between them the broken tenons the mortises that had turned into actual breaks in the timbers he cursed the blundering round ship that had run into the akatos in the rain he cursed ptolemaios too for his siege of halikarnassos and for good measure cursed every carpenter in kos when he came out from under the poop deck he didnt duck far enough and not for the first time banged his head that left him cursing life in general with some sympathy sostratos said ive done that too well of course you have menedemos thought sourly youre taller than i am and clumsier too he rubbed his head before speaking that was probably just as well for all that came out of his mouth was i know what do you think sostratos asked have you changed your mind i only wish i had menedemos answered theres too much damage for me to want to risk the ship going anywhere very far and too much for us to do the repairs ourselves resourceful odysseus made a boat starting with nothing but logs but we cant quite imitate him he stroked his chin maybe we could get up to myndos maybe sostratos tossed his head i dont think that will do us any good halikarnassos is still holding out but ptoiemaios men just took myndos which means the carpenters there will be busy working for him same as the ones here menedemos rubbed his scalp again the bump hed got wasnt the only thing making his head ache thats right sostratos said when did you hear that about myndos menedemos asked its news to me just now as a matter of fact his cousin pointed to a couple of men walking along the quay they were talking about it if you hadnt been all muffled down below you would have heard them too with a sigh menedemos said well lets gather up our perfumes and such and head for the market square maybe well do enough business to break even maybe sostratos didnt sound as if he believed it for that matter meneclemos didnt believe it either sostratos put the best face on things he could the more we sell the less we lose even if we dont break even to menedemos surprise they promptly sold four jars of perfume to a fellow with his right arm bandaged and in a sling he had scarred shins too and a scar seaming his chin and was missing the lobe of his left ear ive got to keep my hetaira sweet on me he said youve got to give em presents or they forget all about you and how was i supposed to give her presents when i was sitting in a tent in front of halikarnassos you werent sitting in a tent all the time menedemos pointed to the soldiers wounded arm no and im almost not sorry i got hurt you know what i mean the fellow said menedemos dipped his head though he thought whether you know it or not you mean that hetairas got her hooks into you deep he recognized the symptoms from experience the soldier went on now that im back here at least she cant forget im alive sostratos pointed to his arm too how did it happen one of those things the scarred man said with a shrug we tried scaling ladders i was moving up towards one of em when i got shot mightve been just as well too on account of i heard later they tipped that ladder over with a bunch of men on it if id been near the top he grimaced its a long fall have you got any idea how much longer the siege will take menedemos asked not me best one the soldier tossed his head were liable to still be at it by the time this healshe wiggled the fingers sticking out of the bandageand ive got to go back to work that place has strong walls and you might think old oneeyes men in there were all citizens by the way theyre fighting menedemos grunted that was exactly what he didnt want to hear ptolemaios mercenary took the perfume and left the agora he wasnt worried about the sieges going on forever he just wanted to enjoy the holiday his wound had given him menedemos wished he could take such a bright view of things himself a juggler strolled past keeping a fountain of six or eight knives and cups and leather balls in the air someone tossed him a coin he caught it and popped it into his mouth without missing a beat menedemos was fond of such shows most days he would have thrown the fellow an obolos too today he let the juggler go by unrewarded the man shot him a reproachful look he stared stonily back with news like that which hed just got he felt he needed to hang on to every bit of silver he had sostratos said not myndos then maybe kalymnos its not much farther or we could go back to knidos and use the wind instead of our rowers i get more tempted with every day that goes by menedemos admitted we did make it back here from the middle of the strait between kalymnos and the mainland so i suppose we have a good chance of getting away with one more trip but even so he scowled i dont like to take the chance youre the captain his cousin said i suppose i ought to be grateful youre more careful at sea than you are on land ha menedemos said in a hollow voice sostratos often twitted him harder than that he raised his voice perfume from fine rhodian roses balsam from engedimakes a fine medicine or a wonderful incense best quality ink crimson dye he and sostratos sold some ink and some balsam by the time the sun sank toward the western horizon they sold some more perfume too and a smalltime silk merchant bought some of their dye they didnt come close to making the mina and a half their crew cost them every day as they walked back toward the harbor sostratos said i hope we wont have to start selling the silk we bought from pixodaros wed better not menedemos said the only way we can unload it here where they make it is to sell at a loss weve been over that road before dont remind me sostratos said but if we have to get silver to keep the sailors paid he kicked at the dirt nothing new here diokles said when they came aboard the aphrodite but then the oarmaster tossed his head no i take that back one of ptolemaios fives limped back into the harbor a good cubit and a half lower in the water than she should have been menedemos cursed one more thing to keep the stinking carpenters busy he turned to sostratos i wish wed gone straight up to the proxenos house thats the kind of news i didnt want to hear cant be helped my dear his cousin answered it would have happened whether we heard about it or not that was true but did little to console menedemos he took a couple of steps toward the gangplank to head back into the city with the last of the light when diokles said somebodys coming this waycoming in a hurry too by the dog of egypt sostratos exclaimed thats polemaios the big man trotted up the quay toward the akatos he paused halfway there to look back over his shoulder as if fearing pursuit seeing none he hurried on hail menedemos he said panting you must take me away from here and quickly what menedemos said startled why antigonos nephew scowled ill tell you why that whoremaster of a ptolemaios thinks ive been spreading silver around to some of his officers to turn em against him and towards me thats why all lies of course he added after a couple of damning heartbeats of course menedemos said not believing him for a moment will you get me out of this place polemaios demanded by the gods ill pay my fare and more name your price ill meet it ill drown you in drakhmai so long as you get me out of that old bastards reach ever so slightly sostratos tossed his head here menedemos didnt need his cousins advice he said im sorry best one but were laid up ourselves a polluted round ship rammed us and were stillwaiting for repairs if we leave the harbor were liable to sink before weve gone even a stadion that exaggerated things but polemaios wouldnt know it with a wave menedemos went on besides you can see for yourself that most of my crews not aboard how could i hope to sail polemaios growled deep in his chest the sound a desperate hunted animal might make he looked back toward the center of town again then howled out a curse for a squad of hoplites approached at a quick march hide me he said and then too late theyve seen me he yanked his sword from its scabbard the soldiers wore helmets and corselets some of bronze others of linen they carried shields and long spears they could have made quick work of the unarmored macedonian but their leader an officer with a crimsondyed crest nodding above his helm politely dipped his head to polemaios what point to fighting most noble one he said why dont you come along with us till this misunderstanding is sorted out menedemos thought polemaios would make them kill him but the big man grabbed hope like a drowning man seizing a spar let it be as you say he said and sheathed the sword again at a word from the officer the ruler of egypts soldiers surrounded him then the captain eyed menedemos and sostratos why dont you rhodians come along with us too so we can find out just what exactly was going on here he phrased it as a request but it was an order and menedemos knew it he walked up the gangplank sostratos behind him the truth lay on their side but would ptolemaios believe it ptolemaios looked searchingly from sostratos to menedemos and back again sostratos did his best to look back without flinching hed thought some flunky of ptolemaios would question them he hadnt expected to be brought before the ruler of egypt himself so ptolemaios rasped you say you werent dickering over the price you wanted for getting him out of my reach thats right sir sostratos answered besides even if wed wanted towhich we didnt as my cousin and i have told you over and overwe couldnt have gone anywhere with polemaios a torch behind ptolemaios head crackled the sun had set but torches and lamps made the andron of the ruler of egypts residence almost as bright as day ptolemaios leaned forward thrusting his bluntfeatured strongchinned face toward the two rhodians why not he said because weve got sprung planking thats why not menedemos exclaimed his temper slipping if you dont believe us ask any of your carpenters weve been screaming a them for most of a month now but they wont give us the time of daytheyre too busy with your polluted ships to care a fig about ours sostratos feared his cousin had spoken too boldly ptolemaios though only dipped his head remarking you say whats on your mind dont you yes sir menedemos answered if we could have got our ship repaired we would have been long gone from here and then you wouldnt be wondering if we were plotting with antigonos nephew suppose i ask my shipwrights if youve been coming by ptolemaios said by the dog of egypt go ahead menedemos burst out again sostratos wondered whether he should have used that particular oath to the ruler of egypt menedemos went on your men will tell you weve been in their hair like lice heh ptolemaios scratched reminiscently ive been lousy a time or twomore than a time or two t hate those little bastards he called for one of his mena soldier not a servitorand spoke to him in a low voice the fellow dipped his head he hurried away ptolemaios went on well see if youre telling the truth if the rhodians hadnt been that would have alarmed them as things were menedemos said only fine whats going to happen to polemaios now sostratos asked that being what was uppermost in his mind ptolemaios scowled that son of a whore was trying to win over my officers with sweet talk and bribes i took him in a stray dog and he used me so ill give him no bites at all only a sip he drinks hemlock tomorrow he laid the full weight of his formidable stare on sostratos and what do you think of that may i watch sir sostratos blurted what ptolemaios blinked whatever sort of answer hed expected that wasnt it he stared more grimly than ever why sostratos wished hed thought more before speaking he answered as best he could because i studied at the lykeion in athens and ive talked with men from the academy the school platon founded and ive read platons tale of how sokrates died id like to see it for myself if i could ive read the phaidon too ptolemaios said which surprised sostratos in turn the ruler of egypt looked like a warrior not a man whod studied philosophy and ptolemaios surprised him all over again by continuing that man wrote like a god yyes sostratos stammered his amazement came not because he disagreed but because bluff ptolemaios was voicing such art opinion going on in the same vein the macedonian marshal sighed and said i wish i would have met him i was nineteen or twenty when he died but i didnt get down to athens till later till after the battle of khaironeia sostratos realized he meant after philip of macedon crushed athens as a power he eyed the ruler of egypt khaironeia had been fought three years before he himself was born so much had happened sincealexanders astonishing career and the wars of his successorsthat seeing a man whod fought there seemed a surprise too hes only a few years older than my father sostratos reminded himself but ptolemaios had been so many places done so much ptolemaios thoughts had traveled down a different road he shook a forefinger at sostratos and said i warn you its not as neat as platon tells it sir lost in his own musings sostratos had dropped the thread of the conversation hemlock ptolemaios said are you sure you want to see it oh sostratos said and then after some thought yes yes i am id like to know what sokrates went through ah ptolemaios said i can understand that it may be foolishness but i can understand it all right young fellow im keeping antigonos nephew in the house next door to this one you be here early tomorrow morning and youll see what you want to see but dont dawdle my men wont wait bargain bargain sostratos said at once thank you sir dont thank me not till after you know what you talked yourself into ptolemaios turned to menedemos what about you do you want to watch polemaios die too menedemos tossed his head not me what i want is a carpenter as if on cue the man ptolemaios had sent out came back into the andron well the ruler of egypt barked at him your excellency the man replied the shipwrights all say these rhodians have been clinging to them like leeches in a swamp oh they do do they ptolemaios rumbled his messenger dipped his head the marshal pointed at menedemos youll have your woodworker tomorrow you can keep an eye on him instead of on polemaios thank you very much menedemos said i think thats a better bargain you and your cousin both want to see things for yourselves ptolemaios said you just want to see different things thats all he gestured toward the doorway of the andron go on get out of here ive wasted too much time on you may we beg a torch to light our way back to the ship sostratos asked take one from the courtyard ptolemaios gestured again even more imperiously than before sostratos retreated his cousin on his heels outside a little twilight still lingered enough with the torch to help the rhodians find their way as soon as they were well away from ptolemaios residence menedemos burst out are you out of your mind what as sostratos tossed his head he stepped in something damp and nasty he scrapped his foot in the dirt to clean it no just curious ptolemaios understood that he understood it better than i thought he would he understood it wouldnt cost him anything to humor a zany menedemos said sostratos tossed his head again no i dont believe thats what he was thinking hes read platon himself i never would have guessed that of a macedonian even if aristoteles did teach alexander his cousin walked along for a couple of paces before saying well maybe it worked out for the best you did convince him we werent plotting with polemaios andmenedemos did a couple of dance steps his shadow swooping wildly in the torchlightwell get the aphroditefixed up thats good sostratos agreed thats very good well finally be able to press on towards athens toward miletos first menedemos said as they started up the quay sostratos swallowed a sigh gods be praised diokles said when they came aboard the merchant galley once more when the soldiers took you away i didnt know what would happen next as a matter of fact neither did we sostratos said its all right though its better than all right menedemos added we get a carpenter tomorrow u euge diokles exclaimed then he asked what does polemaios get something to drink sostratos answered he wont be thirsty afterwards either something to oh the oarmaster didnt need long to figure that out well cant say im surprised you play those games and lose you pay just so sostratos said and waited for menedemos to tell diokles and the handful of sailors aboard the merchant galley what hed be doing in the morning but menedemos said only kleiteles will be wondering what happened to us ill have to send someone over there tomorrow and let him know i wouldnt have minded another round or two with his slave woman either he shrugged well itll be a hard deck tonight not a soft bed and a wench cant be helped i suppose he lay down on the planking as calmly as if there were no such things as beds or women within a thousand stadia diokles went forward to sleep sitting on a rowers bench and leaning against the planking as he always did when aboard ship sostratos took off his chiton folded it up for a pillow and lay down beside menedemos wrapping a himation around himself for warmth good night my dear he murmured good night his cousin answered youd better not sleep late tomorrow or youll miss your big chance he meant it sarcastically which didnt mean he was wrong sostratos said you usually wake before i do give me a shake if im still sleeping all right though why youd want to watch such a thing menedemos said no more but rolled onto his side with his back to sostratos in a few minutes he was snoring sostratos stayed awake a little longer but not much next thing he knew menedemos prodding hand was on his shoulder the sun hadnt risen sostratos needed a moment to remember why his cousin was getting him up so early when he did he stopped the feeble complaints hed been making and said thank you i know what needs doing now he gulped bread and cheese and wine threw on his tunic and hurried into the city of kos when he got to the street on which ptolemaios was staying he had no trouble figuring out which of the houses next door to the ruler of egypts residence held antigonos nephew that one had more soldiers guarding it than did ptolemaios house itself how many of polemaios men had come from khalkis to kos enough to leave ptolemaios nervous however calm things seemed at the moment sostratos gave his name to one of the guards in front of the door tell me who your father is too the fellow said when sostratos did the soldier dipped his head all right you are who you say you are he rapped on the door open up in there that rhodians here the man who did open the door was another soldier not a house slave come along with me he said briskly and led sostratos to the andron the courtyard was also full of armed men the soldiers in the andron were older and looked to be of higher rank ptolemaios witnesses sostratos thought one chair among them remained empty sostratos escort waved him into it he tossed his head in bemusement as he sat down the ruler of egypt thought of everything polemaios strode into the andron a few minutes later he wasnt bound or fettered and the soldiers flanking him looked very alert a supper couch with a small table beside it waited for him as he reclined on the couch he glared at the men whod come to see him die to the crows with all of you he said harshly and then catching sight of sostratos one more vulture waiting for my carrion eh before sostratos could find any words a man brought in a plain earthenware cup and set it on the table he started to slip out of the room wait polemaios said have i got enough here to pour out a libation before i drink with a start sostratos recalled that sokrates had asked the same question his gaoler had said no this fellow dipped his head go on if you care to theres enough in there to do in an elephant taking no chances eh antigonos nephew said not without pride he lifted the cup and spilled out a few drops as if he were offering a little wine to dionysos then he drank the poison down as he lowered the cup he made a horrible face oh by the gods thats vile stuff youd never catch me drinking it more than once euge bravely done murmured the officer sitting next to sostratos the khodian was inclined to agree polemaios might have earned every bit of what he was getting but that didnt mean he wasnt dying well and he hadnt quite finished he splashed some of the dregs from the cup onto the floor of the andron saying this for ptolemaios the beautiful he might have been playing kottabos and praising a pretty boy a couple of ptolemaios officers laughed out loud their master was a great many things most of them praiseworthy but hardly beautiful in his own blocky way sostratos thought he must have made as unlovely a youth as i did polemaios glared at the fellow whod fetched in the hemlock i dont feel anything he said what do i do now walk around till your legs get heavy if you like the man answered then just lie down it will work antigonos nephew muttered something nasty under his breath he stumped around the andron the soldiers watched him closely their spears at the ready he had nothing left to lose now who could guess what he might do he caught them watching and twisted his fingers into an obscene gesture back and forth back and forth strode polemaios the whole business took longer than sostratos had thought it would hed got the impression from the phaidon that sokrates had died fairly fast but sokrates had been old and of no more than average size polemaios was a huge bear of a man and in the prime of life maybe that was why the drug needed longer to work on him most of an hour had gone by before he grunted and said i cant feel my feet he looked pale sweat beaded his forehead sostratos looked around for the man whod brought the deadly dose but the fellow had left the andron one of ptolemaios officers said you can probably lie down now right moving with some difficulty polemaios made his way over to the couch as he eased himself down onto it he said before i came in here that son of a whore told me the drug wouldnt hurt one more lie what does it feel like sostratos asked drink some yourself and find out you nosy bastard polemaios said but then he went on feels like my legs are on fire and my belly too and im going to he leaned over the side of the couch and was noisily sick besides the usual sharp stink of vomit the air held an acrid tang sostratos had never smelled beforethe odor of hemlock he realized the officer sitting next to him waved to one of the soldiers and said go fetch the man who brought the drug find out if puking it up will save polemaios if it does he slashed his thumb across his throat the soldier hurried away but when the poisoner came back he said no its too late now he may take a little longer but hes still a dead man with hemlock you need to heave it up right away to have any chance of coming through polemaios vomited again half an hour later he cursed ptolemaios and also all the men who were watching him die sostratos spat into the bosom of his chiton to turn aside the omen he wasnt the only one either cold antigonos nephew moaned so cold and its getting dark he paused then tossed his head it cant be so late in the day already the cursed drug must be stealing my sight despite the ravages the hemlock worked on his body his mind stayed clear sostratos would have preferred delirium after a while polemaios fouled himself adding one more stench to the air in the andron the man whod given him the hemlock came up to him and said im going to feel of you to find out how far the drug has gone go ahead polemaios answered i cant feel any of myself down past my middle anymore the poisoner probed at his groin and belly your bodys cold up to your navel when it gets to your chest that will be the end because your heart will stop and you wont be able to breathe i wish it would hurry up the big macedonian said i dont want to go on lying here smelling like ptolemaios even as death advanced on him he had the spirit to revile the man who was its author but the ruler of egypt had had the right of it too in the phaidon platon had surely cleaned up the way sokrates perished not wanting to present his beloved teacher in an unflattering light polemaios began fighting for air each breath coming harder than the one before furies takeall of youand especiallyptolemaios he said forcing the words out in little bursts with ever increasing effort he took a few more breaths and then after one last soft sigh breathed no more the man whod given him the drug took hold of his wrist feeling for a pulse like a physician when the fellow let go polemaios arm flopped down limply the poisoner dipped his head to his audience its over best ones about time too grumbled the officer next to sostratos he got to his feet and stretched i really have to piss another officer said remember weve got to mix his men in amongst our own so there arent enough of em in any one place to give us trouble that struck sostratos as a good idea and very much the sort of thing ptolemaios would think of yet another officer said as long as we pay em on time they shouldnt cause too many problems mercenaries worry about what they get first and everything else afterwards he added lets get out of here this place stinks sostratos was glad to breathe fresh air out in the courtyard too his shadow puddled at his feet it was close to noon he hadnt realized hed been in the andron so long several slaves went into the room they came out carrying polemaios corpse sostratos wondered whether whoever owned this place knew it had just been used for an execution were the house his own it wouldnt have been just a matter of making it ritually clean once more even after that he wouldnt have cared to hold a symposion say in the chamber where a man had been put to death fortunately that wasnt his worry he wouldnt see this place again and he was glad of it a soldier politely opened the door for him when he stepped out into the street a guard asked did you find out what you wanted to know how am i supposed to answer that i was curious about how hemlock works but did i really want to watch a man die finding no way to separate the one from the other sostratos sighed and said i suppose i did he hurried away before the guard could find any other questions he didnt care to think about when he got back to the harbor menedemos hailed him with its over eh sostratos dipped his head his cousin went on how did he do as well as he could sostratos answered ptolemaios was right its an uglier business than platon made it out to be he could change the subject here could and did hows the aphroditedoing before menedemos could answer the sound of a man pounding on something with a mallet came from under the poop deck sostratos cousin beamed thats nikagoras he said he got here just after you went into the polis and hes been banging away like talos the bronze man ever since he raised his voice oë nikagoras come out for a cup of wine and say hello to my cousin more banging and then someonepresumably nikagorasspoke from below let me finish driving this treenail home after that im your man the banging resumed hes already joining the timbers is he sostratos was impressed he does know his business i heard that i should hope i do nikagoras said after still more banging he grunted there thatll hold the son of a whore best part of it is ptolemaios is paying for him too menedemos said that is good news sostratos agreed being laid up here has cost us too much already he lowered his voice maybe hes grateful we didnt sail away with andgonos nephew maybe menedemos also spoke quietly to the crows with me if i know where we would have taken him though even if wed wanted to take him anywhere sostratos dipped his head a point polemaios had made enemies of all the macedonian marshals except lysimakhos up in thrace and seleukos in the distant east and no doubt the only reason he hadnt fallen foul of them too was that he hadnt had much to do with them nikagoras came up the stairs and onto the poop deck he was in his early forties naked as a sailor with broad shoulders powerful arms and scarred gnarled hands hail he said to sostratos and wiped the back of one hand across his sweaty forehead hail sostratos said sounds as though youre making good progress sure am nikagoras said thanks he told menedemos whod given him the promised wine he spilled a feu drops onto the deck drank and then gave his attention back to sostratos after all the battle damage ive repaired lately this is almost like a holiday for me i hadnt thought of it like that sostratos said you would have if you were in my line of work the carpenter told him rams are bad enough thats collision damage too like what you took only worse on account of a rams going fast and the fins concentrate where it hits but if you think thats rough you ought to try patching up a ship thats had a couplethree thirtymina stones smack into her right about at the waterline bad sostratos asked worse nikagoras said sometimes it seems like you end up taking out half the planks and replacing them and naturally the captains screaming at you that hes got to get back into the fight as fast as he can and that everythingll be buggered forever if you dont get him fixed up right away you want to drown bigmouthed bastards like that by the godsthey think youre too cursed stupid to figure things out for yourself im just glad youre finally here menedemos said its taken a month of screaming at people to get a carpenter at all of course the aphrodites no warship no but you can fight if you have to and nikagoras said shrewdly a lot of the time being able to fight means you dont have to doesnt it thats right sostratos said youre a man who sees how things work i try the carpenter said and thats a game i know myself i havent been in a brawl in close to twenty years now on account of i look like im tough he made a fist then grinned maybe i am maybe im not but nobody wants to find out the hard way fair enough sostratos said men seldom wanted to brawl with him either because he was well above average size he knew perfectly well that he wasnt particularly tough but that wasnt obvious from looking at him nikagoras gulped the rest of the wine wiped his mouth and set down the cup thank you kindly best one that hit the spot he told menedemos and then disappeared under the poop deck once more a moment later he started banging away with the mallet again a good man sostratos said i wonder if you could persuade him to go to sea his cousin laughed my dear youre reading my mind i asked him that very thing but he said i repair ships for a living dyou think id be daft enough to want to travel on one when i know what all can happen to them hmm sostratos plucked at his beard what does that say about us menedemos laughed again nothing good im certain come on you lazy whoresons diokles called to the aphroditesrowers put your backs into it and your arms too do you still remember how to pull an oar rhyppapai rhyppapai a couple of men groaned as they stroked listening to them menedemos could tell how much the unnatural layoff had cost them as a crew well have plenty of sore muscles tonight he predicted as the aphroditeglided out of kos harbor that we will the keleustes agreed blistered hands too same as we do when we start out in the spring if theyll rub oil on their hands as soon as they start getting raw they wont blister so much sostratos said not a bad notion diokles agreed smiting his bronze square to give the rowers their stroke id do that myself every now and again when i pulled an oar and i did enough rowing to make my palms hard as horn menedemos kept the merchant galley close to the coast of kos across the channel ptolemaios ships and soldiers still laid siege to halikarnassos stopping up a harbor tight as a wine jar wasnt easy though every so often one or two of antigonos war galleys would slip out and sink or capture any ships they could catch menedemos didnt want to make things easy for them he glanced over to his cousin oë sostratos theres history going on just a few stadia away well so there is sostratos said but its not going on very fast is it i dont think ill miss much if i look northwest instead of northeast look towards athens he meant menedemos said were not there yet and were not going there yet either why dont you look due north instead thats where miletos lies near enough we need the money well make there too i know sostratos said every word you say is true i understand that but i have a hard time caring youd better not menedemos warned him when we trade there well have to haggle extra hard squeeze all the silver we can out of the merchants if youre mooning over that miserable gryphons skull you wont do us any good i know sostratos said again but his gaze went back to the rowers bench under which the skull was stowed a lovers gaze might have gone to his beloved in the same way a lovers gaze would have been no more tender either me ill be glad when we get to athens just so were rid of the miserable ugly thing menedemos said anything you can learn from is beautiful his cousin said stiffly when i want beauty ill find it in a girls flesh not a gryphons bone menedemos said theres beauty of the flesh and then theres beauty of the mind sostratos said the gryphons skull has none of the one but thinking about it may lead those who love wisdom to the other after a few heartbeats menedemos tossed his head im afraid thats beyond me my dear nothing you say can make that bone seem anything but ugly to me let it go then sostratos said somewhat to menedemos surprise when his cousin felt philosophical he was often inclined to lecture a moment later sostratos explained himself ive got platon and sokrates on my mind thats all why menedemos asked before sostratos could he answered his own question oh hemlock of course thats right sostratos said theres a good deal of talk about the relationship between physical beauty and real love in the symposion is there well thats more interesting than philosophy usually gets scoffer scoffer menedemos assumed a hurt expression now youve gone and got me interested and you complain im scoffing what does sokrates have to say about it or should i ask what does platon have to say thats a good question sostratos said thoughtfully theres probably no one left alive who can say how much of what platon put in sokrates mouth really belongs there and how much comes from the younger man dont get sidetracked menedemos told him what does beauty have to do with real love thats a lot more interesting than who wrote what you were the one who brought it up but never mind sostratos said if you follow the argument in the symposion not a great deal physical beauty leads you on toward beauty of the mind and thats where real love lies sounds like an old mans argument to me menedemos said if your prick wont stand you talk about the beauty of the mind so you dont have to fret yourself about it you are a scoffer sostratos said and then i just had a nasty thought whats that do we dare put in at miletos we spent all that time stuck in kos when we hadnt planned to by now news that we brought polemaios there will have spread all over the place antigonos men may want to roast us over a slow fire i know you youre still looking for an excuse to head straight for athens menedemos said that one wont do though remember demetrios of phaleron is kassandros puppet and kassandros wont be happy to find out polemaios got loose either he suddenly grinned besides its not a worry anymore why not sostratos asked ill tell you why not suppose they blame us for letting polemaios get loose so he can plague his uncle what do we say we say well o marvelous one you dont need to lose any sleep about that because we watched polemaios die they wont be angry at us for that newstheyll be glad to hear it his cousin looked sheepish youre right youre absolutely right of course i cant think of anybody who wouldnt be glad to hear polemaios was dead neither can i menedemos said he made himself loved as much for his mind as for his beauty didnt he sostratos started just to dip his head but broke out laughing with the motion half done youre not just a scoffer youre a dangerous scoffer i think youd make sokrates choke on his wine no nosokrates choked down his hemlock the same as polemaios did menedemos replied he and sostratos kept on chaffing each other as the aphroditesailed north and west through the strait between the anatolian mainland and the island of kalymnos this time the akatos had fine weather for the journey one of ptolemaios war galleys came out from the newly captured town of myndos to look her over but turned back on recognizing what ship it was i remember you an officer aboard the five called to menedemos youre the fellow who brought whatshisnameantigonos nephewback to kos thats right menedemos answered lifting a hand from the steeringoar tillers to wave to the war galley after the five swung away toward the east sostratos said you didnt tell him whatshisname was dead i certainly didnt menedemos said he would have wasted an hour of our time asking questions and we havent got an hour to spare not if we want to make miletos by sundown youre not the only one who can be in a hurry to get where were going you know not long after the war galley came out from the mainland the aphroditepassed a sponge boat most likely from kalymnos which had a lot of sponge divers a trident in his right hand to free sponges from the ocean floor and a large stone clutched to his chest to make him sink quickly a diver leaped off the stern of the boat and splashed into the blue water he came up again a couple of minutes later hanging on to black sponges of varying sizes the other men on the boat took the sponges from him and hauled him aboard again naked and dripping he waved to the aphrodite from his station at an oar moskhion said this is what i was talking about when we fothered the sailcloth over the planks gods know id rather be here than over there doing that i believe you menedemos said as he had to the men on ptolemaios five he did wave back he doesnt think were pirates anyhow either that or he knows theres nothing worth stealing on his boat i wouldnt want his sponges thats certain sostratos said they dont look like the ones youd use in a fine bathhouse of course they dont moskhion said they havent been cleaned and dried yet sponge diving is as hard a way to make a living as any other kind of fishing menedemos said harder moskhion said with conviction believe meharder when you get right down to it theres no easy way to make a living sostratos said id rather be doing this than that menedemos said sostratos and moskhion both dipped their heads in agreement menedemos went on easy work nowwouldnt you like to be a sophist and make speeches in the market square for money by the dog of egypt i would moskhion said it cant be that easy sostratos said if it were more men would be able to make a living at it most of the ones who try fail you know you need to be able to think on your feet and people have to want to listen to you otherwise you go hungry menedemos hadnt thought about that sostratos had a way of reminding him of things he hadnt thought of maybe youre right menedemos allowed it must be something like being an actor not so easy as acting id say his cousin answered a sophist hasnt got a mask to hide behind the way an actor does a goodsized wave slapped the merchant galleys bow and then another and another making her pitch up and down and were coming out into the ikarian sea menedemos said which means we havent got any more islands to hide behind well be bouncing like a toy boat in a little boys hip bath all the way up to miletos this is one of the roughest stretches of the aegean i know sostratos gulped and looked faintly green i had my sea legs but i may have lost them in the layover at kos he wasnt the only one a couple of sailors leaned out over the rail and heaved up their guts too maybe they wouldnt have done it if they hadnt drunk deep in kos the night before but maybe like sostratos theyd just spent too much time ashore to menedemos relief the aphroditedid make miletos by nightfall he wouldnt have cared to spend a night at sea in such rough waters and a wind might have blown up to make things worse still tying up at a quay as the sun went down made him much happier about the world the milesians who made the ship fast to the quay chattered away amongst themselves in the towns ionic dialect when one of antigonos officers strutted up to ask his questions the harbor workers fell silent and flinched away like beaten children a generation before miletos had tried to hold out alexanders soldiers and been sacked for its effort these days the locals gave their occupiers no trouble from kos eh the officer said menedemos hadnt dared lie about that not when the akatos carried so much silk bristles rasped under the officers fingers as he rubbed his chin in thought at last he asked while you were there did you hear anything about antigonos nephew joining forces with that ugly toad of a ptolemaios oh good menedemos thought he has no idea were the ones who brought polemaios to kos that makes things a lot easier aloud he answered yes polemaios was there while we were but your master doesnt have to worry about him anymore what why not the man demanded because hes dead menedemos replied he tried to bring some of ptolemaios officers over to his own cause ptolemaios caught him at it and made him drink hemlock im sure the news is trueit was all over kos when we left this morning that seemed preferable to telling the officer sostratos had watched polemaios die if the fellow believed him he mightprobably wouldwonder how sostratos had gained that privilege as things were the officers jaw dropped thats wonderful news if its so are you certain of it i didnt see his body menedemos answered truthfully but i dont see why ptolemaios would lie about something like that a lie would only make the soldiers who came along with antigonos nephew want to riot dont you think after a little thought the officer dipped his head when he grinned a scar on one cheek that menedemos hadnt noticed till then pulled the expression out of shape youre right by the gods this has to go straight to antigonos hes up by the hellespont setting things to rights there you might want to stay in port here for a while i wouldnt be surprised if he gave you a reward for the news sostratos looked like a man whod just taken a knife in the back menedemos spoke to the officer best one if i were sure of that i would stay but look at the size of my crew i dont know that i can afford to linger just on the hope of a rewardi have to pay them any which way thats a problem antigonos man admitted youll have to do what you think best then menedemos was tempted to linger old oneeye might be very glad indeed to learn that his unpleasant nephew wouldnt bother him anymore with or without the help of ptolemaios but hed meant what he said the aphrodites crew was expensive if he waited half a month hed go through half a talent of silver sounding like someone whod just had a reprieve sostratos asked the officer whats the news here not much right here the fellow said though some from hellas came in the other day tell us menedemos spoke as quickly as his cousin well the officer went on with the smug smile of someone who knows something his listeners do not you may have heard tell of the youth called herakles alexanders bastard son by barsine oh yes menedemos dipped his head the one who got out of pergamon last year and went across to polyperkhon to help him drive kassandros mad in macedonia thats right antigonos officer said at the same time as sostratos spoke out of the side of his mouth this herakles likely isnt alexanders get at all but a tool of antigonos against kassandros i know shut up menedemos hissed to him before asking the officer what about this youth hes dead thats what the officer answered dead as polemaios if what you say about him is true kassandros persuaded polyperkhon that alexanders kin were too dangerous to leave running around loose and so he drew a finger across his throat they say polyperkhon got land in macedonia for it and soldiers to help him fight down in the peloponnesos kassandros doesnt want any folk of alexanders blood left alive because they weaken his hold on macedonia sostratos said hes just a general they could call themselves kings thats true menedemos said look how he got rid of alexanders legitimate son alexandras winter before lastand roxane the boys mother too sure enough you cant trust kassandros antigonos officer declared he started hack up the quay im off to tell my superiors of your news like i say you can be sure theyll be glad to hear it he hurried away you cant trust kassandros sostratos echoed irony in his voice you cant trust any of the macedonian marshals and they all want to see alexanders kin dead no doubt youre right menedemos said but its still news it hadnt got to kos yet i dont think theres even a bastard pretender from alexanders line left alive now sostratos said his sister kleopatras still up in sardis isnt she menedemos asked by the gods youre right id forgotten about kleopatra sostratos looked annoyed at himself as he often did when he forgot something like that the smile following his annoyed expression wasnt one menedemos would have wanted aimed at him i wonder how long shell last sostratos added like kaunos miletos was an old city one with streets wandering wherever they would sostratos had to pay out not one obolos but two to find his way to the market square in the middle of town he feared he would need to pay for directions back to the harbor too hed got so turned around he had to keep looking at the sun to know which direction was which in the agora hawkers cried the produce of the rich anatolian countryside onions and garlic and olives and raisins and wine potters and tinkers and leatherworkers and wool dealers added to the din so did the fellow who walked through the square with a brazier shouting fresh squid sostratos bought a couple of them he burned his fingers and his mouth on the hot oily flesh but didnt care they were delicious after hed gulped them down he started doing some shouting of his own fine silk from kos miletos being only a days sail from the island he hadnt expected too much in the way of business hed assumed most milesians who wanted silk would have gone down to kos and bought it for themselves as soon as he opened his mouth he saw hed made a mistake for he started selling the stuff as if it had never before appeared in this polis and that it seemed was not so far from the truth thank you so much for fetching some at last said a tailor who bought several bolts no one from kos has been here for a while and no one from our town wanted to go down there you know how it is well no as a matter of fact sostratos said oh but my dear fellow you must the tailor said when sostratos still looked blank the fellow let out an exasperated sigh and condescended to explain if we go down to kos or men from there come hither whats likely to happen antigonos officers will say were spying for ptolemaios or else the other way round thats what silks all very fine but its not worth a visit to the torturer i see sostratos said in a small voice and so he did once the milesian pointed it out to him this is what i get for living in a free and autonomous polis that really is both he thought such things dont occur to me these lands are subject to the marshals who rule them and if the marshals become enemies so do the lands no matter what most of the people want to someone from an independent democracy the notion was absurd but that made it no less real hereabouts silver came clinking in from one customer after another when sostratos saw how eager the locals were to buy he raised the price that didnt keep him from running low on silk before noon he sent a couple of sailors back to the aphroditeto bring more to the market square not long after they returned menedemos stopped by he looked as happy and as sated as a fox in a henhouse you must have spent part of your morning in a brothel sostratos said when his cousin tossed his head alarm shot through him dont tell me you found a friendly wife so quick remember friendly wives have unfriendly husbands no whores no wivesno women at all menedemos answered seeing sostratos dubious expression he went on ill take oath by any god you care to name no ive been meeting jewelers he leaned forward and spoke the last word in a conspiratorial whisper jewelers sostratos echoed for a moment he couldnt imagine why menedemos might be interested in talking with them then he did and felt foolish oh the emeralds he also dropped his voice for the last word thats right menedemos said this isnt kos i can sell them here without worrying about ptolemaios as a matter of fact people here are all the more eager to buy just for the sake of giving ptolemaios a black eye but if ptolemaios ruled miletos they would or some of them wouldinform on you for smuggling sostratos thoughtthe other side of the coin to his earlier reflections thinking of coins made him ask how much are you getting my dear theyre fighting with one another for the chance to get their hands on my little green stones menedemos said i sold two mediumgood onesnot the finest mind youfor ten minai by the dog of egypt sostratos exclaimedthe right oath for gems coming out of ptolemaios realm thats almost twice what we paid for the lot of them i know menedemos said happily and once the fellows who didnt buy take a look at the stones and decide they have to have some too we really may clear more than a talent from them who can buy from the jewelers at such prices though sostratos asked are there that many rich milesians i dont think so his cousin answered but antigonos has plenty of rich officers ah sostratos said thats true and theyll have wives for whom theyll want rings or pendantsor else hetairai to whom theyll have to give presents menedemos dipped his head youre beginning to understand at another time his sarcastic tone would have irked sostratos his thoughts were elsewhere now he wished he had a counting board but managed well enough without one along with his fine memory hed always had a knack for mental arithmetic when he came out of his study he found menedemos looking at him oddly hed seen that particular expression on his cousins face once or twice before a little sheepishly he asked how long was i away not very long menedemos answered but i said something to you and you never heard me what were you thinking about so hard money sostratos said a word that was enough to seize menedemos attention by itself if you can bring in a talent or so for those emeralds and if i keep getting the prices ive been getting for the silk well turn a profit on this run yet and you would have flung me into the sea for wanting to come here instead of making straight for athens menedemos said we might have done just as well for ourselves there sostratos said we probably would have with the emeralds athenian jewelers have kassandros officers to sell to as the milesians have antigonos and theres the gryphons skull so there is to sostratos surprise menedemos chuckled and patted him on the back im all finished arguing about that with you you want to take it over to a bunch of other men wholl stand around looking at it and thinking so hard they cant even hear sostratos kissed him on the cheek you do understand he exclaimed only later did he realize that his cousins description of the philosophers of the lykeion might have been imperfectly flattering menedemos said i cant stay my dear im going to the ship and then back to talk to some more jewelers and who knows one of them may turn out to have a pretty wife he hurried off before sostratos could even begin a gasp of horror swallowing a sigh sostratos went back to calling out the virtues of the silk he was selling he did that on purpose he thought he wanted to make me jump and he did but he also knew that if one of the jewelers did turn out to be married to a women whose looks menedemos liked he might try to seduce her and if he does we may have to head for athens sooner than he wants sostratos tossed his head they were doing such good business here they really needed to stay a while and he wanted to be able to come back to miletos next year or the year after a plump man wearing a chiton of snowy linen and sandals with gold buckles came up and waited to be noticed hail sostratos said the fellow looked prosperous enough to make him hope he was a customer would you be interested in buying some silk ail the man replied his accent not just ionian but something else something that told sostratos he wasnt a hellene not for myself no but i ave come to tell you that my mistress may well be if you ave what she wants your mistress sostratos hoped his startlement didnt show few milesians dressed as well as this fellow sostratos had assumed he had money of his own if he was someones slave how much money did his owner have yes sir the plump man said my mistress is metrikhe who is well known in miletos she might be interested in your silk if you ave any fine enough for professional purposes you understand yes sostratos said a hetaira she has to be he thought and one of the very rich ones if she can afford a slave like this ill be happy to show you what ive got here thank you sir but not to me the plump man shook his head again proving himself no hellene if you would bring it to my mistress house though sostratos almost burst out laughing menedemos will be sorry hes off talking to jewelers he thought if he were here hed do anything this side of bashing me with a rock to go himself yes ill come he told the slave let me find some bolts that might best suit her as he gathered them up he told the couple of sailors with him if anyone comes looking to buy let him know ill be back before too long right you are one of them said with a grin he added tough bit of work youve got ahead of you sounds like doesnt it though sostratos answered deadpan he turned to the slave im ready take me to your mistress as in most poleis the houses of the rich and poor lay side by side and it wasnt easy to tell which was which from the outside the rich hid their wealth behind their walls when the slave stopped and said ere we are sostratos saw that the house was whitewashed and had a very solidlooking door both suggested money neither proved it another slave opened the door when the fellow with sostratos knocked come with me sir he told sostratos and led him to the andron again sostratos held in amusement thinking in a hetairas house is this still the mens chamber and if it is what exactly does that mean the chairs and tables in the andron were well made the courtyard at which sostratos looked out also suggested quiet prosperity with a colonnade around its outer edge a neat flower garden surrounding a fountain and a nearly lifesized statue of a goddess likelier to be artemis than aphrodite sostratos would have expected something gaudier and bawdier one of the slaves brought him wine and olives the first taste of the wine made his eyebrows shoot up he knew ariousian the finest vintage from khios the aphroditehad carried it to great hellas the year before if metrikhe could afford it she was more than prosperous the tangy green olives were also very fine plainly from the first picking metrikhe gave sostratos just long enough to refresh himself before coming to the andron maybe she had a slave keeping an eye on him maybe she simply knew how long a man would need at any rate hed just set down his empty cup when she paused in the doorway and said ail you are the silkseller hail yes thats right as sostratos gave his name he eyed metrikhe no one could have proved her a hetaira by the way she dressed indeed she seemed the height of respectability over her long chiton she wore a wrap of fine soft wool miletos was famous for the quality of its khlaneis she even veiled herself against his eyes how disappointing he thought what was in his mind must have shown on his face for she chuckled were you expecting to see me in something where you could see all of me she asked as she walked in and sat down she moved with a dancers grace sostratos ears heated i did wonder he mumbled that seeming a safer word than hope i cant say im surprised metrikhe tossed her head a startlingly emphatic gesture but no i dont show myself unless its time to show myself that makes it mean more when i do ah sostratos took the point at once i see each craft has its own mysteries plainly you know yours i ad better she answered and cocked his head to one side studying him for a few heartbeats youre not a fool are you i do try not to be sostratos smiled of course i understand that you want men to be fools around you and im sure you know how to get just what you want his cousin was far fonder of quoting homer than he was but a few lines from the odyssey seemed to fit they stood in the brighttressed goddess doorway and listened to kirke inside singing with her beautiful voice while working at a great loom fit for a divinity such as goddesses have and turning out delicately woven work pleasing and fine metrikhe studied him again this time he thought more sharply an edge in her voice she said i dont turn men into swine he didnt want to antagonize her that might cost him a sale even before they started haggling he picked his words with care i wouldnt think youd need to isnt it true that a lot of men are swine before they stand in your doorway you are a man ow do you know these things she sounded half astonished half suspicious how do iknow sostratos wondered he knew what happened to women when cities fell in his student days in athens hed gone to the theater for several revivals of euripides including the trojan women and he worried about menedemos whenever the aphroditecame into a new port how much of that could he tell a stranger none he decided and so he simply shrugged and said am i wrong no by zeus the hetaira answered be thankful you dont know ow right you are perhaps still taken aback by what hed said she dipped up a cup of wine for herself she had to push aside the veils to drink sostratos didnt know what hed expectedhard dazzling beauty most likely he didnt find that she was pretty but not ravishing and younger than he would have guessed from her voice about his own age she knew he was looking of course she smiled as she let the veiling drop back into place what do you think he chose another line from the odyssey nausikaa having loveliness from the gods and then finished with his own invention improvising the end of a hexameter chose to look at silk metrikhe clapped her hands euge not really sostratos said its an anachronism for they didnt know of silk in the days of the trojan war homer never mentions it but if you choose to look at silk ill be happy to show you what i have here please do she said and then youre an unusual man i dont know what youre talking about sostratos answered he didnt particularly expect her to notice the quiet irony in his voice but she did and dipped her head he started opening leather sacks and taking out bolts of cloth your slave said you wanted the thinnest i have yes metrikhe said mysteries of the craft againnot that thats much of a mystery can we go out into the courtyard seeing these in the sunlights the best way to judge ow thin they are certainly sostratos said i wish most of the men i do business with had as good an idea of what they wanted thank you metrikhe replied and i wish most of the men oo come ere to do businessnot that kind of business but other sorts the way you arewould do business with me and not act as if all they care about is my little piggy she used the obscenity as if it were the most natural thing in the world out in the courtyard sostratos held up bolt after bolt of silk metrikhe waved for him to put some aside for later haggling at others she simply tossed her head after a while he said thats the last one i have all right the hetaira answered what do you want for all the ones i can use for all those bolts together sostratos looked up into the sky while numbers danced in his head before long he named a price metrikhe looked from the silk to him and back again i thought you would give me some round figure you reckoned that to the very drakhma didnt you of course he answered honestly surprised isnt that what you wanted me to do what you want and what you get often ave nothing to do with each other she said if it werent for what men want i would have to be a washerwoman or a tavernkeeper or something of the sort but what do they get from me they couldnt have from a threeobolos ore she snapped her fingers illusion thats all sostratos smiled should you tell me such things i wouldnt tell them to most men but i think you can see them for yourself metrikhe said and ill tell you something else no matter ow carefully you figured your price youre still a thief she named one of her own less than half as high if im a thief youre a joker sostratos replied i cant possibly make a profit on that or anything close to it you say you dont want to wash clothes or sell wine that cuts both ways i dont want to tan hides or make pots she stepped forward and set a hand on his arm till then shed acted like a wellbred woman and spoken like a welleducated man now suddenly she chose to remind him of what she really was what she really did her flesh was warm and soft her voice was warm and soft too suppose i give you that very same price and the rest of the afternoon in my bed if you want illusion i can give you the best if my cousin were here he might take you up on that sostratos said please believe me its not that im not interested that was true her touch had startled him and stirred him at the same time even so he went on youre lucky you can make a living from illusion i cant i have to have silver its not always luck believe me some of the men who visit here have illusions of their own metrikhe said she went from wanton back to businesslike in the space of a sentence all right then silver and nothing but silver she came up a little youre speaking of milesian drakhmai sostratos asked metrikhe dipped her head theyre a little heavier than your rhodian coins hed known that somehow he wasnt surprised she did too even so youre still too low he said thinking when we do make a bargain i wont find any heavy drakhmai here the way i did at the temple in kos she said lets go back into the andron and hash it out over more wine why not sostratos said if you can afford to pay for the lovely khian you can afford to pay for my silk too metrikhe laughed youre as spiny as a hedgehog why didnt your cousin come here instead he would have been easier to deal with im sorry said sostratos who wasnt sorry at all youre stuck with me when they did agree on a price it was about as low as sostratos was willing to go without abandoning the deal altogether that didnt surprise him either and when he went through the money she gave him he found a few coinsonly a fewfrom rhodes and other poleis that coined to a lighter standard than miletos ill get you lions to take their places metrikhe said and did replace them with milesian money as hed expected there were no owls or turtles or other heavy coins the drakhmai jingled sweetly as sostratos put them back into the leather sack metrikhe had given him he tied the sack shut with a strip of rawhide thank you for your hospitality and for your business he told her rising to go i hope to see you again one day it could happen ships from his father and uncles firm came into miletos every year or two metrikhe said do you need to leave so soon sostratos frowned were done here arent we or have you changed your mind about some of the silk you said you didnt want i wasnt talking about silk she said a hintmore than a hint of exasperation in her voice his frown deepened then what do you he broke off because of one possibility that occurred to him it would he was sure have occurred to menedemos much sooner do you mean that he was pleased his voice didnt rise to a startled squeak as if he were still a youth certainly i mean that she answered now sounding amused why did you think i might mean anything else because those sorts of things happen to my cousin not to me sostratos thought because women dont usually find me very interesting he had just enough sense not to blurt that out to metrikhe instead he said because you chose to dress like a woman of quality because you bargain like a man because i already turned you down when you ah didnt bargain like a man she laughed and waved that aside you didnt insult me that was business on both sides when i offered and when you said no this wouldnt be business i think this would be fun youve treated me like a person not like a slut you dont know how unusual that is and so she shrugged if you want to of course you really mean it sostratos said in slow wonder metrikhe dipped her head he still had trouble believing it in his youth hed had a couple of painful jokes played on him painful enough to make him wince when he thought of them now ten years later come on metrikhe said im doing this because i feel like it not because i have to make one of my companions feel good thats unusual too and im going to enjoy it sostratos needed no more urging he did bring along the silk she hadnt bought and the money shed given him for what she had if he left them here in the andron he wasnt sure they would stay here till he got back metrikhe didnt urge him to leave them behind all she said was you dont take chances do you i try not to he answered well good for you she said my room is upstairsits the womens quarters after all her bed was wider her mattress thicker and softer than those sostratos had used at kleiteles house back in kos as soon as she closed the bedroom door behind them she took off her veil and set it on the cabinet by the wall her letting him see her face after concealing it through nearly the whole afternoon was almost like letting him see her altogether naked that soon followed she neatly folded the khlanis and laid it beside the veil then undoing her girdle she got out of the long chiton and stood bare before him praxiteles should have got a look at you he said he never would have bothered modeling his aphrodite on phryne she blushed he was delighted to follow the surge of color from her breasts all the way to her hairline i wish more men talked so sweetly she said if they dont theyre either blind or missing a chance sostratos told her which made her flush all over again and im not even exaggerating very much he thought pulling his own chiton off over his head metrikhes shape was everything a man could ask for in a woman slim waist round hips firm breasts of just the right size a sculptor would have been pleased to use her for a model most sculptors would be pleased to do quite a lot of things with her went through sostratos mind as he stepped forward and took her in his arms her body molded itself against his her skin was soft and smooth he wondered if she oiled it she tilted her face up to his seen from a distance of less than a palm her eyes werent brown but dark dark hazel an intriguingly complex color i like tall men she whispered i like you sostratos answered metrikhe laughed and squeezed him her breath was sweet when he kissed her she tasted of wine they lay down on the bed sostratos mouth went from hers to her cheeks the lobes of her ears her neck her breasts his hand wandered lower down the curve of her belly to where her legs joined they opened for him he stroked her there while his tongue teased her nipples she let out a soft sigh of pleasure if it wasnt real she was a better actor than any who went on the stage in athens before long she began to stroke him too and then twisted limber as an eel and took him in her mouth he enjoyed it for a little while before pulling away you dont need to play the lesbian for me he said women from lesbos were famous for giving men that particular pleasure her smile was saucy well what do you want to do then she asked archly this he said and did it metrikhe sighed when he went into her having lain with the rhodian proxenos slave woman back in kos a couple of nights before he didnt feel the need to spend himself as fast as he could he spun it out enjoying the journey as well as the eventual destination metrikhe bucked against him like an unbroken colt her breathing came quick and short till she threw back her head and a gasping moan broke from her sostratos spent himself a few heartbeats later in a throaty voice metrikhe said if wed done that while we were bargaining id ave paid you more for your silk not less thank you he told her and gave her a kiss i dont suppose ill get too many finer compliments she dipped her head she was a merchant too in her own way and knew what her words had meant youre welcome she said and youre welcome ere any time with silk or without that might have been a bigger compliment than the other thank you sostratos said again for now though id better get back to the agora do i remember the turns rightly first left second right fourth left second right she frowned thats not ow i keep track of the way let me think after a moment she dipped her head once more yes that will get you there good sostratos got off the bed and put his tunic back on thank you for your business he said and for everything else metrikhe lay there smiling up at him naked still thank you for everything else she said and for your business we werewe arebound for athens sostratos said now i hope we stay here for a while did he really mean that part of him did at any rate and he knew just which part which was more important in the general scheme of things a woman or the gryphons skull i can find women anywhere he thought theres only one gryphons skull but the physical pleasure the hetaira had given him was less easy to surmount for the pleasures of the mind than platon had made it out to be realizing that made sostratos leave metrikhes house faster than he would have otherwise he made his way back to the agora where he found menedemos dickering over silk with a plump man who had the look of someone knowing himself to be important after his cousin made the bargaina better one than hed got from metrikhe himselfand sent the fellow on his way he turned to sostratos and said well my dear i stopped back here for what i thought would be only a moment it was just long enough to hear where youd gone and to talk with that chap you had a rugged bit of duty there didnt you is she pretty as a matter of fact yes sostratos answered and did she give you half the price in trade menedemos went on of course not we need the silver sostratos held up the sack of coins he told menedemos what hed sold and how much hed got not the best bargain in the world but passable passable his cousin said so you didnt get anything more from her than a smile and the money eh i didnt say that sostratos replied and had the satisfaction of seeing menedemos look very jealous indeed were about ready to sail for athens menedemos told sostratos as they stood on the aphroditespoop deck after several profitable days in miletos all right his cousin said menedemos laughed all right is that the best you can manage before we got here you would have been happy to skip this town and head straight for cape sounion and you know it as well as i do i still want to go sostratos said sounding like a man doing his best not to sound annoyed youre making it seem as though i cant tear myself away from metrikhe and that isnt true well maybe not menedemos laughed again you do come up for air every now and thenthe way a dolphin does before it dives deep into the sea except youre diving deep into her leave it alone would you please now sostratos did sound annoyed since irking his cousin was what menedemos had had in mind he did change the subject in a way youve got to admit we did the right thing coming here besides making you sleep like a dead man every night weve unloaded most of the silk for a better price than we ever thought wed get and all but two of the emeralds well show a profit when we get home our fathers wont have anything to complain about keeping his father from having anything to complain about was one of his main goals in life trouble was philodemos complained whether he had anything to complain about or not you could have sold those last two stones sostratos said one of thems the best of the lot isnt it yes it isand i know i could have menedemos said but i kept thinking if im getting these prices in miletos what would i get in athens this polis hasnt been anything special for a long time since before the persian wars sostratos said thats a long time menedemos said somewhere close to two hundred years he thought before his cousin could tell him exactly how longto the hour as likely as nothe went on lets save a couple anyhow for a really big polis a really rich polis maybe well do better with them there maybe we will sostratos agreed we couldnt very well try selling them in alexandria its the richest city in the world but yes but menedemos said if we showed up with egyptian emeralds in ptolemaios capital people would wonder how we got them and theyd take us apart trying to find out i dont think id care to answer those kinds of questions neither do i sostratos said menedemos pointed a finger at him would your hetaira want to buy one of the emeralds id bet shes got the cash for it im sure metrikhe has the cash for it his cousin answered i mentioned them to her the other day as a matter of fact she said they sound very pretty ill have to see if one of my friends will buy some for me did she menedemos laughed once more sounds like shed make a splendid merchant if she were a mannever use your own money when you can use someone elses instead she would im sure of it sostratos said and i dont think shell be poor after her looks go either shell use what shes got wisely oh i dont know how can you be so sure menedemos said look what shes doing with yougiving it away for nothing if thats not bad business i dont know what is sostratos turned red menedemos grinned hed hoped that would embarrass his cousin if she wants to be foolish that particular way i wont complain sostratos said no eh menedemos said sostratos tossed his head menedemos grin got wider not least to hide his annoyance that sostratos had had such luck here and he hadnt hed even hinted a couple of times that he would like to meet metrikhein a purely social way of course but sostratos had made a point of not inviting him along when he went calling do you think id try to take your woman away would i do such a thing to my own cousin menedemos knew himself well enough to answer that honestly if she were pretty enough i exactly when were you planning to sail sostratos asked day after tomorrow menedemos answered i was thinking wed spend tomorrow in the agora try to move as much as we can silk dye perfume balsam sostratos broke in we only have a little bit of balsam left its done well for us it has hasnt it menedemos said i wish wed bought more from those phoenicians physicians and priests both snap it up i hadnt expected quite so much demand neither had i sostratos said its the perfect sort of thing for us to carry though it isnt bulky and its worth a lot we ought to see if we can get more next year wed make money on it himilkon would probably be able to find some for us menedemos said all sorts of strange things come out of the east and end up in his warehouse peafowl for instance dont remind me sostratos shuddered hed cared for the peafowl on the journey to great hellas the year before and would likely spend the rest of his days trying to forget the experience after a deep breath he went on it might be worth our while to go east next spring and see if we can buy direct engedi where the stuff comes from is somewhere in phoenicia isnt it in it or near it menedemos said im pretty sure of that he stroked his chin if we took a cargo along so we could sell as well as buy well of course sostratos said yes yes slowly menedemos dipped his head weve talked about this once or twice before in an idle sort of way but now im starting to catch fire i truly am we could save a fortune in the middlemens fees the phoenicians charge well have to talk to himilkon when we get back to rhodes see what he can tell us about the country and its customs sostratos said well have to hope its not at war too if ptolemaios decides to try to take it away from antigonos its a good place to stay away from we almost got stuck in their fight a couple of times this sailing season we did get stuck at kos menedemos said so we did sostratos said but it is a good idea i think not that many hellenes go there we could make quite a profit and we can stop in the cities of cyprus on the way there and back i think we should have an easy time persuading our fathers menedemos made a sour face his enthusiasm suddenly half quenched you can say that uncle lysistratos is a pretty easygoing fellow but trying to talk my father into anything he tossed his head its like trying to pound sense into a rock im sure he says the same thing about you his cousin remarked what if he does menedemos said im the one whos right sostratos didnt argue with him menedemos assumed that meant his cousin thought he was right that it might mean sostratos merely thought there was no point to arguing never crossed his mind the evening before they sailed diokles went through the brothels and taverns of miletos rounding up the aphrodites crew he made sure everybody was back aboard the merchant galley before she left the harbor menedemos clapped him on the back you go after them the way a hound goes after hares and you dig them out wherever they hide i know the spots the oarmaster answered id better by the gods when i pulled an oar myself i spent enough time drinking and screwing in them and hoping my officers wouldnt grab me and haul me away not long after sunrise the next morning the aphroditeleft miletos some of the sailors looked wan and unhappy but some of them were bound to look wan and unhappy going out of any port sostratos stared west across the water at a destination he could see only in his minds eye athens he murmured at last menedemos gave him a quizzical look ive never seen anyone run so hard from a pretty girl especially when nobodys running after you his cousin shrugged metrikhe was pleasant but she was only a hetaira only eh menedemos gave a skeptical snort i suppose thats why you made such a point of not introducing me to her sostratos turned red menedemos hid a smile coughing a couple of times sostratos said i did find her first you know his voice got a little stronger a little sharper and i dont see you introducing me to the women you meet at our stops well my dear you do get so tedious about meeting other mens wives menedemos said sostratos coughed again this time as if he were choking he soon found an excuse to go forward menedemos grinned and gave his attention to the steering oars waves slapped the aphrodites starboard side as she made her way west across the ikarian sea the sail now bellied full now lay limp in a fitful breeze from out of the north menedemos kept six sometimes eight men a side on the oars to push the akatos along even when the breeze fell to the north and northwest samos and ikaria and several smaller islands reared out of the water as if their central hills were the notched backs of mythical beasts though the two were much of a size samos was an important place ikaria a backwater where nothing much ever happened here menedemos didnt need to ask his historyminded cousin why the neighboring islands differed so much samos had a good harbor ikaria didnt as a result it had no poleis only a handful of villages and some herdsmen and their flocks the world had passed it by and the aphroditewould do the same the akatos put in at patmos a small island south of ikaria for the night patmos had a decent harborit boasted several bays a ship might enter in factbut very little else it was dry and rocky baked brown as a bread crust by the sun as the aphroditesanchors splashed into the sea sostratos looked over the desolate terrain and said now i understand understand what menedemos asked in the early days of the peloponnesian war a spartan admiral named alkidas was operating north of here up near ephesos his cousin answered in those days the athenian fleet was much stronger than spartas the athenian commanderhis name was pakhesfound out the spartans were around he chased them as far as patmos here but then he turned back menedemos scratched his head im still not following you my dear he took one look at this place and then went away sostratos said wouldnt you oh menedemos took another look at the island at the rocks and the sand and the miserable little fishing village in front of which they were anchored a point i wouldnt want to live out my days here thats sure a few minutes later just before the sun sank into the aegean a small boat put out from the village and made for the aphrodite as it drew near one of the men inside called oo are you where are you comin from where are you eaded for his dialect was odd half ionic half doric and thoroughly rustic after naming the merchant galley menedemos said were out of miletos bound for athens ah the local dipped his head all them big places dont ave much truck with em ere i believe that menedemos thought if you werent a days nail out of miletos no one would ever have anything to do with you the fellow in the boat asked what are you carryin sostratos spoke up koan silk crimson dye rhodian perfume papyrus and ink fine balsam from engedi a lions skin he didnt menedemos noted with amusement mention the gryphons skull was he afraid the people here might want to steal it if he was that had to be one of the more foolish fears menedemos had ever heard of fancy stuff the patmian said i mightve known thought you was a pirate when i first seen you folk often made that mistake about the aphrodite hearing of pirates got menedemos attention have you seen any lately are they sailing in these waters he asked every now and again the local answered which might mean anything or nothing he paused to spit into the sea then asked a question of his own what dyou want for a jar o your perfume my womand take it right kindly if she got one by the gods menedemos muttered i never expected to do business here eight drakhmai sostratos told the patmian as calmly as if he were dickering in the market square in rhodes menedemos admired that calm he also expected to see the local recoil in horror a drakhma a day would keep a man and his family housed and fed if not in fancy style he looked toward the village again nothing here was fancy but the man just shrugged and said deal pal i got the silver dont hardly got nothin to spend it on though ereabouts we mostly just swap back and forth he nudged the other man in the boat who started to row toward shore over his shoulder he called be right back will he menedemos wondered or is he without an obolos to his name and just trying to save face in front of us sostratos shrugged no way to tell either hell come or he wont if he does i wonder what hell use for money they cant possibly mint coins here the boat beached itself a plethron or so from the aphrodite one of the men in it got out and went into a house close by the sea the other man the rower sat in the boat waiting that made menedemos begin to believe the first patmian did have the money and sure enough as twilight began to deepen he emerged from his house and trotted back to the boat a moment later it headed out toward the merchant galley can i come aboard the local called as it drew near come ahead menedemos answered the boat pulled up alongside the akatos waist one of the sailors reached out and helped haul the patmian into the ship he walked back to the stern and up onto the poop deck hail sostratos said ail the patmian replied you got the perfume there thats not what youd call a right big jar is it its the size we always sell sostratos said which was true theres not a whole lot left after they boil down the roses and mix the scent with oil it will last you a whileyour wife wont need much to make herself smell sweet menedemos wondered how true that was the local hadnt bathed any time recently which meant the odds were good his wife hadnt either true this was a dry island but even so there was no room to get upwind of the fellow either menedemos did his best not to breathe with sudden decision the patmian dipped his head all right ill take it he held out a couple of coins to sostratos menedemos cousin took them hefted them and handed the local the perfume thank you kindly the fellow said he scrambled back into the boat when he and his friend beached it this time they pulled it well up out of the water and they both went into the village what did he give you menedemos asked see for yourself sostratos set the coins on menedemos palm in the fading light menedemos held them up close to his face a tetradrakhm from corinth he said thats a pretty pegasos on it and another tetradrakhm from aigina very niceim always glad to get turtles because theyre so heavy notice anything unusual about this particular turtle sostratos asked i didnt menedemos looked more closely its got a smooth shell and flippers not regular feet his cousin agreed its a sea turtle not a tortoise aigina hasnt made them like that since the days of the persian wars i wonder how this one ended up here i wouldnt be surprised if this fellows fivetimesgreatgrandfather stole it from an aiginetan and its been here ever since menedemos answered im just glad hes off my ship did you smell him i could hardly help it sostratos took back the coins however he got the silver though it doesnt stink true now menedemos was the one who looked west towards athens a couple of nights at sea coming up i think thats a better bet than going through the kyklades again sostratos said too many pirates in those waters and sooner or later wed come across one whod sooner fight than go the other way thats what i think too menedemos took off his chiton and threw it down on the poop deck might as well go to sleep now when he woke the next morning and untangled himself from the folds of his himation he exclaimed in lowvoiced delight as he stood by the rail and pissed into the harbor of patmos the breeze came out of the northeast strong and with a certain feel to it that made him think it would hold all day every once in a while such feelings let him down more often than not though he gauged the wind rightly diokles looked up from the rowers bench where hed passed the night kind of day that makes you want to get out to sea as fast as you can he said i was thinking the same thing menedemos said the eastern sky was pink but the sun wouldnt rise for some little while yet he looked down at sostratos who still lay snoring on the poop deck and stirred him with his foot his cousin gasped and sputtered and opened his eyes what was that for he asked indignantly sitting up whats the matter menedemos was the picture of innocence dont you want to go to athens i want you to go to the crows sostratos got to his feet so quickly and fiercely menedemos wondered if he would have to fight his cousin but then the angry glow faded from sostratos eyes thats a splendid wind isnt it feels good to me menedemos said the keleustes likes it too and i cant imagine anyone being sorry to get away from patmos all right sostratos walked naked to the rail as menedemos had moments before when he turned back he said lets start getting the sailors up diokles had already started waking the ones who hadnt roused by themselves they ate bread and oil drank watered wine and had the anchors hauled up and stowed by the time the sun crawled above the horizon they didnt even have to row out of the harbor it faced west and the breeze carried the aphroditeaway from it as soon as the sail came down from the yard looking back over his shoulder menedemos watched patmos recede behind him had he taken the akatos due west he would have sailed through the kyklades for the third time that sailing season instead he used the steering oars to swing her somewhat to the north so that she went up between ikaria on his right hand and mykonos on his left tenos lay northwest of mykonos andros northwest of tenos euboia northwest of andros menedemos steered the aphroditeon a course parallel to them but well to the east out in the middle of the aegean he didnt see another ship all day which suited him fine late tomorrow or early the next day well be able to slide through the channel between andros and euboia and make for athens he said good enough better than good enough in fact sostratos said you had the right of it not many ships out here in the middle of the sea we dont guarantee getting through without any trouble this way menederaos said we do make our chances better though and we never get out of sight of land the way you can sailing west to great hellas so we always know where we are not easy to get out of sight of land in the aegean sostratos said im not sure you could do it not on a clear day up in the north maybe menedemos said theres that broad reach from lesbos to skyros otherwise thoughhe tossed his headno i wouldnt think so some of the sailors baited lines with bits of bread and cheese and let them down into the sea they caught a few sprats and a mackerel or two and then just when menedemos was about to order the anchors dropped moskhion pulled in a gloriously plump red mullet hell have friends tonight sostratos said wont he though menedemos agreed the splendid fish made his mouth water i hope im moskhions friend tonight as the captain of a merchant galley learned to do he pitched his voice to carry moskhion looked up from the mullet an impish grin on his face have we met sir he asked as bland as if he were a man with estates out to the horizon condescending to speak to a tanner menedemos laughed as loudly as everyone else who heard the sailor youll find out whether weve met he growled mock fierce as the sun set the men whod caught fish grilled them over little braziers the savory scent of the flesh filled the air moskhion did share the mullet as widely as he could and sent small portions back to menedemos sostratos and diokles thats only a bite sostratos said as he washed his down with a swallow of wine but its a mighty tasty bite it sure is menedemos agreed a bite of mullets worth a bellyful of cheese any day he knew a hungry man would say no such thing but he enjoyed the luxury of a full belly he ate an olive and spat the pit into the sea diokles pointed into the southern sky a little west of the meridian theres zeus wandering star he said where sostratos said and then ah there now i see it i wonder if its true as the babylonians say that the motions of the stars foretell everything we do how can anyone know something like that menedemos said me i want to think i do things because i want to do them not because some star says i must yes i want to believe the same thing his cousin said but is it really true or do i want to believe it because the stars say i should want to diokles grunted and refilled his wine cup the oarmaster said that kind of talk makes my head ache what do the babylonians have to say about twins menedemos asked theyre born at the same time and sometimes theyre like each other but other sets are as different as eggs and elephants by the stars they should all be just alike shouldnt they thats true sostratos beamed at him very logical in fact i wonder if any philosophers have ever thought about what that means when we get to athens i hope i remember to ask twilight deepened more stars came out menedemos spotted kronos wandering star dimmer and yellower than that of zeus not far above the eastern horizon pointing to it he said i know what that star foretells not long after i see it ill go to sleep amazing sostratos said i was born half a year before you but it means the very same thing for me they both laughed the aphroditerocked gently on the sea menedemos took the motion altogether for granted it wasnt enough to bother his cousin who was more sensitive to such things they lay down side by side on the poop deck diokles went forward to sleep on a rowers bench when menedemos woke morning twilight had replaced that of the evening he yawned and stretched and watches stars fade from the sky as hed watched them come out the night before high up in the air a gull screeched he got to his feet and tasted the wind then dipped his head in satisfaction it hadnt swung during the night nor had it died up toward the bow one earlyrising sailor spoke to another doesnt look like well have to pull too hard today good the second sailor answered sostratos stayed asleep till the men started hauling in the anchors then he looked about in bleary confusion hail slugabed menedemos said oh hail sostratos looked around some more rubbed his eyes and got to his feet as he did he wet a finger to test the wind what he found brought a smile to his face and eagerness to his voice do you think well be able to slide between andros and euboia this afternoon maybe menedemos shook a stern finger at his cousin but even if we do weve got another days sail after that before we put in at peiraieus i know i know sostratos waved impatiently but were so close now i can all but taste athens menedemos pursed his lips as if he were tasting too rocks and dirt and a little bit of hemlock left over from sokrates splash it with oil and its not so bad splash you with oil and youre still an idiot sostratos said doing his best not to splutter after a bow and a wave for his cousin menedemos raised his voice to call out to the sailors eat your breakfast lads and then well be away as long as the gods are kind enough to give us the breeze we need wed be fools and worse than fools if we didnt make the most of it down came the sail from the yard a gust of wind filled it almost at once the mast creaked as it took up the strain at menedemos shouted instructions the men swung the yard from the starboard bow back to take best advantage of the breeze the aphroditeslid through the light chop graceful as a tunny flying fish sprang out of the water so did dolphins which leapt far higher and more gracefully menedemos tossed a barley roll into the aegean the merchant galleys boat had hardly passed it before a dolphin snapped it up the sailors murmured in delighted approval a couple of them clapped their hands good for you skipper diokles said theres good luck no less superstitious than any other seafaring man menedemos dipped his head good luck for the dolphin too he said if it hadnt been in just the right spot a sea bird would have got there first sure enough a small gull with a black head that had been swooping toward the roll pulled up with an angry screech ayeea a moment later a tern plunged into the sea it came out with a fish in its beak between the dolphin and the bird theyve got sitos and opson menedemos said instead of laughing at his little joke sostratos tossed his head for dolphins and terns fish are sitos theyre what they have to have when you gave them the barley roll that was opson for them even though it would be sitos for us diokles clicked his tongue between his teeth here ive been going to sea almost as long as youve been alive young sir and i never once thought of it like that youve got an odd way of looking at the worldan interesting way he hastened to add a lefthanded way menedemos said which wasnt a compliment they didnt have the sea to themselves but for wild things that day a few fishing boats were out on the wide water east of the kyklades when their crews saw the aphroditeapproaching they lowered their sails and made for first tenos and then in the afternoon andros as fast as they could go one of the crews cut a net free to be able to flee the faster poor frightened fools menedemos said thatll cost them a good bit of silver or a good bit of time to make good and we didnt want anything to do with them we ought to paint a legend on the side of the ship i am not a pirate sostratos said and how long would it be before a pirate painted the same thing on his hemiolia menedemos returned sostratos screwed up his face and stuck out his tongue in a gorgons grimace thats a horrible thought are you telling me fm wrong though menedemos asked his cousin tossed his head menedemos smile held slightly grudging approval one thing sostratos was without a doubt an honest man as the sun sank toward the rough horizon to the west sostratos pointed toward the channel between andros and cape geraistos the southernmost part of euboia there it is we can get through before nightfall we can get through yes menedemos said but we cant get very far past the channel if we go through now when morning comes wed be sitting out in the open for anyone to spot if we stay out here on the open aegean till morning though we can dash between the islands and round cape sounion before nightfall tomorrow how does that sound sostratos didnt look happy but he didnt say no he just sighed made a pushing motion and turned away after a moment menedemos realized he was miming sisyphos eternal torment every time the wicked man got his boulder up near the top of the hill it would slip away and roll to the bottom again its not so bad as that menedemos said no it isnt sostratos said its worse diokles spoke up whether we go through now or in the morning id serve out weapons first you never can tell thats a good idea menedemos said i wish it werent but it is he rubbed his chin as he thought i do believe im going to bring us up a little farther north before we anchor for the night that way i can run straight before the wind in the morning and well slide through as fast as may be very nice the keleustes said youre right as can bethe sooner were through there the better the sun was just on the point of setting when menedemos ordered the anchors into the sea sostratos still looked glum cheer up menedemos told him see were even aimed the right way now sure enough hed swung the aphroditearound so her bow pointed southwest straight toward the gap between the islandsand toward the mainland of attica beyond his cousin sighed i know it my dear but it hasnt happened yet and im not going to be content till it does or even after that menedemos thought the ideal world sostratos built up in his mind sometimes made him have trouble accepting reality and its imperfections menedemos didnt twit him about it though the akatos was too crowded a place to make arguments worse bread and olive oil cheese and olives rough red wine a sailors supper at sea not even a taste of mullet to savor tonight the men hadnt caught anything much above sprat size menedemos shrugged ill eat better when we get to athens he thought another night on the planks sostratos said as they stretched out side by side on the poop deck i wont be sorry to sleep in a bed again there menedemos thought he could jab without making his cousin angry and he did back in miletos you werent doing much in the way of sleeping when you ended up in that hetairas bed sostratos snorted youre a fine one to talk who me menedemos did his best to sound innocent i didnt do anything much in miletos no not in miletos sostratos said darkly menedemos made some other protest but only deep heavy even breathing answered him before very long he fell asleep too he woke somewhere in the middle of the night wondering why he had then he realized the aphrodites motion had changed the swells from out of the north remained but the winddriven chop had eased he muttered something or other under his breath wrapped his himation tighter around himself and went back to sleep but when he woke the next morning he wasnt surprised to find that the wind had died even though he hardly remembered rousing before catching his eye diokles mimed rowing motions menedemos dipped his head to the oarmaster all i have to say is its a good thing were not a round ship sostratos declared after menedemos woke him and he realized they were becalmed if we were a round ship that had to lie here on the sea so close to athens with no way to get any closer i do believe id scream i believe youd scream too menedemos said his cousin gave him a dirty look he went on but since we go about as fast with oars as we do with the sail you can save your screams till you need to throw them at your fellow philosophers im not much of a philosopher sostratos said sadly i havent got enough leisure youre doing something useful which is more than a lot of those windbags can say for themselves menedemos replied his cousin looked shocked before sostratos could rush to philosophys defense menedemos added eat your breakfast and then do one more useful thing help me hand out weapons to the crew like most merchant galleysand for that matter like most pirate shipsthe aphrodite carried a motley assortment of arms perhaps a dozen swords sostratos belted his on a handful of peltasts light shields some javelins and pikes hatchets a couple of ripping hooks iron crowbars knives menedemos set his bow and a quiver of arrows where he could grab them in a hurry or more likely where sostratos or somebody else can get his hands on them he thought ill he busy steering the ship he shrugged odds were this was nothing but a waste of time even if a pirate chieftain did make a run at the aphrodite a show of strength would probably make him choose a different victim but if you didnt treat what might lie ahead as if it were real you wouldnt be ready on the off chance it turned out so rhyppapai rhyppapai diokles called and beat out the stroke with his mallet and bronze square as the channel between arados and euboia drew near he looked back over his shoulder at menedemos and asked will you want to put a man at every oar for the dash through the strait the oarmaster acted as if the aphroditemight be sailing straight into danger menedemos didnt see how he could do anything less he dipped his head yes lets he said we havent had to do much of that kind of thing this sailing season lets see how well they handle it good enough diokles ordered the rowers to the rowing benches menedemos sent aristeidas up to the foredeck to keep an eye out for pirates as the akatos passed each promontory if were going to do this well do it the best way we know how he thought his own gaze kept swinging from north to south from one island to the other as the merchant galley sped down the channel diokles had hardly set a hotter pace when they were trying to escape the roman trireme the summer before the men will be glad to ease off once were through menedemos thought but then just when hed started to think theyd safely made the passage aristeidas pointed to port and shouted a ship a ship a pestilence mencdernos exclaimed as the vessel emerged fromthe concealment of a headland on the northern coast of andros and raced toward the aphrodite what do we do now sostratos said maybe we should have tried coming through yesterday afternoon bastard was probably lurking here then too menedemos said there arent many honest uses for a hemiolia anyhow the twobanked galley was short and lean and one of the swiftest things afloat her crew had already taken down the mast and stowed it abaft of the permanent rowing benches of the upper bank turn towards em and try and scare em off diokles asked thats what im going to do menedemos answered they cant have a crew much bigger than ours so why would they want to mix it up he swung the aphroditeinto a tight turn toward the hemiolia up the stroke if you please right you are skipper the keleustes smote the bronze square more quickly still shouting come on boys put your backs into it lets make that polluted vulture run for his nest i hope he will run sostratos said quietly so do i menedemos answered the hemiolia gave no sign of sheering off its rowers worked their oars at least as smoothly as those of the aphrodite the men whose benches had been taken up to give room to stow the mast and yard now stood by the gunwale readyor acting readyto swarm aboard the merchant galley do you want me to take your bow the way i did on the run up to khalkis sostratos asked yes go ahead duck under the tillers and do that menedemos told him then go forward use your own judgment about when to start shooting aim for their officers if you see the chance i understand his cousin got the bow and the quiver then hurried up between the two rows of panting sweating rowers toward the foredeck the men who powered the aphroditecouldnt see what was going on which was true of the rowers in every sea fight since before the trojan war as far as the ship went the rowers were just tools menedemos and diokles had to get the best use from them on came the hemiolia doesnt look like those whoresons want to quit at all does it the oarmaster said no menedemos said unhappily he was unhappy hed taken the aphroditecloser to andros than to euboia because hed worriedmore about pirates on the southern coast of the latter island that meant this pirate ship hadnt had to go so far to close with the akatos more unhappily still menedemos went on we couldnt very well have run away a hemiolia will run down any other kind of ship on the sea diokles didnt argue that was so obviously true no one could argue most pirates though didnt reckon a fight with the large crew of another galley likely to be profitable if this captain proved an exception menedemos picked a spot not far aft of the hemiolias bow where he hoped to drive home his ram the other skipper the man handling the pirate ships steering oars would be picking his target on the aphrodite go on menedemos muttered run for home crows take you aristeidas sang out theyre shooting sure enough arrows arced through the air toward the aphrodite the first shots splashed into the sea well short of the ship archers always started shooting too soon no almost alwayssostratos stood calmly on the small foredeck a shaft nocked but the bow not yet drawn if anyone could wait till he had the chance to make his missiles count menedemos cousin was the man a shaft thudded into the stempost a couple of cubits from sostratos head that seemed to spur him into action he thrust the bow forward on a stiff left arm drew the string back to his ear as the persians had taught hellenes to do and let fly no one aboard the onrushing hemiolia fell so menedemos supposed he missed he pulled another arrow from the quiver and shot again this time menedemos heard the howl of pain across the narrowing gap eugef he called well shot a moment later one of the aphroditesrowers let out a similar howl and clutched at his shoulder he lost the stroke his oar fouled that of the man behind him the merchant galley tried to swerve menedemos worked the steering oars to keep it pointed at the pirate ship clear that oar diokles shouted a couple of sailors who werent rowing pulled it inboard more arrows struck the akatos planking the pirates had several archers the aphroditeonly sostratos several shafts whistled past him as they tried to bring him down none bit as coolly as if exercising at a gymnasion he kept shooting back another pirate wailed he fell into the sea with a splash oh very well shot menedemos exclaimed they arent pulling away dioldes said i see that menedemos answered lets see if we can take out their portside oars and cripple them same trick we pulled on the trireme eh after a moments thought the oarmaster dipped his head worth a try safer than ramming thats certain another sailor on the aphroditenot a man pulling an oar screeched and crumpled clutching his leg the hemiolia was terrifyingly close now her oars rising and falling rising and falling in smooth unison seeing how well the pirates rowed worried menedemos with a crew like that and a fast fast ship their skipper could make plans of his own if he swerved at the last instant portside oarsin diokles bellowed at the same time the pirate ships keleustes roared out an order of his own and at the same time as the aphrodites portside rowers brought their oars inboard so did the hemiolias neither hull crushed the other ships oars beneath it neither set of rowers had arms broken and shoulders dislocated as oars flew out of control but the men who would have sat at the rear of the hemiolias upper bank of oars had none to serve once the ships mast was stowed as the two ships passed close enough to spit from one to the other several of them flung grappling hooks at the aphrodite cut those lines cut them by the gods menedemos shouted suddenly locked together in an embrace of anything but love the two galleys pivoted around a common axis the aphrodites sailors frantically hacked at the ropes attached to the grapples while the pirates hauled on those lines and drew the ships closer together yet with wild cries that hardly sounded like greek at all the first pirates leaped across three or four cubits of open water and onto the merchant galley sostratos shot one last arrow at the shouting men aboard the hemiolia then set down menedemos bow yanked his sword from the scabbard and rushed to join the fight in the waist of the aphrodite dungeating templerobbing whoresons he screamed and swung the sword in an arc of iron at a pirate who was kicking a sailor in the face the blade bit between neck and shoulder blood spurted it stank like hot iron the pirate let out a horrible screech he whirled toward sostratos who stabbed him in the belly the fellow crumpled sostratos stepped on him to get at the next foe madness in a very small spacethat was how sostratos remembered the fight afterwards the aphrodites crew by itself crowded the akatos having twice as many men aboard the ship meant in essence that no one had room for anything but seizing the closest foe and trying to kill him even telling who was friend and who foe wasnt easy one of the aphrodites sailors almost brained sostratos with a belaying pin aphrodite he shouted over and over aphrooof a pirate whod lost whatever weapon he carried punched him in the belly he folded up then made himself straighten more by sheer force of will than anything else if i go down theyll trample me to death he thought he grabbed at the nearest man to steady himself it was another pirate the fellow had a big gold hoop in each ear wearing his wealth thus instead of in rings sostratos didnt have room to use his swordhanging on to it was hard enough but his left hand was free he took hold of one of those rings and yanked with all his strength the ring tore free the pirate roared in pain the earring remained on sostratos index finger well i just made a profit on the day he thought the first foolish thing that popped into his head now i have to see if i live long enough to enjoy it that unfortunately made more sense when the press cleared a little he traded sword strokes with another pirate it was nothing like practice in the gymnasion the aphroditepitched and rolled underfoot as the waves and the surge of men now here now there made her rock sailors and pirates ah around were pushing and shoving and shouting and cursing sostratos worried about a knife in the back almost as much as he did about the blade with which the fellow in front of him was trying to drink his life the pirate who wore a crestless bronze helmet a sword belt and nothing else had ferocity but no great skill he beat sostratos sword aside when the rhodian thrust at his chest sostratos next blow though took him in the side of the head that helm kept his skull unsplit but he staggered even so sostratos sprang forward and pushed with all his strength arms flailing the pirate went over the rail and fell into the aegean nimble as a mountain goat another pirate leaped from the aphroditeback to his own ship with a leather sack under his arm hed had all the fighting he wanted but hed managed to get away with some loot absurdly that outraged sostratos come back here you widearsed thief he yelled the pirate paid no attention and probably didnt even hear then another pirate sprang back to the hemiolia and another and another some with plunder some without see boys menedemos roared in a great voice they cant lick us and they cursed well know it lo for the aphrodite io the aphroditel sostratos heart leaped as he took up the cry he hadnt seen his cousin in the press of fighting and hearing his voice was a great relief seeing the pirates beginning to flee the merchant galley was an even greater one now the pirates were the ones who hacked and chopped at the lines tethering their ship to the akatos now they were the ones who pushed the hemiolia away from the aphroditewith poles and oars a couple of them retrieved the bows theyd left behind and started shooting into the merchant galley as the rest rowed away from a quarry that had proved tougher than they expected sostratos rushed up to the aphrodites foredeck which had seen almost no fighting menedemos bow and the quiver of arrows lay there undisturbed sostratos snatched them up again and shot back at the pirates he was rewarded when their oarmaster screamed and crumpled with an arrow in his thigh the rhodian aimed a couple of shafts at the man handling the hemiolias steering oars who he thought was the captain they went wide though and the man stayed at his station the hemiolia limped off not all its oars were manned not any more sostratos wondered if menedemos would order a pursuit but his cousin was otherwise occupied he stooped over a fallen pirate in the waist of the aphrodite the pirate raised a hand for mercy slowly and deliberately menedemos drove his sword into the mans body blood glistened on the blade as he straightened up throw this carrion into the sea he told the closest sailors his voice cold as a thracian winter that thrust hadnt killed the raider he was still groaning and feebly writhing as the sailors lifted him and flung him over the side splash the groans abruptly ceased another pirate was already dead his head smashed like a broken pot the sailors threw his body out of the aphrodite too looking back toward the stern sostratos saw several men gathered around another body one of them looked up and caught his eye its dorimakhos the fellow said and tossed his head to add without words that the sailor wouldnt be getting up again took a javelin through the throat poor beggar menedemos made his way forward blood splashed his tunic and his hide but he seemed hale looking down at himself sostratos found his own tunic similarly stained he also found he had a cut on his calf he hadnt even noticed now that he knew it was there it began to hurt hail menedemos said you fought well we all did sostratos answered otherwise we wouldnt have driven them off are you all right his cousin shrugged scratches bruises ill be fine in a couple of days this was the worst i got he held out his left hand which bore a ragged nasty wound is that a bite sostratos asked menedemos dipped his head pour wine on it sostratos told him thats the best thing i know to keep wounds from festering and bites are liable to im no hippokrates but i know that much i wish we had hippokrates aboard now or any other physician we could get our hands on menedemos said you probably know more than most of usand the men will think you do even if you dont come help sew em up and bandage em weve got plenty of wine to splash on our hurts anyhow along with menedemos and diokles sostratos did what he could suturing and bandaging arms and legs and scalps he splashed on wine with a liberal hand the sailors howled at the sting the needle and thread he used were coarse ones made for sewing sailcloth but they went through flesh well enough hold still he told teleutas who had a gash just below his knee you try holding still with somebody stabbing you teleutas retorted do you want to keep bleeding sostratos asked teleutas tossed his head no but i dont want to keep getting hurt either impatiently sostratos said you dont have that choice you can bleed or you can let me sew up this wound and then bandage it i wont take long and youll stop getting hurt any more as soon as im done all right go on teleutas said but he jerked and cursed every time sostratos drove the needle through his flesh and he complained more when sostratos wrapped sailcloth around the wound and made it fast with a sloppy knot call that a bandage ive seen real physicians bind up wounds by the gods they make a bandage worth looking at all nice and neat and fancy this pheu he screwed up his face as he made the disgusted noise im so sorry sostratos said with icy irony if you like ill take it off tear out the stitches and start over you try and touch that leg again and illmake you sorry for it the sailor said i just want a proper job done its the best i can do sostratos told him he knew teleutas had a point real physicians made their bandages as neat and elaborate as they could some to the point of showing off he went on just because it isnt neat doesnt mean it wont do the job thats what you say teleutas pointed up to the yard if you were talking about the rigging would you say the same thing not likely youd be screaming your head off to get all the lines shipshape sostratos ears burned so much for the men thinking i know more about doctoring than they do of course teleutas complained and malingered at any excuse or none even so sostratos would have wished for a little more gratitude another sailor did thank him very politely when he bandaged a stab wound in the mans belly he sniffed the wound as he applied the bandage it wasnt very wide and wasnt bleeding nearly so much the gryphons skull as teleutas but he did get a faint whiff of dung he said nothing to the sailor and held his face steady till hed finished the job then he went looking for menedemos why so grim his cousin asked as he dealt with a wound much like teleutas the sailor he was helping didnt snarl at him or criticize his inartistic bandages the man just seemed glad to have the cut dealt with but sostratos though he noticed that had too much on his mind really to envy menedemos luck he said im afraid rhodippos is going to die oimoi menedemos exclaimed in dismay why do you say so he didnt seem that badly hurt i saw him his guts pierced sostratos answered such men almost always die of fever remember that sailor last summer after the roman archer shot him from their trireme as we went past menedemos drummed his fingers on his right thigh his hands were bloody looking down sostratos saw his own were too voice troubled his cousin said yes i do well heres hoping youre wrong thats all heres hoping indeed sostratos said im not a physicianif you dont believe me ask teleutas but i do remember what ive seen and what ive heard i know menedemos said you remember everything as far as i can tell i wish i did sostratos said if you dont you come closer than anyone else i know menedemos said i know were lucky to have come off even as well as we did but all the same he clicked his tongue between his teeth weve got a lot of men hurt most of them should get better sostratos said gods grant it be so menedemos said if it is so ill give asklepios a sheep at his temple on kos if we put in there on the way home or back on rhodes if we dont he glanced up toward the heavens as if hoping to catch sight of the god of healing listening sostratos wasnt sure a sacrifice would do any good but he wasnt sure it wouldnt either even sokrales when he was dying remembered he owed asklepios a cock he thought at least the whoresons didnt try to wreck our rigging the way they would have if we were a round ship menedemos said maybe that glance heavenward had in fact been aimed at the yard not much point to it with a galley sostratos said we can still row perfectly well and we could even if the sail came down of course he added they might not have thought of that one often doesnt think of everything in the middle of a fight a sailor limped up to them with the broken shaft of an arrow sticking out of his calf will you draw this polluted thing for me he said through clenched teeth i tried pulling it out but it hurt too cursed much for me to do the job myself a good thing you stopped sostratos said the points barbed you would have hurt yourself worse if youd kept on he bent and felt the wound well how will you get it out then the man asked after a yelp of pain well have to push it through sostratos answered either that or cut down to the point where it is i think pushing it through is a better betits only a digit or two from coming out already the sailor looked fearfully to menedemos the captain of the aphroditedipped his head my cousins likely right alkiphron he said heresit down on a bench and stretch out your leg hell hold it and ill push the arrow through and bandage it up itll be over before you know it to sostratos he added a quick lowvoiced aside make sure you hang on tight i will sostratos promised as alkiphron eased himself down to a rowers bench he bent beside the sailor and grasped his leg above and below the wound try to keep as still as you can he told him ill do that alkiphron said menedemos took hold of the protruding shaft alkiphron gasped and tensed menedemos gave him a broad friendly smile are you ready he asked before the wounded man could answerand before he could tense himself any moremenedemos pushed the arrow through alkiphron shrieked he tried to jerk his leg away sostratos couldnt quite stop the motion but kept it small the bloodsmeared bronze point burst through the sailors skin there sostratos said soothingly as menedemos drew the shaft out after it now its over you took it like a hero menedemos added wrapping several thicknesses of sailcloth around the wound he had a knack for saying things that made men feel better its probably the knack that makes him such a fine seducer sostratos thought whatever it was he wished he had more of it himself he also noted that menedemos bandage was no neater than the ones hed made himself alkiphron didnt seem inclined to be critical he watched the bandage start to turn red that hurt like fire he said but youre rightits better now thank you both glad to do it menedemos said i hope it heals clean it should too sostratos told the sailor its bleeding freely and that helps take a cup of wine alkiphron menedemos said that will help build your blood up again sostratos frowned from what he remembered hippokrates and his fellows would have prescribed differently but alkiphron looked so pleased at menedemos suggestion sostratos held his peace and menedemos remarked i wouldnt mind a cup of wine myself sostratos thought it over not that he needed long good idea he said splendid idea in fact if you put it to the assembly it would carry in a flash neither he nor menedemos bothered watering the wine they dipped from an amphora either as menedemos sipped he said i dont do this every day he had to know they were being immoderate as well as sostratos did sostratos replied well my dear we dont fight off a pirate ship every day either no we dont and a good thing too menedemos said most of those abandoned catamites have better sense than to tangle with a ship like ours and im going to make sure our boys do plenty of wineshop bragging too let the word get around the aphrodites a hedgehog too prickly to quarrel with thats good thats very good sostratos said after a couple of swigs of strong neat wine it certainly seemed good menedemos drained his cup and filled it again catching sight of sostratos expression he grinned dont worryi still know where attica lies youd better sostratos told him what i wish i knew his cousin said is how to keep pirates from coming after merchants in the first place its not just that no one patrols the sea hard enough though we rhodians do what we can but a pirate in a hemiolia can show his heels to any ship afloat even a trireme cant always catch a hemiolia honest men ought to be able to beat the bastards at their own game youve said that before sostratos remarked whats the answer to the crows with me if i know if it were easy somebody would have thought of it a long time ago wouldnt you say but theres got to be one somewhere sostratos started to ask him why there had to be one but checked himself he didnt want to argue not now all he wanted to do was take a moment to be glad he remained alive and free and unmaimed a little wine sloshed out of his cup he laughed in embarrassment im not pouring a libation my hand is shaking thats a sign you need more wine menedemos said refilling the cup before sostratos could protest his cousin went on its all right to shake a little now when everythings over ive done that myselfyou start thinking about what might have been but you did fine when you needed to i didnt have time to be afraid then sostratos took a pull at the wine and decided not to complain about menedemos giving him more menedemos mind was already moving on to other things well have to put poor dorimakhos body in the boat you know how the men reel about having a corpse on board ship and when we do get in to attica well have to pay a priest to purify the boatand the aphrodite one more thing to take care of but sostratos didnt argue about that either the blood spilled aboard the akatos the deaths shed seen left her ritually polluted after his time in the lykeion sostratos wasnt sure he still believed in such pollutions but he was sure the sailors superstitious to a man did cleansing the ship would put them at ease and so it needed doing i wonder how much the godsdetested pirates managed to steal when they went back aboard their ship menedemos said wed better find out sostratos replied we cant sell what we havent got any more you tend to that menedemos said you know where everythings supposed to be right sostratos said tightly every once in a while he wished he didnt have such a retentive memory he also wished his cousin didnt take that memory so much for granted neither wish seemed likely to come true here menedemos for a wonder noticed his glower and asked is something wrong never mind sostratos answered he was as he was just as menedemos was as he was and his cousin did have plenty of other things to do sostratos clicked his tongue between his teeth as he ducked under the poop deck being as he was he found himself taking the other fellows point of view which made staying annoyed harder he hadnt seen any of the pirates get down under there but the silver was the first and most important thing he needed to check a glance told him all the leather sacks were where they had been before the hemiolia dashed out from behind the headland on andros he breathed a sigh of relief after all theyd sold on miletos losing their money would have been a dreadful blow he came out with care and felt a certain amount of pride at not banging his head what next he wondered the answer wasnt long in coming the balsam it was literally more precious than silver he knew under which bench it was stowed when he squatted there he found it undisturbed now that ive made sure of the money and the balsam he thought menedemos cant blame me if i check the gryphons skull he knew exactly where it was of course i know exactly where it is went through his mind port side stowed under the ninth rowers bench he hurried forward and stooped as he had to make sure the balsam was where it belonged the gryphons skull wasnt there sostratos straightened his first automatic assumption was that hed counted benches wrong he counted them again this was the ninth he bent again still no trace of the big leather sack that had held the skull he looked under the eighth and also under the tenth on the off chancethe preposterous ridiculous utterly unlikely off chancehed miscounted benches when stowing the skull no sign of it under either bench only what he recalled putting in those places desperation clanging inside his mind he checked the starboard benches maybe you put it over there after all but he hadnt the gryphons skull was gone wildeyed sostratos stared out to sea the hemiolia was long vanished with it went a skull that had come from the edge of the world a skull that by an accident of fate had found the perfect owner a skull that now by a more malign accident of fate would never reach the men who might have wrung sense from its strangeness gone gone with a filthy pirate who surely couldnt write his name who cared nothing for knowledge whod chosen theft and robbery in place of honest work gone gone forever past hope of returning sostratos burst into tears whats the matter young sir diokles asked what did the thieving whoresons get the gryphons skull sostratos choked out oh that thing the oarmaster visibly cast about for something to say at last brightening he found it dont fret too much it wouldntve brought in all that much cash anyways cash the word tasted like vomit in sostratos mouth he cursed as foully as he knew hownot with menedemos aristophanic brio perhaps but with far more real anger real hatred behind the foul language sailors shied away from him theyd never seen him in such a transport of temper hed never known himself in such a fury either he would gladly have crucified every pirate ever born and set fire to every forest from which the shipwrights shaped the timbers of their hemioliai and pentekonters from the stern menedemos called whats gone missing he had to say it again the gryphons skull oh his cousin said is that all all sostratos howled more curses burst from him still hot as iron in the forge he finished they could have taken anything else on this shipanything do you hear me but no one of those godsdetested rogues had to steal the single solitary thing we carried that willwouldmatter a hundred years from now menedemos came forward and set a hand on his shoulder cheer up my dear its not so bad as that no its worse sostratos said his cousin tossed his head not really just think right this very minute youre probably having your revenge my what sostratos gaped as if menedemos had suddenly started speaking phoenician what are you talking about ill tell you what menedemos answered suppose youre a pirate your captain decides to go after an akatos for a change itll be a tough fight sure enough he says but think how rich well be once we take her you manage to board the aphrodite her sailors are all fighting like lions somebody stabs you in the leg somebody else cuts off half your ear he paused go on sostratos said in spite of himself grinning menedemos did pretty soon even antigonos the oneeyed can see you arent going to win this scrap you grab whatever you canwhatevers under that bench thereand you hop back aboard your hemiolia you have to get away from those fighting madmen on the merchant galley so you pull your oar till youre ready to drop dead somebody slaps a bandage on your ear and sews up your leg and then finally you say all right lets see whats in this sack its big and heavyits got to have something worthwhile inside and you open itand theres the gryphons skull looking back at you as ugly as it was in the market square in kaunos what would you do then slowly sostratos smiled that was vengeance of a sort but diokles said me id fling the polluted thing straight into the sea that struck sostratos as horribly likely in his minds eye he could see the pirate staring at the skull he could hear the fellow cursing hear his mates laughing and he could see the blue waters of the aegean dosing over the gryphons skull forevermore think of the knowledge wasted he cried think of the look on that bastards face when he opens the sack menedemos said it was the only consolation sostratos had it wasnt enough wasnt anywhere close to enough better i should have sold the skull to damonax he said bitterly what if it sat in his house maybe his son or his grandson would have taken it to athens now its gone im sorry menedemos said though he still seemed more amused than anything else he pointed west toward the distant mainland of attica we still might get to cape sounion by sundown i dont care sostratos said what difference does it make now hed hoped his name might live forever sostratos the rhodian discoverer of he tossed his head what had he discovered thanks to the pirate nothing at all menedemos brought the aphrodite into the little harbor of the village of sounion which lay just to the east of the southernmost tip of the cape he pointed inland towards a small but handsome temple asking who is worshiped there thats one of poseidons shrines i think sostratos answered athenas is the bigger one farther up the isthmus ah thanks menedemos said i havent stopped here before so i didnt remember if i ever knew sounion he snapped his fingers then dipped his head recalling some lines from the odyssey but when we reached holy sounion the headland of athens there phoibos apollo the steersman of menelaos slew assailing him with shafts that brought painless death he held the steeringoar of the racing ship in his hands phrontis onetors son who was best of the race of men at steering a ship whenever storm winds rushed not storm winds now gods be praised his cousin said you did a good job steering the aphrodite though to get us here before nightfall thanks menedemos said do you suppose we could get a priest to purify the ship now or will we have to wait here till morning he answered his own question morning of course so we can get dorimakhos body off the ship and set him in his grave he lowered his voice and you were right worse luckrhodippos has a fever i dont like enough to put him half out of his head i know sostratos sorrowfully clicked his tongue between his teeth i wish such things didnt happen with belly wounds but they do he ground out i wish id shot the bastard who stole the gryphons skull right in the belly i want him dead he was usually among the most gentle of men menedemos regarded him with more than a little curiosity i dont think youd sound so savage if someone stole half our silver maybe i wouldnt sostratos said we can always get more silver one way or another where will we come by another gryphons skull for all you know therell be another one in the marketplace at kaunos next year menedemos answered who knows what will come out of the trackless east these days maybe but sostratos didnt sound as if he believed it on reflection menedemos couldnt blame his cousin the gryphons skull wasnt obviously valuable and was large and heavy and bulky how many merchants would carry such a thing across ten thousand stadia and more on the off chance someone in the west might want it not manythat one had still surprised menedemos he said now that we havent got it any more do you still want to go on to athens i dont know sostratos answered right now im so tired and so angry and so disgusted i know i cant think straight ask me again in the morning and maybe ill be able to tell you something that makes sense fair enough menedemos said lets have some more wine now its been a long time since the fight they were on their second cup when someone on shore pushed a boat into the water and rowed out toward the merchant galley no one had bothered to build quays here and the aphroditelay at anchor a couple of plethra from the beach what ship are you a man called from the boat the aphrodite out of rhodes menedemos answered we were bound for athens but pirates came after us between euboia and andros we fought them off and here we are fought em off you say the fellow in the boat sounded dubious whats your cargo he thinks were pirates menedemos realized when a galley came into an outoftheway harbor like this one the locals often started jumping to conclusions weve got koan silk aboard and crimson dye from byblos menedemos said and perfume from rhodes and fine ink and some papyrus from egyptthough were almost sold out of thatand a splendid lion skin from kaunos on the anatolian mainland and the worlds best balsam from phoenicia worlds best eh the man in the boat laughed you sound like a tradesman all right and weve got news sostratos added news with the one word menedemos cousin had done a better job of snaring the man in the rowboat than he had himself with his whole long list of what the aphroditecarried tell it man the local exclaimed polemaios polemaios son is dead sostratos said when he went to kos he tried to raise a rebellion against ptolemaios and the lord of egypt made him drink hemlock we were there when it happened as usual he said nothing about taking polemaios to kos or about watching antigonos nephew die what he did say was plenty polemaios dead the sounian echoed youre sure menedemos and sostratos solemnly dipped their heads that is news the man said and started rowing back to shore as fast as he could go we could have just told him that and he wouldnt have worried about anything else menedemos said he yawned after the desperate day those two cups of wine were hitting him hard as the stars shone down on the merchant galley he stretched out on the poop deck and dove into sleep like a dolphin diving into the sea however worn he was he did not pass a restful night rhodippos woke himwoke the whole crewtwo or three times with cries of rage and dread as the wounded feverish sailor battled demons only he could see by the time the sun followed rosyfingered dawn up out of the sea to the east the man was moaning almost continuously menedemos pulled the stopper from a fresh amphora of wine last night this made me sleepy he said as he dipped some out now i hope itll wake me up he added water to the wine and drank get me some too please sostratos said poor fellow he added around a yawn its not his fault fault doesnt matter menedemos was yawning too his head felt filled with sand most of the sailors were awake too though a couple snored on despite rhodippos ravings menedemos envied them their exhaustion sostratos said we need to see about one burialtwo soonand about getting the ship cleansed of pollution menedemos envied him too for being able to concentrate on what they had to do when he was as weary as everyone else despite dorimakhos corpse they used the akatos boat to go ashore for an obolos an old man pointed them toward the burial ground outside sounion and toward the gravediggers house youll be the rhodians that worthy said when they knocked on his door gossip as usual had wasted no time you lost someone in your fight with the pirates we lost one man and were losing another menedemos answered will you stay here till he dies the gravedigger asked menedemos and sostratos looked at each other sostratos sighed and shrugged menedemos dipped his head so did the gravedigger three drakhmai then for two graves he said sostratos gave him three rhodian coins he took them without a murmur though they were lighter than athenian owls menedemos asked whos the chief priest at poseidons temple here wed like him to purify our ship that would be theagenes the gravedigger replied as the two rhodians walked toward the temple menedemos asked where do we go from here his cousin looked at him why back to the ship i would think menedemos made an exasperated noise no what i mean is where does the aphroditego from hereand you know it too well what if i do sostratos walked along for several paces his bare feet kicking up dust from a dirt path that hadnt seen rain since spring then suddenly he stopped and sighed and shrugged id hoped i would change my mind with some sleep but i havent without the gryphons skull i dont much care where we go what difference does it make now it makes a lot of difference menedemos answered it makes a difference in what we end up selling and for how much sostratos shrugged again well show some profit this sailing season we wont show a really big one the way we did coming back from great hellas after the peafowl and that mad dash down to syracuse loaded with grain that wasnt mad that was brilliant menedemos said it had been his idea it turned out to be brilliant because we got away with it that doesnt mean it wasnt mad sostratos said relentlessly precise as usual a fly lit on menedemos hand he brushed it away back among the trees a cuckoo called sostratos continued without the gryphons skull whether we go to athens or not doesnt matter to me its just another polis now as far as im concerned you really do mean that menedemos said his cousin dipped his head he looked as sad as a man whose child had just died trying to cheer him up menedemos asked couldnt youi dont know tell your philosopher friends about the gryphons skull he didnt know whether hed cheered sostratos but saw he had amused him kind of you to think of such things my dear but it wouldnt do sostratos said it would be like he paused a moment in thought then grinned and pointed at menedemos like you bragging about some woman youve had where nobody else has seen her or knows whether youre telling the truth dont you listen to the sailors menedemos said men talk like that all the time of course they do im not saying they dont sostratos answered but the point is half the time the people who listen to them think by the gods what a liar he is if i cant hold up the skull to show the men of the lykeion and the academy why should they believe me because they know you menedemos suggested id be likelier to believe you bragging about a woman than i would most people i can think of im still jealous about that hetaira back in miletos and you didnt even brag about her men know about women they know what theyre likeas much as men can hope to anyhow sostratos said and menedemos laughed his cousin went on but suppose men had only known boys up till now think about that i like women better menedemos said they enjoy it too and boys usually dont never mind that sostratos said impatiently suppose all wed known were boys and somebody started talking about what a woman was like would you believe him if he didnt have a woman there with him to prove what he was saying menedemos thought about it no i dont suppose i would he admitted all right then thats what id be up against talking about the gryphons skull without being able to show it sostratos let out another sigh a lover pining for a lost love its over now nothing to be done about it lets find this theagenes and get the ship purified the priest was pruning a fig tree in a little orchard by the temple when the rhodians came up to him hail menedemos called hail theagenes answered over his shoulder just a moment and ill be right with you a smoothbarked branch thudded to the ground theagenes grunted in satisfaction and lowered his saw he turned toward menedemos and sostratos he was a short man shorter than menedemos but with wiry muscles shifting under his skin as he moved there thats better now what can i do for the two of you youll be from the ship that got in last night thats right menedemos gave his name and sostratos if you heard that you probably heard we fought off pirates too we had a man killed and another who looks sure to die of his wounds theagenes dipped his head i did hear that yes youll want me to purify the vessel if you please menedemos said and wed like to sacrifice here as a thanks offering for driving those whoresons away sostratos stirred at that menedemos had been sure he would he hated expense but it needed doing good enough the priest hesitated then went on this wounded man if he dies after i finish the job youd have to do it over again sostratos said thats what i meant yes theagenes agreed a death is a death as far as the ritual goes how it happens doesnt matter well move him to the boat menedemos said hed done that with the dying sailor after the clash with the roman trireme the year before purifying that will be less work for youand if you cant come for some reason well we can buy another boat i understand theagenes said let me get my lustration bowl and then ill come to the harbor with you he went into the temple when he came out again sostratos stirred how long has this temple had that bowl he whispered to menedemos what do you oh menedemos saw what his cousin meant the bowl had an image of poseidon in it the god was done in black against a red background that style had been replaced by red figures on a black background about the time of the persian wars how many blackfigure bowls still survived menedemos said theyre very careful of it i should think so his cousin answered the two rhodians and the priest walked back toward the seashore when theagenes got a good look at the aphrodite he said your ship is too beamy to make a proper pirate but i can see how people might think at first glance she was one weve had it happen yes menedemos said as far as im concerned poseidon or someone ought to sweep all pirates off the sea i wish that might happen myself theagenes said the world would be a better place menedemos waved to the rowers waiting for his return the men waved back they took him and sostratos and theagenes out to the aphrodite dorimakhos body lay wrapped in bloodstained sailcloth at the stern of the boat as theagenes neared the akatos he filled that ancient bowl with seawater he handed it to menedemos before scrambling from the boat to the ship what would he do if i dropped it menedemos wondered but he didnt he just gave it back to theagenes the priest looked at the dark stains on the aphrodites planking you did have a hard fight here he remarked it would have been harder still if wed lost it sostratos said of course theagenes said he went up and down the ship sprinkling the water from the bowl over the planks and murmuring prayers in a low voice as he came up onto the poop deck he remarked the sea purifies anything it touches i suppose thats why in the iliad talthybios the herald threw the boar agamemnon sacrificed when he finally apologized to akhilleus into the sea menedemos said just so theagenes sounded pleased the carcass of the boar carried the burden of agamemnons oath it should not have been eaten by men the sea was the path of its travel to earth sun and the furies the priest beamed at menedemos i see you are a man who thinks on such things well menedemos was no more modest than he had to be but he couldnt take that kind of praise with sostratos standing beside him he said my cousin leans more toward philosophy than i do i dont particularly lean toward philosophy myself theagenes said i think we ought to do as the gods want us to do not make up finesounding excuses to do as we please sostratos raised an eyebrow at that before he could start the sort of argument that had made sokrates a candidate for hemlock menedemos said we do thank you for purifying the ship he gave sostratos a look that said please dont to his relief sostratos didnt theagenes said i am pleased to hear such words from you young man a man who loves the gods will be loved by them he went down into the waist of the ship and splashed a little seawater on rhodippos the wounded man lost in a fever dream moaned and muttered to himself theagenes sighed i fear youre right about him death reaches toward him even as we watch i wish something could be done about wounds like his whether by gods or healers sostratos saidno he wouldnt casually let it drop after all asklepios has been known to work miracles the priest said so he has sostratos agreed if he did it more often though they wouldnt be miracles and a lot more men would have longer lives the priest sent him a sour stare menedemos felt like a man standing between two armies just before they shouted the paean and charged each other doing his best to change the subject he said come on boys lets get rhodippos into the boat well give him the best care we can there rhodippos howled piteously as several sailors lowered him into the boat he kept on howling even after they rigged an awning of sailcloth to keep the sun off him the kindest thing we could do for him would be to cut his throat sostratos said he doesnt know whats happening to him menedemos said its a small mercy but a mercy and the gods may yet choose to preserve his life theagenes added menedemos didnt believe that not for a moment and in his zeal to keep his cousin and the priest from squabbling hed been too clever for his own good with rhodippos in the boat how was theagenes to get back to sounion menedemos hadnt the heart to take the wounded man out of there again the sailors hailed a rowboat from the shore he gave the fellow in it a couple of oboloi to row the priest home once theagenes was out of earshotor nearly sosostratos sniffed and said he may be holy but he isnt what youd call bright theagenes back got very straight no he hadnt been quite out of earshot menedemos hadnt thought so he probably thinks youre bright but not very holy i dont care what he thinks sostratos said and if you think i think the ship is ritually clean again menedemos broke in and i think thats good dont you he gave sostratos a hard look as if to say hed better oh yes his cousin admitted i try not to be superstitious but i dont succeed so well as id like i dont think you can be a sailor without being superstitious i believe in luck and the gods if you want to say that makes me superstitious go ahead menedemos said and wondered how big an argument hed get to his surprise he got none at all sostratos hadnt heard him his cousin was watching a flock of seabirds flapping past menedemos laughed and how do the omens look sostratos did hear that i wasnt watching them for the sake of omens he said i just dont think ive ever seen those particular petrels before oh menedemos said crestfallen many another man might have been lying when he made such a claim sostratos menedemos tossed his head he believed his cousin implicitly rhodippos died three days later the crew of the aphrodite acting for his family buried him in the grave the local gravedigger had excavated theagenes came out to the merchant galley once more this time to cleanse the boat he gave sostratos a sour look sostratos pretended not to see it in the meanwhile a round ship from the island of aigina put in at sounion after talking with its captain menedemos declared now i know where were bound next what to aigina sostratos asked his cousin dipped his head sostratos threw his hands in the air why everything they make there is cheap junk aiginetan goods are a joke all over the aegean what have they got that would be worth our while to carry theyve got silver menedemos said lots and lots of lovely turtles and they have a temple to artemis theyre talking about prettying up artemis is a huntress wouldnt her image look fine in a lion skin ah after some thought sostratos said you might convince them of that you might even have a better chance than at athens i suppose more hides come in to athens than to aigina im sure menedemos kissed him on the cheek exactly what i was thinking my dear and its only a days journey from here he pointed west you can see the island poking its nose up over the horizon islands have noses sostratos said i dont think any philosopher ever suspected that menedemos made a face at him but his own whimsy didnt last long with a sigh he went on i wish we were heading to peiraieus instead without the gryphons skull though whats the point not much no menedemos wasnt heartbroken at the loss of the ancient bones well see how we do somewhere else winds in the saronic gulf were fitful the next day the rowers spent a good deal of time at the oars but they seemed glad enough to row maybe they were eager to escape sounion where two of their comrades would lie forever that wasnt anything sostratos could ask but it wouldnt have surprised him with a circumference of perhaps stadia aigina wasnt a big island these days it also wasnt an important island though that hadnt always been true when the aphroditemade for the polis which lay on the western side of the island sostratos said this place would be a lot better off if it hadnt gone over to dareios before marathon it got what it deserved afterwards eh menedemos said if you want to call it that sostratos replied the athenians dispossessed the aiginetans and planted their own colonists here then after the peloponnesian war the spartans threw those people out and brought back the original aiginetans and their descendants so whos left nowadays menedemos asked aiginetans sostratos said theyre a mongrel lot i suppose but thats true of a lot of hellenes these days if a polis loses a war he clicked his tongue between his teeth he didnt like to think of such things but he refused to shy away from them remember rhodes had a macedonian garrison when we were youths his cousin looked as if he would have been happier forgetting its our job to make sure that never happens again so it is sostratos said if we can he added but only to himself he might think words of evil omen but he would do his best not to speak them aloud whatever their ultimate origins the modern aiginetans spoke a dialect halfway between attic and doric it sounded odd to sostratos menedemos though said they talk almost the same way you do they do not sostratos said indignantly they do so menedemos said they sound like people who started out speaking doric but went to school in athens most of them sound as though theyve never been to school at all sostratos retorted he was proud of the atticisms in his own speech they showed him to be a man of culture to his ear the aiginetans didnt sound cultured at all he and his cousin might have been the asses in aisops fable except that they were dithering over dialects rather than bales of hay all right all right let it go menedemos having planted his barb was content to ease up we made it past the rocks now that were in the harbor well sell the lion skin and make the trip worthwhile rocks sostratos said before menedemos could answer diokles spoke up didnt you notice how carefullike your cousin was steering young sir the approach to this harbors as nasty as any in hellas but he handled it pretty as you please menedemos looked smug praise from a seaman as accomplished as the oarmaster would have left anyone feeling smug and i didnt even pay attention to what he was doing sostratos thought ruefully the next morning the two cousins took their tawny hide up to the temple of artemis which stood close by those of apollo and aphrodite menedemos peered into the one dedicated to apollo we might try here if we have bad luck with artemis priest he said the apollo is nakedcarved from wood looks like and old as the hills that made sostratos look too i wonder just how old that statue is he said people have been making images of marble or bronze for a long time now menedemos only shrugged and with reason they had no better way of learning the statues age than theyd had of finding out how old the gryphons skull was sostratos grimaced wishing he hadnt thought of that comparison he couldnt see attica from here the higher ground of the north of aigina shielded the mainland from his eye which was more than a small relief the marble statue of artemis was draped but only in a carved tunic that didnt even reach the goddess knees why shed catch her death of cold if she didnt don our skin for a cloak menedemos said sostratos looked around wheres the priest he asked seeing no one in the sacred precinct he got no answer either before long an aiginetan ambled in are you the priest menedemos asked him he tossed his head not me nikodromos is probably still in town hes a man who likes to sleep late he is what shall we do till he gets here sostratos asked in annoyance grow moss you might as well pal the local replied he isnt going to get here till he gets here if you know what i mean sostratos grunted the aiginetan had a point another man came into the temple he wasnt nikodromos either he was somebody else looking for the priest lazy sour bastards probably still home snoring he said nikodromos habits were evidently well known he would never have made a seamanbut then he hadnt tried as a priest he could sleep late if he wanted to maybe we ought to find his house in town and throw rocks at the shutters menedemos said a little later just when sostratos was starting to think that sounded like a pretty good idea nikodromos strolled into the temple with a selfsatisfied expression on his face both aiginetans promptly started dunning him for money they said he owed them what followed wasnt quite a screaming row but wasnt far from one either in a low voice sostratos said if we do sell him the hide lets make sure we see the silver before we hand it over menedemos dipped his head ive heard ideas i liked a lot less after half an hour or so nikodromos creditors threw their hands in the air and left he hadnt promised them a thing in an abstract way sostratos admired him in the real world with which he had to deal he wondered if this image of artemis really needed to be draped with a lion skin after all hail the priest said coming up to the two rhodians and what do you want today youve been patient as can be while those idiots spouted their lies he didnt seem too sour to sostratos but then sostratos hadnt been trying to get money out of him his foxy features did not inspire confidence though neither did his squabbles with a pair of aiginetans unconnected to each other nonetheless after naming himself and sostratos menedemos said weve got a splendid karian lion skin here with which you can adorn the statue of the maiden do you indeed nikodromos eyes widened slightly excitement or art sostratos wondered he would have bet on art those eyes were a light brown that in certain lights seemed tinged with amber as foxy as the rest of him or maybe even more so he went on let me see it best ones by all means let me see it menedemos and sostratos spread out the skin on the temple floor then sostratos with a happy inspiration picked it up and draped it over the marble artemis shoulders see how fine shed look he said not bad nikodromos saidsmall praise but praise that skin might remind people of what a great huntress she is true but of course one question remains how much do you want for it five minai menedemos said sostratos hid a smile behind his hand if his cousin would get cheated he aimed to get cheated out of a lot of money nikodromos coughed my dear fellow you cant be serious menedemos smiled his most charming smile ill make it six if you like not so many lions left in europe these days you know and so you think you can charge whatever you please when you bring one here the priest said not quite sostratos told him but no one ever said we had to sell our goods at a loss either five minai is out of the question nikodromos said i might pay two you might indeed menedemos said pleasantly but not to us as my cousin said we need to make money to stay in business well two minai and a half then nikodromos said come on menedemos sostratos said lets head back to the ship plenty of other temples plenty of other poleis they made as if to begin rolling up the lion skin and putting it back into its leather sack sostratos watched nikodromos out of the corner of his eye if the priest let them leave then he did that was all but they hadnt got very far before nikodromos said wait i might go to three we might talk a little more in that case menedemos said nikodromos would have failed as a trader for more reasons than sleeping late he kept coming up and up and didnt draw the line till the price had gone to four minai twenty drakhmai though he grumbled and whined every step of the way he did his best to make it seem as if he were doing the rhodians a favor by dealing with them at all four minai twenty sostratos looked from him to menedemos and back again bargain bargain his cousin and the priest spoke at the same time good enough as far as sostratos was concerned it was better than good enough they hadnt got nearly such a fine price for the other hide back on kos nice solid profit he thought and then nikodromos said let me take the hide back to town and ill bring you your money right away a lot of people had made requests like that over the years more often than not sostratos and menedemos like most traders said yes most people were honest sostratos wasnt so sure about nikodromos he saw his cousin wasnt either smiling menedemos tossed his head you can bring the money here and then well give you the hide or else well come down to aigina with you nikodromos sent him a sour stare youre afraid ill cheat you that is an insult best one we just stood here watching a couple of your own people trying to get money out of you sostratos answered if they have trouble prying their silver loose why wouldnt we were just a couple of foreigners to you better not to take chances i told you the silver they want isnt theirs at all the priest said making a fine show of indignation theyre nothing but a couple of temple robbers with a shrug sostratos said i dont know anything about your quarrels any more than you know about the quarrels back on rhodes all i know is youll have the hide when we have the money he wondered if that would queer the deal if it does too bad he thought that would mean this rogue never intended to pay us in the first place the aiginetans whod tried to squeeze silver out of nikodromos had certainly sounded as if they had a right to it those abandoned rascals blacken my name nikodromos complained easiest way to prove that sir is to give us the price you agreed to menedemos said as soon as we have the turtles well sing your praises at every stop we make of course we wont do anything of the sort if you go back on the bargain sostratos added sometimesoften in factknaves acted like honest men if the choice was having their knavery published to the world knave or not nikodromos let out a loud exasperated sigh come along then both of you he said youll get your money bring the hide let there be no doubt that i am a man who keeps the agreements he makes lets go menedemos said when they got to nikodromos house sostratos wondered whether the priest would be able to pay them at all for no slave opened the door to let them in nikodromos had to do it himself was a man without a slave likely to be a man who had more than four minai of silver in his home it struck sostratos as unlikely he relaxed a little when he saw a woman tending a flower garden in the courtyard a maidservant might not answer the door but at least nikodromos had some help then the priest snapped go back to the womens quarters asine i have traders with me yes my husband the woman said and hurried away though she did look back over her shoulder at the rhodians she wasnt expecting company nikodromos said apologetically its all right best one sostratos said though what he was thinking was just you and your wife how do you get anything done you might as well be peasants or even barbarians quite all right menedemos echoed his tone was all it should have been even so sostratos disliked the way his eyes slid toward the stairway to the second floor the stairway up which asine had gone you barely got a look at her sostratos thought she barely got a look at you why do i thinkwhy do i knowyou want to lie with her if you can why youre my cousin thats why ive seen you around women too many times by now ive seen you land in trouble too many times by now too trying not to think about what might bewhat all too likely wasgoing through menedemos mind sostratos asked nikodromos shall we wait here while you get the money oh i suppose you can step into the andron nikodromos said grudgingly i wont be long in a proper household a slave would have offered them wine and olives or raisins here they simply sat in the mens room and waited well what do you think menedemos asked almost without moving his lips is he lying to us or is he the greatest miser since midas i dont know sostratos answered but im guessing hes a cheapskate would he have had the gall to bring us here if he couldnt pay us well find out menedemos said his wifes pretty did you notice no and i wish you wouldnt have either sostratos said his cousin made a face at him before they could start arguing in earnest menedemos let out a sharp hiss sostratos fell silent hed seen nikodromos coming too the priest carried a leather sack when he set it down on a table in the andron it clinked here you are he said four minai twenty drakhmai go ahead and count it youll see all is as it should be with some men that invitation to count would have told sostratos he didnt have to with one so mean as nikodromos he did anyhow when hed finished he looked up and told the priest im afraid youre still six drakhmai short o marvelous one hed laid the silver coins in neat rows and stacks nikodromos could hardly challenge his assertion in a low furious voice the aiginetan said ill get them and hurried away shameless sostratos said are you surprised menedemos kept looking toward those stairs sostratos noticed that with as much resignation as alarm up till now menedemos hadnt eyed anyone elses wife with desire on this trading run sostratos had started to wonder if his cousin were off his feed before he could warn menedemos nikodromos and asine started yelling at each other sostratos couldnt make out the words but they both sounded furious charming couple sostratos murmured menedemos grinned arent they just still though oh wait here comes the priest back again what had he been about to say maybe i dont want to know sostratos thought nikodromos stormed into the andron his scowl black as moonless midnight he slapped down half a dozen drakhmai there he snarled are you satisfied now perfectly so best one sostratos answered it is what we agreed to after all to the crows with nikodromos began but he caught himself trying to sound civil he said the huntress will be glad to have the lionskin cloak of course she will menedemos sounded as smoothand as greasyas olive oil sostratos suspicions flared hed heard that particular conspiratorial tone before sure enough menedemos went on would you be interested in some fine rhodian perfume sir or evenhe lowered his voice almost to a whisperin emeralds ive got a couple of fine ones straight from egypt now why would i want anything like that nikodromos kept the growl in his voice but leaned toward menedemos even so you never can tell what will sweeten up a woman menedemos remarked for all the world as if he hadnt heardas if the neighbors hadnt heardthe priest and his wife quarreling a moment before nikodromos grunted thats true i suppose for that matter menedemos added as if just remembering i also have some koan silk which is not the sort of stuff every lady in aigina would be wearing do you nikodromos said menedemos gravely dipped his head sostratos sat there putting the coins back in their sack and doing his best not to laugh out loud nikodromos thought menedemos was interested in helping him make up with his wife after their fight and in making some money doing that sostratos knew better oh his cousin wouldnt mind making money off nikodromos but what menedemos really wanted was asine if he sold nikodromos perfume or jewels or silk he would use his visits here to make himself known to hereven if she stayed in the womens quarters while he was aroundand to scout out the ground and see what his chances were maybe you should bring some of these things by give me a chance to look at them nikodromos said not today i should take the hide up to the temple now and ill be sacrificing through the afternoon tomorrow morning not too early tomorrow morning nikodromos agreed ill see you then nikodromos had hardly closed the door behind them when sostratos wagged a forefinger under his cousins nose i know what youve got in mind he said my dear i havent the faintest idea what youre talking about but menedemos eyes danced he couldnt make that sound convincing no matter how hard he tried why arent you swelling up like a toad and telling me what a bad character i am sostratos had been wondering about that himself he gave the most honest answer he could if anyone ever had it coming that petty thief of a nikodromos does well well menedemos said and then again well well he walked on for a few paces before adding theres no guarantee you know dont put yourself in danger sostratos said nikodromos isnt worth it his cousin chuckled of course he isnt asine now asine just may be ill have to see how it goes thats all he tapped sostratos on the chest with his finger one thing though whats that sostratos asked with sinking heart however the other turns out i expect ill make a profit from that polluted priest menedemos said huzzah sostratos said in hollow tones menedemos laughed out loud menedemos rubbed his chin hed taken care to shave before coming up from the harbor to nikodromos house hed done a good job his skin felt almost as smooth as it had when he was a beardless boy he had on the cleaner of his tunics too nikodromos would interpret all that as being no less than his own duehe had plenty of selfimportance how asine would interpret it if she would interpret it at all ill find out menedemos murmured and rapped on the priests door nikodromos opened it himself with what hed spent on the lion skin hed shown he had plenty of money but he was too mean to buy a slave to make life easier for himself and his wife hail he said now wheres your cousin in the market square selling to whoever will buy menedemos answered easily you though best one youre a special customer so im here to show you these goods with no one elses eyes on them as hed thought it would that tickled nikodromos vanity come in come in the priest said he even went so far as to add go on into the andron and ill bring you some wine that wasnt what menedemos had in mind the courtyard might be better most noble one he said it would certainly be better for him because asine would be able to see and hear him but he had a plausible explanation and trotted it out youll want to examine the silk and the jewels by sunlight so i will nikodromos said i dont aim to let anyone cheat me nor should you menedemos said ignoring the threat in the other mans words as he came out into the courtyard he paused to admire the garden what splendid plants how wonderfully green they are even in the middle of the dry season theyre perfectly pruned too with a shrug nikodromos said i havent the time to worry about such trifles mv wife tends them theyre lovely menedemos left it at that he knew better than to give a woman direct praise in her husbands hearing his eyes couldnt help slipping to the stairway and to the rooms above it what would asine be doing in there spinning weaving no probably nothe would have heard the loom surely though she would be listening tomaybe even watchingwhat went on down below he said here is the perfume smell it its from the very best rhodian roses fripperies nikodromos muttered but he drew out the stopper and sniffed in spite of himself one eyebrow rose thats very sweet he rallied id bet the price is enough to sour anybody though not at all instead of naming it menedemos went on let me show you the koan silk any woman who wore a silk tunic would be the envy of all her neighbors wool linen he tossed his head they dont compare in price either yes the priest had a onetrack mind wool and linen are fine for everyday wear menedemos said but your wife will want something special wont she when she goes out into the streets on a festival day after all women dont get out of the house much so they like to make the most of it when they do and she can wear this rhodian scent and these emeralds and be the envy of every other woman in aigina lets see these socalled emeralds nikodromos said i wouldnt be surprised if you were trying to sell me a couple of lumps of glass by the dog of egypt i am not menedemos said indignantly fishing them from the pouch he wore on his belt they come from ptolemaios land as i said people in miletos were happy enough to buy them i made more than a talent on the dozen or so i sold there my father and my uncle have been traders since before i was born their ships go all around the inner sea if i cheat i ruin the firms reputation and we cant afford that here o marvelous onesee for yourself the two emeralds he had left were the ones hed intended to take to athens including the largest and finest stone hed bought from the egyptian roundship captain no one not even nikodromos could claim they were glass after seeing their deep rich color and waxy luster the priest sighed as he handed them back youll want too much he predicted tacitly admitting they were genuine i want what theyre worth pitching his voice to carry up to the womens quarters menedemos asked doesnt your wife deserve the best nikodromos waved his hands and shook his head like a man trying to drive away bees let me see this silk you were gabbling about he said nothing like it for making a lovely woman lovelier menedemos said againhe hopedas much to asine as to her husband this is a particularly fine bolt here look he unrolled it and held it up in the sunlight you can practically see through it thats indecent nikodromos exclaimed only if the woman whos wearing it isnt worth looking at menedemos said with a wink as one man of the world to another my dear fellow you simply wouldnt believe how much silk my cousin sold to the fanciest hetaira in miletos i dont want my woman looking like a hetaira nikodromos said but his voice lost force with each succeeding word why wouldnt a man want his wife to look as desirable as she could you need another sniff of the perfume menedemos pulled the stopper from the little jar again here sweeter than honey isnt it by the way the priest screwed up his face he wanted to deny it but he couldnt what what will you want for all this he asked at last sounding almost fearful for the emeralds nine minai apiece menedemos answered two minai for the silk and twenty drakhmai for the perfume all the prices were outrageously high he knew that with a little luck nikodromos wouldnt hed certainly overpaid for the lion skin he bawled like a branded calf now outrageous he spluttered absurd downright criminal if you want to know the truth menedemos shrugged if youre not interested im sure someone else will want to deck his wife out in style goods like these dont come to aigina every day you know or every year either that was true enough back in the old days that fascinated sostratos so much aigina had been an important polis not anymore it was a backwater now completely overshadowed by athens the aphroditenever would have put in here if not for the pirates the real question was just how much silver did nikodromos have menedemos tossed his head no the real question was how much would he spend if he wouldnt lay out any on a slave would he spend any for his wife if he didnt intend to spend any had he invited menedemos back for no better reason than to waste his time that might make asine unhappy and menedemos had already heard she wasnt shy about letting her husband know how she felt licking his lips nikodromos said i will give you five minai for one of the emeralds one mina for the silk and ten drakhmai for the perfume only one emerald menedemos said using three words to imply the priest was surely the meanest man in the world i cant afford them both nikodromos said something in his voice told menedemos he was lying about that it will tell his wife the same thing the rhodian thought cheerfully nikodromos meanwhile gathered himself for a peevish outburst and i get to choose which stone do you hear me of course menedemos spoke as if humoring a madman then his own voice hardened but you wont choose either unless you come closer to meeting my price he almost said unless you meet my price but that would have given nikodromos no haggling room at all you think you can sail into aigina with your fancy goods and cheat people out of their shoes because we dont see such things very often the priest grumbled since that was exactly what menedemos thought he denied it with special vigor hed made his initial demands so high even nikodromos first counteroffers guaranteed him no small profit and he didnt intend to settle for those first counteroffers once during the dicker that followed menedemos wondered if hed pushed too hard nikodromos stamped his foot and shouted no by the gods not another drakhma take your trash and get out of my house as you wish best one menedemos said coldly a moment later a crash came from upstairs someone had droppedor hurleda pot sure enough were playing to an audience menedemos thought he pretended not to notice the noise or the way nikodromos flinched but gathered up the silk and the perfume and started for the door wait nikodromos said unhappily maybe we could talk a little more maybe menedemos did his best to sound as if he were doing the priest a favor if youre ready to be more reasonable youre the one whos not being reasonable but nikodromos nervously looked up toward the womens quarters as if expecting another pot to shatter at any moment a proverb crossed menedemos mind even herakles cant fight two at once nikodromos might have held his own against menedemos against menedemos and his own wife he had no chance are we agreed then menedemos asked not too much later i suppose so the priest gnawed at a fingernail seven minai fifty drakhmai for the emerald one mina sixty drakhmai for the silk and twelve drakhmai for the perfume he gave the rhodian a triumphant smirk at that last price menedemos smiled back as if acknowledging that nikodromos had beaten him down there he didnt tell nikodromos hed purposely gone easy on the small haggle because hed done so well on the larger ones let nikodromos keep his tiny triumph if it made him happy counting on his fingers menedemos said that makes let me see nine minai twentytwo drakhmai altogether if youll fetch the silver you may choose whichever emerald you like wait here nikodromos said gloomily ill be back a hunted look on his face he scurried into the house menedemos cocked his head toward the womens quarters to his disappointment asine kept quiet but shed already made her presence felt when the priest came back with a fresh leather sack menedemos said if you dont mind im going to take this into the andron i made one small mistake and now everyone thinks im a thief nikodromos said more glumly than ever of course what else would you expect menedemos thought he didnt say that out loud though he was tempted what he did say was not at all im like my cousin though i want to have things straight when hed counted up the coins and put them into glittering rows and stacks in the andron he found that nikodromos payment was four drakhmai over he picked up four turtles and handed them to the priest without a word he was convinced the aiginetan had put them there to test his honesty erthank you nikodromos said a faintly embarrassed expression on his face youre welcome menedemos answered i dont want more than my due just what you said youd pay that wasnt strictly true but nikodromos couldnt know it wasnt a show of virtue made the best shield im sure your wife will enjoy everything youve bought for her he raised his voice a little to say that hoping it would carry up to the womens quarters i want her to nikodromos said i want to get my moneys worth and now if we have no more business that was barely polite enough to be a hint in a moment hed be shouting get out of my house menedemos scooped the coins back into the sack captured a couple that fell on the floor and tried to roll away and headed out the door in a hurry nikodromos all but slammed it behind him as menedemos went he started whistling a persian love song whose tune alexander the greats men had brought back to hellas while he whistled he looked up to the second floor to what he thought were the windows of the womens quarters if one of those shutters opened he would see what happened next if not he would go back to the aphrodite knowing hed pried plenty of silver out of nikodromos a shutter had to open pretty soon he couldnt stand outside the house whistling for very long or nikodromos would figure out why he was doing it fleeing an angry husband after a seduction was part of the game fleeing before a seduction was nothing but an embarrassment menedemos abruptly stopped whistling for a shutter did open the woman who looked down at him wasnt beautiful but she was prettier than nikodromos deserves menedemos thought hail sweetheart he said in a low voice your husbands bought you some very nice things if asine was more faithful than the priest deserved that remained safe enough when her eyes flashed he knew he had a chance what if he did she answered nothing but scorn in her voice i listened to you shaming him into doing it what would it be like to be with a man who cared about what i wanted without having someone else remind him he ought to menedemos grinned hed hoped she would feel something like that had he been married to nikodromos he was sure he would have he couldnt have asked for a better opening he said dear if you want to find out tell me when he wont be home asine couldnt very well misunderstand that she couldnt and she didnt hes going up to the temple tomorrow morning she said hell be there most of the day well well isnt that interesting menedemos said so if i were to knock on the front door thered be only a poor lone woman in the house he winked asine didnt she looked furious hes too stingy to buy me a slave she snapped its a wonder you got him to do this you must be able to talk anyone into doing anything her expression changed now she was paying attention to menedemos not raging at her husband who knows what youll be able to talk me into doing well find out tomor menedemos broke off for she closed the shutter in a hurry maybe nikodromos was coming up the stairs to show her what hed bought when menedemos went back to the aphrodite sostratos greeted him with how did it go by way of reply menedemos handed his cousin the leather sack sostratos hefted it and whistled softly there must be nine or ten minai of silver in hereand thats aiginetan minai too which means theyre heavier than ours nine and a quarter menedemos answered he eyed sostratos with reluctant respect his cousin could be fussy as a broody hen but he knew what he knew how did you figure that out so fast my first guess was in rhodian weight because thats what im most used to sostratos said i know what part of an aiginetan mina a rhodian mina is so i converted from one to the other in my head before i spoke he made it sound as if it were nothing out of the ordinary and so it wasntfor him after a moment he added you squeezed him pretty hard then euge thanks menedemos said the money isnt really what i meant though sostratos said how did the other go menedemos needed a moment to understand him when he did he blinked sostratos wasnt in the habit of asking about his pursuits of other mens wives except to try to talk him out of them you really must dislike nikodromos menedemos murmured his cousin dipped his head menedemos said hes going up to the temple to sacrifice tomorrow im going back to his house euge sostratos said again wear a sword though a sword menedemos tossed his head i intend to use my spear sostratos snorted i know what you intend i dont know what nikodromos and the woman have in mind he may come back to the house when you dont expect him toremember the window you jumped out of in taras last summer or the woman may be playing a different game from the one you think she is wear a sword when menedemos saw asine he saw what he wanted when sostratos thought about her he saw trouble if that didnt sum up the differences between them menedemos didnt know what did but he hadnt seen that trouble himself and he couldnt deny it might be real all right he said ill wear one ill swagger through the streets like a bandit or a barbarian good his cousin said when morning came menedemos couldnt go into town as early as he would have liked nikodromos liked to sleep late and knocking on the door before the priest left didnt strike him as a good idea he made himself wait till the sun stood well above the eastern horizon before leaving the harbor and heading into aigina the bronze scabbard of his sword bumped against his left hipbone at every step a couple of aiginetans gave him odd looks but no one seemed inclined to ask too many questions of an armed man he knocked on nikodromos door as soon as he did his hand fell to the hilt of the sword if asine was playing games of the sort sostratos imagined she opened the door come in she said quick dont hang around for the neighbors to see she sounded practiced at deceit maybe im not the first one whos come in while her husbands away menedemos thought but if she was so practiced should you be wearing that perfume he asked nikodromos is liable to notice it hell think i put it on for him he thinks everythings for him asine didnt try to hide her scorn ah menedemos said politely that fit what hed seen of the priest he smiled at asine when he has such a pretty wife i can understand why he feels that way she studied him as he was studying her youre smooth arent you she said how many times have you done this often enough to know thats a question better left unanswered menedemos wagged a finger at her its better left unasked too he watched her think it over she dipped her head youre probably right so she took a step toward him he put his arms around her she was only a couple of digits shorter than he was she hardly needed to tilt her face up at all to let her mouth meet his her breath was sweet she was somewhere not far from twenty too young to have had much trouble with her teeth the kiss went on for a long time when asine at last drew back amusement danced in her eyes i will say i havent kissed a man who shaves before its different for a moment menedemos mind worked as precisely as sostratos so often did just because youll say it doesnt mean its true is it better or worse he asked and then went on before she could answer why dont we try it again so you have a better idea they did her body molded itself to his her breasts were soft and firm he stroked her hair with one hand the other cupped a buttock before long he was firm himself though far from soft asine rubbed herself against him sweet she murmured he kissed the side of her neck and nibbled at her earlobe his thumb and forefinger teased her nipple through the thin linen of her tunic her head fell back she sighed softly he took her hand and guided it to his manhood her fingers closed on him she squeezed not too hard after a little while he pulled away hed been at sea for a while he didnt want to spend himself too soon come on then she said lets go up to my bedroom they were walking through the courtyard when he said wait asine stopped raising an eyebrow menedemos said why not right here in the sunshine both eyebrows rose this time you are shameless you make me that way menedemos untied the girdle that bound her tunic at the waist then pulled the tunic off over her head when she was naked he bent his head to kiss her breasts her nipples were wider and darker than hed expected faint pale lines marked her belly youve borne a child he said in surprise her face clouded ive borne two neither lived past its second birthday maybe your seed will be stronger than nikodromos i hope so if thats what you want his hand slid down toward the joining of her legs she spread them a little to make it easier for him to stroke her after a while he said bend forward asine did resting the palms of her hands on a stone bench she looked back over her shoulder as menedemos took off his own chiton and poised himself behind her oh she said softly when he went into her he held her by the waisthis skin sundarkened hers almost whiteas he thrust home again and again pausing every now and then to spin out the pleasure for him and for her she shook her head her dark hair flew back and forth she gasped and shuddered and let out a little muffled cry at the same time she squeezed him from within so that he couldnt hold back another instant he drove deep the world utterly forgotten in his moment of joy he patted her backside she started to pull away and straighten up dont he said beginning once more he had been at sea for a while asine looked back at him again well well she said no wonder youve been able to do this before no wonder at all he said so smugly that she laughed he kept on with what he was doing he didnt have to pause this time to keep from spending too soon despite his boast he began to wonder if he would be able to spend at all but panting he managed and brought asine with him too no sooner had he finished than he flopped out of her a third round wouldnt come soon which meant it likely wouldnt come at all he and asine both dressed in a hurry now that theyd done what theyd set out to do they were warier with each other than they had been maybe its just that we arent blind with lust any more menedemos thought as he put his sword belt on again you didnt need that asine told him never can tell who might get home at the wrong time menedemos answered he didnt mention that hed worried asine might be helping her husband play a game of their own she tossed her head hell be out there all day he cares about that more than he cares about me he cares about everything more than he cares about me maybe if my son had lived asine tossed her head again i dont think so he would have cared about the boy but not about me im sorry menedemos said are you why her laughter was barbed as an arrow point you got what you wanted what do you care now how many men had come through the door while nikodromos went to the temple menedemos almost found himself sympathizing with the priest the last thing he would have expected nettled he said i wasnt the only one no asine said you gave me what i needed you couldnt possibly give me what i want what would that be menedemos wondered the answer took shape in his mind almost at once a couple of slaves a better place among the families of aigina sure enough these sweaty couplings couldnt give her that she could get it only from her husbandand he didnt much care whether she had it or not menedemos said the silk and the emerald will help some a little asine saidshe was one of those people who no matter what they had always wanted more menedemos understood that well enough he was the same way himself youd better go she told him yes youre right he wondered if coming here in the first place had been worthwhile he supposed so he hadnt been looking for anything more than a mornings pleasure it had never felt so empty afterwards though asine gave him a kiss as she unlatched the door will you remember me after you sail away she asked ill never forget you he answered it could have been a pretty compliment a polite fib but he heard the raw truth in his voice asine must have heard it too for she smiled pleased with herself shed taken it for praise then as a last favor menedemos didnt tell her otherwise a couple of naked little boys one perhaps eight the other six were playing with a toy oxcart in the dusty street they looked up as menedemos came out of nikodromos houselooked up and started to giggle his ears burned he hurried off toward the market square sostratos waved to him as he came over to the little display the men of the aphrodite had set up glad youre back he called and then well very well thanks and you his cousin rolled his eyes a couple of the sailors whod fetched and carried for sostratos guffawed a third looked blank one of the others leaned close to mutter something to him menedemos couldnt hear what it was but saw the obscene gesture accompanying it the third sailor laughed getting it at last all right sostratos said you didnt get held for ransom you didnt get murdered not that i noticed no menedemos agreed interrupt all you please sostratos told him im still going to ask the questions that need asking for instance can we stay in aigina without worrying about getting knifed whenever we show our faces away from the aphrodite that was indeed a question worth asking menedemos thought about the two giggling little boys they probably werent the only neighbors to have noticed his coming to nikodromos house when the priest wasnt home that meant menedemos tossed his head maybe not another place we cant visit again anytime soon sostratos said with a sigh seems as though theres one every voyage doesnt it this isnt like halikarnassos or taras menedemos said i think im just one in a long line of men nikodromos hates ah like that is it afraid so menedemos didnt feel like dwelling on what hed done so he asked how are things going here sostratos shrugged ive sold some silk and some crimson dye with it and a few jars of perfume but people arent rushing up to buy probably about time to have diokles start pulling sailors out of the taverns and whorehouses wouldnt you say time to leave aigina you mean menedemos said and sostratos dipped his head menedemos thought it over after a moment he did the same he said we might not do badly to head back to rhodes its a little early in the season but only a little and weve gone through most of what we set out with do you know my dear i was thinking the very same thing not an hour ago sostratos said strikes me as a good idea well show a solid profit if we do but if we cruise around for another month without accomplishing much maybe not and i dont mind getting home early at all neither do i menedemos said what a liar i am he thought as the aphrodite glided east through the saronic gulf away from aigina sostratos mournfully peered north toward the mainland of attica there were athens two chief ports peiraieus and phaleron seeming almost close enough to touch there on the higher ground inland lay athens itself the magnificent buildings of the akropolis tiny but perfect in the distance pointing to port he burst out a pestilence take those pirates we should be there now well get there yet menedemos said soothingly but not with the gryphons skull sostratos scowled at his cousin though it wasnt menedemos fault but he couldnt get the picture out of his mind the pirate maybehe hopedwounded undoing the leather lashing that held the sack closed staring in horrified dismay at the skull that stared blindly back and then cursing flinging it into the sea while all his thieving comrades laughed cant be helped we were lucky to get away with our freedom and most of our goods menedemos said he was right again sostratos knew as much but his cool indifference grated so much knowledge wasted sostratos said a lot a littlehow can you tell menedemos remained indifferent you cant even tell for sure whether your philosophical friends would have cared a tenth as much about the skull as you did sostratos bit down on that like a man biting down on a big piece of grit in a chunk of bread and counted himself lucky not to break a mental tooth he didnt know what the philosophers of the lykeion and the academy would have made of the gryphons skull he never would know now he gave back the best answer he could damonax was interested in it damonax didnt care about studying ithe wanted it for a decoration menedemos said that says something nasty about his taste but it doesnt say anything about what a real philosopher would think of it stubbornly sostratos said aristoteles wrote books about animals and the parts that make them up his successor theophrastos whom i studied under is doing the same thing with plants he would have wanted to see the gryphons skull why would he think it grew on a tree like a pine cone youre impossible sostratos said but he laughed in spite of himself maybe that was what his cousin had had in mind little by little athens receded behind the aphrodite sostratos found things with which to busy himself about the ship instead of mooning over the city like a lover over his lost beloved eventually he looked up and saw that it lay far astern i will come back he thought even if it is without the gryphons skull for now though mundane business he asked menedemos are you going to put in at sounion again tonight thats right why his cousin gave him a suspicious look do you plan on jumping ship and heading back to athens even without your precious toy no no no sostratos tossed his head having taken so many barbs sostratos gave one back i was just thinking how handy it was that there are still a few places around the inner sea where you havent outraged any husbands heh menedemos said one syllables worth of laughter but hed never been a man who could dish it out without taking it after a moment he lifted one hand from the steeringoar tillers and waved to sostratos all right my dear you got me that time sounion as far as sostratos was concerned remained as unprepossessing as it had been the last time the aphroditeput in there a few days earlier now at least the ship didnt need to be cleansed of pollution unless adultery counts he thought and they had no dead or dying aboard the setting sun sent gold and orange and crimson ripples across the sea as the akatos anchors splashed down into the water a boat rowed out from the hamlet toward the merchant galley sostratos had seen the man at the oars before but not his passenger a dapper fellow who looked out of place in sounion the dapper man hailed the ship ahoy there who are you and where are you bound were the aphrodite out of rhodes and were heading home sostratos replied told you so said the man at the oars in the small boat the dapper man ignored him will you take a passenger to kos he called that depends sostratos said ah yes the dapper man dipped his head and grinned it always does doesnt it well whats your fare sostratos considered this fellow plainly didnt belong here which meant that for one reason or another he had some urgent need to go east and so the only question was how much to charge him sostratos thought of euxenides of phaselis and how much theyd squeezed out of him for a much shorter trip bracing himself for either a scream of fury or a furious haggle he named the most outrageous price he could think of fifty drakhmai but the dapper man in the boat didnt scream he didnt even blink he just dipped his head and said done you sail in the morning dont you behind sostratos menedemos muttered by the dog of egypt sostratos couldnt tell whether that was praise for him or astonishment that the dapper fellowthe new passenger he was now hadnt screamed blue murder some of both maybe as for sostratos himself he had the feeling he could have asked for a whole mina not just a half and he would have got the same instant agreement he had to make himself remember the mans question thats right he said you pay half then half when we get there i know how its done the dapper man said impatiently ill have my own food and wine too all right sostratos knew he sounded a little dazed but couldnt help it he had to make himself come out with one more question and ah your name is you can call me dionysios son of herakleitos the man answered ill be aboard early enough to suit you i promise he spoke to the local at the oars who took him back to sounion sostratos stared after him well well menedemos said isnt that interesting i wonder what hes running from sostratos said nothing right here in town surely or hed have asked to spend the night on the foredeck something back in athens i suppose he looks like an atheniansounds like one too i wonder who he is menedemos said dionysios son of herakl sostratos began his cousin tossed his head he said we could call him that he didnt say it was his name sostratos thumped his forehead with the heel of his hand he prided himself on noticing such things but hed missed that one menedemos went on he strung a couple of the most ordinary names in the world together is what he did he might have been odysseus telling polyphemos the cyclops to call him nobody trust you to haul homer into it somehow sostratos said but he had to admit the comparison was apt and then his own wits stunned since dionysios so casually agreed to that ridiculous fare started to work again he wants to go to kos he said so menedemos agreed after a moment he snapped his fingers and staying on kos is ptolemaios sostratos finished for him not wanting to hear his own thought hijacked i wonder if hes some sort of envoy from demetrios of phaleron here in attica or from kassandros or if hes one of ptolemaios spies id bet on the last menedemos said ptolemaios has all the money in the world so why should his spies have to quarrel about fares that makes sense sostratos said of course just because it makes sense doesnt have to mean its true ill tell you something else he waited for menedemos to raise a questioning eyebrow then continued whatever he is we wont find out from him well my dear if you think im going to argue about that youre mad as a maenad menedemos said dionysios son of herakleitosor whatever his real name was proved as good as his word he hailed the aphroditeso early the next morning some of her sailors were still asleep carrying a leather sack big enough to hold food and wine and the few belongings a traveling man needed he scrambled up from the locals rowboat into the low waist of the merchant galley hail he said as sostratos came up to him good day sostratos replied i doubt it dionysios replied its going to be beastly hot i hope you dont expect a man to bring his own water along with everything else no sostratos said water we share especially on a hot day and i think youre right this will be one my eyes feel drier than they should and the suns not even over the horizon he held out his hand now if youd be so kind the first part of the fare certainly dionysios reached into the sack for a smaller leather wallet he took coins from it and gave them to sostratos one by one here you are best one twentyfive drakhmai the coins had an eagle on one side and a bluntfeatured mans profile on the other these are ptolemaios drakhmai sostratos said in dismaythey were far lighter than the attic owls hed expected you never said in whose currency you wanted to be paid dionysios pointed out have we got a problem menedemos called from the stern after sostratos explained his cousin asked well what do we do about that shall we send him back to shore unless he comes up with the proper weight of silver wheres the justice in that dionysios demanded im not cheating you out of anything i promised to give so what menedemos said if you dont pay us what we want you can wait for another ship that made the dapper man unhappy try as he would to hide it but sostratos reluctantly tossed his headthat gibe about justice struck home hes right menedemos its my own fault for not saying we wanted it in attic money he took advantage of exchange rates whenever he could it wasnt often that anyone got the better of him but it had happened here youre too soft for your own good menedemos grumbled dionysios son of herakleitos gave sostratos a bow what you are my dear fellow is a kalos kagathos a gentleman me i dont know about that sostratos said more flattered than he was willing to show i do know i expect people who deal with me to be honest so id better give what i hope to get and if that doesnt make you a kalos kagathos to the crows with me if i know what would dionysios said the sun a ball of molten bronze rose over the little island of helena where helen had paused on her way home to sparta after the trojan war almost at once the air began to quiver and dance as it would above hot metal in a smithy those first few harsh beams seemed to scorch the hillsides back of sounion theyd been sere and dry and brown before sostratos knew as much but he could almost watch the last moisture baking out of them now he marveled that he couldnt watch the sea steam and retreat as water would in a pot left over the fire too long papai he exclaimed i hope we have some wind rowing in this will be worse than it was the last time we went through the kyklades dionysios rummaged in his sack again this time he pulled out a broadbrimmed hat which he set on his head i dont care to cook thank you very much he said why dont you go up to the foredeck so the rowers can work freely sostratos said oh of course i dont mean to be a bother dionysios picked up his bag and headed for the bow sostratos went back to the stern and climbed up onto the poop deck he waited for menedemos to rake him over the coals his cousin had earned the right but menedemos just clicked his tongue between his teeth and said well wellthe biter bit i never dreamt hed give me ptolemaios money sostratos said hes as cocksure as an athenian ought to be he speaks good attic greek i expected owls this does make it all the more likely hes ptolemaios man because he uses coins from egypt i should say so well that too but it isnt what i had in mind i was thinking that he acts like a rich cheapskate the way ptolemaios did when we were haggling over the price for the tiger skin sostratos said a rich cheapskate menedemos savored the paradox before dipping his head in agreement thats good he can get anything he wants and pay anything he wants and he knows it but he still doesnt want to pay too much up at the bow capstans creaked as sailors brought up the anchors rich cheapskate or not dionysios son of herakleitos knew enough to stay out of their way sweat and olive oil sheened their naked bodies sostratos swiped a forearm across his brow it came away wet im going to get a hat for myself too he said i dont care to bake my brains today his cousin wet a finger and tested the breezeor would have had there been any breeze to test he sighed thats a good idea however much i wish it werent diokles said im only going to put half a dozen men on a side at the oars and ill change shifts more often than i usually do otherwise well lose somebody from heatstroke sure as sure as you think best menedemos told the keleustes with shouted orders from the captain and the oarmaster the aphroditeleft the little harbor of sounion and started east across the aegean toward kos and then toward rhodes and home sostratos kept looking back towards the north and west towards athens toward what might have been he cursed the pirate whod stolen the gryphons skulland every other pirate whod ever lived those curses felt weak empty the skull was gone and hed never see its like again he wondered if the world would rather than merely cursing pirates menedemos got ready to fend them off serving out weapons to the crew as he had on the voyage towards attica seeing that the aphrodites passenger took a hoplites shortsword from his bag and belted it on around his waist he had the air of a man who knew what to do with it in a dead calm the aegean lay smooth as polished metal under that fierce broiling sun sweat rivered off menedemos as he stood at the steering oars he guzzled heavily watered wine to keep some moisture in him so did the rowers they couldnt pull their best not in heat like this diokles didnt chide them the oarmaster knew they were giving what they could halfway between sounion and keos the aphroditeslid past a becalmed round ship sailors on the tubby merchantman shouted in alarm when they spied the merchant galley had she been a pirate ship they couldnt possibly have escaped the sailors on the round ship shouted again this time in relief when the akatos didnt turn toward them well before noon menedemos decided to put in at keos well fill up our water jars and hope for wind tomorrow he told sostratos i know weve only come about a hundred stadia but even so to his relief his cousin didnt feel like arguing we wouldnt have made kythnos by sundown anyhow and we need the fresh water thats right menedemos dipped his head and the water here is better than the nasty stuff they have on kythnos keos did look greener and more inviting than its southern neighbor though the savage sun was baking it too as the aphroditecame into the harbor at koressia one of the little islands four poleis sostratos remarked this was the place where in the old days they made people drink hemlock when they turned sixtythey didnt want any useless mouths to feed menedemos snapped his fingers i knew that was one of the kyklades but you could have given me to a persian torturer and he wouldnt have squeezed which one out of me sostratos said i remember useless thingsyou know that its also where simonides the poet came from go tell the spartans passerby that here obedient to their laws we lie menedemos quoted the epitaph for the men whod died at thermopylai he wrote a lot of other verses besides that one sostratos said i know but its the one everybody recalls menedemos said im not like you my deari dont come up with the strange things at the drop of a hat sostratos took off his hat menedemos wondered if he would drop it but he only fanned himself with it and put it back on one of his eyebrows rose he studied menedemos the same way hed examined the gryphons skullanalyzing him classifying him finding a place for him in the bigger scheme of things menedemos didnt know that he cared for the place to which his cousin had assigned him it would be higher on the scheme of things than the gryphon surely but how much higher before sostratos could give him the answer therein greater detail than he would like he guesseddionysios came back to the stern considering the price im paying i hoped to get closer to kos my first day out than one miserable little hop the dapper man said i hoped to get closer too menedemos answered but there was no wind and i dont intend to kill my rowers maybe well do better tomorrow wed better dionysios said darkly with a smile even cooler and nastier than the one hed just bestowed on menedemos sostratos said well o marvelous one if our pace doesnt suit you ill give you back all but five drakhmai of your fare and youre welcome to find another eastbound ship here the dull red dionysios turned had nothing to do with the heat the harbor at koressia into which the elixos river ran held no other ships besides the aphrodite only little fishing boats that never got out of sight of the island how long would the traveler have to wait for another vessel bound for kos menedemos had no idea and neither plainly did dionysios with twin splashes the akatos anchors went into the sea sailors wrestled water jars into the boat and went ashore with them the men made for the elixos to fill the jars menedemos said shall we go into the market square with some perfume and a little silk and see if we can sell em here sostratos glance was eloquent i dont think theyve done anything here since they sent a couple of ships to fight the persians at salamis menedemos laughed youre probably right even so though theyre bound to want their women to smell sweet and look pretty i suppose so his cousin admitted but can they pay for what they want always a question menedemos admitted i think its worth finding out next to no one in koressia was stirring as the two rhodians made their way to the agora men stayed in wineshops or squatted like lizards in whatever shade the walls gave them a couple of drunks lay snoring empty cups or wine jars beside them sostratos raised an eyebrow menedemos only shrugged they nearly had the market square to themselves a man hawked raisins while a farm woman displayed eggs and cheeses neither had any customers or seemed to expect anythey were going through the motions of selling no more menedemos had seen that before it always made him scornful come on he told sostratos lets show these people not everybody sleeps all the time his cousin yawned im sorry best one did you say something snorting menedemos raised his voice till it filled the agora perfume from rhodes fine silk from kos who wants to buy we wont stay here long so youd better come quick who wants to buy the man with the raisins and the woman from the farm both stared at them sostratos took up the call and joined with menedemos for a while though menedemos wondered if anyone cared but a couple of doves grubbing whatever they could from the ground koressia wasnt just a sleepy town it might have been a dead one at last though a middleaged man strolled into the agora ail he said dropping his rough breathings as did those who used the ionic dialect what ave you got for sale why im selling doors and roof tiles havent you heard me crying them menedemos thought but sostratos was already displaying a bolt of filmy silk grudgingly menedemos admitted he and his cousin also sold perfume ow about that the kean gaped as if hed never heard of either commodity ow much do you want for em menedemos named his prices adding thats in athenian drakhmai of course keos was part of antigonos island league but had more intimate connections with nearby attica all right the local said let me ave a couple of jars of the perfume and maybe twothree bolts of silk sounds like a pretty good deal you have the money menedemos tried to hide his astonishment ill be back directly the kean replied dont you go away now off he went no faster than he had to he did come back and started piling athenian owls in front of sostratos that should do it he said when he was done why so it does maybe the local couldnt hear how amazed sostratos was menedemos could but at his cousins gesture he gave the man the perfume and the silk thank you kindly the fellow said you got anything else well menedemos hesitated come on spit it out im not going to buy it if you dont tell me what it is the local said if i want it though i will ive got the money youve seen i do so we have menedemos said all right then most noble the other thing i have is a single egyptian emerald now thats something that doesnt come along every day the kean held out his hand lets see it reluctantly menedemos produced the stone half expecting the local to run off with it but he didnt he held it in the sunlight murmuring isnt that pretty when he returned it to menedemos he asked the right question how much without blinking menedemos said ten minai the kean handed back the emerald and spoke in mild protest thats a lot of silver friend but he didnt turn on his heel and walk away instead he said ill give you six menedemos felt like shouting beside him sostratos inhaled sharply but he didnt think the local noticed he tossed his head im sorry but i cant sell it for that without costing myself money the money he was talking about was all profit but the kean didnt have to know that well six minai twenty drakhmai then the fellow said in a quick neat dicker they settled on eight minai fifteen drakhmai for the stone that was even more than nikodromos had paid on aigina the more i ask for emeralds the more i seem to get menedemos thought dazedly and kicked himself for letting others earlier in the trading run go so cheap see you soon the kean said and strolled away menedemos hated to let the man out of his sight would he really come back some of the sweat pouring down the merchants face had nothing to do with the beastly weather in due course the kean did return this time with a bigger leather sack which he handed to sostratos count em out friend if im one or two light ill give em to you count them sostratos did as a matter of fact best one youre one drakhma over he said and handed the kean an owl i thank you the man popped it into his mouth it was heavy enough to make his cheek sag slightly a pleasure to know im dealing with onest men he put that extra coin in on purpose to see what wed do menedemos realized as he passed the kean the emerald the fellow might move slowly and talk like a rustic but he was no fool nikodromos had played the same game but only after hed been caught cheating himself this felt differentnot nearly so annoying a pleasure to know our goods please you sostratos said you might say so the local dipped his head yes you just might say so ail the two of you without any fuss he turned and ambled out of the market square i never even found out his name menedemos thought he called out to the fellow selling raisins ea friend whos that man we were doing business with the fellows eyes got big you dont know kallimedes son of kallias by the way he said it everybody on keos knew him sure enough the raisin seller went on es got bigger wheatfields and more olive trees than anybody else on this island maybe more than everybody else on this island put togetheri wouldnt be surprised no wonder he could afford what we were selling sostratos murmured no wonder at all menedemos whispered back he asked the man with the basket of raisins was he buying our dainties for his wife or for a favorite hetaira kallimedes the raisin seller stared again you must not know him those are bound to be for a pretty boy es mad for boys kallimedes is oh menedemos said in slightly crestfallen tones ha sostratos said menedemos tried to step on his foot but missed his cousin laughed menedemos muttered under his breath he hadnt really intended doing anything with kallimedes wife if the kean had one hed just asked out of curiosity and hed got his answer i think were done here he told sostratos who dipped his head in agreement as they headed back toward the aphrodite menedemos wished he were wearing his sword he hadnt expected to be carrying so much silver but he and sostratos had no trouble not even the panting scavenger dogs found a couple of strangers worth barking at on board ship dionysios son of herakleitos remained in a foul mood youve certainly gone and wasted the best part of the day wasted i should say not o marvelous one menedemos held up the two sacks of coins hed got from kallimedes son of kallias do you see these which do you suppose is more important to me the business i did here or your paltry fare paltry dionysios said youve got your nerve calling it that next to this it is menedemos said youll get to kos soon enough but youre out of your mind if you think i wont do business along the way and youre out of your mind if you think we didnt need fresh water sostratos added were not going to have our rowers fall over dead from working the oars too hard in this heat dionysios looked back toward cape sounion whose headland was still plainly visible in the west i could have swum this far he grumbled if you keep complaining you will swim from here on out menedemos said no trace of smile on his face that got through to the passenger who fell silent the following day dawned as hot and bright as the one before the breeze that came up from the south might have blown from a smithys furnace but it was a breeze menedemos ordered the akatos sail lowered from the yard by the time the sun came up over the eastern horizon the aphroditehad left keos behind are you going to make syros tonight sostratos asked im going to try menedemos answered if the wind holds we shouldnt have any trouble and if we dont run into pirates his cousin added menedemos spat into the bosom of his tunic after a moment sostratos did the same he went on shall i pass out the weapons again just in case maybe youd better menedemos said with a sigh they saw no pirate galleys on the aegean only fishing boats and one round ship that took the aphroditefor a pirate and sped away running before the wind syros rose from the sea ahead of them a sunbaked island much longer from north to south than from east to west the only polis on the island also called syros lay by a bay on the eastern coast menedemos brought the aphroditedown from the north into the harbor he quoted from the odyssey as the akatos anchors splashed into the aegean there is an island called syrie if perhaps you have heard of it above ortygie where the turning points of the sun are it is not very populous but it is good with fine cattle fine sheep full of wine rich in wheat famine never enters that folk nor does any other dire plague come upon wretched mortals but when the race of men grows old in the city apollo of the silver bow comes with artemis he assails them with his painless shafts and kills them there are two cities there and everything is divided in two between them my father was king over both ktesios son of ormenos a man like the immortals thats eumaios the swineherd talking to odysseus isnt it sostratos asked yes thats right menedemos said sostratos took a long look at syros then clicked his tongue between his teeth well if eumaios was telling as much truth about his ancestors as he was about the island he must have been a pigkeeper from a long line of pigkeepers scoffer menedemos said deliciously scandalized but the more he eyed the dry barren landscape beyond the steeply rising streets of the polis of syros the more he realized sostratos had a point he saw not a tree hardly even a bush still he went on it must grow something or no one would live here i suppose so sostratos said grudgingly all the same this is one of those places that prove homer was a blind poet he pointed ahead even the polis is a miserable little dump herodotos never says a word about it and neither does thoukydides i see why not too why should they menedemos said nothing much happens here thats what i mean sostratos said you could live out your life in this polis you could be as big a man here as that kallimedes son of kallias was back on keos and nobody whos not from syros would ever hear of you any more than wed heard of kallimedes in rhodes or athens or taras or syracuse or alexandria at least you have a chance to be remembered here he tossed his head menedemos wondered if bright young men ambitious young men left syros and crossed the sea to some other polis where they could seek their hearts desire he supposed some had to but most surely lived out their lives within a few stadia of where they were born all through the civilized world most people did the heat wave broke that night the northerly breeze that blew the next morning had a distinct nip to it a warning that autumn even if it hadnt got here yet would come menedemos enjoyed that but he enjoyed its steadiness even more now well show that son of a whore what the aphrodite can do he muttered dipping a chunk of bread into olive oil and taking a big bite if the wind holds well make naxos easy as you please diokles agreed and thats a pretty fair days run wind thrummed in the rigging and quickly filled the sail when menedemos ordered it lowered the merchant galley seemed to lean forward letting that wind pull her along naxos lay at the heart of antigonos island league with malice aforethought menedemos asked dionysios son of herakleitos when we get there shall we tell the naxians how eager you are to go on to kos the passengers eyes were cool as marble tell them anything you please o best one its all the same to me he was probably lying about that but hed made his point and menedemos stopped twitting him from naxos to amorgos the next day was an even better run menedemos steered past several little islands that housed a few shepherds and fishermen hed almost gone aground on one of them in the rain on his last trip through the kyklades with polemaios aboard no danger of that here not with the weather fine and sunny but he did have to do several usual days worth of steering before he left them astern sostratos said any one of those horrid little rocks makes syros look like athens and if thats not a frightening thought furies take me if i know what would be menedemos replied he took the aphrodite south and west again the following day to astypalaia where they spoke doric greek like his own rather than ionic a great many fishing boats bobbed in the offshore waters a fertile valley stretched behind the polis which lay in the southeastern part of the island one more place where nobody ever made a name for himself menedemos said to his surprise sostratos tossed his head dont you know the story of kleomedes of astypalaia he asked cant say that i do menedemos admitted who was he a pankratiast back around the time of the persian wars sostratos answered he would have won at the olympic games but he killed his foe in the allout fight and got disqualified he must have gone mad with grief after that he came back to astypalaia and pulled down a pillar that held up the roof for a boys schoolfifty or sixty people died he fled to athenas temple and hid in a wooden chest there but when the astypalaians broke it open he wasnt inside either not alive not dead just gone menedemos felt the hair at the back of his neck try to prickle up in awe and dread what happened then he asked they sent to delphi to find out what they should do and the verse they got back was last of the heroeskleomedes the astypalaian honor him with sacrifices he being mortal no more do they menedemos asked ive never heard otherwise sostratos said a demigod from as late as the persian wars menedemos mused thats strange all by itself although people are saying alexander was divine too theyre saying it all right sostratos agreed what do you think of it i dont know menedemos answered he did things no ordinary mortal could do maybe that does make him divine who knows where humanity stops and divinity starts its not as though there were a neat line between gods and men he poked his cousin in the ribs what do you think i dont know either sostratos sounded uncomfortable even a little annoyed he always hated not knowing he went on he was just a manptolemaios and polemaios knew him im not comfortable with calling anyone a godbut as you say he did things you wouldnt think a mere man could do i wish i had a better answer but i dont i wonder what ptolemaios would say if we asked him well were only a couple of days from kos menedemos said you can do that if youve got the nerve oh im sure hed talk about alexanderalexanders dead divine or not sostratos said now if i were to start talking about antigonos i dont think id want to do that he glanced toward dionysios son of herakleitos whod dropped a fishing line over the side to see if he could catch some opson to go with his sitos in a low voice he added you never can tell who might be listening just then dionysios tugged on the line and hauled a plump mackerel up into the ship it wasnt a mullet or a dogfishno opsophagos delightbut it was a lot better than nothing he gutted it threw the offal into the sea and took out a little charcoal brazier to cook his catch hes got good luck menedemos remarked so he does sostratos said still quietly i wonder where he stole it to that menedemos had no answer the run from astypalaia to kos the next day proved harder work and slower than hed hoped for the wind died away to next to nothing and the rowers had to go to their benches even with a good following wind though menedemos would have been amazed to make the polis of kos before nightfall the aphrodite did reach the western end of the island where he grounded her on a broad fair beach on the north coast shell be easy to get into the water again tomorrow he told sostratos were not carrying enough to weigh her down true his cousin said and we ought to be safe from pirates with so much of ptolemaios fleet in the neighborhood if were not safe here were not safe anywhere outside the great harbor at rhodes menedemos said a couple of peasants came up with honey and olives to sell as sostratos did when buying anything he clicked his tongue between his teeth and gave other signs of distress but after they left he said if people here know its likely to be safe to come up to a beached ship thats the best sign pirates dont come sniffing around very often menedemos dipped his head and tomorrow well put dionysios ashore and then we can head for home ourselves i wonder whether halikarnassos has fallen sostratos said me i hope ptolemaios men sacked it menedemos said his cousin laughed of course you do that would mean whatshisname the fellow with the friendly wife there was likely dead and then we could trade there again without worrying about your getting murdered ears hot menedemos said well thats not the only reason sostratos laughed again sure he was lying through his teeth since he was he changed the subject in a hurry as the aphroditecame into the harbor at kos sostratos shaded his eyes from the sun with the palm of his hand and peered northeast across the narrow channel separating the island from halikarnassos on the mainland no smoke he said no sea battles either the place fell a while ago or it hasnt fallen at all menedemos didnt answer did you hear me sostratos asked i said i heard you menedemos answered im just not listening to you oh sostratos said all right the anger lying under menedemos quiet words warned him hed pushed things about as far as they would go or perhaps a little further now if only menedemos were as good at noticing when he goes too far with me he thought and then laughed wish for the moon while youre at it harbors crowded diokles remarked ships stuffed tight as olives in a jar theres the likely answer sostratos said if ptolemaios fleet is back here halikarnassos probably still belongs to antigonos too bad menedemos said then suddenly he took his right hand from the steeringoar tiller and pointed his voice rose to a shout theres a spot we can squeeze into row you bastards before somebody steals it from us rhyppapai rhyppapai the oarmaster called giving the rowers the stroke the merchant galley slid into the wharf space back oars diokles commanded and then as she came to a halt oöp the men rested at the oars dionysios son of herakleitos leather duffel on his shoulder hurried back to the poop deck as longshoremen caught lines from the aphrodite and made her fast to the quay put up the gangplank he barked at menedemos i have to be on my way menedemos tilted his head back and looked down his nose at the passenger you talk to a skipper like that aboard his ship and hell throw you overboard you wont need to worry about the gangplank then by zeus and you dont go anywhere till you pay us the twentyfive drakhmai you still owe us sostratos added fuming the dapper man gave him the second half of his fare again in ptolemaios light drakhmai even after that menedemos took his own sweet time about running the gangplank over to the pier when he finally did dionysios sprang onto it and went down the pier and into the polis of kos at a dead run whats chasing him one of the longshoremen asked sostratos shrugged who knows some people are just glad to get off a ship the longshoreman laughed sostratos asked a question of his own what went wrong with the siege of halikarnassos oh you were here when that started the longshoreman asked sostratos dipped his head the koan a disgusted look on his face spat into the sea ptolemaios army was on the point of taking the place when who should show up but demetrios son of antigonos with the army hed brought back from fighting somebody or other way off in the east seleukos sostratos suggested i think so the longshoreman answered anyway he relieved the place and put a big new garrison into it so theres no point going after it anymore menedemos made a horrible face too bad he said i think so too the koan agreed halikarnassos was his polis longtime trading rival demetrios came back to anatolia from fighting seleukos you said sostratos asked and the longshoreman dipped his head as was his way sostratos found another question how did he do out in the east well i dont know all the battles and such but i dont think he won the war the koan replied demetrios beat ptolemaios army here but he couldnt beat seleukos army there sostratos thought isnt that interesting ptolemaios had let seleukos go off to the east to cause trouble for antigonos in a new quarter by all appearances seleukos was giving the lord of egypt everything he wanted and then some what other news besides halikarnassos menedemos asked you should have got here half a month ago the longshoreman told him the festival ptolemaios gave when his lady had a boy he grinned reminiscently i drank so much wine my head ached for two days afterwards what did he name the baby sostratos asked he wanted to know all the details why ptolemaios the koan said sostratos frowned doesnt he already have a son named ptolemaios his wife bore the other one not his mistress i think youre right menedemos said the longshoreman shrugged i dont know anything about that hes the richest fellow in the world whos going to tell him he cant have two boys with the same name if thats what he wants not me by zeus nor me sostratos agreed but i wonder how happy his wife will be knowing his mistress has a little ptolemaios too youre too young to have a wife of your own arent you best one asked the longshoreman whose hair was thinning on top and gray at the temples he didnt wait for sostratos to answer but continued you must beyoure nowhere near thirty but ill tell you something youve got that right whether you learned it from your own wife or not shell be steaming sure as sure of course eurydike is back in alexandria and berenikes here along with ptolemaiosthe grownup ptolemaios i mean sostratos said hell go home sooner or later and so will his ladyand so will their brat the koan said and how long hes been away wont matter a khalkos whatshername back there will have plenty to say to him no matter how long it is he spoke with a mixture of glum certainty and gloating anticipation sostratos wondered who ruled the roost at his house no actually he didnt wonderhe thought he could guess something else struck him eurydike is kassandros sister remember he wont be happy if she loses her place one more reason for a fight maybe menedemos said dont the macedonians have enough already sostratos said its not as if they need more theyre like a gang of pankratiasts fighting it out the longshoreman said they wont quit till only ones left standing sostratos thought uneasily of kleomedes of astypalaia hed slain his foe and been disqualified for it nobody disqualified a macedonian marshal who killed a rival or a royal heir unlike athletes the marshals advanced their positions through murder menedemos said now that weve put dionysios ashore here to the crows with me if im not tempted to head straight for rhodes and not spend even a night diokles gave him a reproachful look seeing how hard the men worked through the hot spell skipper and seeing all the miserable goodfornothing places we stopped at on our way across the aegean dont you think they deserve one nights fun in a real polis oh i suppose so menedemos donned a lopsided grin i may even deserve a nights fun in a real polis myself sounds fair the oarmaster said except that once over in aigina you had yourself a pretty quiet run this year we were talking about pankratiasts a minute ago menedemos said i didnt realize everyone was keeping score on me diokles and sostratos solemnly dipped their heads at the same time menedemos made faces at both of them diokles laughed and sostratos said well my dear even if you do go out drinking and wenching tonight im glad you sound as though you want to go home when we set out this past spring you didnt seem to care if you ever saw rhodes again menedemos face frozeand the expression on which it froze was one not far from hatred sostratos took a startled altogether involuntary step away from him after a moment his cousins bleak look faded a little menedemos said id almost forgotten about that and you went and made me remember he sighed and shrugged i dont suppose i can blame you much it would have come back to me when we got into the great harbor what would have sostratos had known something was bothering menedemos but hed had no idea what and he still didnt menedemos had been unusually closemouthedastoundingly so for himall through this seasons sailing he still was he smiled at sostratos and said however strange and sorrowful you may feel about it o marvelous one there are some things you arent going to find out no matter how much research you do no eh sostratos almost made a crack about going on with his investigations but the memory of the look his cousin had given him a moment before made him hold his tongue whatever reasons menedemos had for wanting to stay away from rhodes he was serious about them no he said firmly maybe hed expected a crack from sostratos and was relieved not to get it for his manner lightened again he went on why dont you come drinking and wenching tonight too itd do you good me sostratos tossed his head going around with a thick head the next day isnt my idea of fun he held up a hand before menedemos could say anything oh once in a whilein a symposion say but getting drunk in a tavern isnt my idea of fun well dont get drunk in a tavern then get laid in a brothel instead menedemos smiled once moreor was that a leer whatever it was his good humor seemed restored you cant tell me thats not your idea of fun not after that girl in taras last year the one with hair like new copper every now and then sostratos admitted but not tonight wet blanket i am not sostratos said irately no such thing by zeus you can do whatever you want do i complain about it only when you talk menedemos assured him since he was right or at least partly right sostratos tried a different tack did i tell you not to go drinking tonight did i tell you not to go to a brothel tonight not yet menedemos said funny man sostratos grumbled his cousin bowed as if thinking hed meant it thank you very much that evening most of the sailors and menedemos with them went into kos to revel try not to drink up all our profits anyhow sostratos said as menedemos strode up the gangplank you sound like the pedagogue who took me to school every morning when i was a boy menedemos said but you havent got a switch and he did sostratos spent the night aboard he ate bread and olives and cheese and a fish he bought from a little boy whod caught it at the end of the pier and washed the supper down with wine if i wanted to get drunk i could do it here he thought if he wanted a woman he tossed his head he wouldnt have cared to do that aboard a ship even one called the aphrodite he got little sleep drunken sailors kept reeling back to the merchant galley at all hours at some point menedemos must have come back too though sostratos didnt remember that morning twilight was beginning to make the eastern sky turn pale when he jerked awake yet again at a snatch of drunken song and found menedemos snoring on the planks of the poop deck beside him sunrise woke sostratos for good it also woke his cousin who looked none too happy about being awake if i jump into the sea do you suppose ill turn into a dolphin he asked im sure dolphins dont get hangovers by the way your eyes look id say you were more likely to turn into a jellyfish sostratos answered was the good time you had worth the sore head youve got now from what i remember of it yes menedemos said which wasnt the conclusion sostratos had hoped he would draw menedemos peered through half shut eyes at a couple of welldressed men coming up the quay toward the aphrodite what do they want tell em to go away sostratos i dont want anything to do with em not this early in the morning maybe theyre passengers sostratos said tell em to go away anyhow menedemos answered something sostratos had no intention of doing his intentions turned out not to matter one of the men said menedemos son of philodemos and sostratos son of lysistratos come with us at once if you please there was breathtaking arrogance who says we should sostratos demanded ptolemaios the lord of egypt the man answered he assumed you would come peaceably if not we can make other arrangements what does ptolemaios want with us sostratos asked in surprise thats for him to tell you not me his man answered are you coming sostratos dipped his head after a moment so did menedemos he ran his fingers through his hair to try to make it a little less disheveled im ready he said seeming anything but by all the signs the tramp through town did little to improve his spirits he paused once to hike up his tunic and piss against a wall city stinksdung and unwashed bodies and tanneries and all the otherswere nastier away from the breezes of the harbor his squint got worse as the sun rose higher in the sky when he came before ptolemaios he gave only a perfunctory bow muttering my head wants to fall off you should have thought of that last night sostratos said out of the side of his mouth menedemos sent him a horrible look i hear youre thieves ptolemaios said without preamble no your excellency sostratos said menedemos said nothing but cautiously dipped his head to show he agreed with sostratos im going to have to do this by myself sostratos thought annoyed at his cousin for being useless here but who would have thought ptolemaios would want us be fair no eh the macedonian marshal rumbled thats not how dionysios tells it and i agree with him fifty drakhmai from cape sounion to here thats piracy piracy no sir by the dog of egypt no sir sostratos said ptolemaios raised a bushy eyebrow at his vehemence i tell you it is and i tell you youre talking like a fool sir sostratos retorted both of ptolemaios eyebrows flew upwards a couple of his bodyguards growled ominously sostratos didnt care he was past caring rage almost choking him he went on ill tell you what piracy really is piracys really a pack of howling whoresons swarming onto your ship and killing your men and stealing your goods your your most precious goods hed thought some of the pain from the loss of the gryphons skull had eased now it stabbed him again it happened to us between andros and euboia so furies take your precious dionysios if he calls us pirates nobody held a knife to his throat and made him come along with us he could have taken any other ship he chose furies take you if you call us pirates he didnt quite say that to ptolemaios but it hung in the air a vast silence fell over the andron some of ptolemaios servitors stared at sostratos more eyed the lord of egypt how long has it been since anyone called him a fool to his face sostratos wondered years probably something glinted in ptolemaios eyes amusement or anger sostratos couldnt tell the marshal said if you think you can insult me as you please because you come from a free and autonomous polis youre badly mistaken sostratos made himself meet the older mans stare if you think you can insult us as you please because you rule egypt im right ptolemaios broke in you may be right sir but are you just sostratos asked the last time we were in kos you said you wished youd gone to athens and met platon would he have called that just ptolemaios grimaced sostratos hid a smile a lot of the leading macedonians craved acceptance as cultured hellenes and ptolemaios was indeed an educated man every once in a while someone could turn that longing for acceptance against them ptolemaios gave a sudden sharp dip of the head very well i withdraw the word are you happy now thank you best one sostratos replied bodyguards and courtiers relaxed but i still say that was an outrageously high fare ptolemaios went on shrugging sostratos answered were in business to make a profit sir as i said just now dionysios didnt have to come with us if it didnt please him he might still be in sounion if he hadnt ptolemaios said sostratos only shrugged again ptolemaios gaze sharpened you say you lost your most precious cargo thats not what i heard ice ran through sostratos sir he had to force the word out for he was dreadfully afraid he knew what ptolemaios would say next and the lord of egypt said it i heard you were selling emeralds no not youyour cousin he pointed at menedemos this fellow he talked a lot more the last time i saw him i wonder why that is if you were selling emeralds they were smuggled out of egypt i dont like smugglers i dont like people who deal with them either to sostratos amazementand maybe to ptolemaios toomenedemos burst out laughing bowing to the ruler of egypt he said search me sir here are your guardsthey can look at whatever i have so long as your men dont steal theyre welcome to come aboard the aphrodite and search the ship too if they find a single emerald aboard you can do what you like to me he sold the last one back at keos sostratos remembered he dipped his head my cousin is right sir he told ptolemaios dionysios is trying to get us in trouble because hes angry at the fare he had to pay it could be ptolemaios said sure enough it could be but on the other hand you may be bluffing who knows what kind of abandoned rogues you are he turned to his guards theyve given you the invitation go ahead and search them do a good job of it yes sir the bodyguards chorused they took sostratos and menedemos into separate rooms sostratos didnt know what menedemos went through and hoped it was as unpleasant as his own experience after making him get out of his chiton and examining the garment his belt the little knife on it the leather sheath for the knife and the pouch in which he carried odds and ends they turned their attention to his person they had more practice or more imagination than hed expected their leader ran a finger around inside his mouth and discovered an obolos hed entirely forgotten was in there keep it he told the fellow not me the bodyguard said im no thief he might not have been a thief but he would have made a good torturers apprentice he ran a straw up sostratos nostrils that produced no emeralds but did bring on a sneezing fit he probed sostratos ears with a twig he made sostratos bend over and probed another orifice too he didnt go out of his way to hurt the rhodian but he wasnt gentle about it either he also made sostratos pull back his foreskin before the fellow got any other bright ideas sostratos said let me piss in a pot if im hiding anything up there that will flush it out mmall right the guard said and to sostratos vast relief tossed aside another twig lift up your feet one after the other so i can make sure you havent got anything stuck under your arches as sostratos obeyed he said how likely am i to have an emerald glued to the bottom of my foot especially when i had no idea coming here that i would be searched i dont know how likely you are to have one there friend the bodyguard answered thats why im looking to find out finally for good measure he used a very finetoothed comb one suitable for getting rid of lice and nits on sostratos hair and beard since his hair was wavy and his beard curly and since he hadnt combed them out too well himself that hurt as much as anything else hed been through are you satisfied now he asked when the guard tossed the comb aside pretty much so the man replied either you havent got any or youre a sneakier bastard than most after that less than ringing endorsement he and his comrades let sostratos put his tunic on again hed just slid it down over his head when the other group of guards led menedemos past the doorway and toward the andron his cousin he was not at all sorry to see looked at least as put upon as he felt himselfbut his hair was well combed now the men whod searched sostratos took him back to the andron too well ptolemaios barked no emeralds sir chorused the men whod searched menedemos and the ones whod searched sostratos dipped their heads a guard asked ptolemaios shall we take their ship apart too the way this fellow told us we could ptolemaios thought that over but not for long then he tossed his head no no point to that too many places to hide such small things youd only find em by luck he glowered at the two rhodians im not convinced youre telling me the truth not by a long shot but i cant prove youre not so im going to let you go you did serve me well before thank you sir sostratos said before menedemos could come out with anything that might land them in more trouble i suppose youre welcome the ruler of egypt replied i suppose he jerked a thumb toward the front door meanwhile why dont you go somewhere else and not give me any reason to call you here again yes sir sostratos said thank you again sir he hurried out of the andron menedemos in his wake only after they were out in the street did he pause to let out a sigh of relief many goodbyes to that dionysios menedemos said yes he tried to cover us in dung didnt he sostratos agreed i say we head for home first thing tomorrow morning oh menedemos asked whys that two reasons sostratos looked around to make sure nobody was paying any special attention to them then stuck his thumb in the air for one thing ptolemaios wouldnt find any precious stones hidden on the aphrodite but he would find the account books that talk about them and for anotherhe stuck up his forefinger too he might decide to hold us here till he sends to keos or even to aigina do you want to take the chance now that you mention it no his cousin said good neither do i menedemos said we bought the emeralds in rhodes not in any of the lands ptolemaios rules we didnt break any of his laws to get them i dont see how he really could condemn us for that hes lord of egypt the richest man in the world one of the four or five strongest men in the world sostratos pointed out he doesnt need a reason he can do as he pleases thats what being one of the four or five strongest men in the world means if he catches us lying he shivered and we brought those stones through kos before and what do you want to bet hes made laws against that his cousin pulled a sour face youre probably right no youre certainly right very well best oneyouve convinced me we go out tomorrow morning good sostratos said menedemos chuckled besides id want to spirit you away before ptolemaios makes you shorter by a head for calling him a fool in front of his men did you see how far his eyes bugged out im a free hellene by the gods sostratos said if hes not used to hearing people speak their minds too bad for him he being who he is though its liable to be bad for anyone who does speak his mind menedemos said and sostratos could hardly argue he and menedemos had almost reached the aphrodite when someone called to them from behind alarm ran through sostratos had ptolemaios decided to be difficult after all but when he looked back over his shoulder he recognized the fellow waving to them from up the street hail pixodaros he said what can we do for you today hail both of you the silk dealer answered when i heard youd come back to kos i thought it was a gift from the gods have you any more crimson dye certainly sostratos answered how much do you need how much do you have pixodaros asked let me think sostratos plucked at his beard i believe we have fiftythree jars thats based on what we sold it might be fewer though we had to fight off pirates and they might have stolen a few when they went back to their own ship by zeus labraundeus im glad to see you well and safe pixodaros said may they all go up on crosses may they indeed normally sostratos was among the most mildmannered of men now he sounded thoroughly grim whenever he thought of a pirate picking up the leather sack that held the gryphons skull and leaping back into the hemiolia from the aphrodite his blood boiled how do you keep such good track of whats sold and what isnt menedemos asked him he shrugged i write up the accounts and i remember them it didnt seem remarkable to him he asked a question of his own how do you carry so much of the iliad and odyssey around in your head thats different for one thing the words dont change for another theyre worth remembering menedemos turned back to pixodaros please excuse us best one we do go back and forth at each other i know the karian smiled kinsmen will do that how much dye do you need sostratos asked him as much as you have if you had more i would buy it i have a lot of silk to dye and my ah client wants the cloth as soon as he can get it you can dye a lot of silk with fifty or so jars of crimson sostratos said pixodaros nodded then remembered himself and dipped his head sostratos plucked at his beard again he lowered his voice to ask does antigonos want to give his officers silk tunics or is this for the officers women both menedemos and pixodaros started not antigonosdemetrios his son but how can you know that the silk merchant demanded are you a wizard the fingers of his left hand twisted in an apotropaic gesture sostratos had seen other karians use he tossed his head not at all who but a macedonian marshal could afford so much crimsondyed silk if it were ptolemaios you would have come out and said so it might have been lysimakhos or kassandros but theyre on good terms with ptolemaios now and old oneeye isnt hes the one you have the best reason to be cagey about ah i see pixodaros said trueit is all simple enough once you explain it anything is simple once someone else explains it sostratos thought sourly but before he could say that out loudand he might have menedemos contrived almost by accident to tread on his toe after apologizing his cousin asked pixodaros and what will you give us for the dye the merchant looked pained you have me where you want me i know i only ask you to remember this if you hurt me badly now we have years of dealing ahead where i can take my revenge he gave sostratos half a bow i too have a long memory no doubt sostratos said politely well what does fifteen drakhmai the jar sound like to you what does it sound like pixodaros exclaimed piracy robbery extortion in your dreams you sell it for half that much because you have me because i need it i will give you half that much you gave more than half that much in silk when we stopped here in the springtime sostratos said silk is one thing silver is another pixodaros replied he haggled as fiercely as he could but found himself at a disadvantage the rhodians knew how much he needed the dye that meant they could bargain fiercely while he couldnt at the end he threw his hands in the air all right twelve drakhmai the jar it is bandits both of you how much silver is that altogether lets see exactly how many jars we have sostratos called orders to the sailors they brought fortynine jars of crimson dye up onto the quay he muttered to himself that would be drakhmai all toldnot ptolemaios light drakhmai he added i understand ill be back pixodaros hurried off into kos menedemos snapped his fingers i promised to give a sheep at the asklepeion here if the men healed well after the fight with the pirates now i wont be able to sostratos thought then tossed his head no you promised to give a sheep here if you could or on rhodes if you couldnt as long as you offer the animal to the god youre not forsworn are you sure his cousin asked positive all right good thats a relief menedemos said we do want to leave as soon as we can and thenhe sighedits back to rhodes sostratos still had no idea what troubled him there he wondered if he would ever learn walking into the andron of the family house menedemos felt himself shrinking from a man to a youth perhaps to a little boy when he sailed the aegean he dealt with prominent merchantssome of them older and richer than his fatheras equal to equal they saw him as he was today in philodemos eyes he fell back into the past he knew he always would as long as his father lived not as good a run as you had last year philodemos said we made a solid profit sir menedemos said and we took fewer risks than we did last year when hed come home the previous fall philodemos had done nothing but complain about the chances hed taken in great hellas now his father said well those risks paid off here you might as well have stayed in rhodes and done your trading at the harbor the way himilkon the phoenician does that wasnt fair even so menedemos didnt argue in his fathers eyes he was almost certain to be wrong instead he changed the subject ill want to talk with himilkon before we go out again next spring sostratos thought we might sail east to phoenicia and get rid of one set of middlemen on goods from that part of the world your cousin has good sense philodemos said that was true had he left it there menedemos wouldnt have minded but he added why dont you ever have good ideas like that menedemos could have claimed going east as his own notion it had been as much his as sostratos had he done so though he knew his father would have found some reason not to like it icant win he thought but arguing with his father wouldnt get him anything either he gave up saying its good to see you well i could be better philodemos said my joints pain me as those of a man with my years will old age is a bitter business no doubt about it after a sip of wine though he admitted it could be worse too i will say my teeth are still mostly sound and i thank the gods for that i wouldnt want to have to live out my days on mush i dont blame you menedemos said his father said you did well with those emeralds how much were you getting for those last few when menedemos told him he whistled thats good thats very good thank you are you well menedemos wondered are you sure you wont hurt yourself saying i did something right i feel i ought to pay my fair share of what you made for them not what they cost you philodemos said oh so thats it menedemos thought say what you will about himand i can say plentymy fathers as stubbornly honest as sostratos aloud he said you can do that if you feel you must sir but if anyones entitled to buy at wholesale not retail its the founder of the firm that won him a smileno mean feat seeing how spikily he and his father got along philodemos said you may be right ill talk with my brother and see what he thinks all right menedemos said that was where things would matter sure enough as far as this line of the family was concerned it was just a matter of two accounts for the same silver but to uncle lysistratos it would be a question of whether the money belonged in the firms account or out of it menedemos went on i still think hed do the same thing he might well his father replied but if he did he would ask me and so ill ask him how does your wife like the stone the question put menedemos on dangerous ground not so dangerous as it might be for his father had no inkling of what he felt for baukis but dangerous even so he knew as much and asked anyhow philodemos smiled again this time not at menedemos but at the world at large his lean rather pinched features softened for a moment he seemed a different man and one much easier to like he said timakrates the jeweler mounted it in a splendid ring and she was glad to get it how glad was she how did she show it menedemos could picture the answers to those questions readily enough he shook his head trying to get the pictures out of his mind to keep his father from thinking he was unhappyand to keep him from jumping to more unfortunate and more accurate conclusionshe said i hope she gives you a son seeing as another son would make your portion less thats a generous thing for you to say philodemos didnt sound suspicious but did sound surprised maybe youre growing up after all maybe i am menedemos was convinced hed grown up some years before he was also convinced his father would never believe it he asked how are things between her and sikon that was a safer question his father snorted you know cooks hes convinced he rules the roost if you try to tell him anything else he starts screaming that nobody will be able to eat his food any more and that well never manage another proper dinner party again he spends money as though he stamped it himself he doesnt steal much menedemos said everything he makes is good if we can afford good opson why shouldnt we enjoy it on the instant philodemos features returned to the hard cast menedemos knew so well yes if if on the other hand mullet and squid and dogfish bankrupt us then we should keep a closer eye on what he spends you may not care about such things who says i dont menedemos broke in his father ignored him but baukis believes in watching where the drakhmai go we still eat well but well have some silver left for you to squander when you do come into your inheritance thats not fair im making us money menedemos said less than last year philodemos said again menedemos made as if to tear his hair last year you called me an idiot for taking some of the chances i took i took fewer chances this year and we made less money now you complain about that how can i please you its simple he thought cant lower your voice do you want the slaves hearing all our business philodemos said no all menedemos wanted was to get away that was generally true whenever he talked with his father it had been true before philodemos wed baukis and was doubly true these days now he wantedhe neededto escape rhodes altogether not just the andron or the house and he would be stuck here till spring with a growl that might have come from the throat of a cornered wolf he got to his feet if youll excuse me father he went into the kitchen where sikon was expertly shucking boiled prawns out of their shells the cook was chewing as he worked which meant hed sampled a few or maybe more than a few philodemos fed his slaves well he wouldnt mind that and whod ever heard of a scrawny cook or at least of a scrawny cook worth having but when the door opened sikon looked up in alarm when he saw menedemos coming in he relaxed gods be praised its just you sir i was afraid it might be the lady he rolled his eyes and let his head twist bonelessly in a gesture he must have filched from the comic stage shell learn menedemos said uncomfortably he didnt like to hear anyone criticize baukis that had little to do with her position as manager of the household much more with the position he would have liked her to stop that he shouted at himself as he did several times a day sikon of course had no idea what he was thinking had the cook known he wouldnt have dared roll his eyes again and say maybe she will but when and will she drive me daft before she does she fusses over every obolos i spend youve got to make her happy menedemos said and sternly told himself not to pursue that line of thought either make her happy sikon howled peeling another prawn how am i supposed to manage that short of serving nothing but barley porridge for the next six months i think her mother must have been frightened by a tunny while she was in the womb menedemos pointed to the prawn shells and the tiny bits of flesh clinging to them instead of throwing those in the street in front of the house why dont you give them to her to bury in the garden theyll make her flowers and herbs grow better and shes bound to like that is she if you want to know what i think i think shes more likely to grill me about how much the polluted prawns cost the cook said as menedemos did when his temper began to rise he drummed his fingers on the outside of his thigh sikon recognized the danger sign all right all right ill give them to her and i hope it does some good thats all ive got to say it wasnt all he had to say nor anywhere close to it and he said still more when menedemos reached out and hooked a fat prawn from the bowl into which hed been tossing them mouth full menedemos retreated a moment later he wished he hadnt baukis had come down from the womens quarters and was picking up a hydria so she could water the garden hail she called to him hail he answered his gaze flicked to the andron sure enough his father still sat inside he would have to be all the more careful about what he said then but before he had a chance to say anything sikon stormed out of the kitchen both hands full of prawn shells he all but threw them at baukis feet here you are my lady he said theyll make good manure for the plants i hope she looked startled plainly sikon had never done anything like that before thank you she said youre right they will but then she asked how much did you pay for the prawns the cook glared at menedemos i told you so his eyes said then reluctantly he turned back to baukis i got a good price for them im sure theyll be very tasty menedemos said in fact i know theyll be very tasty because i tasted one since hed suggested this course to sikon he had to back him now baukis said tasty is one thing expensive is something else what exactly did you pay for the prawns sikon having no choice the cook told her she fixed him with a stony glance what would you call a bad price if thats a good one defiantly sikon answered ive paid plenty more in years gone by andhe folded his arms across his chestnobody complained either the macedonians and persians lined up against each other at gaugamela could not have glowered with greater ferocity menedemos in the middle feared he might be torn limb from limb peace both of you he said that isnt a dreadful price he found himself wishing his father would come out of the andron and help him if that wasnt a measure of his alarm and desperation he couldnt imagine what would be philodemos stayed where he was he had too much sense or too little courage to jump into the middle of this battle under menedemos protection sikon preened and swaggered baukis looked as if hed stabbed her in the back if you care more about your belly than about what this house really needs she didnt finish the sentence but turned on her heel and stalked toward the stairs leading up to the womens quarters menedemos watchedhe couldnt help watchingthe furious roll of her hips beside him sikon cackled with glee thank you kindly sir the cook said i guess you told her i guess i did menedemos said dully he scowled at sikon could those prawns possibly be good enough to make up for getting baukis angry at him he doubted ambrosia from olympos would be good enough for that and i looked under the rowers bench sostratos said and the sack with the gryphons skull in it was gone one of those polluted pirates had stolen it what id do to that son of a whore if i could im sorry erinna said and then with something like awe ive never seen you so angry before sostratos looked down at his hands of themselves theyd folded into fists when he willed them open the marks of his nails were printed on his palms more than a little sheepishly he smiled at his younger sister if you think im angry now you should have seen me when it happened so much knowledge that might have been so important gone forever i was beside myself a fly landed on erinnas arm she brushed at it and it darted away gyges the majordomo here had heard from philodemos cook next door that baukis was using fish offal to fertilize her garden erinna had started doing the same thing maybe the plants appreciated it sostratos was certain the flies did the one that had been on erinnas arm landed on his leg he smashed it it fell in the dirt a tiny gecko darted out from between two stones seized it and disappeared again sostratos wiped his hand on his chiton his sister sighed being a man being able to do all those things go all those places must be wonderful not always sostratos said dryly i could have done without pirates trying to kill me or sell me into slavery erinna flushed well yes but most of the time you know what i mean you usually know what i mean sostratos coughed thank you that was a rare compliment he couldnt imagine anyone else saying such a thing to him menedemos no not likely and he couldnt imagine saying such a thing to anybody else himself not even to erinna she asked him a question that surprised him you know damonax son of polydoros dont you of course i do sostratos answered i took the gryphons skull to show him this past spring remember he tried to buy it from me now i wish id let him do it he frowned why do you want to know you were at the gymnasion yesterday when he stopped by erinna said he might be interested enough in marrying into the family not to care so much about how old i am youre not old sostratos said loyally youre only nineteen thats old for a girl to be marrying erinna said he couldnt very well argue with her because she was right shed been only fourteen when she wed for the first time but he said isnt damonax already married he was erinnas face clouded his wife died in childbirth not long after you set out for kos hes looking to marry again of course from what father said he wants a bigger dowry because im older he would sostratos said but that wasnt anything out of the ordinary whats he like erinna asked i got a glimpse of him as he was leaving and hes more than goodlooking enough but that only goes so far whats he like sostratos had never thought he might be describing damonax as a possible husband would i want him for a brotherinlaw he wondered he wasnt sure he said hes bright enoughhe studied in athens before i did you know i dont think hes as bright as he thinks he is but how many people are hes not stingy not from anything ive ever seen ive never heard anything bad about him he hadnt heard that much praise for damonax either he went on when he wants something he really wants iti have noticed that about him but thats not necessarily good or bad would you want him in the family erinna asked that was the very question sostratos was asking himself since he had no good answer for it he gave back a question of his own what does father think he didnt send damonax away with a flea in his ear his sister said hesthinking things over i guess youd say good these dickers can take a long time sostratos said the one for your first marriage did i probably remember that better than you doyou were still a girl then i didnt have much to do with it erinna agreed but its different now im not a girl any more and i dont want this dicker to take a long time because im not getting any younger time is a terrible enemy sooner or later it always wins erinna sprang to her feet and hurried upstairs to the womens quarters sostratos stared after her oh dear he thought that wasnt what she hoped id say at all then he realized something else no matter what father thinks she wants to marry damonax he must feel like a second chance for her do i want damonax in the family if i dont have i got any good reason for not wanting him and why does he want to join us were tradesfolk and hes got land is he in debt those were all good questions he had answers for none of them he couldnt ask his father lysistratos was down at the harbor from what erinna said his father was at least thinking about the match that was interesting erinna no doubt found it much more than interesting a bumblebee buzzed through the garden sostratos went into the andron hed been stung before and didnt care to get stung again after a while the bee had drunk its fill and went away sostratos returned to the courtyard threissa the familys redheaded thracian slave girl came out with her arms full of freshly washed tunics and mantles she started spreading them in the sun to dry hail sostratos said hail young master she answered in her oddly accented greek carrying a load of wet clothes had got the front of her own tunic wet too so that it clung to her breasts sostratos eyed her she noticed him doing it and spoke quickly you excuse me please young master i terrible busy he took her up to his bedroom every so often she was only a slave girl how could she say no even asking him to wait would have landed her in trouble in some households but taking her for his own pleasure while she was in the middle of work would have landed him in trouble with his mother and sister and since she was more resigned to their occasional couplings than eager for them he was less eager for them himself than he might have been and so he said all right threissa though he didnt leave off eyeing the way the wet wool displayed her nipples i thank you young master she said you a kind man despite such praise she stood with her back to him as much as she could terrible to be a slave sostratos thought terrible to be a woman and not a man and if youre unlucky enough to be both what can you do turn your back and hope no more gods be praised im a free man he might have gone upstairs with her when she finished spreading out the clothes but his father got back while she was busy there lysistratos looked pleased with himself saying i may have a deal for some olive oil of the very first pressing that wont be long now the fruits getting on toward being ripe thats good father sostratos said but whats this i hear about damonax son of polydoros sniffing around after erinna well i dont quite know what it is lysistratos answered its all very tentative right now but she should be married again if we can arrange ityou know that and i wouldnt mind a connection to damonaxs familyi wouldnt mind that at all i understandtheyve owned land for generations sostratos said why do they want anything to do with us though have they fallen on hard times that occurred to me too but not that i know of his father said i am sniffing aroundim sniffing around like a scavenger dog sniffing for garbage as a matter of fact havent found anything out of the ordinary yet there must be something otherwise he wouldnt be willing to join with mere tradesmen sostratos smiled a sour smile people whose wealth lay in land always looked down their noses at those who made money by their wits land was safe stable secureboring too sostratos thought actually son you had something to do with it lysistratos said me sostratos voice was a startled squeak what how seems you impressed damonax no end when you wouldnt sell him the gryphons skull this spring lysistratos told him i wish i had then it would still be here thats as may be his father said but damonax thought all merchants were whores and theyd do anything for money he knew youd gone to athens to the lykeion but when you put knowledge ahead of silver that opened his eyes not many gentlemen would have done the same was how he put it did he sostratos said and lysistratos dipped his head thats surprising sostratos went on in musing tones what i was afraid of at the time was that he would call for half a dozen burly slaves and keep the gryphons skull i thought he was admiring that not my integrity you never can tell no you never can lysistratos agreed would you want him in the family ive been thinking about that before what you said just now i would have told you no sostratos answered now he shrugged and let out a rueful chuckle now im so flattered my advice probably isnt worth a thing oh i doubt that if theres one thing i can rely on son its that you keep your wits about you thank you sostratos said though he wasnt quite sure his father had paid him a compliment he might almost have said coldblooded arent you sostratos chuckled again compared to say his cousin he was coldblooded and he knew it after some thought he went on do i want damonax in the family erinna wants the match i know that it would be a step up for us if hes not after our money to repair his fortunes actually it would be a step up for us even if he is but i dont think i care to take that kind of step i told you you keep your wits about you his father said i dont care to either i didnt think you did sir sostratos plucked at his beard damonax isnt badlooking he isnt stupid and he isnt a churl if hes not hiding something from us erinna could do worse fair enough lysistratos said i was thinking along the same lines ill keep talking with him then we have some haggling to do he wants a big dowryyou already knew that didnt you sostratos dipped his head he has some reason to ask it because erinnas a widow not a maiden but if he wont come down if he cares more about the dowry than he does about her thats a sign his own affairs arent prospering good pointvery good lysistratos said well take a few steps forward and well see thats all menedemos spent as much time as he could away from the house that kept him from quarreling with his father and it kept him from having much to do with his fathers wife he exercised in the gymnasion he strolled through the agora looking at what was for sale there and talking with other men who came there to look and to talk all sorts of things came to the marketplace at rhodes he kept hoping he would see another gryphons skull if he did he intended to buy it for his cousin he had no luck there though and when he wasnt at the gymnasion or the agora he went down to the harbor not many ships came in much more than a month after the autumnal equinox but the harbor stayed busy even so with new vessels abuilding and old onesthe aphrodite among them hauled up on the beach for repairs and refitting the talk was good there too though different from that in the market square centered on the sea much less concerned over either the latest juicy gossip or the wider world youre lucky youre here and not in shackles in a slave market in carthage or phoenicia or crete a carpenter said driving home a largeheaded copper tack that helped secure lead sheathing to a round ships side believe me khremes i know it menedemos answered a pestilence take all pirates everyone working on the merchantman dipped his head in a savage mood menedemos went on and if the pestilence doesnt take em the cross will do id like to see that myself khremes said but those whoresons are hard to catch remind mei heard your story but this bit didnt stickwas it a pentekonter that came after you or one of those godsdetested hemioliai a hemiolia menedemos said to the crows with the whoreson who first thought up the breed he must have been a pirate himself i hope he ended up on a cross and died slow theyre only good for one thing might as well be women khremes broke in and all the men in earshot laughed that hit closer to the center of the target than menedemos would have liked to keep anyone else from guessing he took the gibe a step further with a bit of doggerel every womans gall but she has two moments in bed and dead euge khremes exclaimed and put down his hammer to clap his hands the other carpenters and the harborside loungers bending an ear dipped their heads thanks menedemos said thinking ill have to remember that one and spring it on sostratos when hes got a mouthful of winesee if i can make him choke he made himself go back to hemioliai cursed ships are only good for darting out to grab a merchantmanand for showing a pair of heels to anything honest that chases em sometimes a triremell catch em khremes said picking up the hammer once more and choosing another short copper tack sometimes menedemos said morosely not often enough and we all know it the rhodians dipped their heads again a lot of them had pulled an oar in one of the polis triremes or in one of the bigger heavier warships that were fine for battling their own kind but too slow and beamy to go piratehunting despite their swarms of rowers khremes started hammering away a man who looked as if he had a hangover winced and drew back from the round ship as the carpenter drove the tack home he said dont know what to do about it triremes are the fastest warships afloat and they have been foroh i dont know a mighty long time anyways forever you might almost say sostratos would know how long probably to the hour menedemos thought he didnt himself not exactly but he had some notion of how things worked he said biremes are faster than pentekonters because they can pack just as many rowers into a shorter lighter hull hemioliai are especially little and lightthe back half of that upper bank of oars only gets used parttime triremes are a lot biggern twobankers one of the loungers said menedemos dipped his head truth but they pack in a lot more rowers too so they go just about as fast and the extra weight makes em hit a lot harder when they ram what we could really use is a trireme built fast and light like a hemiolia maybe with the same way to stow mast and yard where the back half of the thranite bank of oarsmen work hed been talking to hear himself talk he hadnt expected anything particularly interesting or clever to come out but khremes slowly put down the hammer and gave him a long thoughtful look by the gods best one i think you may have thrown a triple six there he said menedemos listened in his own mind to what hed just said he let out a soft whistle if we wanted to we really could build ships like that couldnt we he said we could no doubt about itwe could and i think maybe we should khremes said theyd be quick as boiled asparagus they would and theyd have enough size and enough crew to step on a hemiolia like it was a bug one of them would be a hemiolia near enough menedemos said an oversized hemiolia a hemiolia made from a triremes hull you could call it a he groped for a word he didnt think the one he came up with really existed in the greek language but it suited the idea so he used it anyway a trihemiolia you might say whether that was a word or not it got across what he wanted for khremes dipped his head excitement in his voice the carpenter said when i close my eyes i can see her on the water shed be wicked fastfast as a dolphin fast as a falcon a trihemiolia it came off his tongue more readily than it had from menedemos you ought to talk to the admirals sir furies take me if im lying a flotilla of ships like that could make a big pack o pirates sorry they took up their trade do you think so menedemos asked but he could see a trihemiolia in his minds eye too see it gliding over the aegean swift and deadly as a barracuda khremes pointed north and west toward the military harbor if you dont find one of the admirals at the ship sheds id be mighty surprised and by the gods i think this is something they need to hear come with me will you menedemos said suddenly and uncharacteristically modest after all youre one of the men whod have to build a trihemiolia if there were to be such a thing the carpenter stuck the hammer on his belt carrying it where a soldier would have worn a sword lets go ship sheds lined the military harbor big wide ones that held the fives rhodes used to defend herself against other naval craft smaller ones for the triremes that hunted pirates when not on patrol or on campaign war galleys were hauled up out of the water so their hulls stayed dry and light and swift a few guards tramped back and forth by the ship sheds when menedemos and khremes came up to one of them and asked their question the fellow dipped his head which made the crimsondyed horsehair plume on his helmet nod and sway he pointed with his spear yes as a matter of fact admiral eudemos just went into that shed there the freedoms been having trouble with her sternpost and he wants to make sure they got it fixed when menedemos walked into the shed that housed the five his eyes needed a few heartbeats to adjust to the gloom he heard eudemos before spotting him up on the deck of the war galley you really think shes sound this time he was asking a carpenter yes sir i do the man answered all right shed better be eudemos said nothing much wrong with having troublethats going to happen but taking three tries to fix it thats a shame and a disgrace he noticed menedemos and khremes at the mouth of the shed and raised his voice to call out to them hail the two of you what do you need for a moment menedemos didnt know what to say come on fool he told himself youve got something to sell same as you would in the agora that steadied him sir ive had an idea that might interest you he said its a good one admiral khremes added that you khremes eudemos said he might not have recognized menedemos voice but he knew the carpenters at once youve got pretty good sense if you say its worth listening to ill hear it he came down the freedoms steeply sloping gangplank and hurried toward menedemos and khremes menedemos got the notion he did everything in a hurry he was somewhere in his forties with a graying beard a jutting nose and hard watchful eyes ah philodemos son he said to himself placing menedemos all right you know a little something about ships anyway say on menedemos did finishing too many pirates get away if we had some ships like these maybe some of them wouldnt thats what im hoping for he waited to see how eudemos would take the idea the admiral had heard him out without giving any sign of what was in his mind once menedemos finished eudemos said not a word to him instead turning to khremes and asking can we build such ships yes sir the carpenter answered yes sir without a doubt we can they might even be cheaper than ordinary triremes youd want em lightyou wouldnt close in the whole deck or build on an oarbox of solid planks so youd save timber that got eudemos attention isee he said and turned back to menedemos youve given me something new to think about and that doesnt happen every day a whole new class of warship euge i was just passing the time of day with khremes when i said something that struck both of us menedemos said that was when we came looking for you eudemos briskly dipped his head having a good idea is one thing knowing youve had a good idea is something else again people have lots of good ideas when theyre just passing the time of day usually they keep right on talking and forget all about them you didnt a trihemiolia eh he tried the unfamiliar word then dipped his head again a lot of pirates may be sorry you didnt too by the gods i hope so menedemos growled yes youre another one who got attacked arent you the admiral said i certainly am sir well as i say the pirates who struck you and a lot of their mates may be sorry they did it that may prove one of the most important bits of piracy since paris stole helen but not the way the pirates had in mind eudemos sounded as if he thought it was sostratos thought it was one of the most important bits of piracy of all time too on account of that polluted gryphons skull menedemos thought but then the admiral has to think straighter than my cousin do you read and write eudemos asked khremes some sir nothing fancy the carpenter answered this doesnt need to be fancy eudemos said write me up a list of what all would go into making a trihemiolia as best you can figure base it on what goes into a trireme of course ill do it khremes said good eudemos clasped menedemos hand and good for you too youve earned the thanks of your polis menedemos bowed low those were words that struck home what hellene could hope for more most noble one a trihemiolia eh sostratos said as he and menedemos made their way through the streets by the great harbor toward himilkon the phoenicians workhouse thats right his cousin answered like i was saying the gods might have put the word on my tongue day before yesterday if the gods gave you the word why didnt they give you one that was easier to pronounce sostratos asked a threeoneandahalfer people will be trying to figure out what that is for years admiral eudemos didnt have any trouble menedemos said hes an admiral sostratos retorted he worries about the thing itself not about the word do you know what you remind me of menedemos said you remind me of aiskhylos down in hades house in aristophanes frogs where hes criticizing euripides prologues but i dont think the trihemiolia is going to lose its little bottle of oil the way the prologues kept doing well all right sostratos said id be the first to admit eudemos knows more about such things than i do generous of you menedemos remarked sostratos wagged a finger at him you shouldnt be sarcastic my dear you dont do it well and thats something i do know something about menedemos made a face at him sostratos laughed hyssaldomos himilkons karian slave was puttering around by the ramshackle warehouse looking busy while actually doing nothing in particular sostratos snorted every slave in the world learned that art seeing the two rhodians approach gave hyssaldomos a legitimate excuse for doing something that didnt involve much real work he waved to them and called hail both of you you looking for my boss thats right sostratos answered is he there you bet he is the slave said ill go fetch him i know hell be glad to see you he ducked inside of course he will sostratos muttered after we bought the peafowl from him hes got to be sure he can sell us anything we made money from them menedemos said by the time we got rid of them id sooner have served them up roasted at a symposion sostratos said familiarity had bred contempt he was and would remain a hater of peafowl before menedemos could answer himilkon emerged from the warehouse hyssaldomos behind him the phoenician wore an anklelength wool robe not badly suited to the raw autumn day gold hoops glittered in his ears a black bushy beard tumbled halfway down his chest he bowed himself almost double hail my masters he said in gutturally accented but fluent greek how may i serve you today sostratos found the phoenicians oily politeness excessive as far as he was concerned no free man should call another one master hail he answered doing his best to hide his distaste wed like to talk with you about your homeland if you dont mind himilkons bushy eyebrows leaped upward about byblos he said of course my friend to you i shall gladly reveal the secrets of my heart he bowed again sostratos didnt believe him for a moment on the other hand he didnt think himilkon had expected to be believed not just about byblos menedemos said about phoenicia in general and the countries thereabouts and the kinds of goods we might expect to find in them ah intelligence glittered in himilkons black black eyes you think to sail east next spring weve talked about it sostratos said if we do wed like to learn as much as we can beforehand wise very wise himilkon gave him yet another bow most hellenes if you will forgive my saying so charge ahead first and think of questions afterwardsif they ever do i might have known you would be different one more bow erthank you sostratos wondered if that was a real compliment aimed at him or just more phoenician flattery he couldnt tell himilkon rounded on his slave dont stand there with your ears flapping in the breeze you lazy worthless goodfornothing rogue go inside and fetch us some wine and a bite to eat and dont take all day doing it either right boss if his masters outburst frightened hyssaldomos the karian hid it very well he sauntered into the warehouse i ought to give him a good whippingfind out if hes really alive himilkon grumbled what do you have in mind buying my masters and what will you take east to sell well obviously as long as were in the country well look to buy some of the crimson dye they make in the phoenician towns menedemos said himilkon nodded hed lived in rhodes a long time but still didnt usually show agreement as a hellene would yes of course he said you already know something of the qualities to look for there for it comes west often enough what else balsam sostratos answered we bought some in knidos from a couple of phoenician traders and we did well with itbetter than i thought we would if we could get it straight from the source wed make even more before himilkon could reply his slave came out with wine and cups and some barley rolls and a bowl of olive oil on a wooden tray just set it down and go away himilkon told him i dont want you snooping around wait sostratos said could we have some water first to mix with the wine go on fetch it himilkon told hyssaldomos but the phoenician also let out a mournful cluck why you hellenes water your wine ive never understood it takes away half the pleasure would you wrap a rag around your prong before you go into a woman one of the seven sages said nothing too much sostratos told him to us unwatered wine seems too much too likely to bring on drunkenness and madness himilkons broad shoulders went up and down in a shrug to me this is silly but never mind he drank his wine neat and with every sign of enjoyment smacking his lips he went on you spoke of balsam my master sostratos had been chewing on a roll and answered with his mouth full yes certainly you want the best the balsam of engedi himilkon asked sostratos and menedemos both dipped their heads himilkon said you wont get it straight from the source not in phoenicia you wont engedi lies inland perhaps twelve or fifteen parasangs inlandyou would say let me see about oh three hundred stadia isnt that phoenicia too menedemos asked no no no himilkon shook his head the phoenician cities are along the coast inland down there is the country of the ioudaioi and the ioudaioi my friends are very peculiar people menedemos sent sostratos a quick glance as if to say anyone not a hellene was of course a peculiar person sostratos would not have disagreed but didnt care to say any such thing where himilkon could hear what he did say was i dont know much about these ioudaioi o best one tell me more foolish people stubborn people about what youd expect from ignorant backcountry hillmen himilkon sniffed and poured himself more wine then shook his head and theyre slightly daft more than slightly daftabout their religion you need to know that if you decide to go inland daft how sostratos asked if i go into their country will they want me to worship the way they do no no no the phoenician said again he laughed but they may not want to have anything to do with you because you dont worship the way they do dealing with you might cause them ritual pollution you see theyre very prickly about that sort of thing they sound as bad as egyptians menedemos said theyre even worse himilkon said they worship their own god and they say nobody elses gods are real what zeus isnt real menedemos burst out laughing oh my dear fellow that has to be a joke not to the ioudaioi himilkon said not at all that holds an obvious logical flaw sostratos said if theirs is the only true god why is he worshiped by one little tribe nobody ever heard of and by nobody else in the whole wide world himilkon shrugged once more menedemos said well my dear if you deal with these strange people i suggest you dont ask them that question otherwise you wont be dealing with them long if theyre like egyptians theyll be touchy as all getout about religion and they wont care a fig for logic however much sostratos might wish it didnt that made good sense ill remember he promised and turned back to himilkon what else can you tell me about these ioudaioi they are honesti will say that for them the phoenician answered this god of theirs may seem silly to everyone else but they take him very seriously what does he look like sostratos asked do they turn a crocodile or a baboon or a cat or a jackal into a god the way the egyptians do no my masternothing of the sort in fact himilkon shook his head again if you can believe it he doesnt look like anything at all he just isis everywhere at the same time i suppose that means he laughed at the absurdity of it so did menedemos whose ideas about religion had always been conventional but sostratos thoughtfully pursed his lips ever since sokrates day philosophers had been dissatisfied with the gods as they appeared in the iliad lustful quarrelsome often foolish or cowardlya pack of chieftains writ large one cautious step at a time thinkers had groped their way toward something that sounded a lot like what these ioudaioi already had maybe they werent so silly after all how can i find out he wondered and asked himilkon do any of them speak greek a few may but himilkon looked doubtful youd do better to learn a little aramaic though i could teach you myself if you like i wouldnt charge much now sostratos wore a dubious expression his curiosity had never extended to learning foreign languages maybe he said i know how it is with you hellenes himilkon said you always want everybody else to speak your tongue you never care to pick up anybody elses thats fine in hellas my friend but theres more to the world than hellas your other choice would be to hire a greekspeaking interpreter in one of the phoenician towns but that would cost a lot more than learning yourself mentioning expense was a good way to get sostratos to think about acquiring some aramaic on his own maybe he said again in a different tone of voice himilkon bowed once more you know i am at your service my master after the rhodians left the warehouse menedemos asked do you really want to learn to go barbarbar sostratos tossed his head no not even a little bit but i dont want to have to count on an interpreter either he sighed well see menedemos felt trapped in the andron for once that had nothing to do with baukis she was upstairs in the womens quarters but philodemos friend xanthos shared with medusa the ability to turn anyone close by to stone he was petrifyingly boring my grandson is beginning to learn his alphabeta he said now hes a likely little ladlooks like my wifes mother my fatherinlaw liked string beans more than any man ive ever known except maybe my great uncle give me a mess of beans and ill be happy my great uncle would say he lived to be almost eighty though he was all blind and bent toward the end isnt that interesting menedemos lied he glanced over toward his father hoping the older man would rescue both of them from their predicament xanthos was his friend after all but philodemos just pointed to the krater in which the watered wine waited and said would you like some more best one i dont mind if i do xanthos used the dipper to refill his cup oh no menedemos thought that will only make him talk more of course by everything hed ever seen xanthos needed no help in talking as much as any three ordinary men put together after a couple of sips of wine he turned to philodemos and said were you in the assembly when i spoke on the need to keep good relations with antigonos and ptolemaios bothand with lysimakhos and kassandros too for that matter yes as a matter of fact i was philodemos said quickly menedemos father a man of stern rectitude seldom told lies but desperate times called for desperate measures and he didnt hesitate here that did him little good i believe your son was still at sea though xanthos said im sure hed be interested in hearing my remarks menedemos had no idea why he was sure of any such thing philodemos said my sons met ptolemaios you might be interested in hearing his views he might as well have saved his breath xanthos was interested in no ones views but his own he took a deep breath getting ready to launch into his speech menedemos tried a different tack what about seleukos o marvelous one you say we should stay friendly toward all the other macedonian marshalswhich struck him as much easier to advocate than to dobut what about seleukos out in the east a very good question young man and you may be sure ill address it in great detail when next the assembly convenes xanthos said meanwhile out came the speech resistance was futile it only delayed the inevitable a man can close his eyes menedemos thought why cant he close his ears too being unable to do so struck him as most unfair and ever more so as time dragged on the worst part was xanthos expected praise once he finished he always did and pouted when he didnt get it that was quite something sir menedemos managed which saved him the trouble of saying just what yes well i have some rather urgent business to attend to philodemos said for a bad moment menedemos feared his father would go off and leave him alone with xanthos hed known he annoyed his father but hadnt thought philodemos hated him that much but then philodemos added and i need my boy with me xanthos had trouble taking a hint after another quarterhour of platitudes though he did make his farewells oh by the dog of egypt menedemos exclaimed doesnt he ever shut up when he goes to bed perhaps his father said ill bet he talks in his sleep menedemos said savagely itd be just like him philodemos clucked in mild reproof thats not a kind thing to say he paused then sighed im not saying youre wrong mind you but its not kind too bad menedemos stood up and stretched something in his back crackled he sighed too with relief the saddest part is hes got no idea how dull he is no and dont tell him his father said he has a good heart hes just boring he cant help that any more than a man can help having a taste for cabbage stew i dont want him insulted do you hear me i wont be the one to do it menedemos said with another sigh youd better not but philodemos sighed again too hes dreadfully dull isnt he baukis walked purposefully across the courtyardnow that xanthos was gone she could come forth from the womens quarters menedemos followed her with his eyes but didnt turn his head he wanted to give his father no reason for suspicion especially when he was doing his best not to deserve any but he couldnt help noting that she disappeared into the kitchen uhoh he thought sure enough a moment later her voice and sikons rose in passionate argument there they go again menedemos saidthat seemed a safe enough remark so they do his father dipped out a fresh cup of watered wine which seemed to express his view of the situation you really ought to do something about that menedemos said and what do you suggest his father retorted a wife is supposed to manage the household and a cook is supposed to come up with the best suppers he can and to the crows with money if i side with either one of them the other will think im wrong and that will just cause more trouble no ill stay off to the side let them settle it between themselves that made good sense menedemos wasnt altogether happy about admitting as much to himself he wondered why his father couldnt give him as long a leash as he let his wife and the cook have whenever he thinks im the least little bit out of line he slaps me down hard he thought resentfully in the kitchen the yelling got louder think youre king midas with all the gold in the world around you baukis said sikons reply came to menedemos ears in impassioned fragments cheapskate barley mush salted fish the cook slammed his fist down on a counter baukis let out a ragefilled wordless squeal oh dear menedemos said philodemos drained that cup of wine and got himself another he was starting to look a little bleary which he seldom did in the afternoon first xanthos and now this menedemos thought not without sympathy a moment later baukis stormed back across the courtyard her back stiff with fury she went up the stairs the door to the womens quarters slammed this time philodemos was the one who said oh dear and a moment after that sikon rushed into the andron shouting i cant stand it any more tell that woman to keep her nose out of my kitchen from here on out or i quit that woman happens to be my wife philodemos pointed out and you cant quit menedemos added youre a slave in case youve forgotten by sikons comically astonished expression he had forgotten with reason too in the kitchen a good cook was king and sikon was more than a merely good cook he said the way she goes on youd think we were trying to scrape by on five oboloi a day how am i supposed to do anything interesting if im looking over my shoulder all the time for fear i spend a khalkos too much youve managed so far philodemos said im sure you can keep right on doing it naturally my wife worries about expenses thats what wives do youll find a way to go on making your delicious suppers come what may thats what cooks do no he never took so soft a line with me menedemos thought maybe i should have been a cook not a trader but sikon wasnt satisfied either cooks cook thats what they do how can i cook when shes driving me mad he threw his hands in the air and stomped out of the andron when he got back to the kitchen he showed what he thought of the whole business by slamming the door as hard as baukis had upstairs well well philodemos said a phrase menedemos had been known to use himself philodemos pointed to him youre closer to the krater than i am son is there enough wine left for another cup let me look menedemos did and then reached for the dipper as a matter of fact theres enough left for two he filled one for his father one for himself that man is so difficult baukis told him a couple of days later he simply will not see reason maybe we just ought to sell him and try someone else menedemos tossed his head we cant do that people would talkhes been in the family his whole life and hes a very good cook you know i wouldnt want to lose him and neither would my father baukis made a sour face yes ive seen as much otherwise he would have laid down the law to sikon she threw her hands in the air what am i supposed to do im not going to give up but how can i make a proper fight of it maybe you have the answer menedemos she looked toward him her eyes wide and hopeful why did she appeal to him against his father her husband because she was looking for a weapon to use against philodemos and sikon or simply because the two of them werent so far apart in years and philodemos beard was gray whatever the reason menedemos knew she was giving him his chance hed made the most of far less with plenty of other women why not here with baukis it would be easy he thought he bit down on the inside of his lower lip till he tasted blood i dont know he said woodenly i just dont know and then to his horrified dismay his fathers wife hung her head and quietly began to cry in a small broken voice she said maybe hes angry with me because i havent got pregnant yet ive done everything i know how to doive prayed ive sacrificedbut i havent caught maybe thats it my father is an old man his seed is bound to be cold if i sow my seed in the furrow hes plowed it would almost be doing him a favor menedemos sprang to his feet from the bench in the courtyard so abruptly that baukis blinked in surprise im sorry he mumbled ive just rememberedive got an appointment down by the harbor im late im very late the lie was clumsy baukis had to know it was a lie menedemos fled the house anyway fled as if the kindly ones dogged his heels and so they might he thought as he looked around on the street wondering where he would really go if i stayed on the road i was traveling there so they might he squeezed his hands into fists till his nails bit into his callused palms did baukis know did she have any idea of the turmoil she roused in him shed never given any sign of itbut then if she was a good wife she wouldnt not all the seductions menedemos tried succeeded he laughed a harsh bitter noise having nothing to do with mirth this is a seduction i havent tried curse it this is a seduction im not going to try baukis trusted him by all the signs she liked him but she was his fathers wife i cant he said as if he were choking i cant and i wont all at once he knew where he would go to keep his appointment the closest brothel was only a couple of blocks away that wasnt what he wanted but maybe it would keep him from thinking about what he did want andhe told himself yet againwhat he couldnt have sostratos gaped at himilkon what he said the conjugation of a verb in aramaic changes depending on whether the subject is masculine or feminine thats crazy the phoenician shook his head no best one its only different everythings different sostratos said none of the words is anything like greek you have all these choking noises in your language i have learned greek himilkon said that was as hard for me as this is for you he was bound to be right that made sostratos feel no better and did you tell me your alphabeta has no vowels and you write it from right to left himilkon nodded sostratos groaned thats very strange too he said we like our alephbet as well as you like yours himilkon told him the phoenician scratched his head interesting how some of the letters have names that are almost the same its no accident sostratos answered we hellenes learned the art of writing from the phoenicians who came with king kadmos we changed the letters to suit our language better but we learned them from your folk thats what herodotos says anyhow if you changed them you should not blame us for leaving them the way they were himilkon said shall we go on with the lesson now you are doing pretty well you really are youre only saying that to keep me coming back sostratos didnt think he was doing well at all aramaic seemed harder than anything hed tried to learn at the lykeion but himilkon said no you have a good memoryi already knew thatand your ear is not bad anyone who hears you speak will know you for a hellene or at least for a foreigner for in some of these little places they will never have heard of hellenes but people will be able to understand you will i be able to understand them though sostratos said following you is even harder than speaking i think do the best you can when spring comes and you sail east you may decide you want an interpreter after all but even if you do you are better off knowing some of the language that will help keep him from cheating you true very sensible too sostratos thumped his forehead with the heel of his hand as if trying to knock in some wisdom yes lets get on with it his brain felt distinctly overloaded as he walked back up toward the northern tip of the city and his home he was going over feminine conjugations in his mind and so engrossed in them that he didnt notice when someone called his name sostratos the secondor was it the thirdtime that pierced his shield of concentration he looked up oh hail damonax where did you spring from damonax laughed spring from what do you think kadmos sowed a dragons tooth and reaped me not likely my dear ive been walking up the street beside you for half a plethron but you never knew it sostratos cheeks heated oh dear im afraid i didnt im sorry i was thinking about something you must have been by zeus damonax said well sokrates was the same way if platons telling the truth so youre in good company sokrates sostratos was sure had never pondered the vagaries of aramaic grammar i was talking about kadmos just a little while ago he said though not in connection with the dragons teeth what then damonax asked how euripides shows him in the bakkhai no sostratos tossed his head in aid of the phoenicians bringing their letters to hellas oh that damonax shrugged history interests me less than philosophy did i hear rightly that your splendid gryphons skull was lost at sea im afraid you did sostratos replied what are you doing in this part of the city why coming to see your father of course he must have told you id like to marry your sister damonax said yes he did the news surprised me more than a little we arent a family with land out to the horizon and you come from that kind of familyor you did sostratos thought have you squandered everything is that it damonaxs smile bright and bland told him nothing of course i expect shed bring a suitable dowry with her he said but that would be true of any man seeking her hand is it not so it was so and sostratos knew it perfectly well he did say what one side finds a suitable dowry may seem outrageous to the other damonax surprised him by saying oh i hope not not here i knew your sisters first husbandwe werent close but he was good friends with my older brother who was nearer his age he would sing erinnas praises by the hour in the areas where a wife should be praised her spinning her weaving the way she ran the household so i already have some notion of what id be getting you might say and im looking forward to it really sostratos said maybe that explained why he was paying court to a widow and not to a maiden maybe sostratos still had his suspicions he knocked on the door when gyges opened it he told the lydian majordomo heres damonax whom i ran into on the street hes come to talk with father yes of course sirwere expecting him the house slave turned to damonax and gave him a polite little bow hail most noble one hail damonax answered is lysistratos in the andron thats right gyges said just come with me ill take you there he glanced toward sostratos you may find this interesting yourself so i may sostratos said one of these days i may have a daughter myself id like to see how the dicker goes youve already missed a good deal damonax said thats all right i expect you and father will start raking things up again the older man chuckled youre probably right in the andron lysistratos waited till a slave had served out wine and olives and cheese before getting down to business sostratos father said so damonax you dont think a dowry of two talents of silver is enough no sir damonax answered with polite firmness neither do my kinsfolk lysistratos sighed im sorry to hear that best one dont you think two talents would help you redeem some of your olive crop damonax flinched redeem it from whom sostratos asked from creditors im afraid his father answered damonaxs family sank a lot of silver into part of a cargo on a round shipand the ship either met pirates or it sank because it never got to alexandria the years olive crop is collateral how did you find that out damonax demanded our creditors swore they wouldnt blab they didnt lysistratos said thats why i needed so long to figure this out but im not wrong am i even if i pieced things together from hither and yon no youre not wrong damonax said bitterly its a pity thoughthe match would have been a good one sostratos got to his feet father walk out into the courtyard with me for a moment would you he said looking a little surprised lysistratos followed him out of the andron in a low voice he asked well what would you say to me that you dont care to have damonax hear only that he would be a good match for erinna if hell settle for the dowry we want sostratos answered i do think he wants her for herself as well as for the money he told me how her first husband praised her as a housekeeper to him and erinna does want to marry again and we saw matches for her arent so easy to come by when that other family chose a younger girl in her place his father looked thoughtful something to that he admitted and damonax would be beholden to us for going forward and his familys fortunes may recover he sighed youre right about your sistershe does want children of her own a fathers not supposed to put much weight on such things but how can i help it he dipped his head in sudden decision if he agrees to the dowry ill make the match when sostratos and lysistratos came back into the andron damonax rose ill be going he said not much point to any more talk is there pained resignation had replaced bitterness that depends lysistratos said youre not going to squeeze more than two talents worth of dowry out of me but well go on from there if you can live with that damonax sank back onto his stool as if his legs didnt want to support him you would do that he whispered hard to blame a man too much for wanting to keep his familys money problems to himself sostratos said not all hellenes would have agreed with him but he was an intensely private man himself and understood the urge to put such embarrassments in chests as it were and hope no one else found out about them his father said tell me one thing very plainly damonax youve lost your crop for the year is it not so but not the land itself yes jerkily damonax dipped his head yes that is so i swear it by zeus and all the other gods all right then lysistratos said you people can recover from that and even if two talents is less than you would have wanted it will go a long way toward keeping you and your family afloat thank you sir damonax said i am in your debtwere all in your debt sostratos smiled to himself that was what hed had in mind gratitude and a sense of obligation didnt always last of course but sometimes they did damonax went on the marriage will give you legitimate grandchildren sir thats the point of marriage after all sostratos father said now go on home make sure your kin are satisfied and well take it from there after damonax had left erinna came down from the womens quarters when sostratos told her of the agreement she whooped with delight and threw herself into his arms this is wonderful she said its like a second chance it is a second chance may everything go as well as it possibly can my dear sostratos said gods grant it be so gods grant it indeed lysistratos said he eyed sostratos one day before too long son well find you a match too thirtys a good age for a man to wed and youre getting there me sostratos hadnt thought about it much marriage seemed neither real nor important to him he patted his sister on the shoulder she wanted a home to manage but every port on the inner sea was his the gods made me a man not a woman a hellene not a barbarian he thought truly im the lucky one historical note the gryphons skull is set in bc i found the idea for the novel that the skull of a protoceratops weathered out of its stony matrix might have given the ancient world the basis from which it invented the gryphonin john r horners fascinating book dinosaur lives unearthing an evolutionary saga cowritten with edwin dobb harpercollins new york it was first advanced by classical folklorist adrienne mayor during early hellenistic times greek cities were founded as far east and north as modern afghanistan if ever a dinosaur skull from mongolia couldalmosthave come to athens that was the era obviously such a skull never truly reached the greek scholarly community i hope ive made this near miss plausible and interesting which is i think the most one can reasonably expect from a historical novelist real characters appearing in the story are menedemos euxenides of phaselis ptolemaios of egypt and antigonos rebellious nephew polemaios whose name is also spelled as ptolemaios in the surviving histories but polemaios in inscriptionsi gladly seized the difference to differentiate him from his more famous contemporary others mentioned but not on stage include alkimos of epeiros antigonos his sons demetrios and philippos lysimakhos kassandros seleukos polyperkhon eurydike berenike and ptolemaios son ptolemaios who was indeed born on kos in this year over this entire era hangs the enormous shadow of alexander the great now dead fourteen years exactly how polemaios came from euboia to kos is not known it might well have been by stealth as plenty of people between the one island and the other wanted him dead equally unknown is menedemos connection if any to the invention of the trihemiolia a few years later however he is the first man known to have captained such a vessel so the connection might well have existed i have for the most part spelled names of places and people as a greek would have thus knidos not cnidus lysimakhos not lysimachus i have broken this rule for a few place names that have wellestablished english spellings rhodes athens the aegean sea and the like i have also broken it for alexander the great and his father philip of macedon this helps distinguish them from the large number of men named alexandras and philippos and they deserve such distinction all translations from the greek are my own as in over the winedark sea i claim no particular literary merit for them only that they convey what the original says menedemos bit of doggerel in chapter is a poem of palladas from the greek anthology that actually dates from the fourth or fifth century ad i concede the anachronismbut menedemos might have said it even if he didnt
