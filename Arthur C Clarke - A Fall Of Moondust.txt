of america to liz and mike chapter to be the skipper of the only boat on the moon was a distinction that pat harris enjoyed as the passengers filed aboard selene jockeying for window seats he wondered what sort of trip it would be this time in the rearview mirror he could see miss wilkins very smart in her blue lunar tourist commission uniform putting on her usual welcome act he always tried to think of her as miss wilkins not sue when they were on duty together it helped to keep his mind on business but what she thought of him he had never really discovered there were no familiar faces this was a new bunch eager for their first cruise most of the passengers were typical touristselderly people visiting a world that had been the very symbol of inaccessibility when they were young there were only four or five passengers on the low side of thirty and they were probably technical personnel on vacation from one of the lunar bases it was a fairly good working rule pat had discovered that all the old people came from earth while the youngsters were residents of the moon but to all of them the sea of thirst was a novelty beyond selenes observation windows its gray dusty surface marched onward unbroken until it reached the stars above it hung the waning crescent earth poised forever in the sky from which it had not moved in a billion years the brilliant bluegreen light of the mother world flooded this strange land with a cold radianceand cold it was indeed perhaps three hundred below zero on the exposed surface no one could have told merely by looking at it whether the sea was liquid or solid it was completely flat and featureless quite free from the myriad cracks and fissures that scarred all the rest of this barren world not a single hillock boulder or pebble broke its monotonous uniformity no sea on earthno millpond evenwas ever as calm as this it was a sea of dust not of water and therefore it was alien to all the experience of men therefore also it fascinated and attracted them fine as talcum powder drier in this vacuum than the parched sands of the sahara it flowed as easily and effortlessly as any liquid a heavy object dropped into it would disappear instantly without a splash leaving no scar to mark its passage nothing could move upon its treacherous surface except the small twoman dustskisand selene herself an improbable combination of sledge and bus not unlike the snocats that had opened up the antarctic a lifetime ago selenes official designation was dustcruiser mark i though to the best of pats knowledge a mark ii did not exist even on the drawing board she was called ship boat or moon bus according to taste pat preferred boat for it prevented confusion when he used that word no one would mistake him for the skipper of a spaceshipand spaceship captains were of course two a penny welcome aboard selene said miss wilkins when everyone had settled down captain hams and i are pleased to have you with us our trip will last four hours and our first objective will be crater lake a hundred kilometers east of here in the mountains of inaccessibility pat scarcely heard the familiar introduction he was busy with his countdown selene was virtually a grounded spaceship she had to be since she was traveling in a vacuum and must protect her frail cargo from the hostile world beyond her walls though she never left the surface of the moon and was propelled by electric motors instead of rockets she carried all the basic equipment of a fullfledged ship of space and all of it had to be checked before departure oxygenok powerok radiook inertial navigatorzeroed airlock safetyon cabinleak detectorok internal lightsok gangwaydisconnected and so on for more than fifty items every one of which would automatically call attention to itself in case of trouble but pat harris like all spacemen hankering after old age never relied on autowamings if he could carry out the check himself at last he was ready the almost silent motors started to spin but the blades were still feathered and selene barely quivered at her moorings then he eased the port fan into fine pitch and she began to curve slowly to the right when she was clear of the embarkation building he straightened her out and pushed the throttle forward she handled very well when one considered the complete novelty of her design there had been no millennia of trial and error here stretching back to the first neolithic man who ever launched a log out into a stream selene was the very first of her line created in the brains of a few engineers who had sat down at a table and asked themselves how do we build a vehicle that will skim over a sea of dust some of them harking back to ole man river had wanted to make her a sternwheeler but the more efficient submerged fans had carried the day as they drilled through the dust driving her before them they produced a wake like that of a highspeed mole but it vanished within seconds leaving the sea unmarked by any sign of the boats passage now the squat pressuredomes of port roris were dropping swiftly below the sky line in less than ten minutes they had vanished from sight selene was utterly alone she was at the center of something for which the languages of mankind have no name as pat switched off the motors and the boat coasted to rest he waited for the silence to grow around him it was always the same it took a little while for the passengers to realize the strangeness of what lay outside they had crossed space and seen stars all about them they had looked upor downat the dazzling face of earth but this was different it was neither land nor sea neither air nor space but a little of each before the silence grew oppressiveif he left it too long someone would get scaredpat rose to his feet and faced his passengers good evening ladies and gentlemen he began i hope miss wilkins has been making you comfortable weve stopped here because this is a good place to introduce you to the seato give you the feel of it as it were he pointed to the windows and the ghostly grayness that lay beyond just how far away he asked quietly do you imagine our horizon is or to put it in another way how big would a man appear to you if he was standing out there where the stars seem to meet the ground it was a question that no one could possibly answer from the evidence of sight alone logic said the moons a small worldthe horizon must be very close but the senses gave a wholly different verdict this land they reported is absolutely fiat and stretches to infinity it divides the universe in twain for ever and ever it rolls onward beneath the stars the illusion remained even when one knew its cause the eye has no way of judging distances when there is nothing for it to focus upon vision slipped and skidded helplessly on this featureless ocean of dust there was not evenas there must always be on earththe softening haze of the atmosphere to give some hint of nearness or remoteness the stars were unwinking needle points of light clear down to that indeterminate horizon believe it or not continued pat you can see just three kilometersor almost two miles for those of you who havent been able to go metric yet i know it looks a couple of light years out to the horizon but you could walk there in twenty minutes if you could walk on this stuff at all he moved back to his seat and started the motors once more nothing much to see for the next sixty kilometers he called over his shoulder so well get a move on selene surged forward for the first time there was a real sensation of speed the boats wake became longer and more disturbed as the spinning fans bit fiercely into the dust now the dust itself was being tossed up on either side in great ghostly plumes from a distance selene would have looked like a snowplow driving its way across a winter landscape beneath a frosty moon but those gray slowly collapsing parabolas were not snow and the lamp that lit their trajectory was the planet earth the passengers relaxed enjoying the smooth almost silent ride every one of them had traveled hundreds of times faster than this on the journey to the moon but in space one was never conscious of speed and this swift glide across the dust was far more exciting when pat swung selene into a tight turn so that she orbited in a circle the boat almost overtook the falling veils of powder her fans had hurled into the sky it seemed altogether wrong that this impalpable dust should rise and fall in such cleancut curves utterly unaffected by air resistance on earth it would have drifted for hoursperhaps for days as soon as the boat had straightened out on a steady course and there was nothing to look at except the empty plain the passengers began to read the literature thoughtfully provided for them each had been given a folder of photographs maps souvenirs and informative text they had only to read this to discover all that they wanted to know about the sea of thirst and perhaps a little more most of the moon they read was covered by a thin layer of dust usually no more than a few millimeters deep some of this was debris from the starsthe remains of meteorites that had fallen upon the moons unprotected face for at least five billion years some had flaked from the lunar rocks as they expanded and contracted in the fierce temperature extremes between day and night whatever its source it was so finely divided that it would flow like a liquid even under this feeble gravity over the ages it had drifted down from the mountains into the lowlands to form pools and lakes the first explorers had expected this and had usually been prepared for it but the sea of thirst was a surprise no one had anticipated finding a dustbowl more than a hundred kilometers across as the lunar seas went it was very small indeed the astronomers had never officially recognized its title pointing out that it was only a small portion of the sinus roristhe bay of dew and how they protested could part of a bay be an entire sea but the name invented by a copywriter of the lunar tourist commission had stuck despite their objections it was at least as appropriate as the names of the other socalled seassea of clouds sea of rains sea of tranquillity not to mention sea of nectar the brochure also contained some reassuring information designed to quell the fears of the most nervous traveler and to prove that the tourist commission had thought of everything all possible precautions have been taken for your safety it stated selene carries an oxygen reserve sufficient to last for more than a week and all essential equipment is duplicated an automatic radio beacon signals your position at regular intervals and in the extremely improbable event of a complete power failure a dustski from port roris would tow you home with little delay above all there is no need to worry about rough weather no matter how bad a sailor you may be you cant get seasick on the moon there are never any storms on the sea of thirst it is always a flat calm those last comforting words had been written in all good faith for who could have imagined that they would soon be proved untrue as selene raced silently through the earthlit night the moon went about its business there was a great deal of business now after the aeons of sleep more had happened here in the last fifty years than in the five billion before that and much more was to happen soon in the first city that man had ever built outside his native world chief administrator olsen was taking a stroll through the park he was very proud of the park as were all the twentyfive thousand inhabitants of port clavius it was small of coursethough not as small as was implied by that miserable tv commentator whod called it a windowbox with delusions of grandeur and certainly there were no parks gardens or anything else on earth where you could find sunflowers ten meters high far overhead wispy cirrus clouds were sailing byor so it seemed they were of course only images projected on the inside of the dome but the illusion was so perfect that it sometimes made the ca homesick homesick he corrected himself this was home yet in his heart of hearts he knew it was not true to his children it would be but not to him he had been born in stockholm earth they had been born in port clavius they were citizens of the moon he was tied to earth with bonds that might weaken with the years but would never break less than a kilometer away just outside the main dome the head of the lunar tourist commission inspected the latest returns and permitted himself a mild feeling of satisfaction the improvement over the last season had been maintained not that there were seasons on the moon but it was noticeable that more tourists came when it was winter in earths northern hemisphere how could he keep it up that was always the problem for tourists wanted variety and you couldnt give them the same thing over and over again the novel scenery the low gravity the view of earth the mysteries of farside the spectacular heavens the pioneer settlements after youd listed those what else did the moon have to offer what a pity there were no native selenites with quaint customs and quainter physiques at which visitors could click their cameras alas the largest life form ever discovered on the moon needed a microscope to show itand its ancestors had come here on lunik h only a decade ahead of man himself commissioner davis riffled mentally through the items that had arrived by the last telefax wondering if there was anything there that would help him there was of course the usual request from a tv company hed never heard of anxious to make yet another documentary on the moonif all expenses were paid the answer to that one would be no if he accepted all these kind offers his departmentwould soon be broke then there was a chatty letter from his opposite number in the greater new orleans tourist commission inc suggesting an exchange of personnel it was hard to see how that would help the moon or new orleans either but it would cost nothing and might produce some good will andthis was more interestingthere was a request from the waterskiing champion of australia asking if anyone had ever tried to ski on the sea of thirst yesthere was definitely an idea here he was surprised that someone had not tried it already perhaps they had behind selene or one of the small dustskis it was certainly worth a test he was always on the lookout for new forms of lunar recreation and the sea of thirst was one of his pet projects it was a project that within a very few hours was going to turn into a nightmare chapter ahead of selene the horizon was no longer a perfect unbroken arc a jagged line of mountains had risen above the edge of the moon as the cruiser raced toward them they seemed to climb slowly up the sky as if lifted upon some gigantic elevator the mountains of inaccessibility announced miss wilkins so called because theyre entirely surrounded by the sea youll notice too that theyre much steeper than most lunar mountains she did not labor this since it was an unfortunate fact that the majority of lunar peaks were a severe disappointment the huge craters which looked so impressive on photographs taken from earth turned out upon close inspection to be gently rolling hills their relief grossly exaggerated by the shadows they cast at dawn and sunset there was not a single lunar crater whose ramparts soared as abruptly as the streets of san francisco and there were very few that could provide a serious ohstacle to a determined cyclist no one would have guessed this however from the publications of the tourist commission which featured only the most spectacular cliffs and canyons photographed from carefully chosen vantage points theyve never been thoroughly explored even now miss wilkins continued last year we took a party of geologists there and landed them on that promontory but they were only able to go a few kilometers into the interior so there may be anything up in those hills we simply dont know good for sue pat told himself she was a firstrate guide and knew what to leave to the imagination and what to explain in detail she had an easy relaxed tone with no trace of that fatal singsong that was the occupational disease of so many professional guides and she had mastered her subject thoroughly it was very rare for her to be asked a question that she could not answer altogether she was a formidable young lady and though she often figured in pats erotic reveries he was secretly a little afraid of her the passengers stared with fascinated wonder at the approaching peaks on the stillmysterious moon here was a deeper mystery rising like an island out of the strange sea that guarded them the mountains of inaccessibility remained a challenge for the next generation of explorers despite their name it was now easy enough to reach thembut with millions of square kilometers of less difficult territory still unexamined they would have to wait their turn selene was swinging into their shadows before anyone had realized what was happening the lowhanging earth had been eclipsed its brilliant light still played upon the peaks far overhead but down here all was utter darkness ill turn off the cabin lights said the stewardess so you can get a better view as the dim red background illumination vanished each traveler felt he was alone in the lunar night even the reflected radiance of earth on those high peaks was disappearing as the cruiser raced farther into shadow within minutes only the stars were leftcold steady points of light in a blackness so complete that the mind rebelled against it it was hard to recognize the familiar constellations among this multitude of stars the eye became entangled in patterns never seen from earth and lost itself in a glittering maze of clusters and nebulae in all that resplendent panorama there was only one unmistakable landmarkthe dazzling beacon of venus far outshining all other heavenly bodies heralding the approach of dawn it was several minutes before the travelers realized that not all the wonder lay in the sky behind the speeding cruiser stretched a long phosphorescent wake as if a magic finger had traced a line of light across the moons dark and dusty face selene was drawing a comet tail behind her as surely as any ship plowing its way through the tropical oceans of earth yet there were no microorganisms here lighting this dead sea with their tiny lamps only countless grains of dust sparking one against the other as the static discharges caused by selenes swift passage neutralized themselves even when one knew the explanation it was still beautiful to watchto look back into the night and to see this luminous electric ribbon continually renewed continually dying away as if the milky way itself were reflected in the lunar surface the shining wake was lost in the glare as pat switched on the seaichlight ominously close at hand a great wall of rock was sliding past at this point the face of the mountain rose almost sheer from the surrounding sea of dust it towered overhead to unknown heights for only where the racing oval of light fell upon it did it appear to flash suddenly into real existence here were mountains against which the himalayas the rockies the alps were newborn babies on earth the forces of erosion began to tear at all mountains as soon as they were formed so that after a few million years they were mere ghosts of their former selves but the moon knew neither wind nor rain there was nothing here to wear away the rocks except the immeasurably slow flaking of the dust as their surface layers contracted in the chill of night these mountains were as old as the world that had given them birth pat was quite proud of his showmanship and had planned the next act very carefully it looked dangerous but was perfectly safe for selene had been over this course a hundred times and the electronic memory of her guidance system knew the way better than any human pilot suddenly he switched off the searchlightand now the passengers could tell that while they had been dazzled by the glare on one side the mountains had been stealthily closing in upon them from the other in almost total darkness selene was racing up a narrow canyonand not even on a straight course for from time to time she zigged and zagged to avoid invisible obstacles some of them indeed were not merely invisible but nonexistent pat had programmed this course at slow speed and in the safety of daylight for maximum impact on the nerves the ahs and ohs from the darkened cabin behind him proved that he had done a good job far above a narrow ribbon of stars was all that could be seen of the outside world it swung in crazy arcs from right to left and back again with each abrupt change of selenes course the night ride as pat privately called it lasted for about five minutes but seemed very much longer when he once again switched on the floods so that the cruiser was moving in the center of a great pool of light there was a sigh of mingled relief and disappointment from the passengers this was an experience none of them would forget in a huny now that vision had been restored they could see that they were traveling up a steepwalled valley or gorge the sides of which were slowly drawing apart presently the canyon had widened into a roughly oval amphitheater about three kilometers acrossthe heart of an extinct volcano breached aeons ago in the days when even the moon was young the crater was extremely small by lunar standards but it was unique the ubiquitous dust had flooded into it working its way up the valley age after age so that now the tourists from earth could ride in cushioned comfort into what had once been a cauldron filled with the fires of hell those fires had died long before the dawn of terrestrial life and would never wake again but there were other forces that had not died and were merely biding their time when selene began a slow circuit of the steeply walled amphitheater more than one of her passengers remembered a cruise in some mountain lake at home here was the same sheltered stillness the same sense of unknown depths beneath the boat earth had many crater lakes but the moon only onethough it had far more craters taking his time pat made two complete circuits of the lake while the floodlights played upon its enclosing walls this was the best way to see it during the daytime when the sun blasted it with heat and light it lost much of its magic but now it belonged to the kingdom of fantasy as if it had come from the haunted brain of edgar allan poe ever and again one seemed to glimpse strange shapes moving at the edge of vision beyond the narrow range of the lights it was pure imagination of course nothing moved in all this land except the shadows of the sun and earth there could be no ghosts upon a world that had never known life it was time to turn back to sail down the canyon into the open sea pat aimed the blunt prow of selene toward the narrow rift in the mountains and the high walls enfolded them again on the outward journey he left the lights on so that the passengers could see where they were going besides that trick of the night ride would not work so well a second time far ahead beyond the reach of selenes own illumination a light was growing spreading softly across the rocks and crags even in her last quarter earth still had the power of a dozen full moons and now that they were emerging from the shadow of the mountains she was once more the mistress of the skies every one of the twentytwo men and women aboard selene looked up at that bluegreen crescent admiring its beauty wondering at its brilliance how strange that the familiar fields and lakes and forests of earth shone with such celestial glory when one looked at them from afar perhaps there was a lesson here perhaps no man could appreciate his own world until he had seen it from space and upon earth there must be many eyes turned toward the waxing moonmore than ever before now that the moon meant so much to mankind it was possible but unlikely that even now some of those eyes were peering through powerful telescopes at the faint spark of selenes floodlights as it crept through the lunar night but it would mean nothing to them when that spark flickered and died for a million years the bubble had been growing like a vast abscess below the root of the mountains throughout the entire history of man gas from the moons not yet wholly dead interior had been forcing itself along lines of weakness accumulating in cavities hundreds of meters below the surface on nearby earth the ice ages had marched past one by one while the buried caverns grew and merged and at last coalesced now the abscess was about to burst captain harris had left the controls on autopilot and was talking to the front row of passengers when the first tremor shook the boat for a fraction of a second he wondered if a fan blade had hit some submerged obstacle then quite literally the bottom fell out of his world it fell slowly as all things must upon the moon ahead of selene in a circle many acres in extent the smooth plain puckered like a navel the sea was alive and moving stirred by the forces that had waked it from its agelong sleep the center of the disturbance deepened into a funnel as if a giant whirlpool were forming in the dust every stage of that nightmare transformation was pitilessly illuminated by the earthlight until the crater was so deep that its far wall was completely lost in shadow and it seemed as if selene were racing into a curving crescent of utter blacknessan arc of annihilation the truth was almost as bad by the time that pat had reached the controls the boat was sliding and skittering far down that impossible slope its own momentum and the accelerating flow of the dust beneath it were carrying it headlong into the depths there was nothing he could do but attempt to keep on an even keel and to hope that their speed would carry them up the far side of the crater before it collapsed upon them if the passengers screamed or cried out pat never heard them he was conscious only of that dreadful sickening slide and of his own attempts to keep the cruiser from capsizing yet even as he fought with the controls feeding power first to one fan then to the other in an effort to straighten selenes course a strange nagging memory was teasing his mind somewhere somehow he had seen this happen before that was ridiculous of course but the memory would not leave him not until he reached the bottom of the funnel and saw the endless slope of dust rolling down from the craters starfringed lip did the veil of time lift for a moment he was a boy again playing in the hot sand of a forgotten summer he had found a tiny pit perfectly smooth and symmetrical and there was something lurking in its depthssomething completely buried except for its waiting jaws the boy had watched wondering already conscious of the fact that this was the stage for some microscopic drama he had seen an ant mindlessly intent upon its mission stumble at the edge of the crater and topple down the slope it would have escaped easily enoughbut when the first grain of sand had rolled to the bottom of the pit the waiting ogre had reared out of its lair with its forelegs it had hurled a fusillade of sand at the struggling insect until the avalanche had overwhelmed it and brought it sliding down into the throat of the crater as selene was sliding now no ant lion had dug this pit on the surface of the moon but pat felt as helpless now as that doomed insect he had watched so many years ago like it he was struggling to reach the safety of the rim while the moving ground swept him back into the depths where death was waiting a swift death for the ant a protracted one for him and his companions the straining motors were making some headway but not enough the falling dust was gaining speedand what was worse it was rising outside the walls of the cruiser now it had reached the lower edge of the windows now it was creeping up the panes and at last it had covered them completely pat cut the motors before they tore themselves to pieces and as he did so the rising tide blotted out the last glimpse of the crescent earth in darkness and in silence they were sinking into the moon chapter in the banked communications racks of traffic control earthside north an electronic memory stirred uneasily the time was one second past twenty hundred hours gmt a pattern of pulses that should arrive automatically on every hour had failed to make its appearance with a swiftness beyond human thought the handful of cells and microscopic relays looked for instructions wait five seconds said the coded orders if nothing happens close circuit the minute portion of the traffic computer as yet concerned with the problem waited patiently for this enormous period of timelong enough to make a hundred million twentyfigure additions or to print most of the contents of the library of congress then it closed circuit high above the surface of the moon from an antenna which curiously enough was aimed directly at the face of the earth a radio pulse launched itself into space in a sixth of a second it had flashed the fifty thousand kilometers to the relay satellite known as lagrange ii directly in the line between moon and earth another sixth of a second and the pulse had returned much amplified flooding earthside north from pole to equator in terms of human speech it carried a simple message hello selene the pulse said i am not receiving your beacon please reply at once the computer waited for another five seconds then it sent out the pulse again and yet again geological ages had passed in the world of electronics but the machine was infinitely patient once more it consulted its instructions now they said close circuit the computer obeyed in traffic control a green light flared suddenly to red a buzzer started to saw the air with its alarm for the first time men as well as machines became aware that there was trouble somewhere on the moon the news spread slowly at first for the chief administrator took a very poor view of unnecessary panic so still more strongly did the tourist commissioner nothing was worse for business than alerts and emergencieseven when as happened in nine cases out of ten they proved to be due to blown fuses tripped cutouts or oversensitive alarms but on a world like the moon it was necessary to be on ones toes better be seared by imaginary crises than fail to react to real ones it was several minutes before commissioner davis reluctantly admitted that this looked like a real one selenes automatic beacon had failed to respond on one earlier occasion but pat harris had answered as soon as he had been called on the cruisers assigned frequency this time there was silence selene had not even replied to a signal sent out on the carefully guarded mooncrash band reserved solely for emergencies it was this news that brought the commissioner hurrying from the tourist tower along the buried glideway into clavius city at the entrance to the traffic control center he met the chief engineer earthside that was a bad sign it meant that someone thought that rescue operations would be necessary the two men looked at each other gravely each obsessed by the same thought i hope you dont need me said chief engineer lawrence wheres the trouble all i know is that a mooncrash signals gone out what ship is it its not a ship its selene shes not answering from the sea of thirst my godif anythings happened to her out there we can only reach her with the dustskis i always said we should have two cruisers operating before we started taking out tourists thats what i arguedbut finance vetoed the idea they said we couldnt have another until selene proved she could make a profit i hope she doesnt make a headline instead said lawrence grimly you know what i think about bringing tourists to the moon the commissioner did very well it had long been a bone of contention between them for the first time he wondered if the chief engineer might have a point it was as always very quiet in traffic control on the great wall maps the green and amber lights flashed continuously their routine messages unimportant against the clamor of that single flaring red at the air power and radiation consoles the duty officers sat like guardian angels watching over the safety of one quarter of a world nothing new reported the ground traffic officer were still completely in the dark all we know is that theyre somewhere out in the sea he traced a circle on the largescale map unless theyre fantastically off course they must be in that general area on the nineteen hundred hours check they were within a kilometer of their planned route at twenty hundred their signal had vanished so whatever happened took place in that sixty minutes how far can selene travel in an hour someone asked flat out a hundred and twenty kilometers replied the commissioner but she normally cruises at well under a hundred you dont hurry on a sightseeing tour he stared at the map as if trying to extract information from it by the sheer intensity of his gaze if theyre out in the sea it wont take long to find them have you sent out the dustskis no sir i was waiting for authorization davis looked at the chief engineer who outranked anyone on this side of the moon except chief administrator olsen himself lawrence nodded slowly send them out he said but dont expect results in a hurry it will take awhile to search several thousand square kilometersespecially at night tell them to work over the route from the last reported position one ski on either side of it so that they sweep the widest possible band when the order had gone out davis asked unhappily what do you think could have happened there are only a few possibilities it must have been sudden because there was no message from them that usually means an explosion the commissioner paled there was always the chance of sabotage and no one could ever guard against that because of their vulnerability space vehicles like aircraft before them were an irresistible attraction to a certain type of criminal davis thought of the venusbound liner argo which had been destroyed with two hundred men women and children aboard because a maniac had a grudge against a passenger who scarcely knew him and then theres collision continued the chief engineer she could have run into an obstacle harris is a very careful driver said the commissioner hes done this trip scores of times everyone can make mistakes its easy to misjudge your distance when youre driving by earthlight commissioner davis barely heard him he was thinking of all the arrangements he might have to make if the worst came to the worst hed better start by getting the legal branch to check the indemnity forms if any relatives started suing the tourist commission for a few million dollars that would undo his entire publicity campaign for the next yeareven if he won the ground traffic officer gave a nervous cough if i might make a suggestion he said to the chief engineer we could call lagrange the astronomers up therr may be able to see something at night asked davis skeptically from fifty thousand kilometers up easily if her searchlights are still burning its worth trying excellent idea said the chief engineer do that right away he should have thought of that himself and wondered if there were any other possibilities he had overlooked this was not the first occasion he had been forced to pit his wits against this strange and beautiful world so breathtaking in her moments of magicso deadly in her times of peril she would never be wholly tamed as earth had been and perhaps that was just as well for it was the lure of the untouched wilderness and the faint but everpresent hint of danger that now brought the tourists as well as the explorers across the gulfs of space he would prefer to do without the touristsbut they helped to pay his salary and now he had better start packing this whole crisis might evaporate and selene might turn up again quite unaware of the panic she had caused but he did not think this would happen and his fear deepened to certainty as the minutes passed he would give her another hour then he would take the suborbital shuttle to port roris and to the realm of his waiting enemy the sea of thirst when the priority red signal reached lagrange thomas lawson phd was fast asleep he resented the interruption though one needed only two hours sleep in twentyfour when living under zero gravity it seemed a little unfair to lose even that then he grasped the meaning of the message and was fully awake at last it looked as if he would be doing something useful here tom lawson had never been very happy about this assignment he had wanted to do scientific research and the atmosphere aboard lagrange ii was much too distracting balanced here between earth and moon in a cbsmic tightrope act made possible by one of the obscurer consequences of the law of gravitation the satellite was an astronautical maidofallwork ships passing in both directions took their fixes from it and used it as a message centerthough there was no truth in the rumor that they stopped to pick up mail lagrange was also the relay station for almost all lunar radio traffic because the whole earthwardfacing side of the moon lay spread beneath it the hundredcentimeter telescope had been designed to look at objects billions of times farther away than the moon but it was admirably suited for this job from so close at hand even with the low power the view was superb tom seemed to be hanging in space immediately above the sea of rains looking down upon the jagged peaks of the apennines as they glittered in the morning light though he had only a sketchy knowledge of the moons geography he could recognize at a glance the great craters of archimedes and plato aristillus and eudoxus the dark scar of the alpine valley and the solitary pyramid of pico casting its long shadow across the plain but the daylight region did not concern him what he sought lay in the darkened crescent where the sun had not yet risen in some ways that might make his task simpler a signal lampeven a hand torchwould be easily visible down there in the night he checked the map coordinates and punched the control buttons the burning mountains drifted out of his field of view and only blackness remained as he stared into the lunar night that had just swallowed more than twenty men and women at first he could see nothingcertainly no winking signal light flashing its appeal to the stars then as his eyes grew more sensitive he could see that this land was not wholly dark it was glimmering with a ghostly phosphorescence as it lay bathed in the earthlight and the longer he looked the more details he could see there were the mountains to the east of rainbow bay waiting for the dawn that would strike them soon and theremy god what was that star shining in the darkness his hopes soared then swiftly crashed that was only the lights of port roris where even now men would be waiting anxiously for the results of his survey within a few minutes he had convinced himself that a visual search was useless there was not the slightest chance that he could see an oblect no bigger than a bus down there in that faintly luminous landscape in the daytime it would have been different he could have spotted selene at once by the long shadow she cast across the sea but the human eye was not sensitive enough to make this search by the light of the waning earth from a height of fifty thousand kilometers this did not worry tom he had scarcely expected to see anything on this first visual survey it was a century and a half since astronomers had had to rely upon their eyesight today they had far more delicate weaponsa whole armory of light amplifiers and radiation detectors one of these he was certain would be able to find selene he would not have been so sure of this had he known that she was no longer upon the surface of the moon chapter when selene came to rest both crew and passengers were still too stricken by astonishment to utter a sound captain harris was the first to recover perhaps because he was the only one who had any idea of what had happened it was a cavein of course they were not rare though none had ever been recorded in the sea of thirst deep down in the moon something had given way possibly the infinitesimal weight of selene had itself triggered the collapse as pat harris rose shakily to his feet he wondered what line of talk he had better use to the passengers he could hardly pretend that everything was under control and that theyd be on their way again in five minutes on the other hand panic was liable to set in if he revealed the true seriousness of the situation sooner or later he would have to but until then it was essential to maintain confidence he caught miss wilkins eye as she stood at the back of the cabin behind the expectantly waiting passengers she was very pale but quite composed he knew that he could rely on her and flashed her a reassuring smile we seem to be in one piece he began in an easy conversational style weve had a slight accident as youll gather but things could be worse weve been caught in a landslipa moonquake if you like theres certainly no need to be alarmed even if we cant get out under our own power port roris will soon have someone here meanwhile i know that miss wilkins was just going to serve refreshments so i suggest you all relax while iahdo whatever proves necessary that seemed to have gone over quite well with a silent sigh of relief he turned back to the controls as he did so he noticed one of the passengers light a cigarette it was an automatic reaction and one that he felt very much like sharing he said nothing that would have destroyed the atmosphere his little speech had created but he caught the mans eye just long enough for the message to go home the cigarette had been stubbed out before he resumed his seat as he switched on the radio pat heard the babble of conversation start up behind him when a group of people were talking together you could gather their mood even if you could not hear the individual words he could detect annoyance excitement even amusementbut as yet very little fear probably those who were speaking did not realize the full danger of the situation the ones who did were silent and so was the ether he searched the wave bands from end to end and found only a faint crackle from the electrified dust that had buried them it was just as he had expected this deadly stuff with its high metallic content was an almost perfect shield it would pass neither radio waves nor sound when he tried to transmit he would be like a man shouting from the bottom of a well that was packed with feathers he switched the beacon to the highpowered emergency setting so that it automatically broadcast a distress signal on the mooncrash band if anything got through this would there was no point in trying to call port roris himself and his fruitless efforts would merely upset the passengers he left the receiver operating on selenes assigned frequency in case of any reply but he knew that it was useless no one could hear them no one could speak to them as far as they were concerned the rest of the human race might not exist he did not brood over this setback for very long he had expected it and there was too much else to do with the utmost care he checked all the instruments and gauges everything appeared to be perfectly normal except that the temperature was just a shade high that also was to be expected now that the dust blanket was shielding them from the cold of space his greatest worry was the thickness of that blanket and the pressure it was exerting on the boat there must be thousands of tons of the stuff above seleneand her hull had been designed to withstand pressure from within not from without if she went too deep she might be cracked like an eggshell how deep the cruiser was he had no idea when he had caught his last glimpse of the stars she was about ten meters below the surface and she might have been carried down much farther by the suction of the dust it would be advisable even though it would increase their oxygen consumptionto put up the internal pressure and thus take some of the strain off the hull very slowly so that there would be no telltale popping of ears to alarm anyone he boosted the cabin pressure by twenty per cent when he had finished he felt a little happier he was not the only one for as soon as the pressure gauge had stabilized at its new level a quiet voice said over his shoulder i think that was a very good idea he twisted around to see what busybody was spying on him but his angry protest died unborn on his first quick inspection pat had recognized none of the passengers now however he could tell that there was something vaguely familiar about the stocky grayhaired man who had come forward to the drivers position i dont want to intrude captainyoure the skipper here but i thought id better introduce myself in case i can help im commodore hansteen pat stared slackjawed at the man who had led the first expedition to pluto who had probably landed on more virgin planets and moons than any explorer in history all he could say to express his astonishment was you werent down on the passenger list the commodore smiled my alias is hanson since i retired ive been trying to do a little sightseeing without quite so much responsibility and now that ive shaved off my beard no one ever recognizes me im very glad to have you here said pat with deep feeling already some of the weight seemed to have lifted from his shoulders the commodore would be a tower of strength in the difficult hoursor daysthat lay ahead if you dont mind continued hansteen with that same careful politeness id appreciate an evaluation to put it bluntly how long can we last oxygens the limiting factor as usual weve enough for about seven days assuming that no leaks develop so far there are no signs of any well that gives us time to think what about food and water well be hungry but we wont starve theres an emergency reserve of compressed food and of course the air purifiers will produce all the water we need so theres no problem there power plenty now that were not using our motors i notice that you havent tried to call base its useless the dust blankets us completely ive put the beacon on emergencythats our only hope of getting a signal through and its a slim one so theyll have to find us in some other way how long do you think it will take them thats extremely difficult to say the search will begin as soon as our twenty hundred hours transmission is missed and theyll know our general area but we may have gone down without leaving any traceyouve seen how this dust obliterates everything and even when they do find us how will they get us out exactly skipper of twentyseat dustcruiser and commodore of space stared at each other in silence as their minds circled the same problem then cutting across the low murmur of conversation they heard a very english voice call out i say missthis is the first decent cup of tea ive drunk on the moon i thought no one could make it here my congratulations the commodore chuckled quietly he ought to thank you not the stewardess he said pointing to the pressure gauge pat smiled rather wanly in return that was true enough now that he had put up the cabin pressure water must be boiling at nearly its normal sealevel temperature back on earth at last they could have some hot drinksnot the usual tepid ones but it did seem a somewhat extravagant way to make tea not unlike the reputed chinese method of roasting pig by burning down the entire house our big problem said the commodore is to maintain morale i think its important therefore for you to give a pep talk about the search procedure that must be starting now but dont be too optimistic you mustnt give the impression that someone will be knocking on the door inside half an hour that might make it difficult ifwell if we have to wait several days it wont take me long to describe the mooncrash organization said pat and frankly it wasnt planned to deal with a situation like this when a ships down on the moon it can be spotted very quickly from one of the satelliteseither lagrange ii above earthside or lagrange i over farside but i doubt if they can help us now as i said weve probably gone down without leaving a trace thats hard to believe when a ship sinks on earth it always leaves something behindbubbles oil slicks floating wreckage none of those apply to us and i cant think of any way we could send something up to the surfacehowever far away that is so we just have to sit and wait yes agreed pat he glanced at the oxygenreserve indicator and theres one thing we can be sure of we can only wait a week fifty thousand kilometers above the moon tom lawson laid down the last of his photographs he had gone over every square millimeter of the prints with a magnifying glass their quality was excellent the electronic image intensifier millions of times more sensitive than the human eye had revealed details as clearly as if it were already daylight down there on the faintly glimmering plain he had even spotted one of the tiny dustskisor more accurately the long shadow it cast in the earthlight yet there was no trace of selene the sea was as smooth and unruffled as it had been before the coming of man and as it would be in all probability ages after he had gone tom hated to admit defeat even in matters far less important than this he believed that all problems could be solved if they were tackled in the right way with the right equipment this was a challenge to his scientific ingenuity the fact that there were many lives involved was immaterial dr tom lawson had no great use for human beings but he did respect the universe this was a private fight between him and it he considered the situation with a coldly critical intelligence now how would the great holmes have tackled the problem he had eliminated the open sea so that left only one possibility the dustcruiser must have come to grief along the coast or near the mountains probably in the region known ashe checked the chartscrater lake that made good sense an accident was much more likely here than out on the smooth unobstructed plain he looked at the photographs again this time concentrating on the mountains at once he ran into a new difficulty there were scores of isolated crags and boulders along the edge of the sea any one of which might be the missing cruiser worse still there were many areas that he could not survey at all because his view was blocked by the mountains themselves from his vantage point the sea of thirst was far around the curve of the moon and his view of it was badly foreshortened crater lake itself for instance was completely invisible to him hidden by its mountain walls that area could only be investigated by the dustskis working at ground level even tom lawsons godlike eminence was useless here he had better call earthside and give them his interim report lawson lagrange ii he said when communications had put him through ive searched the sea of thirsttheres nothing in the open plain your boat must have gone aground near the edge thank you said an unhappy voice youre quite sure of that absolutely i can see your dustskis and theyre only a quarter the size of selene anything visible along the edge of the sea theres too much smallscale detail to make a search possible i can see fiftyoh a hundredobjects that might be the right size as soon as the sun rises ill be able to examine them more closely but its night down there now remember we appreciate your help let us know if you find anything else down in clavius city the tourist commissioner heard lawsons report with resignation that settled it the next of kin had better be notified it was unwise if not impossible to maintain secrecy any longer he turned to the ground traffic officer and asked is that passenger list in yet just coming over the telefax from port roris here you are as he handed over the flimsy sheet he said inquisitively anyone important aboard all tourists are important said the commissioner coldly without looking up then in almost the same breath he added oh my god whats the matter commodore hansteens aboard what i didnt know he was on the moon weve kept it quiet we thought it was a good idea to have him on the tourist commission now that hes retired he wanted to have a look around incognito before he made up his mind there was a shocked silence as the two men considered the irony of the situation here was one of the greatest heroes of spacelost as an ordinary tourist in some stupid accident in earths backyard the moon that may be very bad luck for the commodore said the traffic controller at last but its good luck for the passengersif theyre still alive theyll need all the luck they can get now the observatory cant help us said the commissioner he was right on the first point but wrong on the second dr tom lawson still had a few tricks up his sleeve and so did the reverend vincent ferraro sj a scientist of a very different kind it was a pity that he and tom lawson were never to meet the resulting fireworks would have been quite interesting father ferraro believed in god and man dr lawson believed in neither the priest had started his scientific career as a geophysicist then switched worlds and became a selenophysicistthough that was a name he used only in his more pedantic moments no man alive had a greater knowledge of the moons interior gleaned from batteries of instruments strategically placed over the entire surface of the satellite those instruments had just produced some rather interesting results at hours minutes seconds gmt there had been a major quake in the general area of rainbow bay that was a little surprising for the area was an unusually stable one even for the tranquil moon father ferraro set his computers to work pinpointing the focus of the disturbance and also instructed them to search for any other anomalous instrument readings he left them at this task while he went to lunch and it was here that his colleagues told him about the missing selene no electronic computer can match the human brain at associating apparently irrelevant facts father ferraro only had time for one spoonful of soup before he had put two and two together and had arrived at a perfectly reasonable but disastrously misleading answer chapter and that ladies and gentlemen is the position concluded commodore hansteen were in no immediate danger and i havent the slightest doubt that well be located quite soon until then we have to make the best of it he paused and swiftly scanned the upturned anxious faces already he had noted the possible trouble spotsthat little man with the nervous tic the acidulous prunefaced lady who kept twisting her handkerchief in knots maybe theyd neutralize each other if he could get them to sit together captain harris and ihes the boss im only acting as his adviserhave worked out a plan of action food will be simple and rationed but will be adequate especially since you wont be engaged in any physical activity we would like to ask some of the ladies to help miss wilkins shell have a lot of extra work and could do with some assistance our biggest problem frankly is going to be boredom by the way did anyone bring any books there was much scrabbling in handbags and baskets the total haul consisted of assorted lunar guides including six copies of the official handbook a current best seller the orange and the apple whose unlikely theme was a romance between nell gwyn and sir isaac newton a harvard press edition of shane with scholarly annotations by a professor of english an introduction to the logical positivism of auguste comte and a weekold copy of the new york times earth edition it was not much of a library but with careful rationing it would help to pass the hours that lay ahead i think well form an entertainment committee to decide how well use this material though i dont know how it will deal with monsieur comte meanwhile now that you know what our situation is are there any questions any points youd like captain harris or myself to explain in more detail theres one thing id like to ask sir said the english voice that had made the complimentary remarks about the tea is there the slightest chance that well float up i mean if this stuff is like water wont we bob up sooner or later like a cork that floored the commodore completely he looked at pat and said wryly thats one for you mr harris any comment pat shook his head im afraid it wont work true the air inside the hull must make us very buoyant but the resistance of this dust is enormous we may float up eventuallyin a few thousand years the englishman it seemed was not easily discouraged i noticed that there was a space suit in the air lock could anyone get out and swim up then the search party will know where we are pat stirred uneasily he was the only one qualified to wear that suit which was purely for emergency use im almost sure its impossible he answered i doubt if a man could move against the resistanceand of course hed be absolutely blind how would he know which way was up and how would you close the outer door after him once the dust had flooded in there would be no way of clearing it you certainly couldnt pump it out again he could have said more but decided to leave it at that they might yet be reduced to such desperate expedients if there was no sign of rescue by the end of the week but that was a nightmare that must be kept firmly at the back of his mind for to dwell too long upon it could only sap his courage if there are no more questions said hansteen i suggest we introduce ourselves whether we like it or not we have to get used to each others company so lets find out who we are ill go round the room and perhaps each of you in turn will give your name occupation and home town you first sir robert bryan civil engineer retired kingston jamaica irving schuster attorney at law chicagoand my wife myra nihal jayawardene professor of zoology university of ceylon peradeniya as the roll call continued pat once again found himself grateful for the one piece of luck in this desperate situation by character training and experience commodore hansteen was a born leader of men already he was beginning to weld this random collection of individuals into a unit to build up that indefinable esprit de corps that transforms a mob into a team these things he had learned while his little fleetthe first ever to vcnturc beyond the orbit of neptune almost three billion miles from the sunhad hung poised week upon weck in the emptiness between the planets pat who was thirty years younger and had never been away from the earthmoon system felt no resentment at the change of command that had tacitly taken place it was nice of the commodore to say that he was still the boss but he knew better duncan mckenzie physicist mount stromlo observatory canberra pierre blanchard cost accountant clavius city earthside phyllis morley journalist london karl johanson nucleonics engineer tsiolkovski base farside that was the lot quite a collection of talent though not an unusual one for the people who came to the moon always had something out of the ordinaryeven if it was only money but all the skill and experience now locked up in selene could not so it seemed to pat do anything to help them in their present situation that was not quite true as commodore hansteen was now about to prove he knew as well as any man alive that they would be fighting boredom as well as fear they had been thrown upon their own resources in an age of universal entertainment and communications they had suddenly been cut off from the rest of the human race radio tv telefax newssheets movies telephoneall these things now meant no more to them than to the people of the stone age they were like some ancient tribe gathered round the campfire in a wilderness that held no other men even on the pluto run thought commodore hansteen they had never been as lonely as this they had had a fine library and had been well stocked with every possible form of canned entertainment and they could talk by tight beam to the inner planets whenever they wished but on selene there was not even a pack of cards that was an idea miss morley as a journalist i imagine you have a notebook why yes commodore fiftytwo blank sheets in it still i think so then i must ask you to sacrifice them please cut them out and mark a pack of cards on them no need to be artisticas long as theyre legible and the lettering doesnt show through the back how are you going to shuffle paper cards asked somebody a good problem for our entertainment committee to solve anyone who thinks they have talent in this direction i used to be on the stage said myra schuster rather hesitantly her husband did not look at all pleased by this revelation but it delighted the commodore excellent though were a little cramped for space i was hoping we might be able to put on a play now mrs schuster looked as unhappy as her husband it was rather a long time ago she said and ii never did much talking there were several chuckles and even the commodore had difficulty in keeping a straight face looking at mrs schuster on the wrong side of both fifty years and a hundred kilos it was a little hard to imagine her as he suspected a chorus girl never mind he said its the spirit that counts who will help mrs schuster ive done some amateur theatricals said professor jayawardene mostly brecht and ibsen though that final though indicated recognition of the fact that something a little lighter would be appreciated heresay one of the decadent but amusing comedies of the s which had invaded the airways in such numbers with the collapse of tv censorship there were no more volunteers for this job so the commodore moved mrs schuster and professor jayawardene into adjacent seats and told them to start programplanning it seemed unlikely that such an illassorted pair would produce anything useful but one never knew the main thing was to keep everyone busy either on tasks of their own or cooperating with others well leave it at that for the moment concluded hansteen if you have any bright ideas please give them to the committee meanwhile i suggest you stretch your legs and get to know each other everyones announced his job and home town many of you must have common interests or know the same friends youll have plenty of things to talk about and plenty of time too he added silently he was conferring with pat in the pilots cubicle when they were joined by dr mckenzie the australian physicist he looked very worriedeven more so than the situation merited theres something i want to tell you commodore he said urgently if im right that sevenday oxygen reserve doesnt mean a thing theres a much more serious danger whats that heat the australian indicated the outside world with a wave of his hand were blanketed by this stuff and its about the best insulator you can have on the surface the heat our machines and bodies generated could escape into space but down here its trapped that means well get hotter and hotteruntil we cook my god said the commodore i never thought of that how long do you think it will take give me half an hour and i can make a fair estimate my guess isnot much more than a day the commodore felt a wave of utter helplessness sweep over him there was a horrible sickness at the pit of his stomach like the second time he had been in free fall if this estimate was right all their hopes were blasted they were slim enough in all conscience but given a week there was a slight chance that something might be done with only a day it was out of the question even if they were found in that time they could never be rescued you might check the cabin temperature continued mckenzie that will give us some indication hansteen walked to the control panel and glanced at the maze of dials and indicators im afraid youre right he said its gone up two degrees already over a degree an hour thats about what i figured the commodore turned to iiarris who had been listening to the discussion with growing alarm is there anything we can do to increase the cooling how much reserve power has our airconditioning gear got before pat could answer the physicist intervened that wont help us he said a little impatiently all that our refrigeration does is to pump heat out of the cabin and radiate it away but thats exactly what it cant do now because of the dust around us if we try to run the cooling plant faster it will actually make matters worse there was a gloomy silence that lasted until the commodore said please check those calculations and let me have your best estimate as soon as you can and for heavens sake dont let this go beyond the three of us he felt suddenly very old he had been almost enjoying his unexpected last command and now it seemed that he would have it only for a day at that very moment though neither party knew the fact one of the searching dustskis was passing overhead built for speed efficiency and cheapness not for the comfort of tourists it bore little resemblance to the sunken selene it was in fact no more than an open sledge with seats for pilot and one passengereach wearing a space suitand with a canopy overhead to give protection from the sun a simple control panel motor and twin fans at the rear storage racks for tools and equipmentthat completed the inventory a ski going about its normal work usually towed at least one carrier sledge behind it sometimes two or three but this one was traveling light it had zigzagged back and forth across several hundred square kilometers of the sea and had found absolutely nothing over the suit intercom the driver was talking to his companion what do you think happened to them george i dont believe theyre here where else can they be kidnaped by outsiders im almost ready to buy that was the halfserious answer sooner or later all astronauts believed the human race would meet intelligences from elsewhere that meeting might still be far in the future but meanwhile the hypothetical outsiders were part of the mythology of space and got the blame for everything that could not be explained in any other way it was easy to believe in them when you were with a mere handful of companions on some strange hostile world where the very rocks and air were completely alien then nothing could be taken for granted and the experience of a thousand earthbound generations might be useless as ancient man had peopled the unknown around him with gods and spirits so homo astronauticus looked over his shoulder when he landed upon each new world wondering who or what was there already for a few brief centuries man had imagined himself the lord of the universe and those primeval hopes and fears had been buried in his subconscious but now they were stronger than ever and with good reason as he looked into the shining face of the heavens and thought of the power and knowledge that must be lurking there better report to base said george weve covered our area and theres no point in going over it again not until sunrise anyway well have a much better chance of finding something then this damned earthlight gives me the creeps he switched on the radio and gave the skis call sign duster two calling traffic control over port roris traffic control here found anything not a trace whats new from your end we dont think shes out in the sea the chief engineer wants to speak to you right put him on hello duster two lawrence here plato observatorys just reported a quake near the mountains of inaccessibility it took place at nineteen thirtyfive which is near enough the time when selene should have been in crater lake they suggest shes been caught in an avalanche somewhere in that area so head for the mountains and see if you can spot any recent slides or rockfalls whats the chance sir asked the dustski pilot anxiously that there may be more quakes very small according to the observatory they say it will be thousands of years before anything like this happens again now that the stresses have been relieved i hope theyre right ill radio when i get to crater lake that should be in about twenty minutes but it was only fifteen minutes before duster two destroyed the last hopes of the waiting listeners duster two calling this is it im afraid ive not reached crater lake yet im still heading up the gorge but the observatory was right about the quake there have been several slides and we had difficulty in getting past some of them there must be ten thousand tons of rock in the one im looking at now if selenes under that lot well never find her and it wont be worth the trouble of looking the silence in traffic control lasted so long that the ski called back hello traffic controldid you receive me receiving you said the chief engineer in a tired voice see if you can find some trace of them ill send duster one in to help are you sure theres no chance of digging them out it might take weeks even if we could locate them i saw one slide three hundred meters long if you tried to dig the rock would probably start moving again be very careful report every fifteen minutes whether you find anything or not lawrence turned away from the microphone physically and mentally exhausted there was nothing more that he could door he suspected that anyone could do trying to compose his thoughts he walked over to the southwardfacing observation window and stared into the face of the crescent earth it was hard to believe that she was fixed there in the southern sky that though she hung so close to the horizon she would neither rise nor set in a million years however long one lived here one never really accepted this fact which violated all the racial wisdom of mankind on the other side of that gulf ripples of shock and grief would soon be spreading thousands of men and women were involved directly or indirectly because the moon had stirred briefly in her sleep lost in his thoughts it was some time before lawrence realized that the port signals officer was trying to attract his attention excuse me siryouve not called duster one shall i do it now what oh yesgo ahead send him to help two in crater lake tell him weve called off the search in the sea of thirst chapter the news that the search had been called off reached lagrange ii when tom lawson redeyed from lack of sleep had almost completed the modifications to the hundredcentimeter telescope he had been racing against time and now it seemed that all his efforts had been wasted selene was not in the sea of thirst at all but in a place where he could never have found herhidden from him by the ramparts of crater lake and for good measure buried by a few thousand tons of rock toms first reaction was not one of sympathy for the victims but of anger at his wasted time and effort those young astronomer finds missing tourists headlines would never flash across the newsscreens of the inhabited worlds as his private dreams of glory collapsed he cursed for a good thirty seconds with a fluency that would have astonished his colleagues then still furious he started to dismantle the equipment he had begged borrowed and stolen from the other projects on the satellite it would have worked he was sure of that the theory had been quite soundindeed it was based on almost a hundred years of practice infrared reconnaissance dated back to at least as early as world war ii when it was used to locate camouflaged factories by their telltale heat though selene had left no visible track across the sea she must surely have left an infrared one her fans had stirred up the relatively warm dust a foot or so down scattering it across the far colder surface layers an eye that could see by the rays of heat could track her path for hours after she had passed there would have been just time tom calculated to make such an infrared survey before the sun rose and obliterated all traces of the faint heat trail through the cold lunar night but obviously there was no point in trying now it was well that no one aboard selene could have guessed that the search in the sea of thirst had been abandoned and that the dustskis were concentrating their efforts inside crater lake and it was well also that none of the passengers knew of dr mckenzies predictions the physicist had drawn on a piece of homemade graph paper the expected rise of temperature every hour he noted the reading of the cabin thermometer and pinpointed it on the curve the agreement with theory was depressingly good in twenty hours one hundred ten degrees fahrenheit would be passed and the first deaths from heatstroke would be occurring whatever way he looked at it they had barely a day to live in these circumstances commodore hansteens efforts to maintain morale seemed no more than an ironic jest whether he failed or succeeded it would be all the same by the day after tomorrow yet was that true though their only choice might lie between dying like men and dying like animals surely the first was better it made no difference even if selene remained undiscovered until the end of time so that no one ever knew how her occupants passed their final hours this was beyond logic or reason but so for that matter was almost everything that was really important in the shaping of mens lives and deaths commodore hansteen was well aware of that as he planned the program for the dwindling hours that lay ahead some men are born to be leaders and he was one of them the emptiness of his retirement had been suddenly filled for the first time since he had left the bridge of his flagship centaurus he felt whole again as long as his little crew was busy he need not worry about morale it did not matter what they were doing provided they thought it interesting or important that poker game for instance took care of the space administration accountant the retired civil engineer and the two executives on vacation from new york one could tell at a glance that they were all poker fanatics the problem would be to stop them playing not to keep them occupied most of the other passengers had split up into little discussion groups talking quite cheerfully among themselves the entertainment committee was still in session with professor jayawardene making occasional notes while mrs schuster reminisced about her days in burlesque despite the attempts of her husband to shut her up the only person who seemed a little apart from it all was miss morley who was writing slowly and carefully using a very minute hand in what was left of her notebook presumably like a good journalist she was keeping a diary of their adventure commodore hansteen was afraid that it would be briefer than she suspected and that not even those few pages would be filled and if they were he doubted that anyone would ever read them he glanced at his watch and was surprised to see how late it was by now he should have been on the other side of the moon back in clavius city he had a lunch engagement at the lunar hilton and after that a trip tobut there was no point in thinking about a future that could never exist the brief present was all that would ever concern him now it would be as well to get some sleep before the temperature became unbearable selene had never been designed as a dormitoryor a tomb for that matterbut it would have to be turned into one now this involved some research and planning and a certain amount of damage to tourist commission property it took him twenty minutes to ascertain all the facts then after a brief conference with captain harris he called for attention ladies and gentlemen he said weve all had a busy day and i think most of us will be glad to get some sleep this presents a few problems but ive been doing some experimenting and have discovered that with a little encouragement the center annrests between the seats come out theyre not supposed to but i doubt if the commission will sue us that means that ten of us can stretch out across the seats the rest will have to use the floor another point as you will have noticed its become rather warm and will continue to do so for some time therefore i advise you to take off all unnecessary clothing comfort is much more important than modesty well turn off the main cabin lights but since we dont want to be in complete darkness well leave on the emergency lighting at low power one of us will remain on watch at all times in the skippers seat mr harris is working out a roster of twohour shifts any questions or comments there were none and the commodore breathed a sigh of relief he was afraid that someone would be inquisitive about the rising temperature and was not quite sure how he would have answered his many accomplishments did not include the gift of lying and he was anxious that the passengers should have as untroubled a sleep as was possible in the circumstances barring a miracle it would be their last miss wilkins who was beginning to lose a little of her professional smartness took round final drinks for those who needed them most of the passengers had already begun to remove their outer clothing the more modest ones waited until the main lights went off in the dim red glow the interior of selene now had a fantastic appearance one that would have been utterly inconceivable when she left port roris a few hours before twentytwo men and women most of them stripped down to their underclothing lay sprawled across the seats or along the floor a few lucky ones were already snoring but for most sleep would not come as easily as that captain harris had chosen a position at the very rear of the cruiser in fact he was not in the cabin at all but in the tiny airlock galley it was a good vantage point now that the communicating door had been slid back he could look the whole length of the cabin and keep an eye on everyone inside it he folded his uniform into a pillow and lay down on the unyielding floor it was six hours before his watch was due and he hoped he could get some sleep before then sleep the last hours of his life were ticking away yet he had nothing better to do how well do condemned men sleep he wondered in the night that will end with the gallows he was so desperately tired that even this thought brought no emotion the last thing he saw before consciousness slipped away was dr mckenzie taking yet another temperature reading and carefully plotting it on his chart like an astrologer casting a horoscope fifteen meters abovea distance that could be covered in a single stride under this low gravitymorning had already come there is no twilight on the moon but for many hours the sky had held the promise of dawn stretching far ahead of the sun was the glowing pyramid of the zodiacal light so seldom seen on earth with infinite slowness it edged its way above the horizon growing brighter and brighter as the moment of sunrise approached now it had merged into the opalescent glory of the corona and now a million times more brilliant than either a thin thread of fire began to spread along the horizon as the sun made its reappearance after fifteen days of darkness it would take more than an hour for it to lift itself clear of the sky line so slowly did the moon turn on its axis but the night had already ended a tide of ink was swiftly ebbing from the sea of thirst as the fierce light of dawn swept back the darkness now the whole drab expanse of the sea was raked with almost horizontal rays had there been anything showing above its surface this grazing light would have thrown its shadow for hundreds of meters revealing it at once to any who were searching but there were no searchers there duster one and duster two were busy on their fruitless quest in crater lake fifteen kilometers away they were still in darkness it would be another two days before the sun rose above the surrounding peaks though their summits were already blazing with the dawn as the hours passed the sharpedged line of light would creep down the flanks of the mountainssometimes moving no faster than a man could walkuntil the sun climbed high enough for its rays to strike into the crater but manmade light was already shining there flashing among the rocks as the searchers photographed the slides that had come sweeping silently down the mountains when the moon trembled in its sleep within an hour those photographs would have reached earth in another two all the inhabited worlds would have seen them it would be very bad for the tourist business when captain harris awoke it was already much hotter yet it was not the now oppressive heat that had interrupted his sleep a good hour before he was due to go on watch though he had never spent a night aboard her pat knew all the sounds that selene could make when the motors were not running she was almost silent one had to listen carefully to notice the susurration of the air pumps and the low throb of the cooling plant those sounds were still there as they had been before he went to sleep they were unchanged but they had been joined by another it was a barely audible whisper so faint that for a moment he could not be sure he was not imagining it that it should have called to his subconscious mind across the barriers of sleep seemed quite incredible even now that he was awake he could not identify it or decide from which direction it came then abruptly he knew why it had awakened him in a second the sogginess of sleep had vanished he got quickly to his feet and pressed his ear against the airlock door for that mysterious sound was coming from outside the hull now he could hear it faint but distinct and it set his skin crawling with apprehension there could be no doubt it was the sound of countless dust grains whispering past selenes walls like a ghostly sandstorm what did it mean was the sea once more on the move if so would it take selene with it yet there was not the slightest vibration or sense of motion in the cruiser itself only the outside world was rustling past very quietly being careful not to disturb his sleeping companions pat tiptoed into the darkened cabin it was dr mckenzies watch the scientist was hunched up in the pilots seat staring out through the blinded windows he turned round as pat approached and whispered anything wrong at your end i dont knowcome and see back in the galley they pressed their ears against the outer door and listened for a long time to that mysterious crepitation presently mckenzie said the dusts moving all right but i dont see why that gives us another puzzle to worry about another yes i dont understand whats happening to the temperature its still going up but nothing like as fast as it should the physicist seemed really annoyed that his calculations had proved incorrect but to pat this was the first piece of good news since the disaster dont look so miserable about it we all make mistakes and if this one gives us a few more days to live im certainly not complaining but i couldnt have made a mistake the math is elementary we know how much heat twentytwo people generate and it must go somewhere they wont produce so much heat when theyre sleeping maybe that explains it you dont think id overlook anything so obvious as that said the scientist testily it helps but it isnt enough theres some other reason why were not getting as hot as we should lets just accept the fact and be thankful said pat meanwhile what about this noise with obvious reluctance mckenzie switched his mind to the new problem the dusts moving but we arent so its probably merely a local effect in fact it only seems to be happening at the back of the cabin i wonder if that has any significance he gestured to the bulkhead behind them whats on the other side of this the motors oxygen reserve cooling equipment cooling equipment of course i remember noticing that when i came aboard our radiator fins are back there arent they thats right now i see whats happened theyve got so hot that the dust is circulating like any liquid thats heated theres a dust fountain outside and its carrying away our surplus heat with any luck the temperature will stabilize now we wont be comfortable but we can survive in the crimson gloom the two men looked at each other with a dawning hope then pat said slowly im sure thats the explanation perhaps our lucks beginning to turn he glanced at his watch and did a quick mental calculation the suns rising over the sea about now base will have the dustskis out looking for us and they must know our approximate position ten to one theyll find us in a few hours should we tell the commodore no let him sleep hes had a harder day than any of us this news can wait until morning when mckenzie had left him pat tried to resume his interrupted sleep but he could not do so he lay with eyes open in the faint red glow wondering at this strange turn of fate the dust that had swallowed and then had threatened to broil them had now come to their aid as its convection currents swept their surplus heat up to the surface whether those currents would continue to flow when the rising sun smote the sea with its fall fury he could not guess outside the wall the dust still whispered past and suddenly pat was reminded of an antique hourglass he had once been shown as a child when you turned it over sand poured through a narrow constriction into the lower chamber and its rising level marked the passage of the minutes and the hours before the invention of clocks myriads of men must have had their days divided by such falling grains of sand but none until now surely had ever had his life span metered out by a fountain of rising dust chapter in clavius city chief administrator olsen and tourist commissioner davis had just finished conferring with the legal department it had not been a cheerful occasion much of the time had been spent discussing the waivers of responsibility which the missing tourists had signed before they boarded selene commissioner davis had been much against this when the trips were started on the grounds that it would scare away customers but the administrations lawyers had insisted now he was very glad that they had had their way he was glad also that the port roris authorities had done the job properly matters like this were sometimes treated as unimportant formalities and quietly ignored there was a full list of signatures for selenes passengerswith one possible exception that the lawyers were still arguing about the incognito commodore had been listed as r s hanson and it looked very much as if this was the name he had actually signed the signature was however so illegible that it might well have been hansteen until a facsimile was radioed from earth no one would be able to decide this point it was probably unimportant because the commodore was traveling on official business the administration was bound to accept some responsibility for him and for all the other passengers it was responsible morally if not legally above all it had to make an effort to find them and give them a decent burial this little problem had been placed squarely in the lap of chief engineer lawrence who was still at port roris he had seldom tackled anything with less enthusiasm while there was a chance that the selenes passengers were still alive he would have moved heaven earth and moon to get at them but now that they must be dead he saw no point in risking mens lives to locate them and dig them out personally he could hardly think of a better place to be buried than among these eternal hills that they were dead chief engineer robert lawrence did not have the slightest doubt all the facts fitted together too perfectly the quake had occurred at just about the time selene should have been leaving crater lake and the gorge was now half blocked with slides even the smallest of those would have crushed her like a paper toy and those aboard would have perished within seconds as the air gushed out if by some milliontoone chance she had escaped being smashed her radio signals would have been received the tough little automatic beacon had been built to take any reasonable punishment and if that was out of action it must have been some crackup the first problem would be to locate the wreck that might be fairly easy even if it was buried beneath a million tons of rubble there were prospecting instruments and a whole range of metal detectors that could do the trick and when the hull was cracked the air inside would have rushed out into the lunar nearvacuum even now hours later there would be traces of carbon dioxide and oxygen that might be spotted by one of the gas detectors used for pinpointing spaceship leaks as soon as the dustskis came back to base for servicing and recharging hed get them fitted with leak detectors and would send them sniffing round the rockslides nofinding the wreck might be simplebut getting it out might be impossible he wouldnt guarantee that the job could be done for a hundred million for one thing it was a physical impossibility to bring heavy equipment into the areathe sort of equipment needed to move thousands of tons of rubble the flimsy little dustskis were useless to shift those rockslides one would have to float moondozers across the sea of thirst and import whole shiploads of gelignite to blast a road through the mountains the whole idea was absurd he could understand the administrations point of view but he was damned if he would let his overworked engineering division get saddled with such a sisyphean task as tactfully as possiblefor the chief administrator was not the sort of man who liked to take no for an answerhe began to draft his report summarized it might have read a the jobs almost certainly impossible b if it can be done at all it will cost millions and may involve further loss of life c its not worth doing anyway but because such bluntness would make him unpopular and he had to give his reasons the report ran to over three thousand words when he had finished dictating he paused to marshal his ideas could think of nothing further and added copies to chief administrator moon chief engineer farside supervisor traffic control tourist commissioner central filing classify as confidential he pressed the transcription key within twenty seconds all twelve pages of his report impeccably typed and punctuated with several grammatical slips corrected had emerged from the office telefax he scanned it rapidly in case the electrosecretary had made mistakes she did this occasionally especially during rush periods when she might be taking dictation from a dozen sources at once in any event no wholly sane machine could cope with all the eccentricities of a language like english and every wise executive checked his final draft before he sent it out many were the hilarious disasters that had overtaken those who had left it all to electronics lawrence was halfway through this task when the telephone rang lagrange ii on the line sir said the operatora human one as it happened a doctor lawson wants to speak to you lawson who the devils that the cee asked himself then he remembered that was the astronomer who was making the telescopic search surely someone had told him that it was useless the chief engineer had never had the dubious privilege of meeting dr lawson he did not know that the astronomer was a very neurotic and very brilliant young manand what was more important in this case a very stubborn one lawson had just begun to dismantle the infrared scanner when he stopped to consider his action since he had practically completed the blasted thing he might as well test it out of sheer scientific curiosity he prided himself rightly as a practical experimenter this was something unusual in an age when most socalled astronomers were really mathematicians who never went near an observatory he was now so tired that only sheer cussedness kept him going if the scanner had not worked the first time he would have postponed testing it until he had had some sleep but by the good luck that is occasionally the reward of skill it did work only a few minor adjustments were needed before the image of the sea of thirst began to build up upon the viewing screen it appeared line by line like an oldfashioned tv picture as the infrared detector scanned back and forth across the face of the moon the light patches indicated relatively warm areas the dark ones regions of cold almost all the sea of thirst was dark except for a brilliant band where the rising sun had already touched it with fire but in that darkness as tom looked closely he could see some very faint tracks glimmering as feebly as the paths of snails through some moonlit garden back on earth beyond doubt there was the heat trail of selene and there also much fainter were the zigzags of the dustskis that even now were searching for her all the trails converged toward the mountains of inaccessibility and there vanished beyond his field of view he was much too tired to examine them closely and in any event it no longer mattered for this merely confirmed what was already known his only satisfaction which was of some importance to him lay in the proof that another piece of lawsonbuilt equipment had obeyed his will for the record he photographed the screen then staggered to bed to catch up with his arrears of sleep three hours later he awoke from a restless slumber despite his extra hour in bed he was still tired but something was worrying him and would not let him sleep as the faint whisper of moving dust had disturbed pat harris in the sunken selene so also fifty thousand kilometers away tom lawson was recalled from sleep by a trifling variation from the normal the mind has many watchdogs sometimes they bark unnecessarily but a wise man never ignores their warning still blearyeyed tom left the cluttered little cell that was his private cabin aboard lagrange hooked himself on to the nearest moving belt and drifted along the gravityless corridors until he had reached the observatory he exchanged a surly good morning with those of his colleagues who did not see him in time to take avoiding action then thankful to be alone he settled down among the instruments that were the only things he loved he ripped the photograph out of the oneshot camera where it had been lying all night and looked at it for the first time it was then that he saw the stubby trail emerging from the mountains of inaccessibility and ending a very short distance away in the sea of thirst he must have seen it last night when he looked at the screenbut he had not noticed it for a scientist that was a serious almost an unforgivable lapse and tom felt very angry with himself he had let his preconceived ideas affect his powers of observation what did it mean he examined the area closely with a magnifier the trail ended in a small diffuse dot which he judged to be about two hundred meters across it was very oddalmost as if selene had emerged from the mountains and then taken off like a spaceship toms first theory was that she had blown to pieces and that this smudge of heat was the aftermath of the explosion but in that case there would have been plenty of wreckage most of it light enough to float on the dust the skis could hardly have missed it when they passed through this areaas the thin distinctive track of one showed it had indeed done there had to be some other explanation yet the alternative seemed absurd it was almost impossible to imagine that anything as large as selene could sink without trace in the sea of thirst merely because there had been a quake in that neighborhood he certainly could not call the moon on the evidence of a single photograph and say youre looking in the wrong place though he pretended that the opinion of others meant nothing to him tom was terrified of making a fool of himself before he could advance this fantastic theory he would have to get more evidence through the telescope the sea was now a flat and featureless glare of light visual observation merely confirmed what he had proved before sunrise there was nothing more than a few centimeters high projecting above the dust surface the infrared scanner was no greater help the heat trails had vanished completely wiped out hours ago by the sun tom adjusted the instrument for maximum sensitivity and searched the area where the trail had ended perhaps there was some lingering trace that could be picked up even now some faint smudge of heat that still persisted strong enough to be detected even in the warmth of the lunar morning for the sun was still low and its rays had not yet attained the murderous power they would possess at noon was it imagination he had the gain turned full up so that the instrument was on the verge of instability from time to time at the very limit of its detecting power he thought he could see a tiny glimmer of heat in the exact area where last nights track had ended it was all infuriatingly inconclusivenot at all the sort of evidence that a scientist needed especially when he was going to stick his neck out if he said nothing no one would ever know but all his life he would be haunted by doubts yet if he committed himself he might raise false hopes become the laughingstock of the solar system or be accused of seeking personal publicity he could not have it both ways he would have to make a decision with great reluctance knowing that he was taking a step from which there could be no turning back he picked up the observatory phone lawson here he said get me luna centralpriority chapter aboard selene breakfast had been adequate but hardly inspiring there were several complaints from passengers who thought that crackers and compressed meat a dab of honey and a glass of tepid water scarcely constituted a good meal but the commodore had been adamant we dont know how long this has got to last us he said and im afraid we cant have hot meals theres no way of preparing them and its too warm in the cabin already sorry no more tea or coffee and frankly it wont do any of us much harm to cut down on the calories for a few days that came out before he remembered mrs schuster and he hoped that she wouldnt take it as a personal affront ungirdled after last nights general clothesshedding she now looked rather like a goodnatured hippopotamus as she lay sprawled over a seat and a half the suns just risen overhead continued hansteen the search parties will be out and its only a matter of time before they locate us its been suggested that we have a sweepstake on that miss morley whos keeping the log will collect your bets now about our program for the day professor jayawardene perhaps youll let us know what the entertainment committee has arranged the professor was a small birdlike person whose gentle dark eyes seemed much too large for him it was obvious that he had taken the task of entertainment very seriously for his delicate brown hand clutched an impressive sheaf of notes as you know he said my speciality is the theaterbut im afraid that doesnt help us very much it would be nice to have a playreading and i thought of writing out some parts unfortunately were too short of paper to make that possible so well have to think of something else theres not much reading matter on board and some of it is rather specialized but we do have two novelsa university edition of one of the classic westerns shane and this new historical romance the orange and the apple the suggestion is that we form a panel of readers and go through them has anyone any objectionor any better ideas we want to play poker said a firm voice from the rear but you cant play poker all the time protested the professor thus showing a certain ignorance of the nonacademic world the commodore decided to go to his rescue the reading need not interfere with the poker he said besides i suggest you take a break now and then those cards wont last much longer well which book shall we start on first and any volunteers as readers ill be quite happy to do so but we want some variety i object to wasting our time on the orange and tile apple said miss morley its utter trash and most of it isernearpornography how do you know asked david barrett the englishman who had commended the tea the only answer was an indignant sniff professor jayawardene looked quite unhappy and glanced at the commodore for support he did not get any hansteen was studiously looking the other way if the passengers relied on him for everything that would be fatal as far as possible he wanted them to stand on their own feet very well said the professor to prevent any argument well start with shane there were several protesting cries of we want the orange and the apple but surprisingly the professor stood firm its a very long book he said i really dont think well have time to finish it before were rescued he cleared his throat looked around the cabin to see if there were any further objections and then started to read in an extremely pleasant though rather singsong voice introduction the role of the western in the age of space by karl adams professor of english being based on the kingsley amis seminars in criticism at the university of chicago the poker players were wavering one of them was nervously examining the worn pieces of paper that served as cards the rest of the audience had settled down with looks of boredom or anticipation miss wilkins was back in the airlock galley checking the provisions the melodious voice continued one of the most unexpected literary phenomena of our age has been the revival after half a century of neglect of the romance known as the western these stories set in a background extremely limited in both space and timethe united states of america earth circa were for a considerable period one of the most popular forms of fiction the world has ever known millions were written almost all published in cheap magazines and shoddily produced books but out of those millions a few have survived both as literature and as a record of an agethough we must never forget that the writers were describing an era that had passed long before they were born with the opening up of the solar system in the s the earthbased frontier of the american west seemed so ludicrously tiny that the reading public lost interest in it this of course was as illogical as dismissing hamlet on the grounds that events restricted to a small and drafty danish castle could not possibly be of universal significance during the last few years however a reaction has set in i am creditably informed that western stories are among the most popular reading matter in the libraries of the space liners now plying between the planets let us see if we can discover the reason for this apparent paradoxthis link between the old west and the new space perhaps we can best do this by divesting ourselves of all our modern scientific achievements and imagining that we are back in the incredibly primitive world of picture a vast open plain stretching away into the distance until it merges into a faroff line of misty mountains across that plain is crawling with agonizing slowness a line of clumsy wagons around them ride men on horseback bearing gunsfor this is indian territory it will take those wagons longer to reach the mountains than a starclass liner now requires to make the journey from earth to moon the space of the prairie was just as great therefore to the men who challenged it as the space of the solar system is to us this is one of the links we have with the western there are others even more fundamental to understand them we must first consider the role of the epic in literature it seemed to be going well thought the commodore an hour would be long enough at the end of that time professor j would be through the introduction and well into the story then they could switch to something else preferably at an exciting moment in the narrative so that the audience would be anxious to get back to it yes the second day beneath the dust had started smoothly with everyone in good heart but how many days were there still to go the answer to that question depended upon two men who had taken an instant dislike to each other even though they were fifty thousand kilometers apart as he listened to dr lawsons account of his discoveries the chief engineer found himself torn in opposing directions the astronomer had a most unfortunate method of approach especially for a youngster who was addressing a very senior official more than twice his age he talks to me thought lawrence at first more amused than angry as if im a retarded child who has to have everything explained to him in words of one syllable when lawson had finished the cee was silent for a few seconds as he examined the photographs that had come over the telefax while they were talking the earlier one taken before sunrise was certainly suggestivebut it was not enough to prove the case in his opinion and the one taken after dawn showed nothing at all on the reproduction he had received there might have been something on the original print but he would hate to take the word of this unpleasant young man for it this is very interesting doctor lawson he said at last its a great pity though that you didnt continue your observations when you took the first photos then we might have had something more conclusive tom bridled instantly at this criticism despiteor perhaps because ofthe fact that it was wellfounded if you think that anyone else could have done better he snapped oh im not suggesting that said lawrence anxious to keep the peace but where do we go from here the spot you indicate may be fairly small but its position is uncertain by at least half a kilometer there may be nothing visible on the surface even in daylight is there any way we can pinpoint it more accurately theres one very obvious method use this same technique at ground level go over the area with an infrared scanner that will locate any hot spot even if its only a fraction of a degree warmer than its surroundings a good idea said lawrence ill see what can be arranged and will call you back if i need any further information thank you very muchdoctor he hung up quickly and wiped his brow then he immediately put through another call to the satellite lagrange ii chief engineer earthside here give me the director please professor kotelnikov this is lawrence im fine thanks ive been talking to your doctor lawson no he hasnt done anything except nearly make me lose my temper hes been looking for our missing dustcruiser and he thinks hes found her what id like to know ishow competent is he in the next five minutes the chief engineer learned a good deal about young dr lawson rather more in fact than he had any right to know even over a confidential circuit when professor kotelnikov had paused for breath he interjected sympathetically i can understand why you put up with him poor kidi thought orphanages hike that went out with dickens and the twentieth century a good thing it did burn down do you suppose he set fire to it no dont answer thatyouve told me hes a firstclass observer and thats all i want to know thanks a lot see you down here someday in the next halfhour lawrence made a dozen calls to points all over the moon at the end of that time he had accumulated a large amount of information now he had to act on it at plato observatory father ferraro thought the idea was perfectly plausible in fact he had already suspected that the focus of the quake was under the sea of thirst rather than the mountains of inaccessibility but couldnt prove it because the sea had such a damping effect on all vibrations no a complete set of soundings had never been made it would be very tedious and time consuming hed probed it himself in a few places with telescopic rods and had always hit bottom at less than forty meters his guess for the average depth was under ten meters and it was much shallower round the edges no he didnt have an infrared detector but the astronomers on farside might be able to help sorry no ir detector at dostoevski our work is all in the ultraviolet try verne oh yes we used to do some work in the infrared a couple of years backtaking spectrograms of giant red stars but do you know what there were enough traces of lunar atmosphere to interfere with the readings so the whole program was shifted out into space try lagrange it was at this point that lawrence called traffic control for the shipping schedules from earth and found that he was in luck but the next move would cost a lot of money and only the chief administrator could authorize it that was one good thing about olsen he never argued with his technical staff over matters that were in their province he listened carefully to lawrences story and went straight to the main point if this theory is true he said theres a chance that they may still be alive after all more than a chance id say its quite likely we know the sea is shallow so they cant be very deep the pressure on the hull would be fairly low it may still be intact so you want this fellow lawson to help with the search the chief engineer gave a gesture of resignation hes about the last person i want he answered but im afraid weve got to have him chapter the skipper of the cargo liner auriga was furious and so was his crewbut there was nothing they could do about it ten hours out from earth and five hours from the moon they were ordered to stop at lagrange with all the waste of speed and extra computing that implied and to make matters worse they were being diverted from chavius city to that miserable dump port roris practically on the other side of the moon the ether crackled with messages canceling dinners and assignations all over the southern hemisphere not far from full the mottled silver disc of the moon its eastern limb wrinkled with easily visible mountains formed a dazzling background to lagrange ii as auriga came to rest a hundred kilometers earthward of the station she was allowed no closer the interference produced by her equipment and the glare of her jets had already affected the sensitive recording instruments on the satellite only oldfashioned chemical rockets were permitted to operate in the immediate neighborhood of lagrange plasma drives and fusion plants were strictly taboo carrying one small case full of clothing and one large case full of equipment tom lawson entered the liner twenty minutes after his departure from lagrange the shuttle pilot had refused to hurry despite urgings from auriga the new passenger was greeted without warmth as he came aboard he would have been received quite differently had anyone known his mission the chief administrator however had ruled that it should be kept secret for the present he did not wish to raise false hopes among the relatives of the lost passengers the tourist commissioner had wanted an immediate release maintaining that it would prove that they were doing their best but olsen had said firmly wait until he produces results then you can give something to your friends in the news agencies the order was already too late aboard auriga maurice spenser bureau chief of interphanet news was on his way to take up his duties in clavius city he was not sure if this was a promotion or demotion from peking but it would certainly be a change unlike all the other passengers he was not in the least annoyed by the change of course the delay was on the firms time and as an old newsman he always welcomed the unusual the break in the established routine it was certainly odd for a moonbound liner to waste several hours and an unimaginable amount of energy to stop at lagrange just to pick up a dourfaced young man with a couple of pieces of baggage and why the diversion from clavius to port roris toplevel instructions from earth said the skipper and seemed to be telling the truth when he disowned all further knowledge it was a mystery and mysteries were spensers business he made one shrewd guess at the reason and was rightor almost rightthe first time it must have something to do with that lost dustcruiser there had been such a fuss about just before he left earth this scientist from lagrange must have some information about her or must be able to assist in the search but why the secrecy perhaps there was some scandal or mistake that the lunar administration was trying to hush up the simple and wholly creditable reason never occurred to spenser he avoided speaking to lawson during the remainder of the brief trip and was amused to note that the few passengers who tried to strike up a conversation were quickly rebuffed spenser bided his time and that time came thirty minutes before landing it was hardly an accident that he was sitting next to lawson when the order came to fasten seat belts for deceleration with the fifteen other passengers they sat in the tiny blackedout lounge hooking at the swiftly approaching moon projected on a viewing screen from a lens in the outer hull the image seemed sharper and more brilliant even than in real life it was as if they were inside an oldfashioned camera obscura the arrangement was much safer than having an actual observation windowa structural hazard that spaceship designers fought against tooth and nail that dramatically expanding landscape was a glorious and unforgettable sight yet spenser could give it only half his attention he was watching the man beside him his intense aquiline features barely visible in the reflected light from the screen isnt it somewhere down there he said in his most casual tone of voice that the boatload of tourists has just been lost yes said tom after a considerable delay i dont know my way about the moon any idea where theyre supposed to be even the most uncooperative of men spenser had long ago discovered could seldom resist giving information if you made it seem that they were doing you a favor and gave them a chance of airing their superior knowledge the trick worked in nine cases out of ten it worked now with tom lawson theyre down there he said pointing to the center of the screen those are the mountains of inaccessibility thats the sea of thirst all around them spenser stared in entirely unsimulated awe at the sharply etched blacks and whites of the mountains toward which they were falling he hoped the pilothuman or electronicknew his job the ship seemed to be coming in very fast then he realized that they were drifting toward the flatter territory on the left of the picture the mountains and the curious gray area surrounding them were sliding away from the center of the screen port roris tom volunteered unexpectedly pointing to a barely visible black mark on the far left thats where were landing well id hate to come down in those mountains said spenser determined to keep the conversation on target theyll never find the poor devils if theyre lost in that wilderness anyway arent they supposed to be buried under an avalanche tom gave a superior laugh theyre supposed to be he said whyisnt that true a little belatedly tom remembered his instructions cant tell you anything more he replied in that same smug cocksure voice spenser dropped the subject he had already learned enough to convince him of one thing chavius city would have to wait he had better hang on at port roris for a while he was even more certain of this when his envious eyes saw dr tom lawson cleared through quarantine customs immigration and exchange control in three minutes flat had any eavesdropper been listening to the sounds inside selene he would have been very puzzled the cabin was reverberating unmelodioushy to the sound of twentyone voices in almost as many keys singing happy birthday to you when the din had subsided commodore hansteen called out anyone else besides mrs williams who just remembered that its his or her birthday we know of course that some ladies like to keep it quiet when they reach a certain age there were no volunteers but duncan mckenzie raised his voice above the general laughter theres a funny thing about birthdaysi used to win bets at parties with it knowing that there are three hundred and sixtyfive days in the year how large a group of people would you think was needed before you had a fiftyfifty chance that two of them shared the same birthday after a brief pause while the audience considered the question someone answered why half of three hundred and sixtyfive i suppose say a hundred and eighty thats the obvious answerand its completely wrong if you have a group of more than twentyfour people the odds are better than even that two of them have the same birthday thats ridiculous twentyfour days out of three sixtyfive cant give those odds sorryit does and if there are more than forty people nine times out of ten two of them will have the same birthday theres a sporting chance that it might work with the twentytwo of us what about trying it commodore very well ill go round the room and ask each one of you for his date of birth oh no protested mckenzie people cheat if you do it that way the dates must be written down so that nobody knows anyone elses birthday an almost blank page from one of the tourist guides was sacrificed for this purpose and torn up into twentytwo slips when they were collected and read to everyones astonishmentand mckenzies gratificationit turned out that both pat harris and robert bryan had been born on may pure luck said a skeptic thus igniting a brisk mathematical argument among half a dozen of the male passengers the ladies were quite uninterested either because they did not care for mathematics or because they preferred to ignore birthdays when the commodore decided that this had gone on long enough he rapped for attention ladies and gentlemen he called lets get on with the next item on our program im pleased to say that the entertainment committee consisting of mrs schuster and professor jayaer professor jhas come up with an idea that should give us some amusement they suggest that we set up a court and crossexamine everybody here in turn the object of the court is to find an answer to this question why did we come to the moon in the first place of course some people may not want to be examinedfor all i know half of you may be on the run from the police or your wives youre at liberty to refuse to give evidence but dont blame us if we draw the worst possible conclusions if you do well what do you think of the idea it was received with fair enthusiasm in some quarters and ironic groans of disapproval in others but since there was no determined opposition the commodore went ahead almost automatically he was elected president of the court equally automatic was irving schusters appointment as general counsel the frontright pair of seats had been reversed so that it faced toward the rear of the cruiser this served as the bench shared by the president and counsel when everyone had settled down and the clerk of the court had called for order the president made a brief address we are not yet engaged in criminal proceedings he said keeping his face straight with some difficulty this is purely a court of enquiry if any witness feels that he is being intimidated by my learned colleague he can appeal to the court will the clerk call the first witness eryour honorwho is the first witness said the clerk reasonably enough it took ten minutes of discussion among the court learned counsel and argumentative members of the public to settle this important point finally it was decided to have a ballot and the first name to be produced was david barretts smiling slightly the witness came forward and took his stand in the narrow space before the bench irving schuster looking and feeling none too legal in undershirt and underpants cleared his throat impressively your name is david barrett that is correct your occupation agricultural engineer retired mr barrett will you tell this court exactly why you have come to the moon i was curious to see what it was like here and i had the time and money irving schuster looked at barrett obliquely through his thick glasses he had always found this had an unsettling effect on witnesses to wear spectacles was almost a sign of eccentricity in this age but doctors and lawyersespecially the older onesstill patronized them indeed they had come to symbolize the legal and medical professions you were curious to see what it was like schuster quoted thats no explanation why were you curious i am afraid that question is so vaguely worded that i cannot answer it why does one do anything commodore hansteen relaxed with a smile of pleasure this was just what he wantedto get the passengers arguing and talking freely about something that would be of mutual interest to them all but would arouse no passions or controversy i admit continued counsel that my question might have been more specific i will try to reframe it he thought for a moment shuffling his notes they consisted merely of sheets from one of the tourist guides he had scribbled a few hines of questioning in the margins but they were really for effect and reassurance he had never hiked to stand up in court without something in his hand there were times when a few seconds of imaginary consultation were priceless would it be fair to say that you were attracted by the moons scenic beauties yes that was part of the attraction i had seen the tourist literature and movies of course and wondered if the reality would live up to it and has it done so i would say was the dry answer that it has exceeded my expectations there was general laughter from the rest of the company commodore hansteen rapped loudly on the back of his seat order he called if there are any disturbances i shall have to clear the court this as he had intended started a much louder round of laughter which he let run its natural course when the mirth had died down schuster continued in his most where were you on the night of the twentysecond tone of voice this is very interesting mr barrett you have come all the way to the moon at considerable expense to hook at the view tell mehave you ever seen the grand canyon no have you your honor appealed schuster the witness is being unresponsive hansteen looked severely at mr barrett who did not seem in the least abashed you are not conducting this enquiry mr barrett your job is to answer questions not to ask them i beg the courts pardon my lord replied the witness eram i my lord said hansteen uncertainly turning to schuster i thought i was your honor the lawyer gave the matter several seconds of solemn thought i suggestyour honorthat each witness use the procedure to which he is accustomed in his country as long as due deference is shown to the court that would seem to be sufficient very wellproceed schuster turned to his witness once more i would hike to know mr barrett why you found it necessary to visit the moon while there was so much of earth that you hadnt seen can you give us any valid reason for this illogical behavior it was a good question just the sort that would interest everyone and barrett was now making a serious attempt to answer it ive seen a fair amount of earth he said slowly with his precise english accentalmost as great a rarity now as schusters spectacles ive stayed at the hotel everest been to both poles even gone to the bottom of the calypso deep so i know something about our planet lets say it had lost its capacity to surprise me the moon on the other hand was completely newa whole world less than twentyfour hours away i couldnt resist the novelty hansteen listened to the show and careful analysis with only half his mind he was unobtrusively examining the audience while barrett spoke by now he had formed a good picture of selenes crew and passengers and had decided who could be relied upon and who would give trouble if conditions became bad the key man of course was captain harris the commodore knew his type well he had met it so often in spaceand more often still at such training establishments as astrotech pat was a competent but unambitious youngster with mechanical interests who had been lucky enough to find a job that suited him perfectly and which made no greater demands upon him than care and courtesy he would be loyal conscientious and unimaginative would do his duty as he saw it and in the end would die gamely without making a fuss that was a virtue not possessed by many far abler men and it was one they would need badly aboard the cruiser if they were still here five days from now miss wilkins the stewardess was almost as important as the captain in the scheme of things she was certainly not the stereotyped spacehostess image all vapid charm and frozen smile she was hansteen had already decided a young lady of character and considerable educationbut so for that matter were many space hostesses he had known yes he was lucky with the crew and what about the passengers they were considerably above average of course otherwise they would not have been on the moon in the first place there was an impressive reservoir of brains and talent here inside selene but the irony of the situation was that neither brains nor talent could help them now what was needed was character fortitudeor in a blunter word bravery few men in this age ever knew the need for physical bravery from birth to death they never came face to face with danger the men and women aboard selene had no training for what lay ahead and he could not keep them occupied much longer with games and amusements some time in the next twelve hours he calculated the first cracks would appear by then it would be obvious that something was holding up the search parties and that if they found the cruiser at all the discovery might be too hate commodore hansteen glanced swiftly round the cabin apart from their scanty clothing and slightly unkempt appearance all these twentyone men and women were still rational selfcontrolled members of society which he wondered would be the first to go chapter dr tom lawson so chief engineer lawrence had decided was an exception to the old saying to know all is to forgive all the knowledge that the astronomer had passed a loveless institutionalized childhood and had escaped from his origins by prodigies of pure intellect at the cost of all other human qualities helped one to understand himbut not to like him it was singular bad luck thought lawrence that he was the only scientist within three hundred thousand kilometers who happened to have an infrared detector and knew how to use it he was now sitting in the observers seat of duster two making the final adjustments to the crude but effective lashup he had contrived a camera tripod had been fixed on the canopy of the ski and the detector had been mounted on this in such a way that it could pan in any direction it seemed to be working but that was hard to tell in this small pressurized hangar with a confused jumble of heat sources all around it the real test could come only out in the sea of thirst its ready said lawson presently to the chief engineer me have a word with the man whos going to run it the cee looked at him thoughtfully still trying to make up his mind there were strong arguments for and against what he was considering now but whatever he did he must not let his personal feelings intrude the matter was far too important for that you can wear a space suit cant you he asked lawson ive never worn one in my life theyre only needed for going outsideand we leave that to the engineers well now you have a chance of learning said the cee ignoring the jibe theres not much to it when youre riding a ski youll be sitting still in the observers seat and the autoregulator takes care of oxygen temperature and the rest theres only one problem whats that how are you for claustrophobia tom hesitated not liking to admit any weakness he had passed the usual space tests of course and suspectedquite rightlythat he had had a very close call on some of the psych ratings obviously he was not an acute claustrophobe or he could never have gone aboard a ship but a spaceship and a space suit were two very different things i can take it he said at last dont fool yourself if you cant lawrence insisted i think you should come with us but im not trying to bully you into false heroics all i ask is that you make up your mind before we leave the hangar it may be a little too hate to have second thoughts when were twenty kilometers out to sea tom looked at the ski and bit his lip the idea of skimming across that infernal lake of dust in such a flimsy contraption seemed crazybut these men did it every day and if anything went wrong with the detector there was at least a slight chance that he could fix it heres a suit thats your size said lawrence try it on it may help you to make up your mind tom struggled into the flaccid yet crinkly garment closed the front zipper and stood still helmetless feeling rather a fool the oxygen flask that was buckled to his harness seemed absurdly small and lawrence noticed his anxious glance dont worry thats merely the fourhour reserve you wont be using it at all the main supplys on the ski mind your nosehere comes the helmet tom could tell by the expressions of those around him that this was the moment that separated the men from the boys until that helmet was seated you were still part of the human race afterward you were alone in a tiny mechanical world of your own there might be other men only centimeters away but you had to peer at them through thick plastic talk to them by radio you could not even touch them except through double layers of artificial skin someone had once written that it was very lonely to die in a space suit for the first time tom realized how true that must be the chief engineers voice sounded suddenly reverberantly from the tiny speakers set in the side of the helmet the only control you need worry about is the intercom thats the panel on your right normally youll be connected to your pilot the circuit will be live all the time youre both on the ski so you can talk to each other whenever you feel hike it but as soon as you disconnect youll have to use radioas youre doing now to listen to me press your transmit button and talk back whats that red emergency button for asked tom after he had obeyed this order you wont need iti hope that actuates a homing beacon and sets up a radio racket until someone comes to find you dont touch any of the gadgets on the suit without instructions from usespecially that one i wont promised tom lets go he walked rather clumsilyfor he was used to neither the suit nor the lunar gravityover to duster two and took his place in the observers seat a single umbilical cord plugged inappropriately into the right hip connected the suit to the skis oxygen communications and power the vehicle could keep him alive though hardly comfortable for three or four days at a pinch the little hangar was barely large enough for the two dustskis and it took only a few minutes for the pumps to exhaust its air as the suit stiffened around him tom felt a touch of panic the chief engineer and two pilots were watching and he did not wish to give them the satisfaction of thinking that he was afraid no man could help feeling tense when for the first time in his life he went into vacuum the clamshell doors pivoted open there was a faint tug of ghostly fingers as the last vestige of air gushed out plucking feebly at his suit before it dispersed into the void and then flat and featureless the empty gray of the sea of thirst stretched out to the horizon for a moment it seemed impossible that here only a few meters away was the reality behind the images he had studied from far out in space but this was no picture painted on a screen by flying electrons this was the real thing the strange amorphous stuff that had swallowed twentytwo men and women without trace and across which he tom lawson was about to venture on this insubstantial craft he had little time to brood the ski vibrated beneath him as the fans started to spin then following duster one it glided slowly out onto the naked surface of the moon the low rays of the rising sun smote them as soon as they emerged from the long shadow of the port buildings even with the protection of the automatic filters it was dangerous to look toward the bluewhite fury in the eastern sky no tom corrected himself this is the moon not earth here the sun rises in the west so were heading northeast into the sinus roris along the track selene followed and never retraced now that the low domes of the port were shrinking visibly toward the horizon he felt something of the exhilaration and excitement of all forms of speed the sensation lasted only for a few minutes until no more landmarks could be seen and they were caught in the illusion of being poised at the very center of an infinite plain despite the turmoil of the spinning fans and the slow silent fall of the dust parabolas behind them they seemed to be motionless tom knew that they were traveling at a speed that would take them clear across the sea in a couple of hours yet he had to wrestle with the fear that they were lost lightyears from any hope of salvation it was at this moment that he began a little late in the game to feel a grudging respect for the men he was working with this was a good place to start checking his equipment he switched on the detector and set it scanning back and forth over the emptiness they had just crossed with calm satisfaction he noted the two blinding trails of light stretching behind them across the darkness of the sea this test of course was childishly easy selenes fading thermal ghost would be a million times harder to spot against the waxing heat of dawn but it was encouraging if he had failed here there would have been no point in continuing any further hows it working said the chief engineer who must have been watching from the other ski up to specification replied tom cautiously it seems to be behaving normally he aimed the detector at the shrinking crescent of earth that was a slightly more difficult target but not a really hard one for it needed little sensitivity to pick up the gentle warmth of the mother world when it was projected against the cold night of space yes there it wasearth in the far infrared a strange and at first glance baffling sight for it was no longer a cleancut geometrically perfect crescent but a ragged mushroom with its stem lying along the equator it took tom a few seconds to interpret the picture both poles had been chopped off that was understandable for they were too cold to be detected at this setting of the sensitivity but why that bulge across the unilluminated night side of the planet then he realized that he was seeing the warm glow of the tropical oceans radiating back into the darkness the heat that they had stored during the day in the infrared the equatorial night was more brilliant than the polar day it was a reminder of the fact which no scientist should ever forget that human senses perceived only a tiny distorted picture of the universe tom lawson had never heard of platos analogy of the chained prisoners in the cave watching shadows cast upon a wall and trying to deduce from them the realities of the external world but here was a demonstration that plato would have appreciated which earth was real the perfect crescent visible to the eye the tattered mushroom glowing in the far infraredor neither the office was small even for port roriswhich was purely a transit station between earthside and farside and a jump ingoff point for tourists to the sea of thirst the port had had a brief moment of glory thirty years before as the base used by one of the moons few successful criminals jerry budker who had made a small fortune dealing in fake pieces of lunik ii he was hardly as exciting as robin hood or billy the kid but he was the best that the moon could offer maurice spenser was rather glad that port roris was such a quiet little onedome town though he suspected that it would not stay quiet much longer especially when his colleagues at clavius woke up to the fact that an in bureau chief was lingering here unaccountably and not hurrying southward to the lights of the big city a guarded cable to earth had taken care of his superiors who would trust his judgment and would guess the story he was after sooner or later the competition would guess it toobut by that time he hoped to be well ahead the man he was conferring with was aurigas stilldisgruntled skipper who had just spent a complicated and unsatisfactory hour on the telephone with his agents at clavius trying to arrange transshipment of his cargo mciver mcdonald macarthy and mcculloch ltd seemed to think it was his fault that auriga had put down at roris in the end he had hung up after telling them to sort it out with the head office since it was now early sunday morning in edinburgh this should hold them for a while captain anson mellowed a little after the second whisky a man who could find johnnie walker in port roris was worth knowing and he asked spenser how he had managed it the power of the press said the other with a laugh a reporter never reveals his sources if he did he wouldnt stay in business for long he opened his brief case and pulled out a sheaf of maps and photos i had an even bigger job getting these at such short noticeand id be obliged captain if you would say nothing at all about this to anyone its extremely confidential at least for the moment of course whats it aboutselene so you guessed that too youre right it may come to nothing but i want to be prepared he spread one of the photos across the desk it was a view of the sea of thirst from the standard series issued by the lunar survey and taken from lowaltitude reconnaissance satellites though this was an afternoon photograph and the shadows thus pointed in the opposite direction it was almost identical with the view spenser had had just before landing he had studied it so closely that he now knew it by heart the mountains of inaccessibility he said they rise very steeply out of the sea to an altitude of almost two thousand meters that dark oval is crater lake where selene was lost where she may be lost theres now some doubt about that our sociable young friend from lagrange has evidence that shes actually gone down in the sea of thirstround about this area in that case the people inside her may be alive and in that case captain theres going to be one hell of a salvage operation only a hundred kilometers from here port roris will be the biggest new center in the solar system phew so thats your game but where do i come in once again spenser placed his finger on the map right here captain i want to charter your ship and i want you to land me with a cameraman and two hundred kilos of tv equipment on the western wall of the mountains of inaccessibility i have no further questions your honor said counsel schuster sitting down abruptly very well replied commodore hansteen i must order the witness not to leave the jurisdiction of the court amid general laughter david barrett returned to his seat he had put on a good perfonnance though most of his replies had been serious and thoughtful they had been enlivened with flashes of humor and had kept the audience continuously interested if all the other witnesses were equally forthcoming that would solve the problem of entertainment for as long as it had to be solved even if they used up all the memories of four lifetimes in every daya complete impossibility of coursesomeone would still be talking when the oxygen container gave its last gasp hansteen looked at his watch there was still an hour to go before their frugal lunch they could revert to shane or start on that preposterous historical novel but it seemed a pity to break off now while everyone was in a receptive mood if you all feel the same way about it said the commodore ill call another witness ill second that was the quick reply from barrett who now considered himself safe from further inquisition even the poker players were in favor so the clerk of the court pulled another name out of the coffeepot in which the ballot papers had been mixed he looked at it with some surprise and hesitated before reading it out whats the matter said the court is it your name erno replied the clerk glancing at learned counsel with a mischievous grin he cleared his throat and called mrs myra schuster your honori object mrs schuster rose slowly a formidable figure even though she had lost a kilogram or two since leaving port roris she pointed to her husband who looked embarrassed and tried to hide behind his notes is it fair for him to ask me questions im willing to stand down said irving schuster even before the court could say objection sustained i am prepared to take over the examination said the commodore though his expression rather belied this but is there anyone else who feels qualified to do so there was a short silence then to hansteens surprised relief one of the poker players stood up though im not a lawyer your honor i have some slight legal experience im willing to assist very good mr harding your witness harding took schusters place at the front of the cabin and surveyed his captive audience he was a wellbuilt toughlooking man who somehow did not fit his own description that he was a bank executive hansteen had wondered fleetingly if this was the truth your name is myra schuster yes and what mrs schuster are you doing on the moon the witness smiled thats an easy one to answer they told me id weigh only twenty kilos hereso i came for the record why did you want to weigh twenty kilos mrs schuster looked at harding as if he had said something very stupid i used to be a dancer once she said and her voice was suddenly wistful her expression faraway i gave that up of course when i married irving why of course mrs schuster the witness glanced at her husband who stirred a little uneasily looked as if he might raise an objection but then thought better of it oh he said it wasnt dignified and i guess he was right the kind of dancing i used to do this was too much for mr schuster he shot to his feet ignoring the court completely and protested really myra theres no need oh vector it out irv she answered the incongruously oldfashioned slang bringing back a faint whiff of the nineties what does it matter now lets stop acting and be ourselves i dont mind these folks knowing that i used to dance at the blue asteroidor that you got me off the hook when the cops raided the place irving subsided spluttering while the court dissolved in a roar of laughter which his honor did nothing to quell this release of tensions was precisely what he had hoped for when people were laughing they could not be afraid and he began to wonder still more about mr harding whose casual yet shrewd questioning had brought this about for a man who said he was not a lawyer he was doing pretty well it would be interesting to see how he performed in the witness box when it was schusters turn to ask the questions chapter at last there was something to break the featureless flatness of the sea of thirst a tiny but brilliant splinter of light had edged itself above the horizon and as the dustskis raced forward it slowly climbed against the stars now it was joined by anotherand a third the peaks of the mountains of inaccessibility were rising over the edge of the moon as usual there was no way of judging their distance they might have been small rocks a few paces away or not part of the moon at all but a giant jagged world millions of kilometers out in space in reality they were fifty kilometers distant the dustskis would be there in half an hour tom lawson looked at them with thankfulness now there was something to occupy his eyes and mind he felt he would have gone crazy if he had had to stare at this apparently infinite plain for much longer he was annoyed with himself for being so illogical he knew that the horizon was really very close and that the whole sea was only a small part of the moons quite limited surface yet as he sat here in his space suit apparently getting nowhere he was reminded of those horrible dreams in which you struggled with all your might to escape from some frightful peril but remained stuck helplessly in the same place tom often had such dreams and worse ones but now he could see that they were making progress and that their long black shadow was not frozen to the ground as it sometimes seemed he focused the detector on the rising peaks and obtained a strong reaction as he had expected the exposed rocks were almost at boiling point where they faced the sun though the lunar day had barely started the mountains were already burning it was much cooler down here at sea level the surface dust would not reach its maximum temperature until noon still seven days away that was one of the biggest points in his favor though the day had already begun he still had a sporting chance of detecting any faint source of heat before the full fury of the day had overwhelmed it twenty minutes later the mountains dominated the sky and the skis slowed down to halfspeed we dont want to overrun their track explained lawrence if you look carefully just below that double peak on the right youll see a dark vertical line got it yes thats the gorge leading to crater lake the patch of heat you detected is three kilometers to the west of it so its still out of sight from here below our horizon which direction do you want to approach from lawson thought this over it would have to be from the north or the south if he came in from the west he would have those burning rocks in his field of view the eastern approach was even more impossible for that would be into the eye of the rising sun swing round to the north he said and let me know when were within two kilometers of the spot the skis accelerated once more though there was no hope of detecting anything yet he started to scan back and forth over the surface of the sea this whole mission was based upon one assumption that the upper layers of dust were normally at a uniform temperature and that any thermal disturbance was due to man if this was wrong it was wrong he had miscalculated completely on the viewing screen the sea was a mottled pattern of light and shade or rather of warmth and coldness the temperature differences were only fractions of a degree but the picture was hopelessly confused there was no possibility at all of locating any individual source of heat in that thermal maze sick at heart tom lawson looked up from the viewing screen and stared incredulously across the dust to the unaided eye it was still absolutely featurelessthe same unbroken gray it had always been but by infrared it was as dappled as the sea during a cloudy day on earth when the waters are covered with shifting patterns of sunlight and shadow yet there were no clouds here to cast their shadows on this arid sea this dappling must have some other cause whatever it might be tom was too stunned to look for the scientific explanation he had come all the way to the moon had risked neck and sanity on this crazy rideand at the end of it all some quirk of nature had ruined his carefully planned experiment it was the worst possible luck and he felt very sorry for himself several minutes later he got around to feeling sony for the people aboard selene so said the skipper of the auriga with exaggerated calm you would like to land on the mountains of inaccessibility thats a verra interesting idea it was obvious to spenser that captain anson had not taken him seriously he probably thought he was dealing with a crazy newsman who had no conception of the problems involved that would have been correct twelve hours before when the whole plan was only a vague dream in spensers mind but now he had all the information at his fingertips and knew exactly what he was doing ive heard you boast captain that you could land this ship within a meter of any given point is that right wellwith a little help from the computer thats good enough now take a look at this photograph what is it glasgow on a wet saturday night im afraid its badly overenlarged but it shows all we want to know its a blowup of this areajust below the western peak of the mountains ill have a much better copy in a few hours and an accurate contour maplunar surveys drawing one now working from the photos in their files my point is that theres a wide ledge herewide enough for a dozen ships to land and its fairly flat at least at these points here and here so a landing would be no problem at all from your point of view no technical problem perhaps but have you any idea what it would cost thats my affair captainor my networks we think it may be worthwhile if my hunch comes off spenser could have said a good deal more but it was bad business to show how much you needed someone elses wares this might well be the news story of the decadethe first space rescue that had ever taken place literally under the eyes of the tv cameras there had been enough accidents and disasters in space heaven knows but they had lacked all elements of drama or suspense those involved had died instantly or had been beyond all hope of rescue when their predicament was discovered such tragedies produced headlines but not sustained humaninterest stories like the one he sensed here theres not only the money said the captain though his tone implied that there were few matters of greater importance even if the owners agree youll have to get special clearance from space control earthside i know someone is working on it now that can be organized and what about lloyds our policy doesnt cover little jaunts like this spenser leaned across the table and prepared to drop his citybuster captain he said slowly interplanet news is prepared to deposit a bond for the insured value of the shipwhich i happen to know is a somewhat inflated six million four hundred and twentyfive thousand and fifty sterling dollars captain anson blinked twice and his whole attitude changed immediately then looking very thoughtful he poured himself another drink i never imagined id take up mountaineering at my time of life he said but if youre fool enough to plonk down six million stollarsthen my hearts in the highlands to the great relief of her husband mrs schusters evidence had been interrupted by lunch she was a talkative lady and was obviously delighted at the first opportunity she had had in years of letting her hair down her career such as it was had not been particularly distinguished when fate and the chicago police had brought it to a sudden close but she had certainly got around and had known many of the great performers at the turn of the century to not a few of the older passengers her reminiscences brought back memories of their own youth and faint echoes from the songs of the nineteennineties at one point without any protest from the court she led the entire company in a rendering of that durable favorite spacesuit blues as a moralebuilder the commodore decided mrs schuster was worth her weight in goldand that was saying a good deal after lunch bookreading was resumed and the agitators for the orange and the apple finally got their way since the theme was english it was decided that mr barrett was the only man for the job he protested with vigor but all his objections were shouted down oh very well he said reluctantly here we go chapter one drury lane the author certainly wasted no time within three pages sir isaac newton was explaining the law of gravitation to mistress gwyn who had already hinted that she would like to do something in return what form that appreciation would take pat harris could readily guess but duty called him this entertainment was for the passengers the crew had work to do theres still one emergency locker ive not opened said miss wilkins as the airlock door thudded softly behind them shutting off mr barretts carefully clipped accents were low on crackers and jam but the compressed meat is holding out im not surprised answered pat everyone seems to be getting sick of it lets see those inventory sheets the stewardess handed over the typed sheets now much annotated with pencil marks well start with this box whats inside it soap and paper towels well we cant eat them and this one candy i was saving it for the celebrationwhen they find us thats a good idea but i think you might break some of it out this evening one piece for every passenger as a nightcap and this a thousand cigarettes make sure that no one sees them i wish you hadnt told me pat grinned wryly at sue and passed on to the next item it was fairly obvious that food was not going to be a major problem but they had to keep track of it he knew the ways of administration after they were rescued sooner or later some human or electronic clerk would insist on a strict accounting of all the food that had been used after they were rescued did he really believe that this was going to happen they had been lost for more than two days and there had not been the slightest sign that anyone was looking for them he was not sure what signs there could be but he had expected some he stood brooding in silence until sue asked anxiously whats the trouble pat is something wrong oh no he said sarcastically well be docking at base in five minutes its been a pleasant trip dont you think sue stared at him incredulously then a flush spread over her cheeks and her eyes began to brim with tears im sorry said pat instantly contrite i didnt mean that its been a big strain for us both and youve been wonderful i dont know what wed have done without you sue she dabbed her nose with a handkerchief gave a brief smile and answered thats all right i understand they were both silent for a moment then she added do you really think were going to get out of this he gave a gesture of helplessness who can tell anyway for the sake of the passengers weve got to appear confident we can be certain that the whole moons looking for us i cant believe it will take much longer but even if they find us how are they going to get us out pats eyes wandered to the external door only a few centimeters away he could touch it without moving from this spot indeed if he immobilized the safety interlock he could open it for it swung inward on the other side of that thin metal sheet were unknown tons of dust that would come pouring in like water into a sinking ship if there was the slightest crack through which they could enter how far above them was the surface that was a problem that had worried him ever since they had gone under but there seemed no way of finding out nor could he answer sues question it was hard to think beyond the possibility of being found if that happened then surely rescue would follow the human race would not let them die once it had discovered them alive but this was wishful thinking not logic hundreds of times in the past men and women had been trapped as they were now and all the resources of great nations had been unable to save them there were the miners behind rockfalls sailors in sunken submarinesand above all astronauts in ships on wild orbits beyond possibility of interception often they had been able to talk freely with their friends and relatives until the very end that had happened only two years ago when cassiopeias main drive had jammed and all her energies had been poured into hurling her away from the sun she was out there now heading toward canopus on one of the most precisely measured orbits of any space vehicle the astronomers would be able to pinpoint her to within a few thousand kilometers for the next million years that must have been a great consolation to her crew now in a tomb more permanent than any pharaohs pat tore his mind away from this singularly profitless reverie their luck had not yet run out and to anticipate disaster might be to invite it lets hurry up and finish this inventory i want to hear how nell is making out with sir isaac that was a much more pleasant train of thought especially when you were standing so close to a very attractive and scantily dressed girl in a situation like this thought pat women had one great advantage over men sue still looked fairly smart despite the fact that nothing much was left of her uniform in this tropical heat but he like all the men aboard selene felt scratchily uncomfortable with his three days growth of beard and there was absolutely nothing he could do about it sue did not seem to mind the stubble though when he abandoned the pretense of work and moved up so close that his bristles rubbed against her cheek on the other hand she did not show any enthusiasm she merely stood there in front of the halfempty locker as if she had expected this and was not in the least surprised it was a disconcerting reaction and after a few seconds pat drew away i suppose you think im an unscrupulous wolf he said trying to take advantage of you like this not particularly sue answered she gave a rather tired laugh it makes me glad to know that im not slipping no girl ever minds a man starting to make approaches its when he wont stop that she gets annoyed do you want me to stop were not in love pat to me thats rather important even now would it still be important if you knew we wont get out of this her forehead wrinkled in concentration im not surebut you said yourself weve got to assume that theyll find us if we dont then we might as well give up right away sorry said pat i dont want you under those terms i like you too much for one thing im glad to hear that you know ive always enjoyed working with youthere were plenty of other jobs i could have transferred to bad luck for you pat answered that you didnt his brief gust of desire triggered by proximity solitude scanty clothing and sheer emotional strain had already evaporated now youre being pessimistic again said sue you know thats your big trouble you let things get you down and you wont assert yourself anyone can push you around pat looked at her with more surprise than annoyance id no idea he said that youd been busy psyching me i havent but if youre interested in someone and work with him how can you help learning about him well i dont believe that people push me around no whos running this ship now if you mean the commodore thats different hes a thousand times better qualified to take charge than i am and hes been absolutely correct about ithes asked my permission all along the line he doesnt bother now anyway thats not the whole point arent you glad hes taken over pat thought about this for several seconds then he looked at sue with grudging respect maybe youre right ive never cared to throw my weight about or assert my authorityif i have any i guess thats why im driver of a moon bus not skipper of a space liner its a little late to do anything about it now youre not thirty yet thank you for those kind words im thirtytwo we harrises retain our youthful good looks well into old age its usually all we have left by then thirtytwoand no steady girl friend ha thought pat there are several things you dont know about me but there was no point in mentioning clarissa and her little apartment in copernicus city which now seemed so far away i believe theres safety in numbers he said one of these days ill settle down perhaps youll still be saying that when youre fortyor fifty there are so many spacemen like that they havent settled down when its time to retire and then its too late look at the commodore for example what about him im beginning to get a little tired of the subject hes spent all his life in space he has no family no children earth cant mean much to himhes spent so little rime there he must have felt quite lost when he reached the age limit this accident has been a godsend to him hes really enjoying himself now good for him he deserves it ill be happy if ive done a tenth as much as he has when ive reached his agewhich doesnt seem very likely at the moment pat became aware that he was still holding the inventory sheets he had forgotten all about them they were a reminder of their dwindling resources and he looked at them with distaste back to work he said we have to think of the passengers if we stay here much longer replied sue the passengers will start thinking of us she spoke more truthfully than she had guessed chapter dr lawsons silence the chief engineer decided had gone on long enough it was high time to resume communication everything all right doctor he asked in his friendliest voice there was a short angry bark but the anger was directed at the universe not at him it wont work lawson answered bitterly the heat image is too confused there are dozens of hot spots not just the one i was expecting stop your ski ill come over and have a look duster two slid to a halt duster one eased up beside it until the two vehicles were almost touching moving with surprising ease despite the encumbrance of his space suit lawrence swung himself from one to the other and stood gripping the supports of the overhead canopy behind lawson he peered over the astronomers shoulder at the image on the infrared converter i see what you mean its a mess but why was it uniform when you took your photos it must be a sunrise effect the seas warming up and for some reason its not heating at the same rate everywhere perhaps we can still make sense out of the pattern i notice that there are some fairly clear areasthere must be an explanation for them if we understood whats happening it might help tom lawson stirred himself with a great effort the brittle shell of his selfconfidence had been shattered by this unexpected setback and he was very tired he had had little sleep in the last two days he had been hurried from satellite to spaceship to moon to dustski and after all that his science had failed him there could be a dozen explanations he said dully this dust looks uniform but there may be patches with different conductivities and it must be deeper in some places than in others that would alter the heat flow lawrence was still staring at the pattern on the screen trying to relate it to the visual scene around him just a minute he said i think youve got something he called to the pilot how deep is the dust around here nobody knows the seas never been sounded properly but its very shallow in these partswere near the northern edge sometimes we take out a fan blade on a reef as shallow as that well theres your answer if theres rock only a few centimeters below us anything could happen to the heat pattern ten to one youll find the picture getting simpler again when were clear of these shoals this is only a local effect caused by irregularities just underneath us perhaps youre right said tom reviving slightly if selene has sunk she must be in an area where the dusts fairly deep youre sure its shallow here lets find out theres a twentymeter probe on my ski a single section of the telescoping rod was enough to prove the point when lawrence drove it into the dust it penetrated less than two meters before hitting an obstruction how many spare fans have we got he asked thoughtfully fourtwo complete sets answered the pilot but when we hit a rock the cotter pin shears through and the fans arent damaged anyway theyre made of rubber usually they just bend back ive only lost three in the last year selene took out one the other day and pat harris had to go outside and replace it gave the passengers some excitement rightlets start moving again head for the gorge ive a theory that it continues out underneath the sea so the dust will be much deeper there if it is your picture should start getting simpler almost at once without much hope tom watched the patterns of light and shade flow across the screen the skis were moving quite slowly now giving him time to analyze the picture they had traveled about two kilometers when he saw that lawrence had been perfectly right the mottlings and dapplings had begun to disappear the confused jumble of warmth and coolness was merging into uniformity the screen was becoming a flat gray as the temperature variations smoothed themselves out beyond question the dust was swiftly deepening beneath them the knowledge that his equipment was effective once more should have gratified tom but it had almost the opposite result he could think only of the hidden depths above which he was floating supported on the most treacherous and unstable of mediums beneath him now there might be gulfs reaching far down into the moons mysterious heart at any moment they might swallow the dustski as already they had swallowed selene he felt as if he were tightrope walking across an abyss or feeling his way along a narrow path through a quaking quicksand all his life he had been uncertain of himself and had known security and confidence only through his technical skillsnever at the level of personal relations now the hazards of his present position were reacting upon those inner fears he felt a desperate need for solidity for something firm and stable to which he could cling over there were the mountains only three kilometers awaymassive eternal their roots anchored in the moon he looked at the sunlit sanctuary of those high peaks as longingly as some pacific castaway helpless upon a drifting raft might have stared at an island passing just beyond his reach with all his heart he wished that lawrence would leave this treacherous insubstantial ocean of dust for the safety of the land head for the mountains he found himself whispering head for the mountains there is no privacy in a space suitwhen the radio is switched on fifty meters away lawrence heard that whisper and knew exactly what it meant one does not become chief engineer for half a world without learning as much about men as about machines i took a calculated risk thought lawrence and it looks as if it hasnt come off but i wont give in without a fight perhaps i can still defuse this psychological time bomb before it goes off tom never noticed the approach of the second ski he was already too lost in his own nightmare but suddenly he was being violently shaken so violently that his forehead banged against the lower rim of his helmet for a moment his vision was blinded by tears of pain then with angeryet at the same time with an inexplicable feeling of reliefhe found himself looking straight into the determined eyes of chief engineer lawrence and listening to his voice reverberate from the suit speakers thats enough of this nonsense said the cee and ill trouble you not to be sick in one of our space suits every time that happens it costs us five hundred stollars to put it back into commissionand even then its never quite the same again i wasnt going to be sick tom managed to mutter then he realized that the truth was much worse and felt grateful to lawrence for his tact before he could add anything more the other continued speaking firmly but more gently no one else can hear us tomwere on the suit circuit now so listen to me and dont get mad i know a lot about you and i know youve had a hell of a rough deal from life but youve got a braina damn good brainso dont waste it by behaving like a scared kid sure were all scared kids at some time or other but this isnt the time for it there are twentytwo lives depending on you in five minutes well settle this business one way or the other so keep your eye on that screen and forget about everything else ill get you out of here all right dont you worry about that lawrence slapped the suitgently this timewithout taking his eyes off the young scientists stricken face then with a vast feeling of relief he saw lawson slowly relax for a moment the astronomer sat quite motionless obviously in full control of himself but apparently listening to some inner voice what was it telling him wondered lawrence perhaps that he was part of mankind even though it had condemned him to that unspeakable orphans home when he was a child perhaps that somewhere in the world there might be a person who could care for him and who would break through the ice that had encrusted his heart it was a strange little tableau here on this mirrorsmooth plain between the mountains of inaccessibility and the rising sun like ships becalmed on a dead and stagnant sea duster one and duster two floated side by side their pilots playing no part in the conflict of wills that had just taken place though they were dimly aware of it no one watching from a distance could have guessed the issues that had been at stake the lives and destinies that had trembled in the balance and the two men involved would never talk of it again indeed they were already concerned with something else for in the same instant they had both become aware of a highly ironic situation all the time they had been standing there so intent upon their own affairs that they had never looked at the screen of the infrared scanner it had been patiently holding the picture they sought when pat and sue had completed their inventory and emerged from the airlock galley the passengers were still far back in restoration england sir isaacs brief physics lecture had been followed as might easily have been predicted by a considerably longer anatomy lesson from nell gwyn the audience was thoroughly enjoying itself especially as barretts english accent was now going full blast forsooth sir isaac you are indeed a man of great knowledge yet methinks there is much that a woman might teach you and what is that my pretty maid mistress nell blushed shyly i fear she sighed that you have given your life to the things of the mind you have forgotten sir isaac that the body also has much strange wisdom call me ike said the sage huskily as his clumsy fingers tugged at the fastenings of her blouse not herein the palace nell protested making no effort to hold him at bay the king will be back soon do not alarm yourself my pretty one charles is roistering with that scribbler pepys well see naught of him tonight if we ever get out of here thought pat we must send a letter of thanks to the seventeenyearold schoolgirl on mars who is supposed to have written this nonsense shes keeping everyone amused and thats all that matters now no there was someone who was definitely not amused he became uncomfortably aware that miss morley was trying to catch his eye recalling his duties as skipper he turned toward her and gave her a reassuring but rather strained smile she did not return it if anything her expression became even more forbidding slowly and quite deliberately she looked at sue wilkins and then back at him there was no need for words she had said as clearly as if she had shouted it at the top of her voice i know what youve been doing back there in the air lock pat felt his face flame with indignation the righteous indignation of a man who had been unjustly accused for a moment he sat frozen in his seat while the blood pounded in his cheeks then he muttered to himself ill show the old bitch he rose to his feet gave miss morley a smile of poisonous sweetness and said just loudly enough for her to hear miss wilkins i think weve forgotten something will you come back to the air lock as the door closed behind them once more interrupting the narration of an incident that threw the gravest possible doubts upon the paternity of the duke of st albans sue wilkins looked at him in puzzled surprise did you see that he said still boiling see what miss morley oh interrupted sue dont worry about her poor thing shes been eying you ever since we left the base you know what her trouble is what asked pat already uncomfortably sure of the answer i suppose you could call it ingrowing virginity its a common complaint and the symptoms are always the same theres only one cure for it the ways of love are strange and tortuous only ten minutes ago pat and sue had left the air lock together mutually agreed to remain in a state of chaste affection but now the improbable combination of miss morley and nell gwyn and the feeling that one might as well be hung for a sheep as for a lamb as well as perhaps the instinctive knowledge of their bodies that in the long run love was the only defense against deathhad combined to overwhelm them for a moment they stood motionless in the tiny cluttered space of the galley then neither knowing who moved first they were in each others arms sue had time to whisper only one phrase before pats lips silenced her not here she whispered in the palace chapter chief engineer lawrence stared into the faintly glowing screen trying to read its message like all engineers and scientists he had spent an appreciable fraction of his life looking at the images painted by speeding electrons recording events too large or too small too bright or too faint for human eyes to see it was more than a hundred years since the cathoderay tube had placed the invisible world firmly in mans grasp already he had forgotten that it had ever been beyond his reach two hundred meters away according to the infrared scanner a patch of slightly greater warmth was lying on the face of this dusty desert it was almost perfectly circular and quite isolated there were no other sources of heat in the entire field of view though it was much smaller than the spot that lawson had photographed from lagrange it was in the right area there could be little doubt that it was the same thing there was no proof however that it was what they were looking for it could have several explanations perhaps it marked the site of an isolated peak jutting up from the depths almost to the surface of the sea there was only one way to find out you stay here said lawrence ill go forward on duster one tell me when im at the exact center of the spot dyou think it will be dangerous its not very likely but theres no point in us both taking a risk slowly duster one glided across to that enigmatically glowing patchso obvious to the infrared scanner yet wholly invisible to the eye a little to the left tom ordered another few meters youre nearly therewhoa lawrence stared at the gray dust upon which his vehicle was floating at first sight it seemed as featureless as any other portion of the sea then as he looked more closely he saw something that raised the goosepimples on his skin when examined very carefully as he was examining it now the dust showed an extremely fine pepperandsalt pattern that pattern was moving the surface of the sea was creeping very slowly toward him as if blown by an invisible wind lawrence did not like it at all on the moon one learned to be wary of the abnormal and unexplained it usually meant that something was wrongor soon would be this slowly crawling dust was both uncanny and disturbing if a boat had sunk here once already anything as small as a ski might be in even greater danger better keep away he advised duster two theres something odd herei dont understand it carefully he described the phenomenon to lawson who thought it over and answered almost at once you say it looks like a fountain in the dust thats exactly what it is we already know theres a source of heat here its powerful enough to stir up a convection current what could do that it cant be selene he felt a wave of disappointment sweep over him it was all a wildgoose chase as he had feared from the beginning some pocket of radioactivity or an outburst of hot gases released by the quake had fooled their instruments and dragged them to this desolate spot and the sooner they left it the better it might still be dangerous just a minute said tom a vehicle with a fair amount of machinery and twentytwo passengersthat must produce a good deal of heat three or four kilowatts at least if this dust is in equilibrium that might be enough to start a fountain lawrence thought this was very unlikely but he was now willing to grasp at the slimmest straw he picked up the thin metal probe and thrust it vertically into the dust at first it penetrated with almost no resistance but as the telescopic extensions added to its length it became harder and harder to move by the time he had the full twenty meters out it needed all his strength to push it downward the upper end of the probe disappeared into the dust he had hit nothingbut he had scarcely expected to succeed on this first attempt he would have to do the job scientifically and lay out a search pattern after a few minutes of cruising back and forth he had crisscrossed the area with parallel bands of white tape five meters apart like an oldtime farmer planting potatoes he started to move along the first of the tapes driving his probe into the dust it was a slow job for it had to be done conscientiously he was like a blind man feeling in the dark with a thin flexible wand if what he sought was beyond the reach of his wand he would have to think of something else but he would deal with that problem when he came to it he had been searching for about ten minutes when he became careless it required both hands to operate the probe especially when it neared the limit of its extension he was pushing with all his strength leaning over the edge of the ski when he slipped and fell headlong into the dust pat was conscious of the changed atmosphere as soon as he emerged from the air lock the reading from the orange and the apple had finished some time ago and a heated argument was now in progress it stopped when he walked into the cabin and there was an embarrassing silence while he surveyed the scene some of the passengers looked at him out of the corners of their eyes while the others pretended he wasnt there well commodore he said whats the trouble theres a feeling hansteen answered that were not doing all we could to get out ive explained that we have no alternative but to wait until someone finds usbut not everybody agrees it was bound to come sooner or later thought pat as time ran out and there was no sign of rescue nerves would begin to snap tempers get frayed there would be calls for action any action it was against human nature to sit still and do nothing in the face of death weve been through this over and over again he said wearily were at least ten meters down and even if we opened the air lock no one could get up to the surface against the resistance of the dust can you be sure of that someone asked quite sure pat answered have you ever tried to swim through sand you wont get very far what about trying the motors i doubt if theyd budge us a centimeter and even if they did wed move forwardnot up we could all go to the rear our weight might bring the nose up its the strain on the hull im worried about said pat suppose i did start the motorsit would be like butting into a brick wall heaven knows what damage it might do but theres a chance it might work isnt that worth the risk pat glanced at the commodore feeling a little annoyed that he had not come to his support hansteen stared straight back at him as if to say ive handled this so far now its your turn well that was fair enough especially after what sue had just said it was time he stood on his own feet or at least proved that he could do so the dangers too great he said flatly were perfectly safe here for at least another four days long before then well be found so why risk everything on a milliontoone chance if it was our last resort id say yesbut not now he looked round the cabin challenging anyone to disagree with him as he did so he could not help meeting miss morleys eye nor did he attempt to avoid it nevertheless it was with as much surprise as embarrassment that he heard her say perhaps the captain is in no great hurry to leave i notice that we havent seen much of him latelyor of miss wilkins why you prunefaced bitch thought pat just because no man in his right senses hold it harris said the commodore in the nick of time ill deal with this it was the first time that hansteen had really asserted himself until now he had run things easily and quietly or stood in the background and let pat get on with the job but now they were hearing the authentic voice of authority like a trumpet call across a battlefield this was no retired astronaut speaking it was a commodore of space miss morley he said that was a very foolish and uncalledfor remark only the fact that we are all under considerable strain can possibly excuse it i think you should apologize to the captain its true she said stubbornly ask him to deny it commodore hansteen had not lost his temper in thirty years and had no intention of losing it now but he knew when to pretend to lose it and in this case little simulation was necessary he was not only angry with miss morley he was annoyed with pat and felt that he had let him down of course there might be nothing at all in miss morleys accusation but pat and sue had certainly spent a devil of a long time over a simple job there were occasions when the appearance of innocence was almost as important as the thing itself he remembered an old chinese proverb do not stoop to tie your laces in your neighbors melon patch i dont give a damn he said in his most blistering voice about the relations if any between miss wilkins and the captain thats their own affair and as long as they do their jobs efficiently weve no right to interfere are you suggesting that captain harris is not doing his job welli wouldnt say that then please dont say anything we have enough problems on our hands already without manufacturing any more the other passengers had sat listening with that mixture of embarrassment and enjoyment which most men feel when they overhear a quarrel in which they have no part though in a very real sense this did concern everyone aboard selene for it was the first challenge to authority the first sign that discipline was cracking until now this group had been welded into a harmonious whole but now a voice had been raised against the elders of the tribe miss morley might be a neurotic old maid but she was also a tough and determined one the commodore saw with understandable qualms that she was getting ready to answer him no one would ever know just what she intended to say for at that moment mrs schuster let loose a shriek altogether in keeping with her dimensions when a man falls on the moon he usually has time to do something about it for his nerves and muscles are designed to deal with a sixfold greater gravity yet when chief engineer lawrence toppled off the ski the distance was so short that he had no time to react almost at once he hit the dustand was engulfed in darkness he could see absolutely nothing except for a very faint fluorescence from the illuminated instrument panel inside his suit with extreme caution he began to feel around in the softly resisting halffluid substance in which he was floundering seeking some solid object for support there was nothing he could not even guess which direction was up a mindsapping despair which seemed to drain his body of all its strength almost overwhelmed him his heart was thumping with that erratic beat that heralds the approach of panic and the final overthrow of reason he had seen other men be come screaming struggling animals and knew that he was moving swiftly to join them there was just enough left of his rational mind to remember that only a few minutes ago he had saved lawson from this same fate but he was not in a position to appreciate the irony he had to concentrate all his remaining strength of will on regaining control of himself and checking the thumping in his chest that seemed about to tear him to pieces and then loud and clear in his helmet speaker came a sound so utterly unexpected that the waves of panic ceased to batter against the island of his soul it was tom lawsonlaughing the laughter was brief and it was followed by an apology im sorry mr lawrencei couldnt help it you look so funny there waving your legs in the sky the chief engineer froze in his suit his fear vanished instantly to be replaced by anger he was furious with lawson but much more furious with himself of course he had been in no danger in his inflated suit he was like a balloon floating upon water and equally incapable of sinking now that he knew what had happened he could sort matters out by himself he kicked purposefully with his legs paddled with his hands and rolled round his center of gravityand vision returned as the dust streamed off his helmet he had sunk at the most ten centimeters and the ski had been within reach all the time it was a remarkable achievement to have missed it completely while he was flailing around like a stranded octopus with as much dignity as he could muster he grabbed the ski and pulled himself aboard he did not trust himself to speak for he was still breathless from his unnecessary exertions and his voice might betray his recent panic and he was still angry he would not have made such a fool of himself in the days when he was working constantly out on the lunar surface now he was out of touch why the last time he had worn a suit had been for his annual proficiency check and then he had never even stepped outside the air lock back on the ski as he continued with his probing his mixture of fright and anger slowly evaporated it was replaced by a mood of thoughtfulness as he realized how closelywhether he liked it or notthe events of the last halfhour had linked him with lawson true the astronomer had laughed when he was floundering in the dust but he must have been an irresistibly funny sight and lawson had actually apologized for his mirth a short time ago both laughter and apology would have been equally unthinkable then lawrence forgot everything else for his probe hit an obstacle fifteen meters down chapter when mrs schuster screamed commodore hansteens first reaction was my godthe womans going to have hysterics half a second later he needed all his will power not to join her from outside the hull where there had been no sound for three days except the whispering of the dust there was a noise at last it was unmistakable and so was its meaning something metallic was scraping along the hull instantly the cabin was filled with shouts cheers and cries of relief with considerablc difficulty hansteen managed to make himself heard theyve found us he said but they may not know it if we work together theyll have a better chance of spotting us pat you try the radio the rest of us will rap on the hullthe old morse v signdit dit dit dah come onall together selene reverberated with a ragged volley of dots and dashes which slowly became synchronized into one resounding tattoo hold it said hansteen a minute later everyone listen carefully after the noise the silence was uncannyeven unnerving pat had switched off the air pumps and fans so that the only sound aboard the cruiser was the beating of twentytwo hearts the silence dragged on and on could that noise after all have been nothing but some contraction or expansion of selenes own hull or had the rescue partyif it was a rescue partymissed them and passed on across the empty face of the sea abruptly the scratching came again hansteen checked the renewed enthusiasm with a wave of his hand listen for gods sake he entreated lets see if we can make anything of it the scratching lasted only for a few seconds before being followed once again by that agonizing silence presently someone said quietly more to break the suspense than to make any useful contribution that sounded like a wire being dragged past maybe theyre trawling for us impossible answered pat the resistance would be too great especially at this depth its more likely to be a rod probing up and down anyway said the commodore theres a search party within a few meters of us give them another tattoo once againall together dit dit dit dah dit dit dit dah through selenes double hull and out into the dust throbbed the fateful opening of beethovens fifth symphony as a century earlier it had pulsed across occupied europe in the pilots seat pat harris was saying again and again with desperate urgency selene calling are you receiving over and then listening for an eternal fifteen seconds before he repeated the transmission but the ether remained as silent as it had been ever since the dust had swallowed them up aboard auriga maurice spenser looked anxiously at the clock dammit he said the skis should have been there long ago when was their last message twentyfive minutes ago said the ships communications officer the halfhourly report should be coming in soon whether theyve found anything or not sure youre still on the right frequency you stick to your business and ill stick to mine retorted the indignant radioman sorry replied spenser who had learned long ago when to apologize quickly im afraid my nerves are jumping he rose from his seat and started to make a circuit of aurigas little control room after he had bumped himself painfully against an instrument panelhe had not yet grown accustomed to lunar gravity and was beginning to wonder if he ever wouldhe got himself under control once more this was the worst part of his job the waiting until he knew whether or not he had a story already he had incurred a small fortune in expenses they would be nothing compared with the bills that would soon be accumulating if he gave captain anson the order to go ahead but in that event his worries would be over for he would have his scoop here they are said the communications officer suddenly two minutes ahead of time somethings happened ive hit something said lawrence tersely but i cant tell what it is how far down asked lawson and both pilots simultaneously about fifteen meters take me two meters to the right ill try again he withdrew the probe then drove it in again when the ski had moved to the new position still there he reported and at the same depth take me on another two meters now the obstacle was gone or was too deep for the probe to reach nothing there take me back in the other direction it would be a slow and tiring job charting the outlines of whatever lay buried down there by such tedious methods two centuries ago men began to sound the oceans of earth lowering weighted lines to the sea bed and then hauling them up again it was a pity thought lawrence that he had no echosounder that would operate here but he doubted if either acoustic or radio waves could penetrate through more than a few meters of the dust what a foolhe should have thought of that before that was what had happened to selenes radio signals if she had been swallowed by the dust it would have blanketed and absorbed her transmissions but at this range if he really was sitting on top of the cruiser lawrence switched his receiver to the mooncrash band and there she was yelling at the top of her robot voice the signal was piercingly strongquite good enough he would have thought to have been picked up by lagrange or port roris then he remembered that his metal probe was still resting on the submerged hull it would give radio waves an easy path to the surface he sat listening to that train of pulses for a good fifteen seconds before he plucked up enough courage for the next move he had never really expected to find anything and even now his search might be in vain that automatic beacon would call for weeks like a voice from the tomb long after selenes occupants were dead then with an abrupt angry gesture that defied the fates to do their worst lawrence switched to the cruisers own frequencyand was almost deafened by pat harris shouting selene calling selene calling do you receive me over this is duster one he answered cee speaking im fifteen meters above you are you all ok over it was a long time before he could make any sense of the reply the background of shouting and cheering was so loud that in itself was enough to tell him that all the passengers were alive and in good spirits listening to them indeed one might almost have imagined that they were holding some drunken celebration in their joy at being discovered at making contact with the human race they thought that their troubles were over duster one calling port roris control said lawrence while he waited for the tumult to die down weve found selene and established radio contact judging by the noise thats going on inside everyones quite ok shes fifteen meters down just where doctor lawson indicated ill call you back in a few minutes out at the speed of light waves of relief and happiness would now be spreading over the moon the earth the inner planets bringing a sudden lifting of the hearts to billions of people on streets and slideways in buses and spaceships perfect strangers would turn to each other and say have you heard theyve found selene in all the solar system indeed there was only one man who could not wholeheartedly share the rejoicing as he sat on his ski listening to those cheers from underground and looking at the crawling pattern in the dust chief engineer lawrence felt far more scared and helpless than the men and women trapped beneath his feet he knew that he was facing the greatest battle in his life chapter for the first time in twentyfour hours maurice spenser was relaxing everything that could be done had been done men and equipment were already moving toward port roris captain anson was doing sums with the computer and looking thoughtfully at contour maps of the mountains the crew had been rounded up from the bars and informed that there was yet another change of route on earth at least a dozen contracts had been signed and telefaxed and large sums of money had already changed hands the financial wizards of interplanet news would be calculating with scientific precision just how much they could charge the other agencies for the story without driving them to charter ships of their ownnot that this was at all likely for spenser had too great a lead no competitor could possibly reach the mountains in less than fortyeight hours he would be there in six yes it was very pleasant to take it easy in the calm and confident assurance that everything was under control and going the way you wanted it was these interludes that made life worth living and spenser knew how to make the most of them they were his panacea against ulcersstill after a hundred years the occupational disease of the communications industry it was typical of him however that he was relaxing on the job he was lying a drink in one hand a plate of sandwiches by the other in the small observation lounge of the embarkation building through the double sheets of glass he could see the tiny dock from which selene had sailed three days ago it was merely a strip of concrete stretching for twenty meters out into the uncanny flatness of the dust lying most of its length like a giant concertina was the flexible tube through which the passengers could walk from the port into the cruiser now open to vacuum it was deflated and partly collapseda most depressing sight spenser could not help thinking he glanced at his watch then at that unbelievable horizon if he had been asked to guess he would have said that it was at least a hundred kilometers away not two or three a few minutes later a reflected glint of sunlight caught his eye there they were climbing up over the edge of the moon they would be here in five minutes out of the air lock in ten plenty of time to finish that last sandwich dr lawson showed no signs of recognition when spenser greeted him that was not surprising for their previous brief conversation had been in almost total darkness doctor lawson im bureau chief of interplanet news permission to record just a minute interrupted lawrence i know the interplanet man youre not joe leonard correct im maurice spenser i took over from joe last week he has to get used to earth gravity againotherwise hell be stuck here for life well youre damn quick off the mark it was only an hour ago that we radioed spenser thought it best not to mention that he had already been here the better part of a day id still like to know if i can record he repeated he was very conscientious about this some newsmen took a chance and went ahead without permission but if you were caught you lost your job as a bureau chief he had to keep the rules laid down to safeguard his profession and the public not now if you dont mind said lawrence ive fifty things to organize but doctor lawson will be glad to talk to you he did most of the work and deserves all the credit you can quote me on that erthank you mumbled tom looking embarrassed rightsee you later said lawrence ill be at the local engineers office living on pills but you might as well get some sleep not until ive finished with you corrected spenser grabbing tom and aiming him in the direction of the hotel the first person they met in the tenmetersquare foyer was captain anson ive been looking for you mr spenser he said the spaceworkers union is making trouble you know theres a ruling about time off between trips well it seems that please captain not now take it up with interplanets legal department call clavius ask for harry dantzig hell straighten it out he propelled the unresisting tom lawson up the stairs and into his suite apart from its excessively small size and complete absence of windows the suite might have been in any cheap hotel on earth the simple chairs couch and table were manufactured from the very minimum of material most of it fiberglas for quartz was common on the moon the bathroom was perfectly conventional but the bed had a slightly disconcerting appearance some visitors from earth found it difficult to sleep under a sixth of a gravity and for their benefit an elastic sheet could be stretched across the bed and held in place by light springs the whole arrangement had a distinct flavor of straitjackets and padded cells another cheerful little touch was the notice behind the door which announced in english russian and mandarin that this hotel is independently pressurised in the event of a dome failure you will be perfectly safe should this occur please remain in your room and await further instructions thank you spenser had read that notice several times he still thought that the basic information could have been conveyed in a more confident lighthearted manner the wording lacked charm and that he decided was the whole trouble on the moon the struggle against the forces of nature was so fierce that no energy was left for gracious living this was most noticeable in the contrast between the superb efficiency of the technical services and the easygoing takeitorleaveit attitude one met in all the other walks of life if you complained about the telephone the plumbing the air it was fixed within minutes but just try to get quick service in a restaurant or bar i know youre very tired spenser began but id like to ask a few questions you dont mind being recorded i hope no said tom who had long since passed the stage of caring one way or the other he was slumped in a chair mechanically sipping the drink spenser had poured out but obviously not tasting it this is maurice spenser interplanet news talking with doctor thomas lawson now doctor all we know at the moment is that you and mister lawrence chief engineer earthside have found selene and that the people inside are safe perhaps youll tell us without going into technical details just how youhell and damnation he caught the slowly falling glass without spilling a drop then eased the sleeping astronomer over to the couch well he couldnt grumble this was the only item that hadnt worked according to plan and even this might be to his advantage for no one else could find lawsonstill less interview him while he was sleeping it off in what the hotel roris with a fine sense of humor called its luxury suite in clavius city the tourist commissioner had finally managed to convince everyone that he had not been playing favorites his relief at hearing of selenes discovery had quickly abated when reuters timespace triplanetary publications and lunar news had phoned him in rapid succession to ask just how interplanet had managed to break the story first it had been on the wires in fact even before it had reached administration headquarters thanks to spensers thoughtful monitoring of the dustski radios now that it was obvious what had happened the suspicions of all the other news services had been replaced by frank admiration for spensers luck and enterprise it would be a little while yet before they realized that he had an even bigger trick up his capacious sleeve the communications center at clavius had seen many dramatic moments but this was one of the most unforgettable it was thought commissioner davis almost like listening to voices from beyond the grave a few hours ago all these men and women were presumed deadyet here they were fit and cheerful lining up at that buried microphone to relay messages of reassurance to their friends and relatives thanks to the probe which lawrence had left as marker and antenna that fifteenmeter blanket of dust could no longer cut the cruiser off from the rest of mankind the impatient reporters had to wait until there was a break in selenes transmission before they could get their interviews miss wilkins was now speaking dictating messages that were being handed to her by the passengers the cruiser must have been full of people scribbling telegraphese on the backs of tornup guidebooks trying to condense the maximum amount of information into the minimum number of words none of this material of course could be quoted or reproduced it was all private and the postmasters general of three planets would descend in their combined wrath upon any reporter foolish enough to use it strictly speaking they should not even be listening in on this circuit as the communications officer had several times pointed out with increasing degrees of indignation tell martha jan and ivy not to worry about me ill be home soon ask tom how the ericson deal went and let me know when you call back my love to you allgeorge end of message did you get that selene calling over luna central calling selene yes we have it all down well see that the messages get delivered and will relay the answers as soon as they come in now can we speak to captain harris over there was a brief pause during which the background noises in the cruiser could be clearly heardthe sound of voices slightly reverberant in this enclosed space the creak of a chair a muffled excuse me then captain harris calling central over commissioner davis took the mike captain harris this is the tourist commissioner i know that you all have messages you wish to send but the news services are here and are very anxious to have a few words with you first of all could you give us a brief description of conditions inside selene over well its very hot and we arent wearing much clothes but i dont suppose we can grumble about the heat since it helped you to find us anyway weve grown used to it the airs still good and we have enough food and water though the menu islets say its monotonous what more do you want to know over ask him about moralehow are the passengers taking itare there any signs of strain said the representative of triplanetary publications the tourist commissioner relayed the question rather more tactfully it seemed to cause slight embarrassment at the other end of the line everyones behaved very well said pat just a little too hastily of course we all wonder how long it will take you to get us out can you give us any ideas on that over chief engineer lawrence is in port roris now planning rescue operations davis answered as soon as he has an estimate well pass it on meanwhile how are you occupying your time over pat told him thereby enormously multiplying the sales of shane and less happily giving a boost to the flagging fortunes of the orange and the apple he also gave a brief account of the court proceedingsnow terminated sine die that must have been amusing entertainment said davis but now you wont have to rely on your own resources we can send you anything you wantmusic plays discussions just give the wordwell fix it over pat took his time in answering this the radio link had already transformed their lives had brought them hope and put them in touch with their loved ones yet in a way he was almost sony that their seclusion was ended the heartwarming sense of solidarity which even miss morleys outburst had scarcely ruffled was already a fading dream they no longer formed a single group united in the common cause of survival now their lives had diverged again into a score of independent aims and ambitions humanity had swallowed them up once more as the ocean swallows a raindrop chapter chief engineer lawrence did not believe that committees ever achieved anything his views were well known on the moon for shortly after the last biannual visit of the lunar board of survey a notice had appeared on his desk conveying the information a board is long hard and narrow it is made of wood but he approved of this committee because it fulfilled his somewhat stringent requirements he was chairman there were no minutes no secretary no agenda best of all he could ignore or accept its recommendations as he pleased he was the man in charge of rescue operations unless the chief administrator chose to sack himwhich he would do only under extreme pressure from earth the committee existed merely to provide ideas and technical knowledge it was his private brain trust only half of its dozen members were physically present the rest were scattered over moon earth and space the soilphysics expert on earth was at a disadvantage for owing to the finite speed of radio waves he would always be a second and a half in arrears and by the time his comments could get to the moon almost three seconds would have passed he had accordingly been asked to make notes and to save his views until the end only interrupting if it was absolutely necessary as many people had discovered after setting up lunar conference calls at great expense nothing hamstrung a brisk discussion more effectively than that threesecond time lag for the benefit of the newcomers said lawrence when the roll call had been completed ill brief you on the situation selene is fifteen meters down on a level keel shes undamaged with all her equipment functioning and the twentytwo people inside her are still in good spirits they have enough oxygen for ninety hoursthats the deadline we have to keep in mind for those of you who dont know what selene looks like heres a oneintwenty scale model he lifted the model from the table and turned it slowly in front of the camera shes just like a bus or a small aircraft the only thing unique is her propulsion system which employs these widebladed variablepitch fans our great problem of course is the dust if youve never seen it you cant imagine what its like any ideas you may have about sand or other materials on earth wont apply here this stuff is more like a liquid heres a sample of it lawrence picked up a tall vertical cylinder the lower third of which was filled with an amorphous gray substance he tilted it and the stuff began to flow it moved more quickly than syrup more slowly than water and it took a few seconds for its surface to become horizontal again after it had been disturbed no one could ever have guessed by looking at it that it was not a fluid this cylinder is sealed explained lawrence with a vacuum inside so the dust is showing its normal behavior in air its quite different its much stickier and behaves rather like very fine sand or talcum powder id better warn you its impossible to make a synthetic sample that has the properties of the real thing it takes a few billion years of desiccation to produce the genuine article if you want to do some experimenting well ship you as much dust as you like heaven knows we can spare it a few other points selene is three kilometers from the nearest solid landthe mountains of inaccessibility there may be several hundred meters of dust beneath her though were not sure of that nor can we be quite sure that there will be no more caveins though the geologists think its very unlikely the only way we can reach the site is by dustski weve two units and another one is being shipped round from farside they can carry or tow up to five tons of equipment the largest single item we could put on a sledge would be about two tons so we cant bring any really heavy gear to the site well thats the position we have ninety hours any suggestion ive some ideas of my own but id like to hear yours first there was a long silence while the members of the committee scattered over a volume of space almost four hundred thousand kilometers across brought their various talents to bear on the problem then the chief engineer farside spoke from somewhere in the neighborhood of joliotcurie its my hunch that we cant do anything effective in ninety hours well have to build special equipment and that always takes time sowe have to get an air line down to selene wheres her umbilical connection behind the main entrance at the rear i dont see how you can get a line there and couple it up fifteen meters down besides everything will be clogged with dust ive a better idea someone interjected drive a pipe down through the roof youll need two pipes pointed out another speaker one to pump in oxygen the other to suck out the foul air that means using a complete air purifier and we wont even need it if we can get those people out inside the ninety hours too big a gamble once the air supply is secure we can take our time and the ninetyhour deadline wont worry us i accept that point said lawrence in fact ive several men working on those lines right now the next question is do we try to raise the cruiser with everyone inside or do we get the passengers out individually remember theres only one space suit aboard her could we sink a shaft to the door and couple it to the air lock asked one of the scientists same problem as with the air hose even worse in fact since the coupling would be so much bigger what about a cofferdam large enough to go round the whole cruiser we could sink it round her then dig out the dust youd need tons of piles and shorings and dont forget the dam would have to be sealed off at the bottom otherwise the dust would flow back into it just as fast as we took it out of the top can you pump the stuff asked someone else yes with the right kind of impeller but you cant suck it of course it has to be lifted a normal pump just cavitates this dust grumbled the port roris assistant engineer has the worst properties of solids and liquids with none of their advantages it wont flow when you want it to it wont stay put when you want it to can i make a point said father ferraro speaking from plato this word dust is highly misleading what we have here is a substance that cant exist on earth so theres no name for it in our language the last speaker was quite correct sometimes you have to think of it as a nonwetting liquid rather like mercury but much lighter at other times its a flowing solid like pitchexcept that it moves much more rapidly of course any way it can be stabilized someone asked i think thats a question for earth said lawrence doctor evans would you like to comment everyone waited for the three seconds which as always seemed very much longer then the physicist answered quite as clearly as if he were in the same room ive been wondering about that there might be organic bindersglue if you likethat would make it stick together so that it could be handled more easily would plain water be any use have you tried that no but we will answered lawrence scribbling a note is the stuff magnetic asked the traffic control officer thats a good point said lawrence is it father slightly it contains a fair amount of meteoric iron but i dont think that helps us at all a magnetic field would pull out the ferrous material but it wouldnt affect the dust as a whole anyway well try lawrence made another note it was his hopethough a faint onethat out of this clash of minds would come some bright idea some apparently farfetched but fundamentally sound conception that would solve his problem and it was his whether he liked it or not he was responsible through his various deputies and departments for every piece of technical equipment on this side of the moonespecially when something went wrong with it im very much afraid said the clavius traffic control officer that your biggest headache will be logistics every piece of equipment has to be ferried out on the skis and they take at least two hours for the round tripmore if theyre towing a heavy load before you even start operating youll have to build some kind of working platformlike a raftthat you can leave on the site it may take a day to get that in position and much longer to get all your equipment out to it including temporary living quarters added someone the workmen will have to stay on the site thats straightforward as soon as we fix a raft we can inflate an igloo on it better than that you wont even need a raft an igloo will float by itself getting back to this raft said lawrence we want strong collapsible units that can be bolted together on the site any ideas empty fuel tanks too big and fragile maybe tech stores has something so it went on the brain trust was in session lawrence would give it another halfhour then he would decide on his plan of action one could not spend too much time talking when the minutes were ticking away and many lives were at stake yet hasty and illconceived schemes were worse than useless for they would absorb materials and skills that might tilt the balance between failure and success at first sight it seemed such a straightforward job there was selene within a hundred kilometers of a wellequipped base her position was known exactly and she was only fifteen meters down but that fifteen meters presented lawrence with some of the most baffling problems of his entire career it was a career which he knew well might soon terminate abruptly for it would be very hard to explain his failure if those twentytwo men and women died it was a great pity that not a single witness saw auriga coming down for it was a glorious sight a spaceship landing or taking off is one of the most impressive spectacles that man has yet contrivedexcluding some of the more exuberant efforts of the nuclear engineers and when it occurs on the moon in slow motion and uncanny silence it has a dreamlike quality which no one who has seen it can ever forget captain anson saw no point in trying any fancy navigation especially since someone else was paying for the gas there was nothing in the masters handbook about flying a space liner a hundred kilometersa hundred kilometers indeedthough no doubt the mathematicians would be delighted to work out a trajectory based on the calculus of variations using the very minimum amount of fuel anson simply blasted straight up for a thousand kilometers and came down again on a normal vertical approach with final radar guidance the ships computer and the radar monitored each other and both were monitored by captain anson any one of the three could have done the job so it was really quite simple and safe though it did not look it especially to maurice spenser who began to feel a great longing for the soft green hills of earth as those desolate peaks clawed up at him why had he talked himself into this surely there were cheaper ways of committing suicide the worst part was the free fall between the successive braking periods suppose the rockets failed to fire on command and the ship continued to plunge moonward slowly but inexorably accelerating until it crashed it was no use pretending that this was a stupid or childish fear because it had happened more than once it was not however going to happen to auriga the unbearable fury of the braking jets was already splashing over the rocks blasting skyward the dust and cosmic debris that had not been disturbed in thrice a billion years for a moment the ship hovered in delicate balance only centimeters off the ground then almost reluctantly the spears of flame that supported her retracted into their scabbards the widely spaced legs of the undercarriage made contact their pads tilted according to the contours of the ground and the whole ship rocked slightly for a second as the shock absorbers neutralized the residual energy of impact for the second time inside twentyfour hours maurice spenser had landed on the moon that was a claim that very few men could make well said captain anson as he got up from the control board i hope youre satisfied with the view its cost you plentyand theres still that little matter of overtime according to the spaceworkers union have you no soul captain why bother me with such trivia at a time like this but if i may say so without being charged any extra that was a very fine landing oh its all part of the days work replied the skipper though he could not conceal slight signs of pleasure by the way would you mind initialing the log here against the time of landing whats that for asked spenser suspiciously proof of delivery the logs our prime legal document it seems a little oldfashioned having a written one said spenser i thought everything was done by nucleonics these days traditions of the service replied anson of course the ships flight recorders are running all the time were under power and the trip can always be reconstructed from them but only the skippers log gives the little details that make one voyage different from anotherlike twins born to one of the steerage passengers this morning or at six bells sighted the white whale off the starboard bow i take it back captain said spenser you do have a soul after all he added his signature to the log then moved over to the observation window to examine the view the control cabin a hundred and fifty meters above the ground had the only directvision windows in the ship and the view through them was superb behind them to the north were the upper ramparts of the mountains of inaccessibility ranging across half the sky that name was no longer appropriate thought spenser he had reached them and while the ship was here it might even be possible to do some useful scientific research such as collecting rock samples quite apart from the news value of being in such an outlandish place he was genuinely interested in what might be discovered here no man could ever become so blase that the promise of the unknown and the unexplored completely failed to move him in the other direction he could look across at least forty kilometers of the sea of thirst which spanned more than half his field of view in a great arc of immaculate flatness but what he was concerned with was less than five kilometers away and two below clearly visible through a lowpowered pair of binoculars was the metal rod that lawrence had left as a marker and through which selene was now linked with the world the sight was not impressivejust a solitary spike jutting from an endless plainyet it had a stark simplicity that appealed to spenser it would make a good opening it symbolized the loneliness of man in this huge and hostile universe that he was attempting to conquer in a few hours this plain would be far from lonely but until then that rod would serve to set the scene while the commentators discussed the rescue plans and filled in the time with appropriate interviews that was not his problem the unit at clavius and the studios back on earth could handle it in their stride he had just one job nowto sit here in his eagles nest and to see that the pictures kept coming in with the big zoom lens thanks to the perfect clarity of this airless world he could almost get closeups even from here when the action started he glanced into the southwest where the sun was lifting itself so sluggishly up the sky almost two weeks of daylight as earth counted time still lay ahead no need then to worry about the lighting the stage was set chapter chief administrator olsen seldom made public gestures he preferred to run the moon quietly and efficiently behind the scenes leaving amiable extroverts like the tourist commissioner to face the newsmen his rare appearances were therefore all the more impressiveas he intended them to be though millions were watching him the twentytwo men and women he was really addressing could not see him at all for it had not been thought necessary to fit selene with vision circuits but his voice was sufficiently reassuring it told them everything that they wanted to know hello selene he began i want to tell you that all the resources of the moon are now being mobilized for your aid the engineering and technical staffs of my administration are working round the clock to help you mister lawrence chief engineer earthside is in charge and i have complete confidence in him hes now at port roris where the special equipment needed for the operation is being assembled its been decidedand im sure youll agree with thisthat the most urgent task is to make certain that your oxygen supply can be maintained for this reason we plan to sink pipes to you that can be done fairly quickly and then we can pump down oxygenas well as food and water if necessary so as soon as the pipes are installed youll have nothing more to worry about it may still take a little time to reach you and get you out but youll be quite safe you only have to sit and wait for us now ill get off the air and let you have this channel back so that you can talk to your friends im sorry about the inconvenience and strain youve undergone but thats all over now well have you out in a day or two good luck a burst of cheerful conversation broke out aboard selene as soon as chief administrator olsens broadcast finished it had had precisely the effect he had intended the passengers were already thinking of this whole episode as an adventure which would give them something to talk about for the rest of their lives only pat harris seemed a little unhappy i wish he told commodore hansteen the ca hadnt been quite so confident on the moon remarks like that always seem to be tempting fate i know exactly how you feel the commodore answered but you can hardly blame himhes thinking of our morale which is fine id say especially now that we can talk to our friends and relatives that reminds me theres one passenger who hasnt received or sent any messages whats more he doesnt show the slightest interest in doing so whos that hansteen dropped his voice still further the new zealander radley he just sits quietly in the corner over there im not sure why but he worries me perhaps the poor fellow has no one on earth he wants to speak to a man with enough money to go to the moon must have some friends replied hansteen then he grinned it was almost a boyish grin which flickered swiftly across his face softening its wrinkles and crows feet that sounds very cynical i didnt mean it that way but i suggest we keep an eye on mr radley have you mentioned him to sueer miss wilkins she pointed him out to me i should have guessed that thought pat admiringly not much gets past her now that it seemed he might have a future after all he had begun to think very seriously about sue and about what she had said to him in his life he had been in love with five or six girlsor so he could have sworn at the timebut this was something different he had known sue for over a year and from the start had felt attracted to her but until now it had never come to anything what were her real feelings he wondered did she regret that moment of shared passion or did it mean nothing to her she might argueand so might he for that matterthat what had happened in the air lock was no longer relevant it was merely the action of a man and a woman who thought that only a few hours of life remained to them they had not been themselves but perhaps they had been perhaps it was the real pat harris the real sue wilkins that had finally emerged from disguise revealed by the strain and anxiety of the past few days he wondered how he could be sure of this but even as he did so he knew that only time could give the answer if there was a clearcut scientific test that could tell you when you were in love pat had not yet come across it the dust that lappedif that was the wordagainst the quay from which selene had departed four days ago was only a couple of meters deep but for this test no greater depth was needed if the hastily built equipment worked here it would work out in the open sea lawrence watched from the embarkation building as his spacesuited assistants bolted the framework together it was made like ninety per cent of the structures on the moon from slotted aluminum strips and bars in some ways thought lawrence the moon was an engineers paradise the low gravity the total absence of rust or corrosionindeed of weather itself with its unpredictable winds and rains and frostsremoved at once a whole range of problems that plagued all terrestrial enterprises but to make up for that of course the moon had a few specialities of its ownlike the twohundredbelowzero nights and the dust that they were fighting now the light framework of the raft rested upon a dozen large metal drums which carried the prominently stenciled words contents ethyl alcohol please return when empty to no dispatching center copernicus their contents now were a very high grade of vacuum each drum could support a weight of two lunar tons before sinking now the raft was rapidly taking shape be sure to have plenty of spare nuts and bolts lawrence told himself he had seen at least six dropped in the dust which had instantly swallowed them and there went a wrench make an order that all tools must be tied to the raft even when in use however inconvenient that might be fifteen minutesnot bad considering that the men were working in vacuum and therefore were hampered by their suits the raft could be extended in any direction as required but this would be enough to start with this first section alone could carry over twenty tons and it would be some time before they unloaded that weight of equipment on the site satisfied with this stage of the project lawrence left the embarkation building while his assistants were still dismantling the raft five minutes later he was in the local engineering depot what he found there was not quite so satisfactory supported on a couple of trestles was a twometersquare mockup of selenes roofan exact copy of the real thing made from the same materials only the outer sheet of aluminized fabric that served as a sun shield was missing it was so thin and flimsy that it would not affect the test the experiment was an absurdly simple one involving only three ingredients a pointed crowbar a sledge hammer and a frustrated engineer who despite strenuous efforts had not yet succeeded in hammering the bar through the roof anyone with a little knowledge of lunar conditions would have guessed at once why he had failed the hammer obviously had only a sixth of its terrestrial weight therefore equally obviouslyit was that much less effective the reasoning would have been completely false one of the hardest things for the layman to understand was the difference between weight and mass and the inability to do so had led to countless accidents for weight was an arbitrary characteristic you could change it by moving from one world to another on earth that hammer would weigh six times as much as it did here on the sun it would be almost two hundred times heavier and in space it would weigh nothing at all but in all three places and indeed throughout the universe its mass or inertia would be exactly the same the effort needed to set it moving at a certain speed and the impact it would produce when stopped would be constant through all space and time on a nearly gravityless asteroid where it weighed less than a feather that hammer would pulverize a rock just as effectively as on earth whats the trouble said lawrence the roofs too springy explained the engineer rubbing the sweat from his brow the crowbar just bounces back every time its hit i see but will that happen when were using a fifteenmeter pipe with dust packed all around it that may absorb the recoil perhapsbut look at this they kneeled beneath the mockup and inspected the underside of the roof chalk lines had been drawn upon it to indicate the position of the electric wiring which had to be avoided at all costs this fiberglas is so tough you cant make a clean hole through it when it does yield it splinters and tears seeits already begun to star im afraid that if we try this bruteforce approach well crack the roof and we cant risk that lawrence agreed well drop the idea if we cant pile drive well have to bore use a drill screwed on the end of the pipe so it can be detached easily how are you getting on with the rest of the plumbing almost readyits all standard equipment we should be finished in two or three hours ill be back in two said lawrence he did not add as some men would have done i want it finished by then his staff was doing its utmost and one could neither bully nor cajole trained and devoted men into working faster than their maximum jobs like this could not be rushed and the deadline for selenes oxygen supply was still three days away in a few hours if all went well it would have been pushed into the indefinite future unfortunately all was going very far from well commodore hansteen was the first to recognize the slow insidious danger that was creeping up upon them he had met it once before when he had been wearing a faulty space suit on ganymedean incident he had no wish to recall but had never really forgotten pat he said quietly making sure that no one could overhear have you noticed any difficulty in breathing pat looked startled then answered yes now that you mention it id put it down to the heat so did i at first but i know these symptomsespecially the quick breathing were running into carbondioxide poisoning but thats ridiculous we should be all right for another three daysunless something has gone wrong with the air purifiers im afraid it has what system do we use to get rid of the carbon dioxide straight chemical absorption its a very simple reliable setup weve never had any trouble with it before yes but its never had to work under these conditions before i think the heat may have knocked out the chemicals is there any way we can check them pat shook his head no the access hatch is on the outside of the hull sue my dear said a tired voice which they hardly recognized as belonging to mrs schuster do you have anything to fix a headache if you do said another passenger id like some as well pat and the commodore looked at each other gravely the classic symptoms were developing with textbook precision how long would you guess said pat quietly two or three hours at the most and it will be at least six before lawrence and his men can get here it was then that pat knew without any further argument that he was genuinely in love with sue for his first reaction was not fear for his own safety but anger and grief that after having endured so much she would have to die within sight of rescue chapter when tom lawson woke up in that strange hotel room he was not even sure who he was still less where he was the fact that he had some weight was his first reminder that he was no longer on lagrangebut he was not heavy enough for earth then it was not a dream he was on the moon and he really had been out into that deadly sea of thirst and he had helped to find selene twentytwo men and women now had a chance of life thanks to his skill and science after all the disappointments and frustrations his adolescent dreams of glory were about to come true now the world would have to make amends to him for its indifference and neglect the fact that society had provided him with an education which a century earlier only a few men could afford did nothing to alleviate toms grudge against it such treatment was automatic in this age when every child was educated to the level that his intelligence and aptitudes permitted now that civilization needed all the talent that it could find merely to maintain itself any other educational policy would have been suicide tom gave no thanks to society for providing the environment in which he had obtained his doctors degree it had acted in its own selfinterest yet this morning he did not feel quite so bitter about life or so cynical about human beings success and recognition are great emollients and he was on his way to achieving both but there was more to it than that he had glimpsed a deeper satisfaction out there on duster two when his fears and uncertainties had been about to overwhelm him he had made contact with another human being and had worked in successful partnership with a man whose skill and courage he could respect it was only a tenuous contact and like others in the past it might lead nowhere a part of his mind indeed hoped that it would so that he could once again assure himself that all men were selfish sadistic scoundrels tom could no more escape from his early boyhood than charles dickens for all his success and fame could escape the shadows of the blacking factory that had both metaphorically and literally darkened his youth but he had made a fresh beginningthough he still had very far to go before he became a fully paidup member of the human race when he had showered and tidied himself he noticed the message that spenser had left lying on the table make yourself at home it said ive had to leave in a hurry mike graham is taking over from mecall him at as soon as youre awake im hardly likely to call him before im awake thought tom whose excessively logical mind loved to seize on such looseness of speech but he obeyed spensers request heroically resisting the impulse to order breakfast first when he got through to mike graham he discovered that he had slept through a very hectic six hours in the history of port roris that spenser had taken off in auriga for the sea of thirstand that the town was full of newsmen from all over the moon most of them looking for dr lawson stay right where you are said graham whose name and voice were both vaguely familiar to tom he must have seen him on those rare occasions when he tuned in to lunar telecasts ill be over in five minutes im starving protested tom call room service and order anything you likeits on us of coursebut dont go outside the suite tom did not resent being pushed around in this somewhat cavalier fashion it meant after all that he was now an important piece of property he was much more annoyed by the fact that as anyone in port roris could have told him mike graham arrived long before room service it was a hungry astronomer who now faced mikes miniature teleeamera and tried to explain for the benefit ofas yetonly two hundred million viewers exactly how he had been able to locate selene thanks to the transformation wrought by hunger and his recent experiences he made a firstclass job of it a few days ago had any tv reporter managed to drag lawson in front of a camera to explain the technique of infrared detection he would have been swiftly and contemptuously blinded by science tom would have given a noholdsbarred lecture full of such terms as quantum efficiency blackbody radiation and spectral sensitivity that would have convinced his audience that the subject was extremely complex and wholly impossible for the layman to understand but now he carefully and fairly patientlydespite the occasional urgent proddings of his stomachanswered mike grahams questions in terms that most of his viewers could understand to the large section of the astronomical community which tom had scarred at some time or other it was a revelation up in lagrange ii professor kotelnikov summarized the feelings of all his colleagues when at the end of the performance he paid tom the ultimate compliment quite frankly he said in tones of incredulous disbelief i would never have recognized him it was something of a feat to have squeezed seven men into selenes air lock butas pat had demonstratedit was the only place where one could hold a private conference the other passengers doubtless wondered what was happening they would soon know when hansteen had finished his listeners looked understandably worried but not particularly surprised they were intelligent men and must have already guessed the truth im telling you first explained the commodore because captain harris and i decided you were all levelheadedand tough enough to give us help if we need it i hope to god we wont but there may be trouble when i make my announcement and if there is said harding if anyone makes a fuss jump on them answered the commodore briefly but be as casual as you can when we go back into the cabin dont look as if youre expecting a fight thats the best way to start one your job is to damp out panic before it spreads do you think its fair said dr mckenzie not to give an opportunity towell send out some last messages we thought of that but it would take a long time and would make everyone completely depressed we want to get this through as quickly as possible the sooner we act the better our chance do you really think we have one asked barrett yes said hansteen though id hate to quote the odds no more questions bryan johanson rightlets go as they marched back into the cabin and took their places the remaining passengers looked at them with curiosity and growing alarm hansteen did not keep them in suspense ive some grave news he said speaking very slowly you must all have noticed difficulty in breathing and several of you have complained about headaches yes im afraid its the air we still have plenty of oxygenthats not our problem but we cant get rid of the carbon dioxide we exhale its accumulating inside the cabin why we dont know my guess is that the heat has knocked out the chemical absorbers but the explanation hardly matters for theres nothing we can do about it he had to stop and take several deep breaths before he could continue so we have to face this situation your breathing difficulties will get steadily worse so will your headaches i wont attempt to fool you the rescue team cant possibly reach us in under six hours and we cant wait that long there was a stifled gasp from somewhere in the audience hansteen avoided looking for its source a moment later there came a stertorous snore from mrs schuster at another time it would have been funny but not now she was one of the lucky ones she was already peacefully if not quietly unconscious the commodore refilled his lungs it was tiring to talk for any length of time if i couldnt offer you some hope he continued i would have said nothing but we do have one chance and we have to take it soon its not a very pleasant one but the alternative is much worse miss wilkins please hand me the sleep tubes there was a deathly silencenot even interrupted by mrs schusteras the stewardess handed over a small metal box hansteen opened it and took out a white cylinder the size and shape of a cigarette you probably know he continued that all space vehicles are compelled by law to carry these in their medicine chests they are quite painless and will knock you out for ten hours that may mean all the difference between life and deathfor mans respiration rate is cut by more than fifty per cent when hes unconscious so our air will last twice as long as it would otherwise long enough we hope for port roris to reach us now its essential for at least one person to remain awake to keep in touch with the rescue team and to be on the safe side we should have two one of them must be the captain i think that goes without argument and i suppose the other should be you said an alltoofamiliar voice im really very sorry for you miss morley said commodore hansteen without the slightest sign of resentmentfor there was no point now in making an issue of a matter that had already been settled just to remove any possible misconceptions before anyone quite realized what had happened he had pressed the cylinder to his forearm ill hope to see you allten hours from now he said very slowly but distinctly as he walked to the nearest seat he had barely reached it when he slumped quietly into oblivion its all your show now pat told himself as he got to his feet for a moment he felt like addressing a few wellchosen words to miss morley then he realized that to do so would sp oil the dignity of the commodores exit im the captain of this vessel he said in a firm low voice and from now on what i say goes not with me retorted the indomitable miss morley im a paying passenger and i have my rights ive not the slightest intention of using one of those things the blasted woman seemed unsnubbable pat was also compelled to admit that she had guts he had a brief nightmare glimpse of the future that her words suggested te hours alone with miss morley and no one else to talk to he glanced at the five trouble shooters the nearest to mi morley was the jamaican civil engineer robert bryan he looked ready and willing to move into action but pat still hoped that unpleasantness could be avoided i dont wish to argue about rights he said but if you were to look at the small print on your tickets youd discover that in an emergency im in absolute charge here in any event this is for your own good and your own comfort id much rather be asleep than awake while we wait for the rescue team to get here that goes for me too said professor jayawardene unexpectedly as the commodore said it will conserve the air so its our only chance miss wilkins will you give me one of those things the calm logic of this helped to lower the emotional temperature so did the professors smooth obviously comfortable slide into unconsciousness two down and eighteen to go murmured pat under his breath lets waste no more time he said aloud as you can see these shots are entirely painless theres a microjet hypodermic inside each cylinder and you wont even feel a pinprick sue was already handing out the innocentlooking little tubes and several of the passengers had used them immediately there went the schusters and the enigmatic mr radley that left fifteen who would be next now sue had come to miss morley this is it thought pat if she was still determined to make a fuss he might have guessed it i thought i made it quite clear that i dont want one of these things please take it away robert bryan began to inch forward but it was the sardonic english voice of david barrett that did the trick what really worries the good lady captain he said obviously placing his barb with relish is that you may take advantage of her in her helpless condition for a few seconds miss morley sat speechless with fury while her cheeks turned a bright crimson ive never been so insulted in my she began nor have i madam interjected pat completing her demoralization she looked round the circle of facesmost of them solemn but several grinning even at a time like this and realized that there was only one way out as she slumped in her seat pat breathed a vast sigh of relief after that little episode the rest should be easy then he saw that mrs williams whose birthday had been celebrated in such spartan style only a few hours before was staring in a kind of frozen trance at the cylinder in her hand the poor woman was obviously terrified and no one could blame her in the next seat her husband had already collapsed it was a little ungallant pat thought to have gone first and left his wife to fend for herself before he could take any action sue had moved forward im so sorry mrs williams i made a mistake i gave you an empty one perhaps youll let me have it back the whole thing was done so neatly that it looked like a conjuring trick sue tookor seemed to takethe tube from the unresisting fingers but as she did so she must have jolted it against mrs williams the lady never knew what had happened she quietly folded up and joined her husband half the company was unconscious now on the whole thought pat there had been remarkably little fuss commodore hansteen had been too much of a pessimist the riot squad had not been necessary after all then with a slight sinking feeling he noticed something that made him change his mind it looked as if as usual the commodore had known exactly what he was doing miss morley was not going to be the only difficult customer it was at least two years since lawrence had been inside an igloo there was a time when he had been a junior engineer out on construction projects when he had lived in one for weeks on end and had forgotten what it was like to be surrounded by rigid walls since those days of course there had been many improvements in design it was now no particular hardship to live in a home that would fold up into a small trunk this was one of the latest modelsa goodyear mark xxand it could sustain six men for an indefinite period as long as they were supplied with power water food and oxygen the igloo could provide everything elseeven entertainment for it had a builtin microlibrary of books music and video this was no extravagant luxury though the auditors queried it with great regularity in space boredom could be a killer it might take longer than say a leak in an air line but it could be just as effective and was sometimes much messier lawrence stooped slightly to enter the air lock in some of the old models he remembered you practically had to go down on hands and knees he waited for the pressure equalized signal then stepped into the hemispherical main chamber it was like being inside a balloon indeed that was exactly where he was he could see only part of the interior for it had been divided into several compartments by movable screens overhead three meters above the floor were the lights and the airconditioning grille suspended from the ceiling by elastic webbing against the curved wall stood collapsible metal racks only partly erected from the other side of the nearest screen came the sound of a voice reading from an inventory while every few seconds another interjected check lawrence stepped around the screen and found himself in the dormitory section of the igloo like the wall racks the double bunks had not been fully erected it was merely necessary to see that all the bits and pieces were in their place for as soon as the inventory was completed everything would be packed and rushed to the site lawrence did not interrupt the two storemen as they continued their careful stocktaking this was one of those unexciting but vital jobsof which there were so many on the moonupon which lives could depend a mistake here could be a sentence of death for someone sometime in the future when the checkers had come to the end of a sheet lawrence said is this the largest model you have in stock the largest thats serviceable was the answer we have a twelveman mark nineteen but theres a slow leak in the outer envelope that has to be fixed how long will that take only a few minutes but then theres a twelvehour inflation test before were allowed to check it out this was one of those times when the man who made the rules had to break them we cant wait to make the full test put on a double patch and take a leak reading if its inside the standard tolerance get the igloo checked out right away ill authorize the clearance the risk was trivial and he might need that big dome in a hurry somehow he had to provide air and shelter for twentytwo men and women out there on the sea of thirst they couldnt all wear space suits from the time they left selene until they were ferried back to port roris there was a beep beep from the communicator behind his left ear he flicked the switch at his belt and acknowledged the call cee speaking message from selene sir said a clear tiny voice very urgenttheyre in trouble chapter until now pat had scarcely noticed the man who was sitting with folded arms in window seat d and had to think twice to remember his name it was something like builderthat was it baldur hans baldur he had looked like the typical quiet tourist who never gave any trouble he was still quiet but no longer typicalfor he was remaining stubbornly conscious at first sight he appeared to be ignoring everything around him but the twitching of a cheek muscle betrayed his tenseness what are you waiting for mister baldur asked pat in the most neutral tone that he could manage he felt very glad of the moral and physical support ranged behind him baldur did not look exceptionally strong but he was certainly more than pats moonborn muscles could have coped withif it came to that baldur shook his head and remained staring out of the window for all the world as if he could see something there besides his own reflection you cant make me take that stuff and im not going to he said in heavily accented english i dont want to force you to do anything answered pat but cant you see its for your own goodand for the good of everyone else what possible objection do you have baldur hesitated and seemed to be struggling for words itsits against my principles he said yes thats it my religion wont allow me to take injections pat knew vaguely that there were people with such scruples yet he did not for a moment believe that baldur was one of them the man was lying but why can i make a point said a voice behind pats back of course mister harding he answered welcoming anything that might break this impasse you say you wont permit any injections mister baldur continued harding in tones that reminded pat of his crossexamination of mrs schuster but i can tell that you werent born on the moon no one can miss going through quarantineso how did you get here without taking the usual shots the question obviously left baldur extremely agitated thats no business of yours he snapped quite true said harding pleasantly im only trying to be helpful he stepped forward and reached out his left hand i dont suppose youd let me see your interplanetary vaccination certificate that was a damn silly thing to ask thought pat no human eye could read the magnetically inscribed information on an ivc he wondered if this would occur to baldur and if so what he would do about it he had no time to do anything he was still staring obviously taken by surprise at hardings open palm when baldurs interrogator moved his other hand so swiftly that pat never saw exactly what happened it was like sues conjuring trick with mrs williamsbut far more spectacular and also much deadlier as far as pat could judge it involved the side of the hand and the base of the neckand it was not he was quite sure the kind of skill he ever wished to acquire that will hold him for fifteen minutes said harding in a matteroffact voice as baldur crumpled up in his seat can you give me one of those tubes thanks he pressed the cylinder against the unconscious mans arm there was no sign that it had any additional effect the situation thought pat had got somewhat out of his control he was grateful that harding had exercised his singular skills but was not entirely happy about them now what was all that he asked a little plaintively harding rolled up baldurs left sleeve and turned the arm over to reveal the fleshy underside the skin was covered with literally hundreds of almost invisible pinpricks know what that is he said quietly pat nodded some had taken longer to make the trip than others but by now all the vices of weary old earth had reached the moon you cant blame the poor devil for not giving his reasons hes been conditioned against using the needle judging from the state of those scars he started his cure only a few weeks ago now its psychologically impossible for him to accept an injection i hope ive not given him a relapse but thats the least of his worries how did he ever get through quarantine oh theres a special section for people like this the doctors dont talk about it but the customers get temporary deconditioning under hypnosis there are more of them than you might think a trip to the moons highly recommended as part of the cure it gets you away from your original environment there were quite a few other questions that pat would have liked to ask harding but they had already wasted several minutes thank heavens all the remaining passengers had gone under that last demonstration of judo or whatever it was must have encouraged any stragglers you wont need me any more said sue with a small brave smile goodby patwake me when its over i will he promised lowering her gently into the space between the seat rows or not at all he added when he saw that her eyes were closed he remained bending ovet her for several seconds before he regained enough control to face the others there were so many things he wanted to tell her but now the opportunity was gone perhaps forever swallowing to overcome the dryness in his throat he turned to the five survivors there was still one more problem to deal with and david barrett summed it up for him well captain he said dont leave us in suspense which of us do you want to keep you company one by one pat handed over five of the sleep tubes thank you for your help he said i know this is a little melodramatic but its the neatest way only four of those will work i hope mine will said barrett wasting no time it did a few seconds later harding bryan and johanson followed the englishman into oblivion well said dr mckenzie i seem to be odd man out im flattered by your choiceor did you leave it to luck before i answer that question replied pat id better let port roris know whats happened he walked to the radio and gave a brief survey of the situation there was a shocked silence from the other end a few minutes later chief engineer lawrence was on the line you did the best thing of course he said when pat had repeated his story in more detail even if we hit no snags we cant possibly reach you in under five hours will you be able to hold out until then the two of us yes answered pat we can take turns using the spacesuit breathing circuit its the passengers im worried about the only thing you can do is to check their respiration and give them a blast of oxygen if they seem distressed well do our damnedest from this end anything more you want to say pat thought for a few seconds no he said a little wearily ill call you again on each quarterhour selene out he got to his feetslowly for the strain and the carbondioxide poisoning were now beginning to tell heavily upon himand said to mckenzie right docgive me a hand with that space suit im ashamed of myself id forgotten all about that and i was worried because some of the other passengers might have remembered they must all have seen it when they came in through the air lock it just goes to prove how you can overlook the obvious it took them only five minutes to detach the absorbent canisters and the twentyfourhour oxygen supply from the suit the whole breathing circuit had been designed for quick release in case it was ever needed for artificial respiration not for the first time pat blessed the skill ingenuity and foresight that had been lavished on selene there were some things that had been overlooked or that might have been done a little betterbut not many their lungs aching the only two men still conscious aboard the cruiser stood staring at each other across the gray metal cylinder that held another day of life then simultaneously each said you go first they laughed without much humor at the hackneyed situation then pat answered i wont argue and placed the mask over his face like a cool sea breeze after a dusty summer day like a wind from the mountain pine forests stirring the stagnant air in some deep lowlands valleyso the flow of oxygen seemed to pat he took four slow deep breaths and exhaled to the fullest extent to sweep the carbon dioxide out of his lungs then like a pipe of peace he handed the breathing kit over to mckenzie those four breaths had been enough to invigorate him and to sweep away the cobwebs that had been gathering in his brain perhaps it was partly psychologicalcould a few cubic centimeters of oxygen have had so profound an effectbut whatever the explanation he felt like a new man now he could face the fiveor morehours of waiting that lay ahead ten minutes later he felt another surge of confidence all the passengers seemed to be breathing as normally as could be expectedvery slowly but steadily he gave each one a few seconds of oxygen then called base again selene here he said captain harris reporting doctor mckenzie and i both feel quite fit now and none of the passengers seem distressed ill remain listening out and will call you again on the halfhour message received but hold on a minute several of the news agencies want to speak to you sony pat answered ive given all the information there is and ive twenty unconscious men and women to look after selene out that was only an excuse of course and a feeble one at that he was not even sure why he had made it he felt in a sudden and uncharacteristic burst of rancor why a man cant even die in peace nowadays had he known about that waiting camera only five kilometers away his reaction might have been even stronger you still havent answered my question captain said dr mckenzie patiently what question ohthat no it wasnt luck the commodore and i both thought youd be the most useful man to have awake youre a scientist you spotted the overheating danger before anyone else did and you kept quiet about it when we asked you to well ill try to live up to your expectations i certainly feel more alert than ive done for hours it must be the oxygen were sniffing the big question is how long will it last between the two of us twelve hours plenty of time for the skis to get here but we may have to give most of it to the others if they show signs of distress im afraid its going to be a very close thing they were both sitting crosslegged on the floor just beside the pilots position with the oxygen bottle between them every few minutes they would take turns with the inhaler but only two breaths at a time i never imagined pat told himself that i should ever get involved in the numberone cliche of the tv space operas but it had occurred in real life too often to be funny any moreespecially when it was happening to you both pat and mckenzieor almost certainly one of them could survive if they abandoned the other passengers to their fate trying to keep these twenty men and women alive they might also doom themselves the situation was one in which logic warred against conscience but it was nothing new certainly it was not peculiar to the age of space it was as old as mankind for countless times in the past lost or isolated groups had faced death through lack of water food or warmth now it was oxygen that was in short supply but the principle was just the same some of those groups had left no survivors others a handful who would spend the rest of their lives in selfjustification what must george pollard late captain of the whaler essex have thought as he walked the streets of nantucket with the taint of cannibalism upon his soul that was a twohundredyearold story of which pat had never heard he lived on a world too busy making its own legends to import those of earth as far as he was concerned he had already made his choice and he knew without asking that mckenzie would agree with him neither was the sort of man who would fight over the last bubble of oxygen in the tank but if it did come to a fight what are you smiling at asked mckenzie pat relaxed there was something about this burly australian scientist that he found very reassuring hansteen gave him the same impression but mckenzie was a much younger man there were some people you knew that you could trust whom you were certain would never let you down he had that feeling about mckenzie if you want to know he said putting down the oxygen mask i was thinking that i wouldnt have much of a chance if you decided to keep the bottle for yourself mckenzie looked a little surprised then he too grinned i thought all you moonborn were sensitive about that he said ive never felt that way pat answered after all brains are more important than muscles i cant help it that i was bred in a gravity field a sixth of yours anyway how could you tell i was moonborn well its partly your build you all have that same tall slender physique and theres your skin colorthe uv lamvs never seem to give you the same tan as natural sunlight its certainly tanned you retorted pat with a grin at night you must be a menace to navigation incidentally how did you get a name like mckenzie having had little contact with the racial tensions that were not yet wholly extinct on earth pat could make such remarks without embarrassmentindeed without even realizing that they might cause embarrassment my grandfather had it bestowed on him by a missionary when he was baptized im very doubtful if it has anyah genetic significance to the best of my knowledge im a fullblooded abo abo aboriginal we were the people occupying australia before the whites came along the subsequent events were somewhat depressing pats knowledge of terrestrial history was vague like most residents of the moon he tended to assume that nothing of great importance had ever happened before november when the fiftieth anniversary of the russian revolution had been so spectacularly celebrated i suppose there was war you could hardly call it that we had spears and boomerangs they had guns not to mention tb and vd which were much more effective it took us about a hundred and fifty years to get over the impact its only in the last century since about nineteen fortythat our numbers started going up again now there are about a hundred thousand of us almost as many as when your ancestors came mckenzie delivered this information with an ironic detachment that took any personal sting out of it but pat thought that he had better disclaim responsibility for the misdeeds of his terrestrial predecessors dont blame me for what happened on earth he said ive never been there and i never willi couldnt face that gravity but ive looked at australia plenty of times through the telescope i have some sentimental feeling for the place my parents took off from woomera and my ancestors named it a woomeras a booster stage for spears are any of your people asked pat choosing his words with care still living in primitive conditions ive heard thats still true in some parts of asia the old tribal lifes gone it went very quickly when the african nations in the un started bullying australia often quite unfairly i might addfor im an australian first and an aboriginal second but i must admit that my white countrymen were often pretty stupid they must have been to think that we were stupid why way into the last century some of them still thought we were stone age savages our technology was stone age all rightbut we werent there seemed nothing incongruous to pat about this discussion beneath the surface of the moon of a way of life so distant both in space and time he and mckenzie would have to entertain each other keep an eye on their twenty unconscious companions and fight off sleep for at least five more hours this was as good a way as any of doing it if your people werent in the stone age docand just for the sake of argument ill grant that you arenthow did the whites get that idea sheer stupidity with the help of a preconceived bias its an easy assumption that if a man cant count write or speak good english he must be unintelligent i can give you a perfect example from my own family my grandfatherthe first mckenzielived to see the year two thousand but he never learned to count beyond ten and his description of a total eclipse of the moon was kerosene lamp bilong jesus christ he buggerup finish altogether now i can write down the differential equations of the moons orbital motion but i dont claim to be brighter than grandfather if wed been switched in time he might have been the better physicist our opportunities were differentthats all grandfather never had occasion to learn to count and i never had to raise a family in the desertwhich was a highly skilled fulltime job perhaps said pat thoughtfully we could do with some of your grandfathers skills here for thats what were trying to do nowsurvive in a desert i suppose you could put it that way though i dont think that boomerang and fire stick would be much use to us maybe we could use some magicbut im afraid i dont know any and i doubt if the tribal gods could make it from arnhem land do you ever feel sorry asked pat about the breakup of your peoples way of life how could i i scarcely knew it i was born in brisbane and had learned to run an electronic computer before i ever saw a corroboree a what tribal religious danceand half the participants in that were taking degrees in cultural anthropology ive no romantic illusions about the simple life and the noble savage my ancestors were fine people and im not ashamed of them but geography had trapped them in a dead end after the struggle for sheer existence they had no energy left for a civilization in the long run it was a good thing that the white settlers arrived despite their charming habit of selling us poisoned flour when they wanted our land they did that they certainly did but why are you surprised that was a good hundred years before belsen pat thought this over for a few minutes then he looked at his watch and said with a distinct expression of relief time i reported to base again lets have a quick look at the passengers first chapter there was no time now lawrence realized to worry about inflatable igloos and the other refinements of gracious living in the sea of thirst all that mattered was getting those air pipes down into the cruiser the engineers and technicians would just have to sweat it out in the suits until the job was finished their ordeal would not last for long if they could not manage inside five or six hours they could turn round and go home again and leave selene to the world after which she was named in the workshops of port roris unsung and unrecorded miracles of improvisation were now being achieved a complete airconditioning plant with its liquidoxygen tanks humidity and carbondioxide absorbers temperature and pressure regulators had to be dismantled and loaded on to a sledge so did a small drilling rig hurled by shuttle rocket from the geophysics division at clavius so did the specially designed plumbs ing which now had to work at the first attempt for there would be no opportunity for modifications lawrence did not attempt to drive his men he knew it was unnecessary he kept in the background checking the flow of equipment from stores and workshop out to the skis and trying to think of every snag that could possibly arise what tools would be needed were there enough spares was the raft being loaded on to the skis last so that it could be offloaded first would it be safe to pump oxygen into selene before connecting up the exhaust line these and a hundred other detailssome trivial some vitalpassed through his mind several times he called pat to ask for technical information such as the internal pressure and temperature whether the cabin relief valve had blown off yet and advice on the best spots to drill through the roof and each time pat answered with increasing slowness and difficulty despite all attempts to make contact with him lawrence resolutely refused to speak to the newsmen now swarming round port roris and jamming half the sound and vision circuits between earth and moon he had issued one brief statement explaining the position and what he intended doing about it the rest was up to the administrative people it was their job to protect him so that he could get on with his work undisturbed he had made that quite clear to the tourist commissioner and had hung up before davis could argue with him he had no time of course even to glance at the tv coverage himself though he had heard that doctor lawson was rapidly establishing a reputation as a somewhat prickly personality that he presumed was the work of the interplanet news man into whose hands he had dumped the astronomer the fellow should be feeling quite happy about it the fellow was feeling nothing of the sort high on the ramparts of the mountains of inaccessibility whose title he had so convincingly refuted maurice spenser was heading swiftly toward that ulcer he had avoided all his working life he had spent a hundred thousand stollars to get auriga hereand now it looked as if there would be no story after all it would all be over before the skis could arrive the suspensepacked breathtaking rescue operation that would keep billions glued to their screens was never going to materialize few people could have resisted watching twentytwo men and women snatched from death but no one would want to see an exhumation that was spensers coldblooded analysis of the situation from the newscasters viewpoint but as a human being he was equally unhappy it was a terrible thing to sit here on the mountain only five kilometers away from impending tragedy yet able to do absolutely nothing to avert it he felt almost ashamed of every breath he took knowing that those people down there were suffocating time and again he had wondered if there was anything that auriga could do to help but now he was sure that she could only be a spectator that implacable sea ruled out all possibility of aid he had covered disasters before but this time he felt uncommonly like a ghoul it was very peaceful now aboard seleneso peaceful that one had to fight against sleep how pleasant it would be thought pat if he could join the others dreaming happily all around him he envied them and sometimes felt jealous of them then he would take a few draughts from the dwindling store of oxygen and reality would close in upon him as he recognized his peril a single man could never have remained awake or kept an eye on twenty unconscious men and women feeding them oxygen whenever they showed signs of respiratory distress he and mckenzie had acted as mutual watchdogs several times each had dragged the other back from the verge of sleep there would have been no difficulty had there been plenty of oxygen but that one bottle was becoming rapidly exhausted it was maddening to know that there were still many kilograms of liquid oxygen in the cruisers main tanks but there was no way in which they could use it the automatic system was metering it through the evaporators and into the cabin where it was at once contaminated by the now almost unbreathable atmosphere pat had never known time to move so slowly it seemed quite incredible that only four hours had passed since he and mckenzie had been left to guard their sleeping companions he could have sworn that they had been here for days talking quietly together calling port roris every fifteen minutes checking pulses and respiration and doling out oxygen with a miserly hand but nothing lasts forever over the radio from the world which neither man really believed he would ever see again came the news they had been waiting for were on the way said the weary but determined voice of chief engineer lawrence you only have to hang on for another hourwell be on top of you by then how are you feeling very tired said pat slowly but we can make it and the passengers just the same rightill call you every ten minutes leave your receiver on volume high this is med divisions ideathey dont want to risk your falling asleep the blare of brass thundered across the face of the moon then echoed on past the earth and out into the far reaches of the solar system hector berlioz could never have dreamed that two centuries after he had composed it the soulstirring rhythm of his rakoczy march would bring hope and strength to men fighting for their lives on another world as the music reverberated round the cabin pat looked at dr mckenzie with a wan smile it may be oldfashioned he said but its working the blood was pounding in his veins his foot was tapping with the beat of the music out of the lunar sky flashing down from space had come the tramp of marching armies the thunder of cavalry across a thousand battlefields the call of bugles that had once summoned nations to meet their destiny all gone long ago and that was well for the world but they had left behind them much that was fine and nobleexamples of heroism and selfsacrifice proofs that men could still hold on when their bodies should have passed the limits of physical endurance as his lungs labored in the stagnant air pat harris knew that he had need of such inspiration from the past if he was to survive the endless hour that lay ahead aboard the tiny cluttered deck of duster one chief engineer lawrence heard the same music and reacted in the same fashion his little fleet was indeed going into battle against the enemy that man would face to the end of time as he spread across the universe from planet to planet and sun to sun the forces of nature would be arrayed against him in ever new and unexpected ways even earth after all these aeons still had many traps for the unwary and on a world that men had known for only a lifetime death lurked in a thousand innocent disguises whether or not the sea of thirst was robbed of its prey lawrence was sure of one thingtomorrow there would be a fresh challenge each ski was towing a single sledge piled high with equipment which looked heavier and more impressive than it really was most of the load was merely the empty drums upon which the raft would float everything not absolutely essential had been left behind as soon as duster one had dumped its cargo lawrence would send it straight back to port rons for the next load then he would be able to maintain a shuttle service between the site and base so that if he wanted anything quickly he would never have to wait more than an hour for it this of course was taking the optimistic view by the time he got to selene there might be no hurry at all as the port buildings dropped swiftly below the sky line lawrence ran through the procedure with his men he had intended to do a fulldress rehearsal before sailing but that was another plan that had had to be abandoned through lack of time the first countclown would be the only one that mattered jones sikorsky coleman matsul when we arrive at the marker youre to unload the drums and lay them out in the right pattern as soon as thats done bruce and hodges will fix the crossmembers be very careful not to drop any of the nuts and bolts and keep all your tools tied to you if you accidentally fall off dont panic you can only sink a few centimeters i know sikorsky jones you give a hand with the flooring as soon as the raft frameworks fixed coleman matsui immediately theres enough working space start laying out the air pipes and the plumbing greenwood renaldi youre in charge of the drilling operation so it went on point by point the greatest danger lawrence knew was that his men would get in each others way as they worked in this confined space a single trifling accident and the whole effort would be wasted one of lawrences private fears which had been worrying him ever since they left port roris was that some vital tool had been left behind and there was an even worse nightmarethat the twentytwo men and women in selene might die within minutes of rescue because the only wrench that could make the final connection had been dropped overboard on the mountains of inaccessibility maurice spenser was staring through his binoculars and listening to the radio voices calling across the sea of thirst every ten minutes lawrence would speak to selene and each time the pause before the reply would be a little longer but harris and mckenzie were still clinging to consciousness thanks to sheer will power and presumably the musical encouragement they were getting from clavius city whats that psychologist disc jockey pumping into them now asked spenser on the other side of the control cabin the ships radio officer turned up the volume and the valkyries rode above the mountains of inaccessibility i dont believe grumbled captain anson that theyve played anything later than the nineteenth century oh yes they have corrected jules braques as he made some infinitesimal adjustment to his camera they did khachaturians sabre dance just now thats only a hundred years old time for duster one to call again said the radio officer the cabin became instantly silent right on the second the dustski signal came in the expedition was now so close that auriga could receive it directly without benefit of the relay from lagrange lawrence calling selene well be over you in ten minutes are you ok again that agonizing pause this time it lasted almost five seconds then selene answering no change here that was all pat harris was not wasting his remaining breath ten minutes said spenser they should be in sight now anything on the screen not yet answered jules zooming out to the horizon and panning slowly along its empty arc there was nothing above it but the black night of space the moon thought jules certainly presented some headaches to the cameraman everything was soot or whitewash there were no nice soft half tones and of course there was that eternal dilemma of the stars though that was an aesthetic problem rather than a technical one the public expected to see stars in the lunar sky even during the daytime because they were there but the fact was that the human eye could not normally see them during the day the eye was so desensitized by the glare that the sky appeared an empty absolute black if you wanted to see the stars you had to look for them through blinkers that cut off all other light then your pupils would slowly expand and one by one the stars would come out until they filled the field of view but as soon as you looked at anything elsephut out they went the human eye could look at the daylight stars or the daylight landscape it could never see both at once but the tv camera could if desired and some directors preferred it to do so others argued that this falsified reality it was one of those problems that had no correct answer jules sided with the realists and kept the star gate circuit switched off unless the studio asked for it at any moment he would have some action for earth already the news networks had taken flashesgeneral views of the mountains slow pans across the sea closeups of that lonely marker sticking through the dust but before long and perhaps for hours on end his camera might well be the eyes of several billion people this feature was either going to be a bust or the biggest story of the year he fingered the talisman in his pocket jules braques member of the society of motion picture and television engineers would have been displeased had anyone accused him of carrying a lucky charm on the other hand he would have been very hard put to explain why he never brought out his little toy until the story he was covering was safely on the air here they are yelled spenser his voice revealing the strain under which he had been laboring he lowered his binoculars and glanced at the camera youre too far off to the right jules was already panning on the monitor screen the geometrical smoothness of the far horizon had been broken at last two tiny twinkling stars had appeared on that perfect arc dividing sea and space the dustskis were coming up over the face of the moon even with the longest focus of the zoom lens they looked small and distant that was the way jules wanted it he was anxious to give the impression of loneliness emptiness he shot a quick glance at the ships main screen now tuned to the interplanet channel yes they were carrying him he reached into his pocket pulled out a small diary and laid it on top of the camera he lifted the cover which locked into position just short of the verticaland immediately became alive with color and movement at the same time a faint gnatsized voice started to tell him that this was a special program of the interplanet news service channel one oh sevenand we will now be taking you over to the moon on the tiny screen was the picture he was seeing directly on his monitor nonot quite the same picture this was the one he had captured two and a half seconds ago he was looking that far into the past in those two and a halt million microsecondsto change to the time scale of the electronic engineerthis scene had undergone many adventures and transformations from his camera it had been piped to aurigas transmitter and beamed straight up to lagrange fifty thousand kilometers overhead there it had been snatched out of space boosted a few hundred times and sped earthward to be caught by one or another of the satellite relays then down through the ionospherethat last hundred kilometers the hardest of allto the interplanet building where its adventures really began as it joined the ceaseless flood of sounds and sights and electrical impulses which informed and amused a substantial fraction of the human race and here it was again after passing through the hands of program directors and specialeffects departments and engineering assistantsright back where it started broadcast over the whole of earthside from the highpower transmitter on lagrange ii and over the whole of farside from lagrange i to span the single hands breadth from juless tv camera to his pocketdiary receiver that image had traveled three quarters of a million kilometers he wondered if it was worth the trouble men had been wondering that ever since television was invented chapter lawrence spotted auriga while he was still fifteen kilometers away he could scarcely have failed to do so for she was a conspicuous object as the sunlight glistened from her plastic and metal what the devils that he asked himself and answered the question at once it was obviously a ship and he remembered hearing vague rumors that some news network had chartered a flight to the mountains that was not his business though at one time he himself had looked into the question of landing equipment there to cut out this tedious haul across the sea unfortunately the plan wouldnt work there was no safe landing point within five hundred meters of sea level the ledge that had been so convenient for spenser was at too great an altitude to be of use the chief engineer was not sure that he liked the idea of having his every move watched by longfocus lenses up in the hillsnot that there was anything he could do about it he had already vetoed an attempt to put a camera on his ski to the enormous relief though lawrence did not know it of interplanet news and the extreme frustration of the other services then he realized that it might well be useful having a ship only a few kilometers away it would provide an additional information channel and perhaps they could utilize its services in some other way it might even provide hospitality until the igloos could be ferried out where was the marker surely it should be in sight by now for an uncomfortable moment lawrence thought that it had fallen down and disappeared into the dust that would not stop them finding selene of course but it might delay them five or ten minutes at a time when every second was vital he breathed a sigh of relief he had overlooked the thin shaft against the blazing background of the mountains his pilot had already spotted their goal and had changed course slightly to head toward it the skis coasted to a halt on either side of the marker and at once erupted into activity eight spacesuited figures started unshipping roped bundles and large cylindrical drums at a great speed according to the prearranged plan swiftly the raft began to take shape as its slotted metal framework was bolted into position round the drums and the light fiberglas flooring was laid across it no construction job in the whole history of the moon had ever been carried out in such a blaze of publicity thanks to the watchful eye in the mountains but once they had started work the eight men on the skis were totally unconscious of the millions looking over their shoulders all that mattered to them now was getting that raft in position and fixing the jigs which would guide the hollow lifebearing drills down to their target every five minutes or less lawrence spoke to selene keeping pat and mckenzie informed of progress the fact that he was also informing the anxiously waiting world scarcely crossed his mind at last in an incredible twenty minutes the drill was ready its first fivemeter section poised like a harpoon ready to plunge into the sea but this harpoon was designed to bring life not death were coming down said lawrence the first sections going in now youd better hurry whispered pat i cant hold out much longer he seemed to be moving in a fog he could not remember a time when it was not there apart from the dull ache in his lungs he was not really uncomfortablemerely incredibly unbelievably tired he was now no more than a robot going about a task whose meaning he had long ago forgotten if indeed he had ever known it there was a wrench in his hand he had taken it out of the tool kit hours ago knowing that it would be needed perhaps it would remind him of what he had to do when the time came from a great distance it seemed he heard a snatch of conversation that was obviously not intended for him someone had forgotten to switch channels we should have fixed it so that the drill could be unscrewed from this end suppose hes too weak to do it we had to take the risk the extra fittings would have delayed us at least an hour give me that then the circuit went dead but pat had heard enough to make him angryor as angry as a man could be in his halfstupefied condition hed show themhe and his good pal doctor macmac what he could no longer remember the name he turned slowly round in his swiveling seat and looked back along the golgothalike shambles of the cabin for a moment he could not find the physicist among the other tumbled bodies then he saw that he was kneeling beside mrs williams whose dates of birth and death now looked like being very close together mckenzie was holding the oxygen mask over her face quite unaware of the fact that the telltale hiss of gas from the cylinder had ceased and the gauge had long ago reached zero were almost there said the radio you should hear us hit at any minute so soon thought pat but of course a heavy tube would slice down through the dust almost as quickly as it could be lowered he thought he was very clever to deduce this bang something had hit the roof but where i can hear you he whispered youve reached us we know answered the voice we can feel the contact but you have to do the rest can you tell where the drills touching is it in a clear section of the roof or is it over the wiring well raise and lower it several times to help you locate it pat felt rather aggrieved at this it seemed terribly unfair that he should have to decide such a complicated matter knock knock went the drill against the roof he couldnt for the life of him locate the exact position of the sound well they had nothing to lose go ahead he murmured youre in the clear he had to repeat it twice before they understood his words instantlythey were quick off the pad up therethe drill started whirring against the outer hull he could hear the sound very distinctly more beautiful than any music the bit was through the first obstacle in less than a minute he heard it race then stop as the motor was cut then the operator lowered it the few centimeters to the inner hull and started it spinning again the sound was much louder now and could be pinpointed exactly it came pat was mildly disconcerted to note from very close to the main cable conduit along the center of the roof if it went through that slowly and unsteadily he got to his feet and walked over to the source of the sound he had just reached it when there was a shower of dust from the ceiling a sudden spitting of electricityand the main lights went out luckily the emergency lighting remained on it took pats eyes several seconds to adapt to the dim red glow then he saw that a metal tube was protruding through the roof it moved slowly downward until it had traveled half a meter into the cabin and there it stopped the radio was talking in the background saying something that he knew was very important he tried to make sense of it as he fitted the wrench around the bit head and tightened the screw adjustment dont undo the bit until we tell you said that remote voice we had no time to fit a nonreturn valvethe pipes open to vacuum at this end well tell you as soon as were ready i repeat dont remove the bit until we say so pat wished the man would stop bothering him he knew exactly what to do if he leaned with all his might on the handle of the wrenchsothe drill head would come off and hed be able to breathe again why wasnt it moving he tried once more my god said the radio stop that were not ready youll lose all your air just a minute thought pat ignoring the distraction theres something wrong here a screw can turn this wayor that way suppose im tightening it up when i should be doing the opposite this was horribly complicated he looked at his right hand then his left neither seemed to help well he could try the other way and see if that was better with great dignity he performed a complete circuit of the tube keeping one arm wrapped around it as he fell on the wrench from the other side he grabbed it with both hands to keep himself from collapsing for a moment he rested against it head bowed up periscope he mumbled now what on earth did that mean he had no idea but he had heard it somewhere and it seemed appropriate he was still puzzling over the matter when the drill head started to unscrew beneath his weight very easily and smoothly fifteen meters above chief engineer lawrence and his assistants stood for a moment almost paralyzed with horror this was something that no one could ever have imagined they had thought of a hundred other accidents but not this colemanmatsui snapped lawrence connect up that oxygen line for gods sake even as he shouted at them he knew that it would be too late there were two connections still to be made before the oxygen circuit was closed and of course they were screw threads not quickrelease couplings just one of those little points that normally wouldnt matter in a thousand years but now made all the difference between life and death like samson at the mill pat trudged round and round the pipe pushing the handle of the wrench before him it offered no opposition even in his present feeble state by now the bit had unscrewed more than two centimeters surely it would fall off in a few more seconds ahalmost there he could hear a faint hissing that grew steadily as the bit unwound that would be oxygen rushing into the cabin of course in a few seconds he would be able to breathe again and all his troubles would be over the hiss had deepened to an ominous whistling and for the first time pat began to wonder if he was doing precisely the right thing he stopped looked thoughtfully at the wrench and scratched his head his slow mental processes could find no fault with his action if the radio had given him orders then he might have obeyed but it had abandoned the attempt well back to work he started to push on the wrench once moreand fell flat on his face as the drill came loose in the same instant the cabin reverberated with a screaming roar and a gale started all the loose papers fluttering like autumn leaves a mist of condensation formed as the air chilled by its sudden expansion dumped its moisture in a thick fog when pat turned over on his back conscious at last of what had happened he was almost blinded by the mist around him that scream meant only one thing to a trained spaceman and his automatic reactions had taken over now he must find some flat object that could be slid over the hole anything would do if it was fairly strong he looked wildly around him in the crimson fog which was already thinning as it was sucked into space the noise was deafening it seemed incredible that so small a pipe could make such a scream staggering over his unconscious companions clawing his way from seat to seat he had almost abandoned hope when he saw the answer to his prayer there lay a thick volume open face downward on the floor where it had been dropped not the right way to treat books he thought but he was glad that someone had been careless he might never have seen it otherwise when he reached the shrieking orifice that was sucking the life out of the cruiser the book was literally torn from his hands and flattened against the end of the pipe the sound died instantly as did the gale for a moment pat stood swaying like a drunken man then he quietly folded at the knees and pitched to the floor chapter the really unforgettable moments of tv are those which no one expects and for which neither cameras nor commentators are prepared for the last thirty minutes the raft had been the site of feverish but controlled activitythen without warning it had erupted impossible though that was it seemed as if a geyser had spouted from the sea of thirst automatically jules tracked that ascending column of mist as it drove toward the stars as it rose it expanded like some strange attenuated plantor like a thinner feebler version of the mushroom cloud that had terrorized two generations of mankind it lasted only for a few seconds but in that time it held unknown millions frozen in front of their screens wondering how a waterspout could possibly have reared itself from this arid sea then it collapsed and died still in the same uncanny silence in which it had been born to the men on the raft that geyser of moistureladen air was equally silent but they felt its vibration as they struggled to get the last coupling into place they would have managed sooner or later even if pat had not cut off the flow for the forces involved were quite trivial but their later might have been too late perhaps indeed it already was calling selene calling selene shouted lawrence can you hear me there was no reply the cruisers transmitter was not operating he could not even hear the sounds her mike should be picking up inside the cabin connections ready sir said coleman shall i turn on the oxygen generator it wont do any good thought lawrence if harris has managed to screw that damned bit back into place i can only hope hes merely stuffed something into the end of the tube and that we can blow it out ok he said let her goall the pressure you can get with a sudden bang the battered copy of the orange and the apple was blasted away from the pipe to which it had been vacuumclamped out of the open orifice gushed an inverted fountain of gas so cold that its outline was visible in ghostly swirls of condensing water vapor for several minutes the oxygen geyser roared without producing any effect then pat harris slowly stirred tried to get up and was knocked back to the ground by the concentrated jet it was not a particularly powerful jet but it was stronger than he was in his present state he lay with the icy blast playing across his face enjoying its refreshing coolness almost as much as its breathability in a few seconds he was completely alertthough he had a splitting headacheand aware of all that had happened in the last halfhour he nearly fainted again when he remembered unscrewing the bit and fighting that gusher of escaping air but this was no time to worry about past mistakes all that mattered now was that he was aliveand with any luck would stay so he picked up the stillunconscious mckenzie as though he were a limp doll and laid him beneath the oxygen blast its force was much weaker now as the pressure inside the cruiser rose back to normal in a few more minutes it would be only a gentle zephyr the scientist revived almost at once and looked vaguely round him where am i he said not very originally ohthey got through to us thank god i can breathe again whats happened to the lights dont worry about thatill soon fix them we must get everyone under this jet as quickly as we can and flush some oxygen into their lungs can you give artificial respiration ive never tried its very simple wait until i find the medicine chest when pat had collected the resuscitator he demonstrated on the nearest subject who happened to be irving schuster push the tongue out of the way and slip the tube down the throat now squeeze this bulbslowly keep up a natural breathing rhythm got the idea yes but how long shall i do it five or six deep breaths should be enough id guess were not trying to revive them after allwe just want to get the stale air out of their lungs you take the front half of the cabin ill do the rear but theres only one resuscitator pat grinned without much humor its not necessary he answered bending over his next patient oh said mckenzie id forgotten that it was hardly chance that pat had headed straight to sue and was now blowing into her lips in the ancientand highly effectivemouthtomouth method but to do him justice he wasted no time on her when he found that she was breathing normally he was just starting on his third subject when the radio gave another despairing call hello selene is there anyone there pat took a few seconds off to grab the mike harris calling were ok were applying artificial respiration to the passengers no time to say morewell call you later ill remain on receive tell us whats happening thank god youre okwed given you up you gave us a hell of a fright when you unscrewed that drill listening to the chief engineers voice while he blew into the peacefully sleeping mr radley pat had no wish to be reminded of that incident he knew that whatever happened he would never live it down yet it had probably been for the best most of the bad air had been siphoned out of selene in that hectic minute or so of decompression it might even have lasted longer than that for it would have taken two or three minutes for a cabin of this size to lose much of its air through a tube only four centimeters in diameter now listen continued lawrence because youve been overheating badly were letting you have your oxygen just as cold as we think its safe call us back if it gets too chilly or too dry in five or ten minutes well be sinking the second pipe to you so that well have a complete circuit and can take over your entire airconditioning load well aim this pipe for the rear of the cabin just as soon as weve towed the raft a few meters were moving now call you back in a minute pat and the doctor did not relax until they had pumped the foul air from the lungs of all their unconscious companions then very tired yet feeling the calm joy of men who see some great ordeal approach its triumphant end they slumped to the floor and waited for the second drill to come through the roof ten minutes later they heard it bang against the outer hull just forward of the air lock when lawrence called to check its position pat confirmed that this time it was clear of obstructions and dont worry he added i wont touch that drill until you tell me it was now so cold that he and mckenzie had put on their outer clothing once more and had draped blankets over the sleeping passengers but pat did not call a halt as long as they were not in actual distress the colder the better they were driving back the deadly heat that had almost cooked themand even more important their own air purifiers would probably start working again now that the temperature had dropped so drastically when that second pipe came through the roof they would be doubly safeguarded the men on the raft could keep them supplied with air indefinitely and they would also have several hoursperhaps a daysreserve of their own they might still have a long wait here beneath the dust but the suspense was over unless of course the moon arranged some fresh surprises well mr spenser said captain anson looks as if youve got your story spenser felt almost as exhausted after the strain of the last hour as any of the men out on the raft two kilometers below him he could see them there on the monitor on medium closeup they were obviously relaxingas well as men could relax when they were wearing space suits five of them indeed appeared to be trying to get some sleep and were tackling the problem in a startling but sensible manner they were lying beside the raft half submerged in the dust rather like floating rubber dolls it had not occurred to spenser that a space suit was much too buoyant to sink in this stuff by getting off the raft the five technicians were not only providing themselves with an incomparably luxurious couch they were leaving a greatly enlarged working space for their companions the three remaining members of the team were moving slowly around adjusting and checking equipmentespecially the rectangular bulk of the air purifier and the big lox spheres coupled to it at maximum optical and electronic zoom the camera could get within ten meters of all this gearalmost close enough to read the gauges even at medium magnification it was easy to spot the two pipes going over the side and leading down to the invisible selene this relaxed and peaceful scene made a startling contrast with that of an hour ago but there was nothing more to be done here until the next batch of equipment arrived both of the skis had gone back to port roris that was where all the activity would now be taking place as the engineering staff tested and assembled the gear which they hoped would enable them to reach selene it would be another day at least before that was ready meanwhile barring accidents the sea of thirst would continue to bask undisturbed in the morning sun and the camera would have no new scenes to throw across space from one and a half lightseconds away the voice of the program director back on earth spoke inside aurigas control cabin nice work maurice jules well keep taping the picture in case anything breaks at your end but we dont expect to carry it live until the oh six hundred news spot hows it holding up supernova rating and theres a new angleevery crackpot inventor who ever tried to patent a new paper clip is crawling out of the woodwork with ideas were rounding up a batch of them at six fifteen it should be good fun who knowsperhaps one of them may have something maybe but i doubt it the sensible ones wont come near our program when they see the treatment the others are getting whywhat are you doing to them their ideas are being analyzed by your scientist friend doctor lawson weve had a dummy run with him he skins them alive not my friend protested spenser ive only met him twice the first time i got ten words out of him the second time he fell asleep on me well hes developed since then believe it or not youll see him inoh fortyfive minutes i can wait anyway im only interested in what lawrence plans to do has he made a statement you should be able to get at him now the pressures off hes still furiously busy and wont talk we dont think the engineering department has made up its mind yet anyhow theyre testing all sorts of gadgets at port roris and ferrying in equipment from all over the moon well keep you in touch if we learn anything new it was a paradoxical fact which spenser took completely for granted that when you were covering a story like this you often had no idea of the big picture even when you were in the center of things as he was now he had started the ball rolling but now he was no longer in control it was true that he and jules were providing the most important video coverage or would be when the action shifted back herebut the pattern was being shaped at the news centers on earth and in clavius city he almost wished he could leave jules and hurry back to headquarters that was impossible of course and even if he did so he would soon regret it for this was not only the biggest scoop of his career it was he suspected the last time he would ever be able to cover a story out in the field by his own success he would have doomed himself irrevocably to an office chairor at best a comfortable little viewing booth behind the banked monitor screens at clavius central chapter it was still very quiet aboard selene but the quietness was now that of sleep not of death before long all these people would be waking to greet a day few of them could really have expected to see pat harris was standing somewhat precariously on the back of a seat mending the break in the overhead lighting circuit it was fortunate that the drill had not been five millimeters to the left then it would have taken out the radio as well and the job would have been much worse throw in numberthree circuit breaker doc he called winding up his insulating tape we should be in business now the main lights came on blindingly brilliant after the crimson gloom at the same time there was a sudden explosive sound so unexpected and alarming that it shocked pat off his unstable perch before he reached the floor he identified it it was a sneeze the passengers were starting to waken and he had perhaps slightly overdone the refrigeration for the cabin was now extremely cold he wondered who would be the first to return to consciousness sue he hoped because then they would be able to talk together without interruption at least for a little while after what they had been through together he did not regard duncan mckenzies presence as any interferencethough perhaps sue could hardly be expected to see it that way beneath the covering of blankets the first figure was stirring pat hurried forward to give assistance then he paused and said under his breath oh no well you couldnt win all the time and a captain had to do his duty come what may he bent over the scrawny figure that was struggling to rise and said solicitously how do you feel miss morley to have become a tv property was at once the best and the worst thing that could have happened to dr lawson it had built up his selfconfidence by convincing him that the world which he had always affected to despise was really interested in his special knowledge and abilities it had given him an outlet for expressing his genuine devotion to astronomy somewhat stultified by living too long in the exclusive society of astronomers and it was also earning him satisfactory quantities of money but the program with which he was now involved might almost have been designed to confirm his old view that the men who werent brutes were mostly fools this however was hardly the fault of interplanet news which could not resist a feature that was a perfect fillin for the long periods when nothing would be happening out at the raft the fact that lawson was on the moon and his victims were on earth presented only a minor technical problem which the tv technicians had solved long ago the program could not go out live it had to be taped beforehand and those annoying twoandahalfsecond pauses while the radio waves flashed from planet to satellite and back again had to be sliced out they would upset the performersnothing could be done about thatbut by the time a skilled editor had anachionized the tape the listener would be unable to tell that he was hearing a discussion that spanned almost four hundred thousand kilometers chief engineer lawrence heard the program as he lay flat on his back in the sea of thirst staring up into the empty sky it was the first chance of resting he had had for more hours than he could remember but his mind was too active to let him sleep in any event he had never acquired the knack of sleeping in a suit and saw no need to learn it now for the first of the igloos was already on the way from port roris when that arrived he would be able to live in wellearned and muchneeded comfort despite all the claims of the manufacturers no one can function efficiently in a space suit for more than twentyfour hours for several obvious reasons and several that are not so obvious there is for example that baffling complaint known as spacemans itch affecting the small of the backor even less accessible spotsafter a days incarceration in a suit the doctors claim that it is purely psychological and several heroic space medicos have worn suits for a week or more to prove it the demonstration has done nothing to affect the incidence of the disease the mythology of space suits is a vast complex and frequently ribald subject with a nomenclature all of its own no one is quite sure why one famous model of the s was known as the iron maiden but any astronaut will gladly explain why s mark xiv was called the chamber of horrors there seems little truth however in the theory that it was designed by a sadistic female engineer determined to inflict a diabolical revenge upon the opposite sex but lawrence was reasonably at ease in his model as he listened to these enthusiastic amateurs put forward their ideas it was just possiblethough very unlikelythat one of these uninhibited thinkers might come up with an idea that could be of practical use he had seen it happen before and was prepared to listen to suggestions rather more patiently than dr lawsonwho it was obvious would never learn to suffer fools gladly he had just demolished an amateur engineer from sicily who wanted to blow the dust away by means of strategically placed air jets the scheme was typical of those put forward even where there was no fundamental scientific flaw most of these ideas fell to pieces when examined quantitatively you could blow the dust awayif you had an unlimited supply of air wthile the voluble flow of italianenglish was proceeding lawson had been doing some rapid calculations i estimate signor gusalli he said that you would need at least five tons of air a minute to keep open a hole large enough to be useful it would be quite impossible to ship such quantities out to the site ah but you could collect the air and use it over and over again thank you signor gusalli cut in the firm voice of the master of ceremonies now we have mr robertson from london ontario whats your plan mr robertson i suggest freezing just a minute protested lawson how can you freeze dust first id saturate it with water next id sink cooling pipes and turn the whole mass into ice that would hold the dust in place and then it would be easy to drill through it its an interesting idea admitted lawson rather reluctantly at least its not as crazy as some that weve had but the amount of water needed would be impossibly large remember the cruiser is fifteen meters down whats that in feet said the canadian in a tone of voice that made it clear that he was one of the hardcore antimetric school fifty feetas im sure you know perfectly well now youd have to deal with a column at least a meter acrossyard to youso that would involveahapproximately fifteen times ten squared times ten to the fourth cubic centimeters which giveswhy of course fifteen tons of water but this assumes no wastage at all youd really need several times as much as this it might come to as much as a hundred tons and how much do you think all the freezing gear would weigh lawrence was quite impressed unlike many scientists he had known lawson had a firm grasp of practical realities and was also a rapid calculator usually when an astronomer or a physicist did a quick computation his first attempt was out by a factor of anything from ten to a hundred as far as lawrence could judge lawson was always right the first time the canadian refrigeration enthusiast was still putting up a fight when he was dragged off the program to be replaced by an african gentleman who wanted to use the opposite techniqueheat he planned to use a huge concave mirror focusing sunlight on the dust and fusing it into an immobile mass it was obvious that lawson was keeping his temper only with the utmost difficulty the solarfurnace advocate was one of those stubborna selftaught experts who refused to admit that he could possibly have made an error in his calculations the argument was getting really violent when a voice from much closer at hand cut across the program the skis are coming mister lawrence lawrence rolled into a sitting position and climbed aboard the raft if anything was already in sight that meant it was practically on top of him yes there was duster oneand also duster three which had made a difficult and expensive trip from the lake of drought the seas smaller equivalent on farside that journey was a saga in itself which would remain forever unknown except to the handful of men involved each ski was towing two sledges piled high with equipment as they drew alongside the raft the first item to be unloaded was the large packing case containing the igloo it was always fascinating to watch one being inflated and lawrence had never anticipated the spectacle more eagerly the process was completely automatic one broke a seal turned two separate leversas a safeguard against the disastrous possibility of accidental triggeringand then waited lawrence did not have to wait for long the sides of the box fell flat revealing a tightly packed convoluted mass of silvery fabric it stirred and struggled like some living creature lawrence had once seen a moth emerging from the chrysalis with its wings still crumpled and the two processes bore an uncanny similarity the insect however had taken an hour to reach its full size and splendor but the igloo took only three minutes as the air generator pumped an atmosphere into the flaccid envelope it expanded and stiffened in sudden jerks followed by slow periods of consolidation now it was a meter high and was spreading outward rather than upward when it had reached the limits of its extension it started to go upward again and the air lock popped away from the main dome the whole operation one felt should be accompanied by laborious wheezings and puffings it seemed quite wrong that it was happening in utter silence now the structure had nearly reached its final dimensions and it was obvious that igloo was the only possible name for it though they had been designed to provide protection against a very differentthough almost equally hostileenvironment the snow houses of the eskimos had been of exactly the same shape the technical problem had been similar so was the solution it took considerably longer to install the fittings than to inflate the igloo for all the equipmentbunks chairs tables cupboards electronic gearhad to be carried in through the air lock some of the larger items barely made it having been designed with only centimeters to spare but at last there was a radio call from inside the dome were open for business it said come on in lawrence wasted no time in accepting the invitation he began to undo the fittings of his suit while he was still in the outer section of the twostage air lock and had the helmet off as soon as he could hear voices from inside the dome reaching him through the thickening atmosphere it was wonderful to be a free man again to be able to wriggle scratch move without encumbrance talk to your fellows face to face the coffinsized shower removed the stink of the space suit and made him feel fit for human society once more then he put on a pair of shortsall that one ever wore in an iglooand sat down to a conference with his assistants most of the material he had ordered had come in this consignment the rest would be arriving on duster two in the course of the next few hours as he checked the supply lists he felt himself much more the master of the situation oxygen was assuredbarring catastrophe water had been getting short down there well he could supply that easily enough food was a little more difficult though it was merely a matter of packing central catering had already supplied samples of chocolate compressed meat cheese and even elongated french rollsall packed into cylinders three centimeters wide presently he would shoot them down the air pipes and give morale in selene a big boost but this was less important than the recommendations of his brains trust embodied in a dozen blueprints and a terse sixpage memorandum lawrence read it extremely carefully nodding agreement from time to time he had already come to the same general conclusions and he could see no way of escaping from them whatever happened to her passengers selene had made her last voyage chapter the gale that had swept through selene seemed to have carried away with it more than the stagnant air when he looked back on their first days beneath the dust commodore hansteen realized that there had often been a hectic even hysterical mood aboard after the initial shock had worn off trying to keep up their spirits they had sometimes gone too far in the direction of false gaiety and childish humor now that was all past and it was easy to see why the fact that a rescue team was at work only a few meters away was part of the explanation but only part of it the spirit of tranquillity that they now shared came from their encounter with death after that nothing could be quite the same again the petty dross of selfishness and cowardice had been burned out of them no one knew this better than hansteen he had watched it happen many times before whenever a ships company faced peril in the far reaches of the solar system though he was not philosophically inclined he had had plenty of time to think in space he had sometimes wondered if the real reason why men sought danger was that only thus could they find the companionship and solidarity which they unconsciously craved he would be sorry to say goodby to all those peopleyes even to miss morley who was now as agreeable and considerate as her temperament would allow the fact that he could think that far ahead was the measure of his confidence one could never be certain of course but the situation now seemed completely under control no one knew exactly how chief engineer lawrence intended to get them out but that problem was now merely a choice between alternative methods from now on their imprisonment was an inconvenience not a danger it was not even a hardship since those food cylinders had started popping down the air tubes though there had never been any risk of starvation the diet had grown extremely monotonous and water had been rationed for some time now several hundred liters had been pumped down to refill the almost empty tanks it was strange that commodore lansteen who usually thought of everything never asked himself the simple question whatever happened to all the water we started with though he had more immediate problems on his mind the sight of that extra mass being taken aboard should have set him worrying but it never did until it was much too late pat harris and chief engineer lawrence were equally to blame for the oversight it was the one flaw in a beautifully executed plan and one flaw of course was all that was needed the engineering division of earthside was still working swiftly but no longer in a desperate race against the clock there was time now to construct mockups of the cruiser to sink them in the sea off port roris and to try various ways of entering them advice sensible and otherwise was still pouring in but no one took any notice of it the approach had been decided and would not be modified now unless it ran into unexpected obstacles twentyfour hours after the igloo had been set up all the special gear had been manufactured and shipped out to the site it was a record that lawrence hoped he would never have to break and he was very proud of the men who had made it possible the engineering division seldom got the credit it deserved like the air everyone took it for granted forgetting that the engineers supplied that air now that he was ready to go into action lawrence was quite willing to start talking and maurice spenser was more than willing to accommodate him this was the moment spenser had been waiting for as far as he could remember it was also the first time that there had ever been a tv interview with camera and subject five kilometers apart at this fantastic magnification the image was a little fuzzy of course and the slightest vibration in aurigas cabin set it dancing on the screen for this reason everyone aboard the ship was motionless and all nonessential machinery had been switched off chief engineer lawrence was standing on the edge of the raft his spacesuited figure braced against the small crane that had been swung over the side hanging from the jib was a large concrete cylinder open at both endsthe first section of the tube that was now being lowered into the dust after a lot of thought said lawrence for the benefit of that distant camera but above all for the benefit of the men and women fifteen meters beneath him weve decided that this is the best way to tackle the problem this cylinder is called a caissonhe pronounced it kasoonand it will sink easily under its own weight the sharp lower edge will cut through the dust like a knife through butter we have enough sections to reach the cruiser when weve made contact and the tube is sealed at the bottomits pressure against the roof will ensure thatwell start scooping out the dust as soon as thats done well have an open shaft like a small well right down to selene that will be half the battle but only half then well have to connect the shaft to one of our pressurized igloos so that when we cut through the cruisers roof theres no loss of air but i thinki hopethat these are fairly straightforward problems he paused for a minute wondering if he should touch on any of the other details that made this operation so much trickier than it looked then he decided not to those who understood could see with their own eyes and the others would not be interested or would think he was boasting this blaze of publicity did not worry him so long as things went well but if they did not he raised his arm and signaled to the crane operator lower away slowly the cylinder settled into the dust until its full fourmeter length had vanished except for a narrow ring just protruding above the surface it had gone down smoothly and easily lawrence hoped that the remaining sections would be equally obliging one of the engineers was carefully going along the rim of the caisson with a spirit level to check that it was sinking vertically presently he gave the thumbsup signal which lawrence acknowledged in the same manner there had been a time when like any regular spacehog he could carry out an extended and fairly technical conversation by signlanguage alone this was an essential skill of the trade for radio sometimes failed and there were occasions when one did not wish to clutter up the limited number of channels available ready for number two he said this would be tricky the first section had to be held rigid while the second was bolted to it without altering the alignment one really needed two cranes for this job but a framework of ibeams supported a few centimeters above the surface of the dust could carry the load when the crane was otherwise engaged no mistakes now for gods sake he breathed silently numbertwo section swung off the sledge that had brought it from port roris and three of the technicians manhandled it into the vertical this was the sort of job where the distinction between weight and mass was vital that swinging cylinder weighed relatively little but its momentum was the same as it would be on earth and it could pulp a man if it managed to trap him on one of those sluggish oscillations and that was something else peculiar to the moonthe slowmotion movement of this suspended mass in this gravity a pendulum took twoandahalf times as long to complete its cycle as it would on earth this was something that never looked quite right except to a man who had been born here now the second section was upended and mated to the first one they were clamped together and once again lawrence gave the order to lower away the resistance of the dust was increasing but the caisson continued to sink smoothly under its own weight eight meters gone said lawrence that means were just past the halfway mark numberthree section coming up after this there would only be one more though lawrence had provided a spare section just in case he had a hearty respect for the seas ability to swallow equipment so far only a few nuts and bolts had been lost but if that piece of caisson slipped from the hook it would be gone in a flash though it might not sink far especially if it hit the dust broadside on it would be effectively out of reach even if it was only a couple of meters down they had no time to waste salvaging their own salvage gear there went number three its last section moving with almost imperceptible slowness but it was still moving in a few minutes with any luck at all they would be knocking on the cruisers roof twelve meters down said lawrence were only three meters above you now selene you should be able to hear us at any minute indeed they could and the sound was wonderfully reassuring more than ten minutes ago hansteen had noticed the vibration of the oxygen inlet pipe as the caisson scraped against it you could tell when it stopped and when it started moving again there was that vibration once more accompanied this time by a delicate shower of dust from the roof the two air pipes had now been drawn up so that about twenty centimeters of their lengths projected through the ceiling and the quickdrying cement which was part of the emergency kit of all space vehicles had been smoothed around their points of entry it seemed to be working loose but that impalpable rain of dust was far too slight to cause alarm nevertheless hansteen thought that he had better mention it to the skipper who might not have noticed funny said pat looking up at the projecting pipe that cement should hold even if the pipe is vibrating he climbed up on a seat and examined the air pipe more closely for a moment he said nothing then he stepped down looking puzzled and annoyedand more than a little worried whats the trouble hansteen asked quietly he knew pat well enough now to read his face like an open book that pipes pulling up through the roof he said someone up on the rafts being mighty careless its shortened by at least a centimeter since i fixed that plaster then pat stopped suddenly aghast my god he whispered suppose its our own fault suppose were still sinking what if we are said the commodore quite calmly youd expect the dust to continue settling beneath our weight that doesnt mean were in danger judging by that pipe weve gone down one centimeter in twentyfour hours they can always give us some more tubing if we need it pat laughed a little shamefacedly of coursethats the answer i should have thought of it before weve probably been sinking slowly all the time but this is the first chance weve had to prove it still id better report to mr lawrenceit may affect his calculations pat started to walk toward the front of the cabin but he never made it chapter it had taken nature a million years to set the trap that had snared selene and dragged her down into the sea of thirst the second time she was caught in a trap that she had made herself because her designers had no need to watch every gram of excess weight or plan for journeys lasting more than a few hours they had never equipped selene with those ingenious but unadvertised arrangements whereby spaceships recycle all their water supply she did not have to conserve her resources in the miserly manner of deepspace vehicles the small amount of water normally used and produced aboard she simply dumped over the past five days several hundred kilos of liquid and vapor had left selene to be instantly absorbed by the thirsty dust many hours ago the dust in the immediate neighborhood of the waste vents had become saturated and had turned into mud dripping downward through scores of channels it had honeycombed the surrounding sea silently patiently the cruiser had been washing away her own foundations the gentle nudge of the approaching caisson had done the rest up on the raft the first intimation of disaster was the flashing of the red warning light on the air purifier synchronized with the howling of a radio klaxon across all the spacesuit wave bands the howl ceased almost immediately as the technician in charge punched the cutoff button but the red light continued to flash a glance at the dials was enough to show lawrence the trouble the air pipesboth of themwere no longer connected to selene the purifier was pumping oxygen into the sea through one pipe and worse still sucking in dust through the other lawrence wondered how long it would take to clean out the filters but wasted no further time upon that thought he was too busy calling selene there was no answer he tried all the cruisers frequencies without receiving even a whisper of a carrier wave the sea of thirst was as silent to radio as it was to sound theyre finished he said to himself its all over it was a near thing but we just couldnt make it and all we needed was another hour what could have happened he thought dully perhaps the hull had collapsed under the weight of the dust nothat was very unlikely the internal air pressure would have prevented that it must have been another subsidence he was not sure but he thought that there had been a slight tremor underfoot from the beginning he had been aware of this danger but could see no way of guarding against it this was a gamble they had all taken and selene had lost even as selene started to fall something told pat that this was quite different from the first cavein it was much slower and there were scrunching squishing noises from outside the hull which even in that desperate moment struck pat as being unlike any sounds that dust could possibly make overhead the oxygen pipes were tearing loose they were not sliding out smoothly for the cruiser was going down stern first tilting toward the rear with a crack of splintering fiberglas the pipe just ahead of the airlock galley ripped through the roof and vanished from sight immediately a thick jet of dust sprayed into the cabin and fanned out in a choking cloud where it hit the floor commodore hansteen was nearest and got there first tearing off his shirt he swiftly wadded it into a ball and rammed it into the aperture the dust spurted in all directions as he struggled to block the flow he had almost succeeded when the forward pipe ripped looseand the main lights went out as for the second time the cable conduit was wrenched away ill take it shouted pat a moment later also shirtless he was trying to stem the torrent pouring in through the hole he had sailed the sea of thirst a hundred times yet never before had he touched its substance with his naked skin the gray powder sprayed into his nose and eyes half choking and wholly blinding him though it was as bone dry as the dust from a pharaohs tombdryer than this indeed for it was a million times older than the pyramidsit had a curiously soapy feeling as he fought against it pat found himself thinking if there is one death worse than being drowned its being buried alive when the jet weakened to a thin trickle he knew that he had avoided that fatefor the moment the pressure produced by fifteen meters of dust under the low lunar gravity was not difficult to overcomethough it would have been another story if the holes in the roof had been much larger pat shook the dust from his head and shoulders and cautiously opened his eyes at least he could see again thank heaven for the emergency lighting dim though it was the commodore had already plugged his leak and was now calmly sprinkling water from a paper cup to lay the dust the technique was remarkably effective and the few remaining clouds quickly collapsed into patches of mud hansteen looked up and caught pats eye well captain he said any theories there were times thought pat when the commodores olympian selfcontrol was almost maddening he would like to see him break just once nothat was not really true his feeling was merely a flash of envy even of jealousyunderstandable but quite unworthy of him he should be ashamed of it and he was i dont know whats happened he said perhaps the people on top can tell us it was an uphill walk to the pilots position for the cruiser was now tilted at about thirty degrees from the horizontal as pat took his seat in front of the radio he felt a kind of despairing numbness that surpassed anything he had known since their original entombment it was a sense of resignation an almost superstitious belief that the gods were fighting against them and that further struggle was useless he felt sure of this when he switched on the radio and found that it was completely dead the power was off when that oxygen pipe had ripped out the roof cable conduit it had done a thorough job pat swiveled slowly around in his seat twentyone men and women were looking at him awaiting his news but twenty of them he did not see for sue was watching him and he was conscious only of the expression on her face it held an anxiety and readinessbut even now no hint of fear as pat looked at her his own feelings of despair seemed to dissolve he felt a surge of strength even of hope im damned if i know whats happened he said but im sure of thiswere not done for yet by several lightyears we may have sunk a little farther but our friends on the raft will soon catch up with us this will mean a slight delaythats all theres certainly nothing to worry about i dont want to be an alarmist captain said barrett but suppose the raft has sunk as well what then well know as soon as i get the radio fixed replied pat glancing anxiously at the wires dangling from the roof cable duct and until i get this spaghetti sorted out youll have to put up with the emergency lighting i dont mind said mrs schuster i think its rather cute bless you mrs s said pat to himself he glanced quickly around the cabin though it was hard to see all their expressions in this dim lighting the passengers seemed calm enough they were not quite so calm a minute later that was all the time it took to discover that nothing could be done to repair the lights or radio the wiring had been ripped out far down inside the conduit beyond reach of the simple tools available here this is rather more serious reported pat we wont be able to communicate unless they lower a microphone to make contact with us that means said barrett who seemed to like looking on the dark side of things that theyve lost touch with us they wont understand why were not answering suppose they assume that were all deadand abandon the whole operation the thought had flashed through pats mind but he had dismissed it almost at once youve heard chief engineer lawrence on the radio he answered hes not the sort of man whod give up until he had absolute proof that were no longer alive you neednt worry on that score what about our air asked professor jayawardene anxiously were back on our own resources again that should last for several hours now the absorbers have been regenerated those pipes will be in place before then answered pat with slightly more confidence than he felt meanwhile well have to be patient and provide our own entertainment again we did it for three days we should be able to manage for a couple of hours he glanced again around the cabin looking for any signs of disagreement and saw that one of the passengers was rising slowly to his feet it was the very last person he would have expectedquiet little mr radley who had uttered perhaps a dozen words during the entire trip pat still knew no more about him than that he was an accountant and come from new zealandthe only country on earth still slightly isolated from the rest of the world by virtue of its position it could be reached of course as quickly as any other spot on the planet but it was the end of the line not a way station to somewhere else as a result the new zealanders still proudly preserved much of their individuality they claimed with a good deal of truth to have salvaged all that was left of english culture now that the british isles had been absorbed into the atlantic community you want to say something mister radley asked pat radley looked around the dimlit cabin rather like a schoolmaster about to address a class yes captain he began i have a confession to make i am very much afraid that this is all my fault when chief engineer lawrence broke off his commentary earth knew within two seconds that something had gone wrongthough it took several minutes for the news to reach mars and venus but what had happened no one could guess from the picture on the screen for a few seconds there had been a flurry of frantic but meaningless activity but now the immediate crisis seemed to be over the spacesuited figures were huddled together obviously in conferenceand with their telephone circuits plugged in so that no one could overhear them it was very frustrating to watch that silent discussion and to have no idea of what it was about during those long minutes of agonizing suspense while the studio was trying to discover what was happening jules did his best to keep the picture alive it was an extremely difficult job handling such a static scene from a single camera position like all cameramen jules hated to be pinned down in one spot this site was perfect but it was fixed and he was getting rather tired of it he had even asked if the ship could be moved but as captain anson put it im damned if ill go hopping back and forth over the mountains this is a spaceship not aa chamois so jules had to ring the changes on pans and zooms though he used the latter with discretion because nothing upset viewers more quickly than being hurled back and forth through space or watching scenery explode in their faces if he used the powerzoom flat out jules could sweep across the moon at about fifty thousand kilometers an hourand several million viewers would get motion sickness at last that urgent soundless conference was breaking up the men on the raft were unplugging their telephones now perhaps lawrence would answer the radio calls that had been bombarding him for the last five minutes my god said spenser i dont believe it do you see what theyre doing yes said captain anson and i dont believe it either but it looks as if theyre abandoning the site like lifeboats leaving a sinking ship the two dustskis crowded with men were pulling away from the raft chapter perhaps it was well that selene was now out of radio contact it would hardly have helped morale if her occupants had known that the skis heavily overloaded with passengers were heading away from the site but at the moment no one in the cruiser was thinking of the rescue effort radley as holding the center of the dimly lit stage what do you meanthis is all your fault asked pat in the baffled silence that followed the new zealanders statement only baffled as yet not hostile because no one could take such a remark seriously its a long story captain said radley speaking in a voice that though it was oddly unemotional had undertones that pat could not identify it was almost like listening to a robot and it gave pat an unpleasant feeling somewhere in the middle of his spine i dont mean to say that i deliberately caused this to happen but im afraid it is deliberate and im sorry to have involved you all you seethey are after me this is all we need thought pat we really seem to have the odds stacked against us in this small company weve got a neurotic spinster a drug addictand now a maniac what other freaks are going to reveal themselves before were finished then he realized the unfairness of his judgment the truth was that he had been very lucky against radley miss morley and hans baldur he had the commodore dr mckenzie the schusters little professor jayawardene david barrettand all the others who had done as they were asked without making a fuss he felt a sudden surge of affection even of lovetoward them all for giving him their active or passive support and especially toward sue who was already one jump ahead of him as she always seemed to be there she was moving unobtrusively about her duties at the back of the cabin pat doubted if anyone noticedcertainly radley did notas she opened the medicine chest and palmed one of those cigarettesized cylinders of oblivion if this fellow gave trouble she would be ready at the moment trouble seemed the furthest thing from radleys mind he appeared to be completely selfpossessed and perfectly rational there was no mad gleam in his eye or any other of the clichйs of insanity he looked exactly what he wasa middleaged new zealand accountant taking a holiday on the moon this is very interesting mister radley said commodore hansteen in a carefully neutral voice but please excuse our ignorance who are they and why should they be after you i am sure commodore that youve heard of flying saucers flying what pat asked himself hansteen seemed better informed than he was yes i have he answered a little wearily ive come across them in old books on astronautics they were quite a craze werent they about eighty years ago he realized that craze was an unfortunate word to use and was relieved when radley took no offense oh he answered they go back much further than that but it was only in the last century that people started to take notice of them theres an old manuscript from an english abbey dated that describes one in detailand that isnt the earliest report by any means more than ten thousand flying saucer sightings have been recorded prior to the twentieth century just a minute interrupted pat what the devil do you mean by flying saucer ive never heard of them then im afraid captain that your education has been neglected answered radley in a sorrowful voice the term flying saucer came into general use after to describe the strange usually discshaped vehicles that have been investigating our planet for centuries some people prefer to use the phrase unidentified flying objects that aroused a few faint memories in pats mind yes he had heard that term in connection with the hypothetical outsiders but there was no concrete evidence of course that alien space vessels had ever entered the solar system do you really believe said one of the other passengers skeptically that there are visitors from space hanging round the earth much more than that answered radley theyve often landed and made contact with human beings before we came here they had a base on farside but they destroyed it when the first survey rockets started taking closeups how do you know all this asked someone else radley seemed quite indifferent to the skepticism of his audience he must have grown used to this response long ago he radiated a kind of inner faith which however illfounded it might be was oddly convincing his insanity had exalted him into the realm beyond reason and he was quite happy there we havecontacts he answered with an air of great importance a few men and women have been able to establish telepathic communication with the saucer people so we know a good deal about them how is it that no one else does asked another disbeliever if theyre really out there why havent our astronomers and space pilots seen them oh but they have radley answered with a pitying smile and theyre keeping quiet theres a conspiracy of silence among the scientists they dont like to admit that there are intelligences out in space so much superior to ours so when a pilot does report a saucer they make fun of him now of course every astronaut keeps quiet when he meets one have you ever met one commodore asked mrs schuster obviously half convinced or are you in thewhat did mister radley call itconspiracy of silence im very sorry to disappoint you said hansteen youll have to take my word for it that all the spaceships ive ever met have been on lloyds register he caught pats eye and gave a little nod that said lets go and talk this over in the air lock now that he was quite convinced that radley was harmless he almost welcomed this interlude it had very effectively taken the passengers minds off the situation in which they now found themselves if radleys brand of insanity could keep them entertained then good luck to it well pat said hansteen when the airlock door had sealed them off from the argument what do you think of him does he really believe that nonsense oh yesevery word of it ive met his type before the commodore knew a good deal about radleys peculiar obsession no one whose interest in astronautics dated back to the twentieth century could fail to as a young man he had even read some of the original writings on the subjectworks of such brazen fraudulence or childish naпvetй that they had shaken his belief that men were rational beings that such a literature could ever have flourished was a disturbing thought though it was true that most of those books had been published in that psychotic era the frantic fifties this is a very peculiar situation complained pat at a time like thisall the passengers are arguing about flying saucers i think its an excellent idea answered the commodore what else would you suggest they do lets face it weve got to sit here and wait until lawrence starts knocking on the roof again if hes still here barrett may be rightperhaps the raft has sunk i think thats very unlikely the disturbance was only a slight one how far would you imagine we went down pat thought this over looking back on the incident it seemed to have lasted a long time the fact that he had been in virtual darkness and had been fighting that jet of dust still further confused his memory he could only hazard a guess id sayten meters nonsense the whole affair only lasted a couple of seconds i doubt if we dropped more than two or three meters pat found this hard to believe but he hoped that the commodore was right he knew that it was extremely difficult to judge weak accelerations particularly when one was under stress hansteen was the only man aboard who could have had any experience of this his verdict was probably correctand was certainly encouraging they may never have felt a thing on the surface continued hansteen and theyre probably wondering why they cant make contact with us are you sure theres nothing we can do about the radio quite sure the whole terminal blocks come loose at the end of the cable conduit theres no way of reaching it from inside the cabin well i suppose thats that we might as well go back and let radley try to convert usif he can jules had tracked the overcrowded skis for a hundred meters before he realized that they were not as overcrowded as they should have been they carried seven menand there had been eight on the site he panned swiftly back to the raft and by the good luck or precognition that separates the brilliant cameraman from the merely adequate one he arrived there just as lawrence broke his radio silence cee calling lawrence said sounding as tired and frustrated as would any man who had just seen his carefully laid plans demolished sorry for the delay but as youll have gathered we have an emergency there appears to have been another cavein how deep it is we dont knowbut weve lost physical contact with selene and shes not answering our radio in case theres another subsidence ive ordered my men to stand by a few hundred meters away the dangers very slight we hardly felt that last tremorbut theres no point in taking chances i can do everything thats necessary for the moment without any help ill call again in a few minutes cee out with the eyes of millions upon him lawrence crouched at the edge of the raft reassembling the probe with which he had first located the cruiser he had twenty meters to play with if she had gone deeper than that he would have to think of something else the rod sank into the dust moving more and more slowly as it approached the depth where selene had rested there was the original markfifteen point one five metersjust disappearing through the surface the probe continued to move like a lance piercing into the body of the moon how much farther whispered lawrence to himself in the murmurous silence of his space suit the anticlimax was almost laughable except that this was no laughing matter the probe penetrated an extra meter and a halfa distance he could comfortably span without straining his arms far more serious was the fact that selene had not sunk evenly as lawrence discovered after a few additional probings she was much lower at the stern being now tilted at an angle of about thirty degrees that alone was enough to wreck his plan he had relied upon the caisson making a flush contact with the horizontal roof he put that problem aside for the moment there was a more immediate one now that the cruisers radio was silent and he had to pray that it was a simple power failurehow could he tell if the people inside were still alive they would hear his probe but there was no way in which they could communicate with him but of course there was the easiest and most primitive means of all which could be so readily overlooked after a century and a half of electronics lawrence got to his feet and called the waiting skis you can come back he said theres no danger she only sank a couple of meters he had already forgotten the watching millions though his new plan of campaign had still to be drawn up he was going into action again chapter when pat and the commodore returned to the cabin the debate was still going full blast radley who had said so little until now was certainly making up for lost time it was as if some secret spring had been touched or he had been absolved from an oath of secrecy that was probably the explanation now that he was convinced that his mission was discovered he was only too happy to talk about it commodore hansteen had met many such believersindeed it was in sheer selfdefense that he had waded through the turgid literature of the subject the approach was almost always the same first would be the suggestion that surely commodore youve seen some very strange things during your years in space then when his reply was unsatisfactory there would be a guardedand sometimes not so guarded hint that he was either afraid or unwilling to speak it was a waste of energy denying the charge in the eyes of the faithful that only proved that he was part of the conspiracy the other passengers had no such bitter experience to warn them and radley was evading their points with effortless ease even schuster for all his legal training was unable to pin him into a corner his efforts were as futile as trying to convince a paranoiac that he was not really being persecuted does it seem reasonable schuster argued that if thousands of scientists know this not one of them will let the cat out of the bag you cant keep a secret that big it would be like trying to hide the washington monument oh there have been attempts to reveal the truth radley answered but the evidence has a way of being mysteriously destroyedas well as the men who wanted to reveal it they can be utterly ruthless when its necessary but you said thattheyhave been in contact with human beings isnt that a contradiction not at all you see the forces of good and evil are at war in the universe just as they are on earth some of the saucer people want to help us others to exploit us the two groups have been struggling together for thousands of years sometimes the conflict involves earth that is how atlantis was destroyed hansteen was unable to resist a smile atlantis always got into the act sooner or lateror if not atlantis then lemuria or mu they all appealed to the same type of unbalanced mysterymongering mentality the whole subject had been thoroughly investigated by a group of psychologists duringif hansteen remembered correctlythe s they had concluded that around the midtwentieth century a substantial percentage of the population was convinced that the world was about to be destroyed and that the only hope lay in intervention from space having lost faith in themselves men had sought salvation in the sky the flying saucer religion flourished among the lunatic fringe of mankind for almost exactly ten years then it had abruptly died out like an epidemic that had run its course two factors the psychologists had decided were responsible for this the first was sheer boredom the second was the international geophysical year which had heralded mans own entry into space in the eighteen months of the igy the sky was watched and probed by more instruments and more trained observers than in the whole of previous history if there had been celestial visitors poised above the atmosphere this concentrated scientific effort would have revealed them it did nothing of the sort and when the first manned vehicles started leaving earth the flying saucers were still more conspicuous by their absence for most men that settled the matter the thousands of unidentified flying objects that had been seen over the centuries had some natural cause and with better understanding of meteorology and astronomy there was no lack of reasonable explanations as the age of space dawned restoring mans confidence in his own destiny the world lost interest in flying saucers it is seldom however that a religion dies out completely and a small body of the faithful kept the cult alive with fantastic revelations accounts of meetings with extraterrestrials and claims of telepathic contacts even when as frequently happened the current prophets were proved to have faked the evidence the devotees never wavered they needed their gods in the sky and would not be deprived of them you still havent explained to us mr schuster was now saying why the saucer people should be after you what have you done to annoy them i was getting too close to some of their secrets so they have used this opportunity to eliminate me i should have thought they could have found less elaborate ways it is foolish to imagine that our limited minds can understand their mode of thinking but this would seem like an accident no one would suspect that it was deliberate a good point since it makes no difference now could you tell us what secret you were after im sure wed all like to know hansteen shot a quick glance at irving schuster the lawyer had struck him as a rather solemn humorless little man irony seemed somewhat out of character id be glad to tell you answered radley it really starts back in nineteen fiftythree when an american astronomer named oneill observed something very remarkable here on the moon he discovered a small bridge on the eastern border of the mare crisium other astronomers of course laughed at himbut less prejudiced ones confirmed the existence of the bridge within a few years however it had vanished obviously our interest had alarmed the saucer people and they had dismantled it that obvious hansteen told himself was a perfect example of saucerite logicthe daring non sequitur that left the normal mind helplessly floundering several jumps behind he had never heard of oneills bridge but there had been scores of examples of mistaken observations in the astronomical records the martian canals were the classic case honest observers had reported them for years but they simply did not existat least not as the fine spider web that lowell and others had drawn did radley think that someone had filled in the canals between the time of lowell and the securing of the hrst clear photographs of mars he was quite capable of it hansteen was sure presumably oneills bridge had been a trick of the lighting or of the moons perpetually shifting shadowsbut such a simple explanation was not of course good enough for kadley and in any event what was the man doing here a couple of thousand kilometers from the mare crisium someone else had thought of that and had put the same question as usual radley had a convincing answer at the tip of his tongue id hoped he said to divert their suspicions by behaving like an ordinary tourist because the evidence i was looking for lay on the western hemisphere i went east i planned to get to the mare crisium by going across farside there were several places there that i wanted to look at too but they were too clever for me i should have guessed that id be spotted by one of their agentsthey can take human form you know probably theyve been following me ever since i landed on the moon id like to know said mrs schuster who seemed to be taking radley with everincreasing seriousness what theyre going to do to us now i wish i could tell you maam answered radley we know that they have eaves deep down inside the moon and almost certainly thats where were being taken as soon as they saw that the rescuers were getting close they stepped in again im afraid were too deep for anyone to reach us now thats quite enough of this nonsense said pat to himself weve had our comic relief and now this madman is starting to depress people but how can we shut him up insanity was rare on the moon as in all frontier societies pat did not know how to deal with it especially with this confident curiously persuasive variety there were moments when he almost wondered if there might be something in radleys delusion in other circumstances his natural healthy skepticism would have protected him but now after these days of strain and suspense his critical faculties were dimmed he wished there was some neat way of breaking the spell that this glibtongued maniac was undoubtedly casting half ashamed of the thought he remembered the quick coup de grace that had put hans baldur so neatly to sleep without intending to do seat least to his conscious knowledgehe caught hardings eye to his alarm there was an immediate response harding nodded slightly and rose slowly to his feet no said patbut only to himself i dont mean that leave the poor lunatic alone what sort of man are you anyway then he relaxed very slightly harding was not attempting to move from his seat four places from radley he was merely standing there looking at the new zealander with an unfathomable expression it might even have been pity but in this dim lighting pat could not be sure i think its time to make my contribution harding said at least one of the things our friend was telling you is perfectly true he has been followedbut not by saucemites by me for an amateur wilfred george radley id like to congratulate you its been a fine chasefrom christchurch to astrograd to clavius to tycho to ptolemy to plato to port rorisand to here which i guess is the end of the trail in more ways than one radley did not seem in the least perturbed he merely inclined his head in an almost regal gesture of acknowledgment as if he recognized hardings existence but did not wish to pursue his acquaintance as you may have guessed continued harding im a detective most of the time i specialize in fraud quite interesting work though i seldom have a chance of talking about it im quite grateful for this opportunity ive no interestwell no professional interestin mister radleys peculiar beliefs whether theyre true or not doesnt affect the fact that hes a very smart accountant earning a good salary back in nz though not one good enough to pay for a month on the moon but that was no problembecause you see mister radley was senior accountant at the christchurch branch of universal travel cards incorporated the system is supposed to be foolproof and double checked but somehow he managed to issue himself a cardq categorygood for unlimited travel anywhere in the solar system for hotel and restaurant billings for cashing checks up to five hundred stoilars on demand there arent many q cards around and theyre handled as if theyre made of plutonium of course people have tried to get away with this sort of thing before clients are always losing their cards and enterprising characters have a fine time with them for a few days before theyre caught but only a few days the utc central billing system is very efficientit has to be there are several safeguards against unauthorized use and until now the longest run anyones had was a week nine days radley unexpectedly interjected sorryyou should know nine days then but radley had been on the move for almost three weeks before we spotted him hed taken his annual leave and told the office hed be vacationing quietly on the north island instead he went to astrograd and then on to the moon making history in the process for hes the first manand we hope the last oneto leave earth entirely on credit we still want to know exactly how he did it how did he bypass the automatic checking circuits did lie have an accomplice in the computer programing section and similar questions of absorbing interest to utc inc i hope radley youll let down your hair with me just to satisfy my curiosity i think its the least you can do in the circumstances still we know why you did itwhy you threw up a good job to go on a spree that was bound to land you in jail we guessed the reason of course as soon as we found you were on the moon utc knew all about your hobby but it didnt affect your efficiency they took a gamble and its been an expensive one im very sorry radley replied not without dignity the firms always treated me well and it did seem a shame but it was in a good cause and if i could have found my evidence but at that point everyone except detective inspector harding lost interest in radley and his saucers the sound that they had all been anxiously waiting for had come at last lawrences probe was scratching against the roof chapter i seem to have been here for half a lifetime thought maurice spenser yet the sun is still low in the west where it rises on this weird world and its still three days to noon how much longer am i going to be stuck on this mountaintop listening to captain ansons tall stories of the spaceways and watching that distant raft with its twin igloos it was a question that no one could answer when the caisson had started to descend it had looked as if another twentyfour hours would see the job finished but now they were back where they had startedand to make matters worse all the visual excitement of the story was over everything that would happen from now on would be hidden deep in the sea or would take place behind the walls of an igloo lawrence still stubbornly refused to allow a camera out on the raft and spenser could hardly blame him the chief engineer had been unlucky once when his commentary had blown up in his face and was not going to risk it happening again yet there was no question of auriga abandoning the site which she had reached at such expense if all went well there was one dramatic scene still to come and if all went badly there would be a tragic one sooner or later those dustskis would be heading back to port roriswith or without the men and women they had come to save spenser was not going to miss the departure of that caravan whether it took place under the rising or the setting sun or beneath the fainter light of the unmoving earth as soon as he had relocated selene lawrence had started drilling again on the monitor screen spenser could see the thin shaft of the oxygensupply tube making its second descent into the dust why was lawrence bothering to do this he wondered if he was not even sure whether anyone was still alive aboard selene and how was he going to check this now that the radio had failed that was a question that millions of people were asking themselves as they watched the pipe sink down into the dust and perhaps many of them thought of the right answer yet oddly enough it never occurred to anyone aboard selenenot even to the commodore as soon as they heard that heavy thump against the roof they knew at once that this was no sounding rod delicately probing the sea when a minute later there came the unmistakable whirr of a drill chewing its way through fiberglas they felt like condemned men who had been granted a lastminute reprieve this time the drill missed the cable conduitnot that it mattered now the passengers watched almost hypnotized as the grinding sound grew louder and the first flakes planed down from the ceiling when the head of the drill appeared and descended twenty centimeters into the cabin there was a brief but heartfelt burst of cheering now what said pat to himself we cant talk to them how will i know when to unscrew the drill im not going to make that mistake a second time startlingly loud in this tense expectant silence the metal tube resonated with the dit dit dit dah which surely not one of selenes company would forget however long he lived pat replied at once banging out an answering v with a pair of pliers now they know were alive he thought he had never really believed that lawrence would assume that they were dead and abandon them yet at the same time there was always that haunting doubt the tube signaled again this time much more slowly it was a nuisance having to learn morse in this age it seemed such an anachronism and many were the bitter protests among pilots and space engineers at the waste of effort in your whole lifetime you might need it only once but that was the point you would really need it then dit dit dah rapped the tube dah dit dit dit dit dah dit dah dit dit dah dit dit dit dah dah then so that there would be no mistake it started to repeat the word but both pat and the commodore rusty though they were had got the message theyre telling us to unscrew the drill said pat well here we go the brief rush of air gave everyone a moment of unnecessary panic as the pressure equalized then the pipe was open to the upper world and twentytwo anxious men and women waited for the first breath of oxygen to come gushing down it instead the tube spoke out of the open orifice came a voice hollow and sepulchral but perfectly clear it was so loud and so utterly unexpected that a gasp of surprise came from the company probably not more than half a dozen of these men and women had ever heard a speaking tube they had grown up in the belief that only through electronics could the voice be sent across space this antique revival was as much a novelty to them as a telephone would have been to an ancient greek this is chief engineer lawrence speaking can you hear me pat cupped his hands over the opening and answered slowly hearing you loud and clear how do you receive us very clear are you all right yeswhats happened youve dropped a couple of metersno more than that we hardly noticed anything up here until the pipes came adrift hows your air still goodbut the sooner you start supplying us the better dont worry well be pumping again as soon as we get the dust out of the filters and can rush out another drill head from port roris the one youve just unscrewed was the only spare it was lucky we had that so it will be at least an hour pat told himself before their air supply could be secured again that however was not the problem that now worried him he knew how lawrence had hoped to reach them and he realized that the plan would not work now that selene was no longer on an even keel how are you going to get at us he asked bluntly there was only the briefest of hesitations before lawrence answered ive not worked out the details but well add another sec tion to the caisson and continue it down until it reaches you then well start scooping out the dust until we get to the bottom that will take us to within a few centimeters of you well cross that gap somehow but theres one thing i want you to do first whats that im ninety per cent sure that you wont settle againbut if youre going to id rather you did it now i want you all to jump up and down together for a couple of minutes will that be safe asked pat doubtfully suppose this pipe tears out again then you can plug it again another small hole wont matterbut another subsidence will if it happens when were trying to make a mansized opening in the roof selene had seen some strange sights but this was undoubtedly the strangest twentytwo men and women were solemnly jumping up and down in unison rising to the ceiling and then pushing themselves back as vigorously as possible to the floor all the while pat kept a careful watch on that pipe leading to the upper world after a minutes strenuous exertion on the part of her passengers selene had moved downward by less than two centimeters he reported this to lawrence who received the news with thankfulness now that he was reasonably sure that selene would not shift again he was confident that he could get these people out exactly how he was not yet certain but the plan was beginning to form in his mind it took shape over the next twelve hours in conferences with his brains trust and experiments on the sea of thirst the engineering division had learned more about the dust in the last week than during the whole of its previous existence it was no longer fighting in the dark against a largely unknown opponent it understood which liberties could be taken and which could not despite the speed with which the changed plans were drawn up and the necessary hardware constructed there was no undue haste and certainly no carelessness for this was another operation that had to work the first time if it failed then at the very least the caisson would have to be abandoned and a new one sunk and at the worstthose aboard selene would be drowned in dust its a pretty problem said tom lawson who liked pretty problemsand not much else the lower end of the caissons wide open to the dust because its resting against selene at only one point and the tilt of the roof prevents it from sealing before we can pump out the dust we have to close that gap did i say pump that was a mistake you cant pump the stuff it has to be lifted and if we tried that as things are now it would flow in just as fast at the bottom of the tube as we took it out of the top tom paused and grinned sardonically at his multimillion audience as if challenging it to solve the problem he had outlined he let his viewers stew in their own thoughts for a while then picked up the model lying on the studio table though it was an extremely simple one he was rather proud of it for he had made it himself no one could have guessed from the other side of the camera that it was only cardboard sprayed with aluminum paint this tube he said represents a short section of the caisson thats now leading down to seleneand which as i said is full of dust now this with his other hand he picked up a stubby cylinder closed at one endfits snugly inside the caisson like a piston its very heavy and will try to sink under its own weight but it cant do so of course while the dust is trapped underneath it tom turned the piston until its flat end was toward the camera he pressed his forefinger against the center of the circular face and a small trap door opened this acts as a valve when its open dust can flow through and the piston can sink down the shaft as soon as it reaches the bottom the valve will be closed by a signal from above that will seal off the caisson and we can start scooping out the dust it sounds very simple doesnt it well its not there are about fifty problems i havent mentioned for example as the caisson is emptied it will try to float up to the surface with a lift of a good many tons chief engineer lawrence has worked out an ingenious system of anchors to hold it down youll realize of course that even when this tube has been emptied of dust there will still be that wedgeshaped gap between its lower end and selenes roof how mister lawrence proposes to deal with that i dont know and please dont send me any more suggestions weve already had enough halfbaked ideas on this program to last a lifetime thispiston gadgetisnt just theory the engineers here have built and tested it during the last twelve hours and its now in action if i can make any sense of the signals the mans waving at me i think were now going over to the sea of thirst to find out whats happening on the raft the temporary studio in the hotel roris faded from a million screens in its place was the picture that by this time must have been familiar to most of the human race there were now three igloos of assorted sizes on or around the raft as the sunlight glinted from their reflecting outer surfaces they looked like giant drops of mercury one of the dustskis was parked beside the largest dome the other two were in transit still shuttling supplies from port roris like the mouth of a well the caisson projected from the sea its rim was only twenty centimeters above the dust and the opening seemed much too narrow for a man to enter it would indeed have been a very tight fit for anyone wearing a space suitbut the crucial part of this operation would be done without suits at regular intervals a cylindrical grab was disappearing into the well to be hauled back to the surface a few seconds later by a small but powerful crane on each withdrawal the grab would be swung clear of the opening and would disgorge its contents back into the sea for an instant a gray dunces cap of dust would stand in momentary balance on the level plain then it would collapse in slow motion vanishing completely before the next load had emerged from the shaft it was a conjuring trick being carried out in broad daylight and it was fascinating to watch more effectively than a thousand words of description it told the viewers all that they needed to know about the sea of thirst the grab was taking longer on its journeys now as it plunged deeper into the dust and at last there came the moment when it emerged only half full and the way to selene was open except for that roadblock at the end chapter were still in very good spirits said pat into the microphone that had now been lowered down the air shaft of course we had a bad shock after that second cavein when we lost contact with youbut now were sure youll soon have us out we can hear the grab at work as it scoops up the dust and its wonderful to know that help is so close well never forget he added a little awkwardly the efforts that so many people have made to help us and whatever happens wed like to thank them all of us are quite sure that everything possible has been done and now ill hand over the mike since several of us have messages we want to send with any luck at all this will be the last broadcast from selene as he gave the microphone to mrs williams he realized that he might have phrased that last remark a little better it could be interpreted in two ways but now that rescue was so close at hand he refused to admit the possibility of further setbacks they had been through so much that surely nothing more would happen to them now yet he knew that the final stage of the operation would be the most difficult and the most critical of all they had discussed it endlessly during the last few hours ever since chief engineer lawrence had explained his plans to them there was little else to talk about now that by common consent the subject of flying saucers was vetoed they could have continued with the book readings but somehow both shane and the orange and the apple had lost their appeal no one could concentrate on anything now except the prospects of rescue and the renewal of life that lay before them when they had rejoined the human race from overhead there was a sudden heavy thump that could mean only one thing the grab had reached the bottom of the shaft and the caisson was clear of dust now it could be coupled to one of the igloos and pumped full of air it took more than an hour to complete the connection and make all the necessary tests the specially modified mark xix igloo with a hole in its floor just large enough to accommodate the protruding end of the caisson had to be positioned and inflated with the utmost care the lives of selenes passengers and also those of the men attempting to rescue them might depend upon this air seal not until chief engineer lawrence was thoroughly satisfied did he strip off his space suit and approach that yawning hole he held a floodlight above the opening and looked down into the shaft which seemed to dwindle away to infinity yet it was just seventeen meters to the bottom even in this low gravity an object would take only five seconds to fall that distance lawrence turned to his assistants each was wearing a space suit but with the face plate open if anything went wrong those plates could be snapped shut in a fraction of a second and the men inside would probably be safe but for lawrence there would be no hope at allnor for the twentytwo aboard selene you know exactly what to do he said if i want to come up in a hurry all of you pull on the rope ladder together any questions there were none everything had been thoroughly rehearsed with a nod to his men and a chorus of good lucks in return lawrence lowered himself into the shaft he let himself fall most of the way checking his speed from time to time by grabbing at the ladder on the moon it was quite safe to do this well almost safe lawrence had seen men killed because they had forgotten that even this gravity field could accelerate one to a lethal speed in less than ten seconds this was like alices fall into wonderland but there was nothing to see on the way down except the blank concrete wall so close that lawrence had to squint to focus upon it and then with the slightest of bumps he had reached the bottom he squatted down on the little metal platform the size and shape of a manhole cover and examined it carefully the trapdoor valve that had been open during the pistons descent through the dust was leaking very slightly and a trickle of gray powder was creeping round the seal it was nothing to worry about but lawrence could not help wondering what would happen if the valve opened under the pressure from beneath how fast would the dust rise up the shaft like water in a well not as fast he was quite certain as he could go up that ladder beneath his feet now only centimeters away was the roof of the cruiser sloping down into the dust at that maddening thirty degrees his problem was to mate the horizontal end of the shaft with the sloping roof of the cruiserand to do it so well that the coupling would be dusttight he could see no flaw in the plan nor did he expect to for it had been devised by the best engineering brains on earth and moon it even allowed for the possibility that selene might shift again by a few centimeters while he was working here but theory was one thingand as he knew all too well practice was another there were six large thumbscrews spaced around the circumference of the metal disc on which lawrence was sitting and he started to turn them one by one like a drummer tuning his instrument connected to the lower side of the platform was a short piece of concertinalike tubing almost as wide as the caisson and now folded flat it formed a flexible coupling large enough for a man to crawl through and was now slowly opening as lawrence turned the screws one side of the corrugated tube had to stretch through forty centimeters to reach the sloping roof the other had to move scarcely at all lawrences chief worry had been that the resistance of the dust would prevent the concertina from opening but the screws were easily overcoming the pressure now none of them could be tightened any further the lower end of the coupling must be flush against selenes roof and sealed to it he hoped by the rubber gasket around its rim how tight that seal was he would very soon know automatically checking his escape route lawrence glanced up the shaft he could see nothing past the glare of the floodlight hanging two meters above his head but the rope ladder stretching past it was extremely reassuring ive let down the connector he shouted to his invisible colleagues it seems to be flush against the roof now im going to open the valve any mistake now and the whole shaft would be flooded perhaps beyond possibility of further use slowly and gently lawrence released the trap door which had allowed the dust to pass through the piston while it was descending there was no sudden upwelling the corrugated tube beneath his feet was holding back the sea lawrence reached through the valveand his fingers felt the roof of selene still invisible beneath the dust but now only a handsbreath away few achievements in all his life had ever given him such a sense of satisfaction the job was still far from finishedbut he had reached the cruiser for a moment he crouched in his little pit feeling as some oldtime miner must have when the first nugget of gold gleamed in the lamplight he banged three times on the roof immediately his signal was returned there was no point in striking up a morse conversation for if he wished he could talk directly through the microphone circuit but he knew the psychological effect that his tapping would have it would prove to the men and women in selene that rescue was now only centimeters away yet there were still major obstacles to be demolished and the next one was the manhole cover on which he was sitting the face of the piston itself it had served its purpose holding back the dust while the caisson was being emptied but now it had to be removed before anyone could escape from selene this had to be done however without disturbing the flexible coupling that it had helped to place in position to make this possible the circular face of the piston had been built so that it could be lifted out like a saucepan lid when eight large bolts were unscrewed it took lawrence only a few minutes to deal with these and to attach a rope to the new loose metal disc then he shouted haul away a fatter man would have had to climb the shaft while the circular lid came up after him but lawrence was able to squeeze against the wall while the metal plate moving edgeways was hoisted past him there goes the last line of dofense he told himself as the disc vanished overhead now it would be impossible to seal the shaft again if the coupling failed and the dust started to pour in bucket he shouted it was already on its way down forty years ago thought lawrence i was playing on a california beach with bucket and spade making castles in the sand now here i am on the moonchief engineer earthside no lessshoveling in even deadlier earnest with the whole human race looking over my shoulder when the first load was hoisted up he had exposed a considerable area of selenes roof the volume of dust trapped inside the couplingtube was quite small and two more bucketfuls disposed of it before him now was the aluminized fabric of the sun shield which had long ago crumpled under the pressure lawrence cut it away without difficultyit was so fragile that he could tear it with his bare handsand exposed the slightly roughened fiberglas of the outer hull to cut through that with a small power saw would be easy it would also be fatal for by this time selenes double hull had lost its integrity when the roof had been damaged the dust would have flooded into the space between the two walls it would be waiting there under pressure to come spurting out as soon as he made his first incision before he could enter selene that thin but deadly layer of dust would have to be immobilized lawrence rapped briskly against the roof as he had expected the sound was muffled by the dust what he did not expect was to receive an urgent frantic tattoo in reply this he could tell at once was no reassuring im ok signal from inside the cruiser even before the men overhead could relay the news to him lawrence had guessed that the sea of thirst was making one final bid to keep its prey because karl johanson was a nucleonics engineer had a sensitive nose and happened to be sitting at the rear of the bus he was the one who spotted the approach of disaster he remained quite still for a few seconds nostrils twitching then said excuse me to his companion in the aisle seat and strolled quietly to the washroom he did not wish to cause alarm if there was no need especially when rescue seemed so near but in his professional lifetime he had learned through more examples than he cared to remember never to ignore the smell of burning insulation he was in the washroom for less than fifteen seconds when he emerged he was walking quickly but not quickly enough to cause panic he went straight to pat harris who was deep in conversation with commodore hansteen and interrupted them without ceremony captain he said in a low urgent voice were on fire go and check in the toilet ive not told anyone else in a second pat was gone and hansteen with him in space as on the sea no one stopped to argue when he heard the word fire and johanson was not the sort of man to raise a false alarm like pat he was a lunar administration tech and had been one of those whom the commodore had selected for his riot squad the toilet was typical of that on any small vehicle of land sea air or space one could touch every wall without changing position but the rear wall immediately above the washbowl could no longer be touched at all the fiberglas was blistered with heat and was buckling and bulging even while the horrified spectators looked at it my god said the commodore that will be through in a minute whats causing it but pat had already gone he was back a few seconds later carrying the cabins two small fire extinguishers under his arms commodore he said go and report to the raft tell them we may only have a few minutes ill stay here in case it breaks through hansteen did as he was told a moment later pat heard his voice calling the message into the microphone and the sudden turmoil among the passengers that followed almost immediately the door opened again and he was joined by mckenzie can i help asked the scientist i dont think so pat answered holding the extinguisher at the ready he felt a curious numbness as if this was not really happening to him but was all a dream from which he would soon awaken perhaps by now he had passed beyond fear having surmounted one crisis after another all emotion had been wrung out of him he could still endure but he could no longer react whats causing it asked mckenzie echoing the commodores unanswered question and immediately following it with another whats behind this bulkhead our main power supply twenty heavyduty cells how much energy in them well we started with five thousand kilowatthours we probably still have half of it theres your answer somethings shorting out our power supply its probably been burning up ever since the overhead wiring got ripped out the explanation made sense if only because there was no other source of energy aboard the cruiser she was completely fireproof so could not support an ordinary combustion but there was enough electrical energy in her power cells to drive her at full speed for hours on end and if this dissipated itself in raw heat the results would be catastrophic yet this was impossible such an overload would have tripped the circuit breakers at onceunless for some reason they had jammed they had not as mckenzie reported after a quick check in the air lock all the breakers have jumped he said the circuits are as dead as mutton i dont understand it even in this moment of peril pat could hardly refrain from smiling mckenzie was the eternal scientist he might be about to die but he would insist on knowing how if he was being burned at the stakeand a similar fate might well be in storehe would ask his executioners what kind of wood are you using the folding door creased inward as hansteen came back to report lawrence says hell be through in ten minutes he said will that wall hold until then god knows answered pat it may last for another hourit may go in the next five seconds depends how the fires spreading arent there automatic firefighting appliances in that cornpartment theres no point in having themthis is our pressure bulkhead and theres normally vacuum on the other side thats the best fire fighter you can get thats it exclaimed mckenzie dont you see the whole compartments flooded when the roof tore the dust started to work its way in its shorting all the electrical equipment pat knew without further discussion that mckenzie was right by now all the sections normally open to space must be packed with dust it would have poured in through the broken roof flowed along the gap between the double hull slowly accumulated around the open bus bars in the power compartment and then the pyrotechnics would have started there was enough meteoric iron in the dust to make it a good conductor it would be arcing and shorting in there like a thousand electric fires if we sprinkled water on that wall said the commodore would it help mattersor would it crack the fiberglas i think we should try it answered mckenzie but very carefullynot too much at a time he filled a plastic cup the water was already hotand looked enquiringly at the others since there were no objections he began to splash a few drops on the slowly blistering surface the cracklings and poppings that resulted were so terrifying that he stopped at once it was too big a risk with a metal wall it would have been a good idea but this nonconducting plastic would shatter under the thermal stresses theres nothing we can do in here said the commodore even those extinguishers wont help much wed better get out and block off this whole compartment the door will act as a fire wall and give us some extra time pat hesitated the heat was already almost unbearable but it seemed cowardice to leave yet hansteens suggestion made excellent sense if he stayed here until the fire broke through he would probably be gassed at once by the fumes rightlets get out he agreed well see what kind of barricade we can build behind this door he did not think they would have much time to do it already he could hear quite distinctly a frying blistering sound from the wall that was holding the inferno at bay chapter the news that selene was on fire made no difference at all to lawrences actions he could not move any faster than he was doing now if he attempted it he might make a mistake just when the trickiest part of the entire job was coming up all he could do was to forge ahead and hope that he would beat the flames the apparatus now being lowered down the shaft looked like an overgrown grease gun or a giant version of those syringes used to put icing on wedding cakes this one held neither grease nor icing but an organic silicon compound under great pressure at the moment it was liquid it would not remain so for long lawrences first problem was to get the liquid between the double hull without letting the dust escape using a small rivet gun he fired seven hollow bolts into selenes outer skinone in the center of the exposed circle the other six evenly spaced around its circumference he connected the syringe to the center bolt and pressed the trigger there was a slight hiss as the fluid rushed through the hollow bolt its pressure opening a tiny valve in the bulletshaped nose working very swiftly lawrence moved from bolt to bolt shooting equal charges of fluid through each now the stuff would have spread out almost evenly between the two hulls in a ragged pancake more than a meter across nonot a pancakea souffle for it would have started to foam as soon as it escaped from the nozzle and a few seconds later it would have started to set under the influence of the catalyst injected with it lawrence looked at his watch in five minutes that foam would be rockhard though as porous as pumicewhich indeed it would very closely resemble there would be no chance of more dust entering this section of the hull what was already there was frozen in place there was nothing he could do to shorten that five minutes the whole plan depended upon the foam setting to a known consistency if his timing and positioning had been faulty or the chemists back at base had made an error the people aboard selene were already as good as dead he used the waiting period to tidy up the shaft sending all the equipment back to the surface soon only lawrence himself was left at the bottom with no tools at all but his bare hands if maurice spenser could have smuggled his camera into this narrow spaceand he would have signed any reasonable contract with the devil to have done sohis viewers would have been quite unable to guess lawrences next move they would have been still more baffled when what looked like a childs hoop was slowly lowered down the shaft but this was no nursery toy it was the key that would open selene sue had already marshaled the passengers to the frontand now much higherend of the cabin they were all standing there in a tightly packed group looking anxiously at the ceiling and straining their ears for every encouraging sound encouragement thought pat was what they needed now and he needed it more than any of them for he alone knew unless hansteen or mckenzie had guessed itthe real magnitude of the danger they were facing the fire was bad enough and could kill them if it broke through into the cabin but it was slowmoving and they could fight it even if only for a while against explosion however they could do nothing for selene was a bomb and the fuse was already lit the storedup energy in the power cells that drove her motors and all her electrical devices could escape as raw heat but it could not detonate that was not true unfortunately of the liquidoxygen tanks they must still hold many liters of the fearfully cold violently reactive element when the mounting heat ruptured those tanks there would be both a physical and a chemical explosion a small one it was trueperhaps equivalent to a hundred kilograms of tnt but that would be quite enough to smash selene to pieces pat saw no point in mentioning this to hansteen who was already planning his barricade seats were being unscrewed from the rows near the front of the cabin and jammed between the rear row and the toilet door it looked as if the commodore was preparing for an invasion rather than a fire as indeed he was the fire itself because of its nature might not spread beyond the powercell compartment but as soon as that cracked and blistered wall finally gave way the dust would come flooding through commodore said pat while youre doing this ill start organizing the passengers we cant have twenty people trying to get out at once that was a nightmare prospect that had to be avoided at all costs yet it would be hard to avoid paniceven in this welldisciplined communityif a single narrow tunnel was the only means of escape from a rapidly approaching death pat walked to the front of the cabin on earth that would have been a steep uphill climb but here a thirtydegree slope was barely noticeable he looked at the anxious faces ranged in front of him and said were going to be out of here very soon when the ceiling opens a rope ladder will be dropped down the ladies will go first then the menall in alphabetical order dont bother to use your feet remember how little you weigh here and go up hand over hand as quickly as you can but dont crowd the person in front you should have plenty of time and it will take you only a few seconds to reach the top sue please sort everyone out in the right order harding bryan johanson barrettid like you to stand by as you did before we may need your help he did not finish the sentence there was a kind of soft muffled explosion from the rear of the cabinnothing spectacular the popping of a paper bag would have made more noise but it meant that the wall was downwhile the ceiling unfortunately was still intact on the other side of the roof lawrence laid his hoop flat against the fiberglas and started to fix it in position with quickdrying cement the ring was almost as wide as the little well in which he was crouching it came to within a few centimeters of the corrugated walls though it was perfectly safe to handle he treated it with exaggerated care he had never acquired that easy familiarity with explosives that characterizes those who have to live with them the ring charge he was tamping in place was a perfectly conventional specimen of the art involving no technical problems it would make a neat clean out of exactly the desired width and thickness doing in a thousandth of a second a job that would have taken a quarter of an hour with a power saw that was what lawrence had first intended to use now he was very glad that he had changed his mind it seemed most unlikely that he would have a quarter of an hour how true that was he learned while he was still waiting for the foam to set the fires through into the cabin yelled a voice from overhead lawrence looked at his watch for a moment it seemed as if the second hand was motionless but that was an illusion he had experienced all his life the watch had not stopped it was merely that time as usual was not going at the speed he wished until this moment it had been passing too swiftly now of course it was crawling on leaden feet the foam should be rockhard in another thirty seconds far better to leave it a little longer than to risk shooting too soon while it was still plastic he started to climb the rope ladder without haste trailing the thin detonating wires behind him his timing was perfect when he had emerged from the shaft uncrimped the short circuit he had put for the sake of safety at the end of the wires and connected them to the exploder there were just ten seconds to go tell them were starting to count down from ten he said as pat raced downhill to help the commodorethough just what he could do now he had very little ideahe heard sue calling in an unhurried voice miss morley mrs schuster mrs williams how ironic it was that miss morley would once again be the first this time by virtue of alphabetical accident she could hardly grumble about the treatment she was getting now and then a second and much grimmer thought flashed through pats mind suppose mrs schuster got stuck in the tunnel and blocked the exit well they could hardly leave her until last no shed go up all right she had been a deciding factor in the tubes design and since then she had lost several kilos at first glance the outer door of the toilet still seemed to be holding indeed the only sign that anything had happened was a slight wisp of smoke curling past the hinges for a moment pat felt a surge of relief why it might take the fire half an hour to burn through the double thickness of fiberglas and long before that something was tickling his bare feet he had moved automatically aside before his conscious mind said whats that he looked down though his eyes were now accustomed to the dim emergency lighting it was some time before he realized that a ghostly gray tide was pouring beneath that barricaded doorand that the panels were already bulging inward under the pressure of tons of dust it could be only a matter of minutes before they collapsed even if they held it might make little difference that silent sinister tide had risen above his ankles even while he was standing here pat did not attempt to move or to speak to the commodore who was standing equally motionless a few centimeters away for the first time in his lifeand now it might well be for the lasthe felt an emotion of sheer overwhelming hate in that moment as its million dry and delicate feelers brushed against his bare legs it seemed to pat that the sea of thirst was a conscious malignant entity that had been playing with them like a cat with a mouse every time he told himself we thought we were getting the situation under control it was preparing a new surprise we were always one move behind and now it is tired of its little game we no longer amuse it perhaps radley was right after all the loudspeaker dangling from the air pipe roused him from his fatalistic reverie were ready it shouted crowd at the end of the bus and cover your faces ill count down from ten ten were already at the end of the bus thought pat we dont need all that time we may not even have it nine ill bet it doesnt work anyway the sea wont let it if it thinks we have a chance of getting out eight a pity though after all this effort a lot of people have half killed themselves trying to help us they deserved better luck seven thats supposed to be a lucky number isnt it perhaps we may make it after all some of us six lets pretend it wont do much harm now suppose it takesoh fifteen seconds to get through five and of course to let down the ladder again they probably rolled that up for safety four and assuming that someone goes out every three seconds no lets make it five to be on the safe side three that will be twentytwo times five which is one thousand andno thats ridiculous ive forgotten how to do simple arithmetic two say one hundred and something seconds which must be the best part of two minutes and thats still plenty of time for those lox tanks to blow us all to kingdom come one one and i havent even covered my face maybe i should lie down even if i have to swallow this filthy stinking dust there was a sudden sharp crack and a brief puff of air that was all it was disappointingly anticlimactic but the explosives experts had known their job as is highly desirable that explosives experts should the energy of the charge had been precisely calculated and focused there was barely enough left over to ripple the dust that now covered almost half the floor space of the cabin time seemed to be frozen for an age nothing happened then there was a slow and beautiful miracle breathtaking because it was so unexpected yet so obvious if one had stopped to think about it a ring of brilliant white light appeared among the crimson shadows of the ceiling it grew steadily thicker and brighter then quite suddenly expanded into a complete and perfect circle as the section of the roof fell away the light pouring down was only that of a single glow tube twenty meters above but to eyes that had seen nothing but dim redness for hours it was more glorious than any sunrise the ladder came through almost as soon as the circle of roofing hit the floor miss morley poised like a sprinter was gone in a flash when mrs schuster followeda little more slowly but still at a speed of which no one could complainit was like an eclipse only a few stray beams of light now filtered down that radiant road to safety it was dark again as if after that brief glimpse of dawn the night had returned with redoubled gloom now the men were starting to gobaldur first probably blessing his position in the alphabet there were only a dozen left in the cabin when the barricaded door finally ripped from its hinges and the pentup avalanche burst forth the first wave of dust caught pat while he was halfway up the slope of the cabin light and impalpable though it was it slowed his movements until it seemed that he was struggling to wade through glue it was fortunate that the moist and heavy air had robbed it of some of its power for otherwise it would have filled the cabin with choking clouds pat sneezed and coughed and was partly blinded but he could still breathe in the foggy gloom he could hear sue countingfifteen sixteen seventeen eighteen nineteen as she marshaled the passengers to safety he had intended her to go with the other women but she was still down here shepherding her charges even as he struggled against the cloying quicksand that had now risen almost to his waist he felt for sue a love so great that it seemed to burst his heart now he had no possible doubt real love was a perfect balance of desire and tenderness the first had been there for a long time and now the second had come in full measure twentythats you commodorequickly like hell it is sue said the commodore up you go pat could not see what happenedhe was still partly blinded by the dust and the darknessbut he guessed that hansteen must have literally thrown sue through the roof neither his age nor his years in space had yet robbed him of his earthborn strength are you there pat he called im on the ladder dont wait for meim coming that was easier said than done it felt as if a million soft yet determined fingers were clutching at him pulling him back into the rising flood he gripped one of the seatbacksnow almost hidden beneath the dustand pulled himself toward the beckoning light something whipped against his face instinctively he reached out to push it aside then realized that it was the end of the rope ladder he hauled upon it with all his might and slowly reluctantly the sea of thirst relaxed its grip upon him before he entered the shaft he had one last glimpse of the cabin the whole of the rear was now submerged by that crawling tide of gray it seemed unnatural and doubly sinister that it rose in such a geometrically perfect plane without a single ripple to furrow its surface a meter awaythis was something pat knew he would remember all his life though he could not imagine whya solitary paper cup was floating sedately on the rising tide like a toy boat upon a peaceful lake in a few minutes it would reach the ceiling and be overwhelmed but for the moment it was still bravely defying the dust and so were the emergency lights they would continue to burn for days even when each one was encapsulated in utter darkness now the dimlit shaft was around him he was climbing as quickly as his muscles would permit but he could not overtake the commodore there was a sudden flood of light from above as hansteen cleared the mouth of the shaft and involuntarily pat looked downward to protect his eyes from the glare the dust was already rising swiftly behind him still unrippled still smooth and placidand inexorable then he was straddling the low mouth of the caisson in the center of a fantastically overcrowded igloo all around him in various stages of exhaustion and dishevelment were his fellow passengers helping them were four spacesuited figures and one man without a suit whom he assumed was chief engineer lawrence how strange it was to see a new face after all these days is everyone out lawrence asked anxiously yes said pat im the last man then he added i hope for he realized that in the darkness and confusion someone might have been left behind suppose radley had decided not to face the music back in new zealand nohe was here with the rest of them pat was just starting to do a count of heads when the plastic floor gave a sudden jumpand out of the open well shot a perfect smoke ring of dust it hit the ceiling rebounded and disintegrated before anyone could move what the devil was that said lawrence our lox tank answered pat good old busshe lasted just long enough and then to his helpless horror the skipper of selene burst into tears chapter i still dont think those flags are a good idea said pat as the cruiser pulled away from port roris they look so phony when you know theyre in vacuum yet he had to admit that the illusion was excellent for the lines of pennants draped around the embarkation building were stirring and fluttering in a nonexistent breeze it was all done by springs and electric motors and would be very confusing to the viewers back on earth this was a big day for port rons and indeed for the whole moon he wished that sue could be here but she was hardly in proper shape for the trip very literally as she had remarked when he kissed her goodby that morning i dont see how women could ever have had babies on earth fancy carrying all this weight around in six times our gravity pat turned his mind away from his impending family and pushed selene ii up to full speed from the cabin behind him came the ohs and ahs of the thirtytwo passengers as the gray parabolas of dust soared against the sun like monochrome rainbows this maiden voyage was in daylight the travelers would miss the seas magical phosphorescence the night ride up the canyon to crater lake the green glories of the motionless earth but the novelty and excitement of the journey were the main attractions thanks to her illfated predecessor selene ii was one of the bestknown vehicles in the solar system it was proof of the old saying that there is no such thing as bad publicity now that the advance bookings were coming in the tourist commissioner was very glad that he had taken his courage in both hands and insisted on more passenger space at first he had had to fight to get a new selene at all once bitten twice shy the chief administrator had said and had capitulated only when father ferraro and the geophysics division had proved beyond reasonable doubt that the sea would not stir again for another million years hold her on that course said pat to his copilot ill go back and talk to the customers he was still young enough and vain enough to savor the admiring glances as he walked back into the passenger cabin everyone aboard would have read of him or seen him on tv in fact the very presence of these people here was an implicit vote of confidence pat knew well enough that others shared the credit but he had no false modesty about the role he had played during the last hours of selene i his most valued possession was the little golden model of the cruiser that had been a wedding present to mr and mrs harris from all on the last voyage in sincere appreciation that was the only testimonial that counted and he desired no other he had walked halfway down the cabin exchanging a few words with a passenger here and there when he suddenly stopped dead in his tracks hello captain said an unforgotten voice you seem surprised to see me pat made a quick recovery and flashed his most dazzling official smile its certainly an unexpected pleasure miss morley i had no idea you were on the moon its rather a surprise to me i owe it to the story i wrote about selene i im covering this trip for life interplanetary i only hope said pat that it will be a little less exciting than last time by the way are you in touch with any of the others doctor mckenzie and the schusters wrote a few weeks ago but ive often wondered what happened to poor little radley after harding marched him off nothingexcept that he lost his job universal travel cards decided that if they prosecuted everyone would sympathize with radley and it would also give other people the same idea he makes a living i believe lecturing to his fellow cultists about what i found on the moon and ill make you a prediction captain harris whats that some day hell get back to the moon i rather hope he does i never did discover just what he expected to find in the mare crisium they both laughed then miss morley said i hear youre giving up this job pat looked slightly embarrassed thats true he admitted im transferring to the space service if i can pass the tests he was by no means sure that he could yet he knew that he had to make the effort driving a moon bus had been an interesting and enjoyable job but it was also a dead endas both sue and the commodore had now convinced him and there was another reason he had often wondered how many other lives had been changed or diverted when the sea of thirst had yawned beneath the stars no one who had been aboard selene i could fail to be marked by the experience in most cases for the better the fact that he was now having this friendly talk with miss morley was sufficient proof of that it must also have had a profound effect on the men who had been involved in the rescue effortespecially doctor lawson and chief engineer lawrence pat had seen lawson many times giving his irascible tv talks on scientific subjects he was grateful to the astronomer but found it impossible to like him it seemed however that some millions of people did as for lawrence he was hard at work on his memoirs provisionally entitled a man about the moonand wishing to god hed never signed the contract pat had already helped him on the selene chapters and sue was reading the typescript while waiting for the baby if youll excuse me said pat remembering his duties as skipper i must attend to the other passengers but please look us up next time youre in clavius city i will promised miss morley slightly taken aback but obviously somewhat pleased pat continued his progress to the rear of the cabin exchanging a greeting here answering a question there then he reached the airlock galley and closed the door behind him and was instantly alone there was more room here than in selene is little air lock but the basic design was the same no wonder that memories came flooding back that might have been the space suit whose oxygen he and mckenzie had shared while all the rest were sleeping that could have been the wall against which he had pressed his ear and heard in the night the whisper of the ascending dust and this whole chamber indeed could have been where he had first known sue in the literal and biblical sense there was one innovation in this new modelthe small window in the outer door he pressed his face against it and stared across the speeding surface of the sea he was on the shadowed side of the cruiser looking away from the sun into the dark night of space and presently as his vision adjusted itself to that darkness he could see the stars only the brighter ones for there was enough stray light to desensitize his eyes but there they wereand there also was jupiter most brilliant of all the planets next to venus soon he would be out there far from his native world the thought exhilarated and terrified him but he knew he had to go he loved the moon but it had tried to kill him never again could he be wholly at ease out upon its open surface though deep space was still more hostile and unforgiving as yet it had not declared war upon him with his own world from now on there could never be more than an armed neutrality the door of the cabin opened and the stewardess entered with a tray of empty cups pat turned away from the window and from the stars the next time he saw them they would be a million times brighter he smiled at the neatly uniformed girl and waved his hand around the little galley this is all yours miss johnson he said look after it well then he walked back to the controls to take selene ii on his last voyage and her maiden one across the sea of thirst
