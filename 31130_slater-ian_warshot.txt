ian slater warshot chapter one demilitarized zone eastern siberia the three figures dropped softly catlike from the chopper roaring above them its rotors a blur against the winter moon their progress in the deep snow was unhurried displaying an economy of movement yet singular purpose their sixtypound packs and twometer skis lowered the women pulled down their night vision goggles clicked on the long skis and using herringbone steps began to climb the ridge from the depression the chopper had used for cover the baskets at the end of their poles disappeared six inches into fresh powder before biting into the last snowfall that had crusted under the impact of wind and sun across the vast taiga at the ridges summit a black moonlit wilderness of pine beech and fir stretched in every direction the air no longer polluted by the oily stench of the choppers exhaust but pure and smelling of that hard cold purity that all skiers love the three women in their thirties were olympic standard biathletes in top shape they were as adept at firing the highvelocity rifles dead on target as they were skiing the womens ninemile or the mens twelvemile crosscountry course each of them having practiced endlessly on the les saisles course at albertville and on others before the war each womans body was so wellconditioned that she could drop her rapid biathlon heartbeat to per minute while firing on the range in the prone position and to no more than on the crosscountry trails they skied down from the ridge in single file and it wasnt until a minute later that the leader found it necessary to start double poling her body in the white skintight fourwaystretch lycranylon suit moving as if one with the white skis and poles as well as having to be beautiful in top physical condition and willing to volunteer for the threeday seventymile crossing of the ceasefires nomans land all three had been required to submit to a medical examination to ascertain whether any of them were having or would have their period during the crossing menstruation would almost certainly be a lure to any tracking dogs that might be accompanying patrols sent out along the enemys edge of the fourhundredmilelong seventymilewide dmz the merest whiff of blood they knew could be picked up for miles by the animals and would pose a risk to the entire mission normally this wouldnt be a problem you could simply kill a dog with a single shot from the with noise suppressor so as not to attract any further attention but on this mission they carried no weapons at least none like a rifle or pistol which would be a sure giveaway only the twoapiece razorsharp ice pick daggers whose grips were the normal plastic rubberized and fingercontoured handles of the ski poles these could be extracted quickly with one pull from the pole screw threads being decided against because even a drop of moisture on a thread could freeze and make extraction harder anyway it would take longer to unscrew rather than pull them the rubbernylex pole handles simply slipped out and back into the pole in a firm friction grip the hairline of the join obscured by the poles rubberized handle which extended an inch farther down the pole than the join three skiers meant six daggers in all each tipped with ricin pellets the castor oil derivative took only seconds to work as the needlesharp point upon being thrust forward would break the ricin capsule teardropped at its end like a solidified saffron drop of canada balsam coating the tip with the poison even as it punctured the ricin and the victims skin simultaneously the poison causing a total collapse of the victims central nervous system on flat terrain now the three were moving in unison in legkick polepush strokes then with an incline up the other side of a frozen stream approaching them the leader moved from classic stroking to the freer skating slide poles starting together then one leg pushing the ski sideways using the other to glide then alternating someone back at hq had argued that while it was obvious they couldnt use a helicopter to cross the dmz in such clear weather without it being detected and shot down they should have at least used male commandos until it was pointed out by the duty officer that even the traditionbound british had conceded that now half their mi counterespionage agents were women better at observation saw things men didnt besides with three women there was a greater element of surprise the enemy wouldnt expect it once the three had crossed the dmz using darkness as cover theyd surely fit in much more quickly than three men after all what could be more natural than three goodlooking foreign correspondents all equipped with the necessary id vying craftily with one another to get a oneonone interview with the famous american general whose daring if unconventional exploits from iraq to siberia had surpassed even those of the legendary rommel and schwarzkopf and then all it needed was a second the needlethin steel out stab and back in the pole or if carried in separately should they have to leave the poles outside just as easily discarded behind a cabinet in a wastebasket anything nearby the wound so thin it would in effect be no more than a hatpindiameter stab to make sure of this having practiced with the optimum size needed to ensure depth without severe hemorrhaging they had followed the lead of the british who in the iraqi war had consulted an eminent edinburgh pathologist on the best shape and size of the bayonet required to kill with minimum effort there would be little if any blood and the symptoms such that the victims responses would more likely than not be interpreted as either heart attack or stroke and giving him mouthtomouth would make it look even better if aides rushed in to help the ceasefire might last but if it didnt get freeman and the battled be half won freeman was like patton unpredictable and brilliant indeed it had been someone at marshal yesovs hq at irkutsk who remembering that patton had represented the united states in the decathlon in the olympics thought of the idea of using the biathletes to get freeman if the ceasefire between siberias sixty divisions and americas twelve broke one of the best friends the americans had had before the ceasefire was a siberian alexsandra malof from the jao jewish autonomous oblast or region around khabarovsk whose underground movement had unearthed the secret of baikal in this fourhundredmilelong twentymilewide lake the deepest in the world and holding a fifth of all the freshwater on earth the siberians had hidden a flotilla of small diesel subs beneath the winter ice nosing up through the thinner patches of ice the toroidal goodyear man shaped minisubs had been able to launch a deadly missile offensive hundreds of miles eastward against the unsanctioned and outnumbered american force of ten divisions the american force under the command of general douglas freeman was charged with preventing any further annexation of territory in what had been the soviet far east now after escaping from the siberian jail in port baikal during the allied commando raid that had destroyed the sub base alexsandra malof was still on the run having headed south across the siberianchinese border then east to harbin the largest city in manchuria she was intent on getting back to the autonomous region in americanheld khabarovsk chapter two harbin manchuria now said latov sitting on the edge of the bed it was half command half plea as head of the new siberian republics consulate in harbin he was used to getting his own way particularly with refugees like this one desperately wanting the necessary travel documents so she could return to her home near khabarovsk no alexsandra told him taking his hand moving it sulkily away from the thighrevealing slit of her qi pao the green dress clinging sensuously to her you kept me waiting she said sensing that if she gave in too easily shed have nothing left to bargain with for a moment ilya latov didnt answer her he couldnt he was too excited she was still new to him three weeks ago he had seen her walking through zhaolin park by the river dressed in rags she was shivering her clothes liceridden her siberian fur boots tattered now the musky smell of her perfume which hed brought her enveloped him her lithe silksheathed body exciting him in a reverie of expectation despite the darkness of the room here in the consulate annex he could still see the outline of her breasts silhouetted clearly against the rimecovered window beneath all her outward sophistication the finery he had provided for her latov couldnt think of her as any more than a siberian peasant a jewish peasant at that and he was determined to get every kopeks worth out of her he tried again to slide his hand beneath the qi pao feeling the warmth of her thigh it made him feel young again ive been busy he said lamely his arousal making his voice dry and cracked she pushed his hand away again it was the only power she had but soon she knew she would have to yield if she was to get the papers she so desperately needed to get out of harbin to head north back to the jao near khabarovsk it was now thank god in control of the americans following their push of the siberians back as far as baikal before the ceasefire following the first undeclared war since iraq in latov moved closer to her he wanted her on top of him sitting on him rocking slowly back and forth side to side to watch her breasts sway above him until he couldnt stand it anymore he thought her by far the most beautiful woman hed seen in months or had he been away from siberia too long among the kosoglazythe slanteyed chinese who as far as he could remember had been siberias most hated enemy who were you busy with alexsandra asked moodily sitting up stiffly against the wall pulling her wrap tightly about her drawing her feet up like a petulant schoolgirl her black hair caught the glow of colored lights outside the siberian consulate overlooked zhaolin park where the chinese were having the annual ice lantern festival the consulate had been asked to douse its lights to heighten the effect the kaleidoscopic hues they could see through the frosted windows produced by the batteryfed light bulbs frozen inside the ice sculptures and from swinging lanterns at the edges of the park i saw you with her alexsandra challenged latov walking in the park this afternoon gospodi he said exasperatedly shes my wife what do you expect that i should alexsandra swung her legs over the edge of the bed reaching down for the heavy peasant fur boots shed worn all the way on her escape from lake baikal south then east across the mongolianchinese frontier and here to harbin latov reached out took her shoulders steadying her look if i refuse to go out with her it would look suspicious what do you expect will little ilya have to be home by eleven again he ignored her baiting tone in a way he liked it he would enjoy hurting her even more the chinese are giving one of their lunar new year parties he explained lamely his hands slipping about her pulling her around so that her back was to him he kissed her neck her hair shes gone out with friends alexsandra could smell his breath wine and stale cigar smoke wont you be missed he felt his erection getting harder what do you want first youre mad that im with her then if it wasnt for me youd still be wandering around in the park i want you to tell me the truth ilya i dont want anyone coming back catching us here youre a bigwig the new siberian consul who am i she turned suddenly to him a jewess a refugee forced south by the war what would happen to me she remembered all too vividly what had happened to her in the port baikal jail after she had been arrested in khabarovsk as being a member of the yevreyskie podpoliethe jewish underground and shipped west on the transsiberian had it not been for the allied commando attack on lake baikals southern township during which a shell had blown open a wall of the jail she and the other prisoners would never have escaped she would still be there having to endure more of the torture of the kind meted out by the omons the siberian ministry of interiors black berets some of them women who in true omon style had gleefully crippled several american pows by driving needlethin wire through their genitals it hadnt taken her long to realize that the omon thugs were no different from the kgb thugs who had raped her in the baikal jail that the new siberian secret police were no better than the old siberian kgb only the names had changed she wont come back early said latov reassuringly taking off his greatcoat the sag of his belly revealed as the white bulge of his tuxedo theyll all be too busy stuffing themselves with grilled bear paws and stewed moose nose the chinese are barbarians theyll eat anything cow tendons intestines she laughed they think youre the ones that are barbarians hed had enough of her teasing and suddenly released her walked away from the bed and sat in a chair he dragged over from the corner of the room come here he ordered pulling her close to him he felt her breasts pushing against him in the dark her nipples hard in the cold of this caretakers annex that he used for what he grandly called their rendezvous it was near freezing in the room the chinese didnt believe in heat and had it not been for the small japanese kerosene radiator in the room they would have frozen he knew that outside enjoying the lantern festival the chinese would be wandering contentedly up and down the park in the subzero temperatures licking ice cream the big revolution in dreary harbin one of the worstpolluted cities in manchuria being the advent of a new flavor strawberry an ideological victory over the traditional and trusted vanilla are you telling me the truth she asked softly yielding a little more to him theres no one besides your wife she almost said another man perhaps but that would be pushing him too far even so he uttered an oath under his breath none of which she heard clearly but nevertheless understood it meant what more do you want from me i told you he said sharply ive been busy the chinks are calling up more troops from the southern provinces sending them up over the nanking bridge to our border you must have seen them passing through i tell you its a logjam down there in nanking weve been trying to help them sort it out all their other crossings over the yangtze are flooded chinese have no idea of building approach roads or i dont care about chinese roads she said just so long as youre telling me the truth that theres no one else she pushed her thigh between his legs you promise i swear he said at once impatient and gratified that she was so jealous ive been busy with chink officials all day novosibirsk and beijing dont want any misunderstanding she knew what he meant the chinese and russians had fought sporadic but bitter battles for a hundred years over the amur river which the chinese called the black dragon the prize was the fertile river border areas around the northeasternmost corner of manchuria within the big hump formed by the river as it flowed eastward into the sea of okhotsk things had gotten so out of hand in the sixties that at one point soldiers of the chinese peoples liberation army had dropped their trousers and mooned the russians watching them across the river many on both sides had been killed during the resulting border clashes but why the sudden rapprochement between ancient enemies i just want you to spend more time with me she said conciliatory dropping now any suggestion that he might be fooling around with some other woman she took his hand and placed it beneath her qipao telling him flippantly that it was nice novosibirsk had kissed and made up with the chinese weve not made up ilya retorted angrily its convenient for novosibirsk and beijing to get on with one another just now why she asked giggling putting his hand inside her panties because he said gasping like a fish out of water if the ceasefire if it doesnt hold novosibirsk would want beijing an ally he was babbling now here let me do it she said unzipping the qi pao herself he was so clumsy you mean youve spent all night discussing that she said laughing openly at him the americans wont break the ceasefire he was angered by her laughter but too excited to chastise her she reached out in the darkness her hand unzipping him squeezing it tugging it toward her smelling it enough war talk she said softly i believe you so long as you werent with some slut he saw her shoulders visibly relax her whole body demeanor softer warmer now reaching frantically for his greatcoat draped behind him over the chair he got up tipping over the chair in his urgency flinging the coat onto the bed to take away the chill of the sheets then he lowered her to it im sorry ilya she said plaintively im so jealous sometimes ladno golubchik he said its all right my sweet its all she turned full on to him squeezing him harder moving its swollen tip in a fast gentle whipping motion up and down against the damp tightness of her panties he groaned with pleasure go on go on he pleaded no stop stop tease me she kissed the lobe of his ear bit it she hated him his sour breath now reeking with nicotine and sweat he smelled like the omon thugs and she felt a rush of panic she knew they wouldnt give up looking for her of all the prisoners who had escaped baikal she knew she had earned the omons special hatred as well as being instrumental in helping the americans to uncover the secret of the vast frozen lake the midget shiptosurfacearmed missile submarines that had almost turned the tide against the americans until the spectacular joint british sas american delta commando raid on baikal she and other jewish saboteurs from the jao had wrecked part of the transsiberian in trying to stop the military support trains heading east from novosibirsk the commandos had completely wrecked the sub base at baikal if ilya even suspected who she really was she knew shed be shot and most likely he too for having given her shelter from the omon bloodhounds albeit unknowingly she heard him grunting his body heavy suffocating his belly sliding in perspiration on hers his arms barely able to support his weight shaking she was still a prisoner in order to get the necessary travel papers she so desperately needed the very sex she was giving him as the price might well induce him to take his own good time issuing the papers why should he hurry he might even refuse just to keep her on tap he was covering her in wet kisses the cloying mixture of vodka and stale breath flooding over her his rutting rough and hard confident he was exciting her she sighed and gasped to maintain his illusion and to take her mind off the sheer horror of it wondered how she could possibly end the liaison shed started when she had determined to accidentally bump into him in zhaolin park and now she had more reason to get out of harbin to get north with the vital information of the massive chinese buildup that was streaming over the yangtze across the nanking bridge the american satellites wouldnt pick it up through harbins souplike pollution even if there was a satellite passing over harbin suddenly she had the answer alexsandra alex cried ilya i love you i seized by inspiration she pulled harder slipped her shawl between them to stop the sucking noise of his sweatslicked paunch slithering reptilelike against her and pulled him harder into her kissing him her nails digging hard into his back his mouth now moving quickly away from hers kissing slobbering over her breasts harder she told him and she could see them raping her in the jail at baikal her hatred of them so intense she feared she might never again be capable of genuine sexual love she was crying he mistaking it for passion his thrusting becoming more violent through the maelstrom she turned her head to the rimecovered window that looked out on the blurry pink glow of zhaolin park his rutting took on a manic quality and snorting frantically now like a pig he drove her back against the headboard of the bed with such force that she heard a bone click in her neck the pain shooting down her spine then suddenly she felt lighter as the blubber rolled off her it was panting trying to talk but unable grunting incomprehensibly finally gathering his spittle he asked was it good prekrasno wonderful she said in the darkness the room permeated now and then by the crimson light of swinging lanterns outside the east was red so was ilyas back when mrs latov got through eating her grilled bear paw or stewed moose nose the chinese believed that eating animal parts imparted the animals strength and she returned to the consulate to find her darling ilyas back so badly scratched it would all be over for him what would he tell her that the chinese comrades hed been working late with had suddenly turned passionate then alexsandra knew hed have to issue her travel papers as quickly as possible shed have her papers within hours why hed probably have the consulate limousine drive her to the outskirts hed be in such a hurry to bundle her off even so itd take him months to make it up with madame latov despite her soreness feeling as if a redhot poker had been shoved up inside her alexsandra smiled deliciously at latovs predicament and how could he possibly blame her hed probably boast for years about the woman who was driven so uncontrollable by his passion that shed near skinned him alive the fat pig as he lit his cigarette he saw her smiling it was that good eh yes she said without betraying her contempt genuinely relaxing now it shouldnt be better she added invoking an old russian proverb that meant when things were going so well one had no right to ask for anything more alexsandra he began as he started to dress yes it was becoming windy outside fine snow striking the window like sand the room pierced by flashes of red light from the wildly swinging lanterns what she said it was nice and with that he walked over and opened the door the two black berets their faces covered by the usual black balaclavas walked in unhurriedly but moved purposefully one standing to the side of the open door the other coming over handing alexsandra her coat and shawl and this time said ilya as he was zipping up outside the door looking back at them dont let her escape find out who her contacts are in the city what other jewish bastards are in the area before you get rid of her understand this angered the black beret closest to her hell he told his comrade when latov was gone we werent the bastards who blew the jail apart the other black beret still looking down at her wasnt listening alexsandra stared at the balaclavas the mark of their obsession with anonymity then as if reading her thoughts the one nearest she could smell him pulled up his mask and grinned they knew it didnt matter whether she could identify them or not it would do her no good now she was finished an interrogation session maybe with help from their chinese hosts after all she would be in a chinese jail and then execution as a spy in china that meant a bullet into the neck or would they insist on the omon way and garrote her too bad the americans wont know one of them said to her she was speechless with fright shivering so violently she could hear her teeth chattering about the nanking bridge he continued he glanced back at the other omon by the door you think the americans are in for a surprise comrade i think so comrade the other answered i think so and they both laughed ill have a bit of that the unmasked one said watching her breasts rising and falling quickly in her panic left tit for me said the other man picky bastard joked his companion with mock severity youll take whats left comrade the unmasked one walked toward her he had the crude goldcapped teeth that had given soviet dentistry a bad name and when he smiled it made him look even more malevolent marshal yesov he told her bending down on his haunches so close she could smell a strong cheesy odor pervading the dark room marshal yesov my lovely wants some information from you all right he was unbuttoning his fly we want to know all about your yid underground its contacts with the americans understand she wasnt looking at him but could smell him slowly he wound her hair about his wrists forcing her to look up at him her lips parted in pain you have contacts with freemans hq eh he now pushed her head down between his legs tell niki what you know chapter three khabarovsk already a legend in his time for his part in americas sweeping outflanking armored movements of the iraqi war and in the battles since general douglas freeman a tall silvergrayhaired officer whose clear blue eyes belied the weatherbeaten exterior of middle age was for all his toughness an optimistic man a smile more his armor in second army than a frown but when he scowled as he was this late afternoon striding as briskly as deep snow would allow and pulling his gloves on tightly against the bitter siberian cold his troops said he was a dead ringer for george c scott as patton there was a swish of snow nearby scuse me general freeman and his aide colonel dick norton saw it was a reporter some of the press corps particularly the europeans imitating second armys firstbattalion alpine troops out of the winter training center high in the sierra nevadas were finding it easier to get about on skis the newsmans id clip signified he was from one of the generals least liked papers the national investigator one of the american la roche tabloid chain only thing they investigate freeman had once told norton is tit and ass thats it and thats all of it scuse me general yes he knew the reporter was probably sniffing around for info about one of the men near the baikal dmz hundreds of miles to the east who the night before had come in after four hours of guard duty and shot himself you think private bronowski would have committed suicide general if hed been back in the states when he got the news from his wife freeman kept walking the squeak of his boots against the dry packed powder not letting up no one likes being over here said freeman not bothering to break his stride for the reporter or to look at him but we were sent here by the un to do a job to maintain the peace and to ensure that siberias annexation of outer mongolia doesnt spread any farther farther where inner mongolia said freeman almost adding you fool his breath stabbing the air in short bursts of warmth men are bound to get homesick course i dont expect your story of his wife being screwed by a pentagon pen pusher while hes stuck over here keeping the ceasefire helped any we just report the news general at that freeman stopped and wheeled on the reporter dick norton alarmed the general looking as if he was within a couple of seconds of punching out the muckraker the national investigator reporter stood his ground general you said no one likes being over here are you saying the president should recall freeman turned away and kept walking dick norton informing the reporter were here to keep the ceasefire period if youd like to ask any more questions you should put them at the scheduled press conference khabarovsk hq sixteen hundred hours the reporter moved off on his skis still scribbling by god muttered freeman pulling one glove so tight that the goretex looked grafted to his hand cant stand that vermin the blondes a bit betterlooking i must admit said norton trying to laugh it off rats said freeman all of those la roche reporters are rats he looked across at norton you see that boys body god damn ive seen some horrible wounds in my time but sticking a barrel in your mouth like that still i havent got much time for anyone who shoots himself over beaver but you can understand i suppose his right fist hit the palm of his left damn washington should have let me press yesovs army when we had em on the run dick now theyre safe as church mice west of baikal all those damned politicians back home thats what it is they were approaching the generals quonset hut the pillowed snow following the roofs halfmoon bluish contour in the late afternoon light the general pausing watching the long trails of steam from the quonsets vents snaking high up into the pristine air but no added freeman bitterly washington in its wisdom stopped us just as they did schwarzkopf course freeman conceded if norman had gone farther west to run the republican guard to ground our armor over there wouldve bogged down in the wet plains round basra but here dick here we couldve finished yesovs bastards off before they got halfway across that that damned ice rink the rink freeman was referring to was the fourhundredmilelong lake baikal now frozen solid norton spotted a covey of reporters approaching them hungry on the scent of the suicide and bent he warned freeman on making an issue of poor morale throughout second army theyd given freeman good headlines for fighting yesovs siberians to a standstill then pushing them back across baikal but now with the suicide of one soldier there was blood in the air and the less scrupulous among the press corps had left their hosannas back in the bars of khabarovsk it was hooting time freeman was smiling at the oncoming pack most of them on skis telling norton not that blond bitch from the investigator leave her till last first question for the brunette from cbs by god id like to reconnoiter her dick cool it general freeman nodded as pleasantly as he could in minus forty ladies gentlemen norton gave cbs the nod general began the brunette flicking away strands of nutbrown hair that just for a moment turned gold in the dying rays of the sun is it true that morale in second army is at its lowest ebb since the signing of the ceasefire not at all were talking here i presume you are talking about the selfinflicted the suicide one soldiers tragedy hardly extends to a whole army said freeman general interjected a french reporter from paris match in a loud tone weve had rumors that the siberian interior ministry is out to punish is actively searching for collaborators who helped the british and american forces before the ceasefire freeman was struck by the mans use of the phrase actively searching for he wondered what passively searching for would be weve had no such reports freeman told him truthfully what they do in the zone west of baikal i cant say but therell be no tracking down of collaborators in our zone that is east of baikal were not here to exact vengeance were here to keep the peace you dont think any omons are after you personally do you general hell no freeman laughed looking down at the crowd which he always thought of as an audience any of those blackbonneted bastards come to get me ill give them a second army welcome he patted his waistband beneath which he carried the sig sauer p always loaded with a fifteenround magazine of ninemillimeter parabellum and if that isnt enough for em ill introduce them to my friend charles winchester there were a few laughs from those who had been on the second army beat longest who knew he was referring to the twelvegauge riot gun loaded with that he kept by his bed hell continued the general the winchester twelve hundredll stop he paused searching for an apt analogy amtrak suggested one of the reporters hell the general joked anythingll stop amtrak that was the headline in the next mornings national investigator stateside general slams amtrak marshal yesovs aides delivered the headline and story to the siberian commander they had been instructed by him to monitor everything said by and about the general theyd had a special file on him ever since he had fought so brilliantly in the iraqi war chapter four irkutsk marshal yesov and the other siberian generals had been delighted by the iraqi war it had been the realnoe vremyarealtimetesting range that told them which of the old russian now cis weapons needed to be junked a case in point was the scud moscow had said theyd updated it after the iraqi war but in siberia in novosibirsks satellite city akademgorodok home of the republics most eminent scientists the joke amid the siberians who hated moscow as much as they did the americans was that firing a scud was like drinking a glass of cheap moscow vodka you never knew where youd land through front companies in brussels the worlds arms capital yesov ordered shipments of the new israeli arrow antimissile missile in lieu of the american patriot it wasnt only that the american patriot was unobtainable even through thirdparty arms dealers but that the siberians had long suspected even before the new york times reporters that the patriot highly lauded as it had been through media hype was a missile with more of a reputation than it deserved the siberians concern was that while the patriot had brought down so many scuds over israel it had not always destroyed the warhead sometimes merely exploding the scuds fuel tanks such hits were spectacular especially to the millions of tv viewers but they still left the warhead intact to fall and explode somewhere else if you were aiming your missile at a large target a city this didnt matter so much but marshal yesov had expressed concern that if novosibirsk decided on a preemptive strike against the americans then a very specific targeting capability would be needed together with an integrated indepth antiaircraft and antimissilemissile defense ring around lake baikals western shore which would be provided by the machbreaking israeli arrow for yesov the new longrange mm howitzers operating within the deep aa defensive ring about west baikal were the answer one of yesovs younger generals minsky commander of the siberians far eastern military districts elite udarnayashock troops of the tenth guards cavalry division was pressing for just such a strike pontificating aloud about the vulnerability of the americans minsky was an afghanistan veteran recently appointed co of the tenth guards division its honorific of slutsk earned by his forebears in the battle in byelorussia in the great patriotic war of as its commander minsky was keen to prove his worth against the americans to hell with the ceasefire he proclaimed defiantly in the siberians irkutsk hq no general would have dared spoken in the marshals presence like this in the old days but since gorbachev yeltsin and now chernko the upandcoming young turks as minskys ilk were called could get away with it if they showed results as minsky had in suppressing breakaway minorities farther north in the yakutsk region i say push the bastards back to the sea he enjoined his colleagues we outnumber them five to one at least attending to his maps yesov said nothing he was an old soviet strategist of the frunze military academy a believer in the big battalions school of warfare dominated by artillery the bog voynygod of warand zarnitsa or lightning war behind the enemys lines not only behind the battlefield but wherever possible within the enemys supply base in this case the united states itself having been a young soldier once himself he well understood the impatience of minskys generation but he had risen to be a marshal because he had never lost and as much as the young men now scoffed at lenin one leninist dictum had guided and would continue to guide all yesovs actions it is a crime to undertake war with a better prepared opponent minsky however highly decorated in the afghanistan war was undeterred by yesovs frunze academy caution he thought yesov an old fogy in turn yesov thought that dealing with minsky was like staring down the laser sights of one of the new ts mm the biggest mbt main battle tank gun in the world one frontal shot against the tanks glacis armor plate wouldnt be enough to stop it sometimes yesov knew it was more prudent to withdraw to defilade position to sit and wait the americans are dug in minsky pressed freezing their asses off snow why its mothers milk to us but not to the americans i say hit them before the ice starts to crack and close our roads there being precious few roads at all in siberia the frozen rivers were the only trustworthy supply lines along which the logistics tail could keep up with the head besides added minsky indicating the map of eastern siberia around lake baikal and south into outer mongolia we have the transsiberian in fortyfive it only took us two months to move four armies across from the west and during the ceasefire weve been moving supplies across the taiga constantly why doesnt novosibirsk attack none of his colleagues answered they were loyal to minsky but they knew his reference to novosibirsk was really a dig at yesov who would have the final military say on whether to hold the ceasefire or not after novosibirsks political decision well what are we going to do said minsky i dont know what youre going to do general said yesov putting on his greatcoat his peaked crimsonbanded gray cap and his gloves against the bitter winter cold but im going to dinner but minsky was not easily put off inside the officers mess he wondered aloud about the special vulnerability of americans when they were so far from home i tell you the americans are crybabies three months away and they start to blubber for mama general minsky said yesov quietly his massive jaws demolishing thick black bread perhaps the americans will move against us the other officers nonplussed glanced at one another but for minsky there was no doubt they wont he said confidently washington wouldnt permit freeman to violate the ceasefire the marshal took out his cigarette case and lit a sobraine holding it meditatively between thumb and forefinger both of which were stained a dark yellow with nicotine perhaps comrades well see but this freeman he has a flair for the unorthodox just how unorthodox yesov could have had no idea chapter five khabarovsk freemans insistence that a team of navy seal sea air and land commandos be trained by deaf mutes and that wolf dung lots of it be collected and brought to his hq at khabarovsk were two of the strangest orders issued by the commander of all american and allied forces in eastern siberia the victor of his daring nighttime commando raid on pyongyang north koreas capital early in the war and of his equally audacious airborne attack on ratmanov island in the bering strait only twentyfive miles from alaska freeman had never approved of the ceasefire agreed to by the white house if we dont finish it now freeman warned washington well have to do it later at a higher cost but as schwarzkopf was told not to pursue the republican guard in iraq any farther so washington had similarly ordered freeman not to press his rout of the siberian fifth army spearheaded by the oncefamed but now badly mauled thirtyfirst stalingrad division the generals order for wolf dung during the ceasefire washington and novosibirsk had pressed upon him perplexed his aide dick norton but freeman as if his words were explanation enough merely pointed out that intelligence reports all wolves have been taken from the beijing zoo and sent to the northern boundaries of the beijing military region in his khabarovsk quonset hut hq freeman was studying the huge twelvebysixfoot map of eastern siberia its green mountainous terrain to the south contrasting with the treeless humps and plains of mongolia to the south and west his eyes followed the outline of a huge rectangle the western edge formed by lake baikal the annexed mongolian peoples republic to his south the yakutsk region of siberia to his north and behind him the sea of japan there were many fancy military euphemisms for it but every private in freemans second army knew what it meant if the ceasefire didnt hold theyd be boxed in why cant the damn fools see it demanded freeman novosibirsk is playing washington for a sucker again i dont trust those vodkaswilling sons of bitches as far as i can kick em he turned from the map to face norton and the other officers of his khabarovsk hq some of them new boys flown in from dutch harbor alaska on rotation you know what the new republics military were doing when bush and gorby were shaking hands gentlemen norton knew it was a rite of passage for any newcomer to his staff as far as freeman was concerned well said freeman there was a little mystery nato couldnt figure out you all remember nato north american trust organization proffered a cocky if illadvised young captain obviously not a career soldier freeman ignored the smartass remark but hed already noted the mans name tyler m a junior officer liaison between freemans g intelligence section and his first armored division cheeky bastard like tyler would be a good man to put in the lead tank freeman thought with that kind of chutzpa hed keep going where others would stop secret of an armored thrust was that you must never stop your mobility was the best chance of securing victory and survival well continued freeman our russian friends in july soviet high command to be exact reported they had fortyone thousand tanks in europe fortyone thousand five hundred and eighty to be precise gentlemen under the cofie conventional forces in europe treaty a significant number of those tanks were to be destroyed and so four months later the soviets told us there were now only twenty thousand soviet tanks in europe the question however gentlemen was i should say iswhere did the other twenty thousand go scrap heap freeman shook his head no sirnone of them were junked not a one we found out that many of the remainder were moved east of the urals out of europe just before the treaty document about tanks in europe was signed and some were sent to the new central asian republics now there were still eight thousand tanks missing gentlemen and if youre puzzled about them i can tell you that it was revealed in sovetskaya rossiyaa russian paper that the missing eight thousand tanks had been put in storage bases in western siberia and central asia tanks gentlemen ts with laser sighting thermal imaging and appliqué armor all of which could be used against us at any time so my standing order is to keep your powder dry and make damn sure none of your forward ops doze offspecially during blizzards when our air cover from here west to baikal will effectively be reduced to zero even with our infrared capability any observer falls asleep at his post ill have him flayed alive plus a hundred dollar fine for each man in the squad understand yes sir and the officer in charge busted to private no one answered freeman was as frustrated as norton had seen him he had tried to warn the american people and the congress of the danger a few days before during his press conference in khabarovsk but for this hed been attacked now holding up one of the la roche papers he let the new members of his staff see the screaming fourinch headline warmonger what do you think he asked his staff am i a warmonger anybody here think these jokersll rest with american troops on siberian soil when theyve got us surrounded north to yakutsk west beyond lake baikal south to mongolia no one cared to answer him warmonger he said throwing the la roche paper down well theyre rightwhen i see war coming like churchill my god this is saddam insane all over again should have gone after that son of a bitch right into baghdad id have personally shot the mad bastard know how many kurds we would have saved men women and children never mind iraqis freeman snatched up his cap and the thick beech stick hed honed to a pointer his tone changing as if suddenly uncharacteristically resigned to the foibles of washington and the state department doyennes of foggy bottom meanwhile he continued in a worldweary voice all those armchair fairies in state and the pentagon are pumping the president full ofrestraint he said it as if it were a dirty word the beech stick smacking hard against the massed divisions west of baikal only restraint this crowdll understand will come from the barrel of an m tank which is why gentlemen if im any judge i expect to be recalled for consultation any day if some of the officers were surprised dick norton wasnt hed got the first fax copy of the new york times that morning and if unlike the la roche tabloids the mainstream papers werent exactly calling freeman a warmonger their more genteel prose amounted to the same thing the times had written general douglas freeman has proved to have been not only a loyal implementor of us national policy but a prescient and brilliant soldier the raid he led on pyongyang the brilliant strategy that allowed the allies to break out of the infamous sovietringed dortmundbielefeld pocket on the north german plain earlier in this conflict and his dashing seizure of the initiative once the siberian military threat in lake baikal had been realized have made his name synonymous in the history of american arms with daring and brilliant if at times eccentric leadership this having been said however we believe that the time has come for douglas freeman to be recalled as he was once the european threat was quashed he is a fighting general and not as is increasingly being pointed out in the congress a peace general he has done his job extraordinarily well and the nation as it did upon his return from europe should shower its honors upon him for his outstanding leadership of operation arctic front which made it possible for the present ceasefire to be instigated but now it is time for someone else to take his place in siberia he is as he was in europe and there is no easy way to say this too volatile for the peace he is a soldiers soldier and one who has much to teach in the staff colleges of the nation with the battlefield now thankfully silent and with spring imminent it is fitting that with a change in season there be a change in command a transition from the time of war to a season of hope by god freeman had commented upon seeing the editorial whipping off his reading glasses conveying the impression he didnt really need visual assist when he plainly did he was certain the new york times and other papers were merely parroting administration policy which he believed had been deliberately leaked to signal his end where do those pentagon fairies get that horse manure from dick season of hope good god dont they understand the siberians outnumber us more than five to one dick norton thought it inadvisable to remind the general that before the ceasefire one of the pentagon fairies hed referred to had won the silver star in the vicious fighting on the road east of skovordino and that in his view washington might be right norton looked down at the editorial sounds like james knutson to me yale not the pentagon well grumped freeman his hands cupping a mug of coffee as he overlooked the frozen amur river from his khabarovsk hq the tall warscarred smokestacks reaching into the icecold blue its an ivy league fairy then worst kind dont realize their freedom to pontificate upon national policy has been paid for in blood from iwo jima to this he paused searching for the right word to describe the confluence of vast mountain ranges and endless taiga of fir beech larch silver pine and the steppe beyond baikal it was so vast whole armies had been swallowed by and could hide in it without a trace soon be spring he said but there was none of the optimism with which most others on his staff had been anticipating the coming of the season icell start to melt therell be floods our tanks could be in a quagmire immobile he took a sip of coffee its steam condensing the hq door banged open a g lieutenant stamping his feet shucking off the snow cept for the permafrost freeman went on thats rockhard but that wont help us when the rivers start to crack norton could see that even as the general was speaking his conversation about the cold was evidence of a much deeper concern about whether the ceasefire would hold he wanted it to but to be caught napping at any of the hundreds of weak points along the vast box was a heavier load than anyone else was carrying here or back in the pentagon what do you think dick freeman asked dont dress it up you think theyll attack in winter no sir i think the ceasefirell hold summers the time for war in this country they sure as hell wont try to move while lake baikal is frozen we could reinforce our m battalions on the western shore in a matter of hours just scoot across that lake with close air support a thunderbolts riding shotgun theyd soon sort out the ts look what they did on the road to basra norton was talking about the massacre the thunderbolts had wrought in the iraqi desert with their volkswagensized gun mount forward of the planes titanium bath seat the thunderbolts thirtymillimeter cannon chopping up husseins fleeing armored columns sending them careening in panic besides general baikal wont even begin to melt till late spring four six weeks away at least maybe dick but i dont trust em i want to know the moment that son of a bitch starts to crack yes sir under the rules freeman said contemptuously putting down his cap the beech sticks knobby end smacking the fourhundredmilelong lake we can move anything but food supply trucks across the lake washington says anything else would give the wrong signal to novosibirsk yes sir i know freeman pulled his gloves on deciding to leave after all stretching the furlined leather into a fist dick norton opened the door for him and immediately turned his face from the icy blast you tell me dick the moment that ice starts to melt first goddamn crack you hear yes sir but i honestly dont think youve anything to worry about as freeman stepped out into swirling fresh snow someone cried look out general almost too late the general stepped back barely missed by two hooded skiers god damn it exploded freeman as they swooshed by you okay general asked norton yes yes said freeman brusquely pulling up his collar women drivers what dyou expect mans not safe in his own camp norton laughed with him it was a comment thatd get him killed in the media but norton knew he held no prejudice against women had used them as his lead pilots in the attack on pyongyang on the other hand hed vehemently opposed the idea of women in tanks had said quite rightly there was no place to piss in private chapter six in the headquarters of beijing mr the most important of the seven military regions in china the imperturbable general cheng was perturbed in one fell swoop with siberias annexation of outer mongolia to which cheng had no doubt ulan bator had willingly agreed given the mongolians ancient hatred of the chinese the traditional buffer zone between north china inner mongolia and siberia had been removed it wasnt just the stationing there of the siberian thirtyninth army with its category onetop readiness armored and motorrifle divisions that concerned cheng they had always been posted on the mongolianchinese border and had always been a thorn in chinas side but now several more divisions were stationed closer along the mongolianchinese border around saynshand in the gobi desert the annexation meant that not even the formalities of siberianmongolian discussions were necessary before the siberians could move their troops at will in and about outer mongolia threatening chinas enormous province of inner mongolia chengs concerns ranged from the grand strategic implications of siberias annexation of mongolia to the myriad details that had to be attended to in running the worlds largest army which though not as modernized as the siberians or the americans was nevertheless four million strong many of the reservist cadres were battle hardened and wise after unofficially fighting to help defeat the americans in the vietnam war older cadres having fought the americans to a standstill in korea in the s but always it had been difficult for the pla to keep within budget in the time of tiananmen it had cost only thirteen us cents a bullet to shoot goddess of democracy protesters but now with rampant inflation the cost of ammunition had skyrocketed to twentyfive cents cheng knew this might not be a serious consideration for smaller armies but for an army of four million it was a headache but cheng was as resourceful as he was known to be cautious and his connection with the american industrialist and newspaper magnate jay la roche was used to good effect enabling him to buy us supplies in the illegal arms trade through brussels cheng knew from his intelligence sources that la roche was what even the americans would call a degenerate his bizarre sexual behavior had driven away his wife who was now serving as a wave an american naval nurse at dutch harbor in the american aleutian island chain but registered on the shanghai as well as the tokyo london and wall street exchange la roche who cheng plainly admitted to his colleagues would sell his mother for a fen was valuable to beijing la roche had assured cheng and thus the peoples liberation army of access to anything they required from bullets to nerve gas which could be used against either siberians or americans whoever violated chinese territorial integrity though la roche always insisted on hard currency cheng had conserved brilliantly while the americans and siberians were spending more and more on selfpropelled artillery for example the pla relied largely on the olderfashioned towing system it meant that the crews werent as wellprotected as they would be in armorplated selfpropelled howitzers but cheng knew that once a selfpropelled vehicle broke down an overheated bearing a wiring malfunction whatever it stayed where it was and became the delight of enemy artillery gunners a stationary target with towed weapons on the other hand if something happened to the lead vehicle the gun could be quickly uncoupled broken down into its component parts and if necessary moved by sheer muscle power as had been done over the mountains and through the swamps of the thousandmile ho chi minh trail cheng much preferred fighting to pennypinching the constant battle of refusing requests for more money making him increasingly unpopular among military commanders and he yearned to show his mettle in combat as he signed a memo denying yet another exorbitant request for extra uniforms general chengs foreign affairs phone began its insistent ring it was the foreign ministry informing him that the siberian chargé daffaires in harbin ilya latov had conveyed the wish of general yesov commander in chief of the new siberian forces to meet tomorrow with his esteemed chinese colleague in the border town of erhlien cheng recognized instantly that there was significance in the siberians having selected the chinese town on the border and not dzamïn üüd the town on siberias mongolian side where the transsiberian spurline coming down through ulan bator reached the chinese frontier it was a gesture of respect that yesov would be coming to him not vice versa still cheng was as suspicious of yesov as yesov and freeman were of each other what was the siberian bear up to so as to maintain face and not show any sign of haste that might evidence the anxiety he felt cheng replied he would be pleased to meet the comrade from siberia but not till the following evening this he knew would necessitate yesov taking the transmongolian express unless the siberian commander wanted to come by air and risk the americans interpreting an overborder flight as a back door violation of the ceasefire it would be a long journey for yesov through the mountains south of lake baikal down through the selenga river valley into mongolia all the time enjoying the ceaseless loudspeaker rattle from the trains pa system unable to stop or even control the pa system yesov would be subjected to the relentless mindnumbing blare all the way down over the endless brown icy treeless expanse the great marshal of the united siberian republic would have to feast on the finest mongolian cuisine of rancid blood sausage and slimy bowls of floating goats ears and yellow mutton cheng calculated that by the time yesov reached erhlien on the chinese side a neat town compared to the mongolian slum of dzamïn üüd and was given proper food he would be in a much more conducive mood to listen to the chinese point of view to whatever proposal he might have cheng certainly wasnt going to cross the border to meet him apart from the filth of the mongolian side the mobile missile sites around dzamïn üüd as part of the gobi desert defense were all pointed at china to meet there rather than in erhlien would be an implicit acceptance of siberias annexation of the mongolian frontier it would be noon by the time the transmongolian reached the border and over the vast endless snow that covered the dormant grassland of the southern gobi vultures would be high in the hard cloudless blue sky circling waiting for the slightest mistake of any wayward traveler already many refugees from the north were said to have perished before leaving for erhlien general cheng unsettled by the new siberian republic flexing its muscle in mongolia decided it would be prudent to have the frontier units in beijing lanzhou and shenyang military regions in the far north of china bordering on siberia and mongolia on firststage alert the haunting fear of a sudden mongol invasion sweeping down from the north across the plains of inner mongolia to beijing was always a constant in the psyche of the chinese and foremost in the mind of whoever was head of the pla indeed the fear had been the reason for the construction of the great wall the only manmade construct visible from outer space cheng ever vigilant would sometimes walk through the vast underground network of tunnels beneath beijing which had been constructed in the s when the ferocity of the chinesesoviet battles over the disputed northern border areas around the amur river had convinced the chinese that a soviet invasion was imminent as a final precaution prior to leaving the beijing railway station for erhlien cheng suddenly ordered carriages in his train to be switched you could never be too careful it would take only one democracy movement fanatic to kill you he also ordered a fax be readied for one of la roches shanghai companies requesting replacement parts for civilian air transport indeed cheng though he could never admit it officially avoided air travel in china if at all possible he had lost more people on the peoples airline in the last year than he had on military maneuvers in fact the fax which might or might not be sent depending on his meeting with yesov had nothing to do with aircraft parts but its invoice number code would tell la roches company that what the pla needed was a delivery of ten thousand mm kilogram he high explosive heavy artillery rounds with variable bag charges the mm had a range of plus or minus eighteen miles and could do tremendous damage in either a creeping barrage or direct target fire cheng also ordered that pending the meeting with yesov a requisition be made and held for four thousand aif or antiinfrared smoke rounds these latter were normal smoke rounds infused with denser particles which prevented enemy infrared scopes from picking up body and engine heat signature which they could do through normal smoke these aif rounds cheng knew might be a little more difficult for la roche to procure he knew that la roche might not be able to get them directly from belgian or french factories because of the ridiculous us humanrightsprompted embargo on such sales to china but then la roche would do what he had done so often in the past have the aif shells stolen from his own countrys army either from the convoys resupplying freemans vladivostok base out of japan or from the stockpiles in vladivostok itself he would then send them down on junks through the tsushima strait between south korea and japan into the yellow sea where the junks ostensibly bound for taiwan could be officially intercepted by the pla navys fastattack coastal defense boats and unloaded on the china coast chapter seven new york in the opulent dimly lit cocktail bar of the il trovatore on the fiftieth floor of la roche tower jay la roche who owned the tower and everything in it looked out at the gilded blackness that was manhattan and part his la roches empire begun in perfume and pharmaceuticals had expanded in a dozen different directions and before the ceasefire the war had catapulted him to the top ten of fortunes the waitress who delivered his third manhattan in the fifteenkaratgoldlipped glass with goldfiligree leaf design bent lower as she placed the silk coaster before him lingering to wipe the table the table was as clean as a choirboy as la roche was fond of saying but francine a long lithe blonde with a starlets body to match knew that if she was to keep her job and the big tips that came with working at the il trovatore shed better linger as long and as frequently as possible and as jimmy working bar told her lowcut dresses with no visible panty line were de rigueur jimmy also informed francine there was a bonus for noninventoried services she asked him what he meant jimmy told her shed find out jay was alone this evening but jimmy could read the signs and knew it wouldnt be long before la roche wanted company dressed smartly in a tuxedo la roche had what jimmy called the lookenigmatic cold like one of those long deepfeeding fish jimmy had heard about creatures who lived their entire lives in the dark covered in poisonous antennae who would lie in wait for hours then suddenly dart stun their prey swallow their victim and move on their only satisfaction the kill jimmy knew the ritual by heart after the third manhattan which la roche was now sipping hed ring room service for a fourth drink to be taken up to his penthouse soon la roche was down to the cherry jimmy pulled over the next order chit and scooped ice into the daiquiri shaker think youre about to be drafted francine you been a good girl the question wasnt idle chatter if she hadnt been theyd all get it in the neck course she said dont shit me francine you been having it off with the fleet or what screw you she said when are those daiquiris going to be ready he gave the flask a few extra shakes the condensation catching the rosy glow of the bar his voice using the chipped ice as cover nothing personal francine but mr la roche wants the best have to understand that you had a blood test you had yours yeah said jimmy unabashed but im careful francine i dont go screwing about with anyone after hours know what i mean i havent hey dont dance with me honey one of the juiceheads said she saw you down at melvilles with a flyboy if you two tore one off sweetie i hope you used a letter im clean she said he topped up the daiquiris listen francine youve got it all wrong its for your own good too babe he lowered his voice careful that a group of american and japanese businessmen two tables closer in than la roche couldnt overhear the japanese being told through the booze and haze of blue smoke that with the mideast wells aflame again this time by muslim fundamentalists in support of siberia against america north slope oil was going to cost them a lot more than yen if youre dirty jimmy explained to francine hell get mad he likes s and m anyway and thatd just give him an excuse if youre dirty jimmy lifted his eyes know what i mean he could tell she wasnt quite sure though she was getting the drift sort of you hear about his wife francine shrugged i heard a lot of yap in shanghai said the barman beat the crap out of her shes lucky she got out in one piece just warnin you babe i can handle it jack she said picking up the tray i think youre jealous maybe you didnt perform well enough for him im still here bitch and dont call me jack my my i think he is jealous said francine balancing the tray just a teensyweensy bit la roche snapped his fingers she went over and came back without having delivered the daiquiris mr la roche would like another drink jack she said in his room youre on babe you clean she snatched up several coasters i suppose all your boyfriends are virgins jack yes he said unequivocally how about yours francine didnt give a damn about jimmy did he think that because she was just seventeen she hadnt been round the block or something that she didnt know la roche had you followed that if you had made it with anyone else and hadnt passed the company medical you were out on your ass she knew she was clean the only thing she couldnt figure out was that if la roche was so fussy he probably knew shed been to melvilles if he was so damned uptight about prick poisons why didnt he just keep a stable of girls on tap how come he had to come down to the barhis bar for chrissakes and pretend that hed somehow managed to pick you up as if somehow hed seduced you well she didnt care had a guy once who had to do it with a parrot in the room he was rich too and anyway jay la roche was one helluva lot richer than him made it kind of exciting though she thought like in the movies when she entered the penthouse the first thing francine was aware of was its smell strangely antiseptic creating an ambience of cold detachment an empty feeling so much so that she half expected to see cover sheets on the furniture the apartment was spacious yet not as big as shed supposed everything in it seemed extraordinarily organized nothing spontaneous about it even the paintings mod art seemed chosen to match the angular scandinavian chaise longue for all the art deco colors and a stunning view of central park and beyond it had an inhospitable air and she felt a chill despite the fact that the goldbraced thermostat was registering over seventy degrees when he came out from the kitchenette to meet her he was in a rich oxblood robe with yellow dragons rampant front and back embroidered in gold thread it clashed violently with the decor he pressed a button somewhere and the air began pulsating with a heavy rock bet you like the razors he asked yes mr la roche but how did you know i know what music you like if you call that shit music he paused but she knew it wasnt for want of anything to say his eyes sweeping over her taking in every detail as if he could see right through her knew all about her past and her future i know what you eat he said come here as she walked toward him he reached over to the window wall and without taking his eyes off her pressed another button and she saw the drapes moving toward one another wiping out the view my wifes boyfriend is back with her he said up in alaska she was nonplussed but quickly something told her perhaps the obsessive neatness of the apartment that if she showed any puzzlement it would be dangerous she said nothing you know why la roche went on one hand extracting a small gold snuff box from the robes righthand pocket his other hand holding the gold leaf which gave the cocaine a light saffron color you know why he repeated no because said la roche his lips in a thin smile he had to bail out over ratmanov francine was racing to keep up all ratmanov meant to her was that it was some hunk of rock off alaska the americans and siberians had been fighting over before the ceasefire a lot of men were killed yeah said la roche some siberian nearly took romeos eye out la roche was still smiling swirling the ice cubes in the glass course hell want to get back to flying soon as he can right sure agreed francine i mean its only natural isnt it yeah well i want him out of there away from her he took a gulp of the manhattan that natural yeah sure mr la roche you know all itll take to get him out of there francine shook her head he handed her a thousanddollar bill rolled tightly into a tube holding her hair back with one hand she leaned forward one phone call sweetie one fucking phone call thats all he held his hand out for the snuff box after shed finished and she watched his fingers covering it like an octopus he laughed and a little campaign contribution she smiled figuring it was the right thing to do it was but then suddenly his mood changed he sat down in the plush leather swivel chair and turned away from her for a moment francine thought he was staring at the drapes but then noticed he was holding a christmascardsized photograph he must have taken from his robe pocket she wants me back he said i know it deep down i know it he swung around to face francine again but i was bad to her francine you know what i mean ii think so mr la roche he was looking away from her again back at the photo of his wife i have to pay for it francine he was speaking softly his head back hard against the rest but francine didnt hear him and didnt care already feeling the rush he got up walked over toward her and taking her hand led her into the kitchenette opened a drawer and took out a small glistening paring knife she froze dont worry he said contemptuously im not going to hurt you come here she hesitated come here you bitch her heart thumping she glanced at the door go if you want he said think im going to cut you no she began uncertainly he put down the knife walked toward her took her arms pulled her hard up against him staring at her then released his grip her relief was audible as she stumbled back rubbing her wrist he held out his hand to her and this time she came to him willingly albeit hesitantly now watch he said i told you im not going to hurt you deftly quickly he took the knife and pulling the bodice of her dress toward him sliced it open then hooking his left forefinger in the middle of her bra cut the strap and dropped the knife into the sink gazing at her breasts then wordlessly he led her into the bedroom and shut the door he turned on a small bedside lamp sat on the bedspread of pale blue silk and told her to take off his robe he was getting big she saw but not fully aroused he flung back the bed sheets and from under the pillow pulled out a strap its buckle missing he doubled it up and gave it to her until i tell you to stop francine you understand are you sure you she began he screamed at her until i tell you to stop understand before she could answer he lay facedown spreadeagled on the bed his body much thinner than she had imagined the robe probably had padded shoulders only then in the dim peach glow of the lamp did she notice another photo of his wife lana hed placed it so that he could see it as francine began giving him the strap he told her to do it harder and harder and soon he was calling out his wifes name and francine thought that thats all thered be to it if jay la roche was thinking of his wife she wasnt thinking of him still busy looking after the wounded that had come in prior to the ceasefire the worst cases from ferocious tank battles along the neverskovorodino road north of the hump formed by the amur river lieutenant lana la roche nee brentwood was far too occupied to think of anyone but her patients and even if shed had the time she would have tried to avoid thinking of jay his kinky sex so vulgarly aggressive to the minutest detail that even the memory of their short and for her terrible marriage made her stomach churn in her work shed found a way of at least temporarily escaping the awful humiliations he had subjected her to in the bedroom while appearing to the outside world as a meticulously groomed and successful businessman owner as well as chief executive officer of one of the worlds largest industrial conglomerates work also helped lana forget his petty vindictiveness his refusal to grant her a divorce on any grounds unless she wanted to see her family in particular her father a retired us admiral and her three brothers smeared in his tabloids at first she thought he was bluffing besides with her youngest brother david who had served with distinction in the allied special air servicedelta force commando raid against the submarine pens on lake baikal her brother rays equally distinguished service as captain of a fast guidedmissile frigate and her eldest brother robert serving as the captain of a sea wolf ii hunterkiller she quite frankly didnt see how la roche could do anything against her family you want to bet baby jay had sneered at her through cokebright eyes i dont need your whole fucking family daddyll do fine what do you mean shed asked him flabbergasted la roche had poured himself a half glass of scotch downed it then used a napkin to pat his sneering lips dry staring into the distance affecting the pose of someone in deep thought how about this for a headline admiral brentwood denies he is homosexual but but shed said flustered angry yet feeling utterly helpless before him hes not even if he was so what you naive little bitch retorted la roche dont you know anything you sure as hell dont know how to fuck doesnt matter whether its true or not hollywood wouldnt care or would say they didnt care liz taylor would probably donate another of her pearl chokers to the fight aids committee but believe me babe in the rest of the country in the navy for chrissakesadmiral denies hes gay put that in a headline he shrugged and not even clarence darrow could sue me we and by we sweetheart i mean every goddamn paper i own a hundred and twentythree to be exact would only be reporting the admirals denial his smile was pure evil freedom of the press right it was the first time shed ever hit him or at least tried to the blow he delivered in return sent her reeling across the plushcarpeted bedroom of their shanghai penthouse that makes two black eyes youve got youd better quit while you still have your teeth that night looking down on the bund watching shanghais waterfront lights smeared by the drizzling rain that was falling over the huangpu and farther north at the mouth of the yangtze lana felt as lonely and as homesick as she thought anyone could be all she had wanted to do then was to go down and get aboard a ship a junk anything that would float and take her away from shanghai and jay but realizing now die threat against her family was real she had no option but to stay the war and her volunteering as a wave had allowed her the only possible escape but even her volunteering made la roche look even better the successful businessman and patriot unselfishly allowing his wife to go and help the boys and gals as he was fond of putting it at the front now and then he even sent la rochesponsored concerts to entertain the troops but lana knew that if she ever sued for divorce his tabloids would unleash a muckraking albeit invented offensive that would totally bewilder as well as destroy her parents if not her brothers careers but for lana this night thousands of miles away from jay was one of the better ones in americas siberia the name given to the remote naval hospital at dutch harbor which for many servicemen on rotation from duty in siberia was the first piece of america they had seen for months the weather was bad as usual wind fog and then eightymileperhour arctic winds all within the space of an hour but she didnt mind she was on her way to see the man who had helped her mend frank shirer was an american air ace shed met briefly years before in washington and who was now the man she wanted to marry if that were ever possible shirer had been shot down during freemans attack on ratmanov island in the bering strait when the us carrier salt lake city from which frank had led the second wave of tomcats launched its fighter bomber attack on the rock both he and his radar intercept officer had baled out but were captured by the siberian spetsnaz the equivalent of allied special forces and with a cruelty that lana could still not fathom one of the spets commandos trying to get frank to reveal the exact location of the american carrier had driven a ballpoint into franks left eye leaving it hanging by the optic nerve after the fall of ratmanov surgeons at dutch harbor had put back the eye but the vision demanded of a fighter pilot was gone yet as traumatic as it was for frank shirer the man who had once shot down his coequal in the siberian air force sergei marchenko after having been downed once by marchenko himself to contemplate the end of a brilliant career it was made worse by the knowledge that marchenko whom he had thought he had downed for good over north korea had apparently survived marchenkos fulcrum mig with its telltale ubiytsa yankiyankee killermotif had been sighted by americans flying patrol over the lake baikal ceasefire line for lana however the prospect of frank being out of the war was something for which she was grateful for a moment when she walked into ward and saw he was gone all her professional cool left her and she panicked sometimes for no known cause an infection could develop in a patient overnight and she heard a whistle es over ere it was a cockney voice that always reminded her and frank of eliza doolitties father in my fair lady the voice belonged to an irreverent but wellmeaning cockney whom theyd appropriately nicknamed doolittle and who was convalescing from burns suffered when general freeman in one of the most controversial decisions of the war had ordered in faes fuel air explosive bombs over the sevensquaremile ratmanov island in the bering strait freeman had used the overpressure of the airdetonated faes a chemical mist of jellied ammonium nitrate aluminum powder and polystyrene soap to detonate mines that the spets had laid in anticipation of freemans airborne invasion unfortunately on the small rocky island the explosion of the faes had also caused some collateral damage as the pentagon had put it amongst the joint british sasus delta force commando detachment that had spearheaded the attack on ratmanov fought ed done a midnight flit on yer did yer lieutenant asked doolittle his bandaged head nodding toward franks empty bed lana smiled with relief the cockney quickly dousing a cigarette in his tea mug before the ward sistermother attila he called her spotted him me and frank nipped out to the lounge for a bit of tv masterpiece theatre shakespeare he nodded cheekily toward frank who was returning from the washroom fought it about time e got a bit of bloody culture the cockney winked at lana but all e wants to do is ogle the nurses e does and read dirty mags glad you turned up gettin right out of control e was right mate he asked shirer who had shoved the reading glasses prescribed for him into the pocket of his hospitalissue robe yeah continued doolittle ere i was tryin to educate im an hes pervin at centerfolds just as well e got his transfer transfer said lana completely taken aback washington said shirer adding disgustedly some damn desk job have to be there in a week ill see you two later said the cockney tatta neither of them speaking frank and lana walked out together to the tv lounge they could hear the masterpiece theatre theme trumpeting and saw the blue flickering of the screen lousy reception frank said atmospherics up here are really weird met guys say that if it wasnt for all the cold fronts socking us in wed see the aurora borealis least thatd be something they walked hand in hand through the lounge and got a disapproving look for it from one of the head nurses coming from the coffee room where they were headed i dont want you to lana began but if you really had your heart set on it why couldnt you go back to the carrier in some you know administrative god damn it he began then checked himself sorry but lookit if i cant fly i dont want to be on the carrier seeing other guys suiting up couldnt stand it i know sorry it was stupid of me no no youre right ill just hell ill just have to settle into whatever they give me he paused both hands in his robe unless unless what nothing there was an awkward moments silence and without him saying a word she knew what it was doolittle the cockney had been pumping him up again with stories about adolf galland germanys top air ace commander of the luftwaffe in world war two having flown and fought with only one eye the other one glass every fighter pilot who had ever had an eye injury had heard about galland it was even said that siberian ace marchenko who had reputedly suffered from a slight astigmatism had trotted out the galland story to get into flying school before hed submitted to a simple laser recontour of the cornea to correct the problem that was in world war two said lana sharply they never flew jets yes they did replied frank hastily galland flew the messerschmidt if theyd produced enough of i dont want to hear about galland lana said impatiently all i hear about is galland and his damned glass eye how about bader frank shot back british ace didnt have any legs can you imagine flew without legs everyone said it was impossible thought it was going to be a big handicap guess what it helped him out in a dive blood flow didnt have so far to go could come out of a blackout quicker than anyone else how about that thats great im very happy for him but i wish doolittle would clam up for a while he means well i know frank but look hon the sooner you face it i mean really face it me better no ones going to let you take up multimilliondollar aircraft with one eye not these days dont you think ive asked around it took shirer by surprise well i have if i had my druthers i wouldnt see you near another plane but i know how much it means well anyway the answers the same no deal besides it she stopped herself go on no it doesnt matter go on they were no longer holding hands all right ill say it frank youve got to think of other people as well as yourself i know how much flying means to you its been your whole life all youve ever cared about but its not just you its youre saying id be a danger to others she looked straight at him yes standard answer he said dismissively plugging in the kettle again for coffee although it had just been on a raging boil because its the standard truth she said anyway youd never pass the eye examination without your glasses thanks a million oh dont be so childish all im trying to do is help you frank all right lets not talk about it anymore he said you want sugar i love you she said you too he said kissing her quickly on the cheek it bothered her oh not that theyd had another row about his inability to accept the end of his flying career theyd had any number of discussions on that subject it was him asking her if she wanted any sugar he knew she never took it her determination to keep on her diet had been reinforced by the sweet things he told her about her body during their most intimate moments his venus de milo he had called her frank shirer knew darn well that she never took sugar he slipped his arm about her pulling her closely to him kissing her again on the cheek their fights had never ended like that at least not so quickly thered always been a mini cold war before the thaw he was up to something whatcha mate asked doolittle it was the cockneys way of inquiring how you were doing fine said frank as they passed him on the way back to the ward just fine lana felt increasingly anxious something wasnt right suddenly she felt herself plunging into outright depression brought on in part by the shock of realizing theyd be separated within the week shed never seen a transfer come through that fast a week the thought of being without him filled her with an ache of such longing she felt as empty as she had that night looking down on the bund in shanghai without any hope of escaping the pain her only consolation was that at least the war was over the ceasefire intact chapter eight marshal yesov had tired of the endless mongolian vista of snowcovered pasturelands unbroken except for the odd camel he could see from the train and clumps of yurtsthe circular willowframeworkcovered homes of the mongols an occasional curl of cowdung smoke spiraled lazily up from the yurts toonos or chimneys whose flaps opened a little more as the sun rose higher over the cloudless gobi where night temperatures were still often minus twentyfive and below yesov also had had enough of the bowls of yellowish glutinous goats ears swimming in fat delivered to him proudly by the mongolians as the train approached the chinese border yesov noticed that patches of snow had already melted revealing the yellow caked earth which blown up by the hot winds of summer would form the great dust storms of the gobi which would sweep south over the great wall and on to beijing less than four hundred miles to the south he would be glad to get his business done and though he wouldnt admit it to the chinese who met him at erhlien glad to be on chinese soil away from the inedible muck the mongolians served up and glad too to get away from smiling in fraternal friendship with the mongolian comrades while having to drink their vile traditional cup of sour camel milk mixed with salt tea na zdorovyeto your health said marshal yesov gratefully raising his cup of chinese tea unlike the troe durokovthree stooges the drunks who had bungled the attempted putsch against gorbachev back in yesov preferred tea to alcohol which he rarely consumed though he had a great reputation for doing so what he never told anyone was that whoever was attending bar at official functions in novosibirsk was always warned by one of his aides on pain of losing their job that after the first vodka toast his glass was to be filled with water this enabled a sober yesov to hear many things he would not have otherwise and to be one step ahead of his competitors in response to his na zdorovye yesov expected to hear gan beibottoms up the chinese equivalent of the toast hed just made to the fraternal friendship between siberia and china instead general cheng still standing not yet having removed either cap or coat responded with a longwinded toast to the health and fraternal friendship of marxistleninist principles yesov grunted and drank the tea the chinese were paranoid about what had happened in the soviet union particularly with the breakaway siberian union and were determined to prevent any such dissolution in china accordingly marshal yesov couched his introductory remarks in terms of consolidation as in the case of the siberian union having annexedwith ulan bators invitationouter mongolia this could hardly be seen yesov pointed out with the first smile that had crossed his face in two weeks as aggression on the part of the siberian union far from a splitting up of constituent parts it was as he said a consolidation of two historical cousins into one cheng sat expressionless beijing had already protested the annexation of outer mongolia he waited there was a long pained silence yesov finally offering cigars cuban giving cheng the chance to comment either way on his view of the annexation cheng declined the cigar seeing his opposite number clearly had no intention of exchanging pleasantries yesov now came directly to the point the americans are up to no good this ceasefire is in reality a time of frantic resupply for their imperialist forces yesov leaned forward across the bare wooden table it is the americanjapanese alliance we both know japan covets your manchuria the japanese have always done so and now with the oil wells set aflame in the middle east by the muslim fundamentalists japan is frantic comrade frantic she imports ninety percent of her oil from the middle east without that oil she is nothing but your vast coal reserves in manchuria and in siberia put in cheng suddenly yes and those japan would like those too comrade and the americans are going to help her get them and all the other raw materials you have in manchuria if you let them yesov pushed forward his cup for a refill his gesture devoid of any sign that it was a request more like a demand a bluff perhaps thought cheng the only way for freeman to defeat us general with his back to the sea is for him to launch a preemptive flanking attack against us a left hook south across the amur west through northeastern china and mongolia to come around behind us at irkutsk west of lake baikal and soon while the ground is still firm enough for their armor our intelligence confirms it still cheng said nothing he didnt believe all yesov said for a minute but there was a halftruth in the russians presentation that alone could quickly develop into a fullblown ugly reality for china no matter who started it if fighting broke out again between the siberians and americans the siberians in order to split the american forces between lake baikal and khabarovsk would need to launch a right hook from their eastern mongolia through chinas inner mongolia and up across the black dragon which cheng noticed the marshal had still called the amur such a counterattack would mean freemans forces would be split in two by the siberian wedge coming out of chinese territory if beijing permitted it this was obviously what yesov was here for to come to an understanding so that the chinese would permit or rather turn a blind eye to siberian troops in transit on chinese soil well then proffered yesov his attention moving from the waterswollen leaves of the aromatic green tea to the generals impassive face if the americans violated chinese territory in attacking us would you would beijing have any objection to us sending forces up from mongolia across the amu the river to root them out if the americans violate chinese territory they will be attacked immediately by the peoples liberation army marshal but as to your request of transit for siberian troops i would have to ask beijing of course when might we expect an answer in due course the matter is urgent as im sure you realize comrade cheng intelligence reports tell us american armor is already massing along the hump we will decide when we are ready comrade it was one of the chinese characteristics that most infuriated yesov the refusal to give you a definite yes or no on the spot of course it had been the same in the old days with moscow everything had to go to ten different committees no one taking responsibility until it was too late it reminded him of the story about mao being asked whether he thought the invention of the wheel had been a forward or backward step for china mao considered the question and replied too early to tell general cheng rose followed by yesov the meeting was over cheng decided immediately to reinforce the chinese presence on his side of the border ordering two of the five armored divisions in shenyang the most northeastern province north from harbin to the banks of the black dragon river together with five of shenyangs fifteen infantry divisions and two artillery brigades even allowing for the fact that a chinese division had five thousand less than a western division it still meant a reinforcement of over men but with siberians americans and the chinese now caught in a tripartite of suspicion cheng was not content to rest in addition to his having unilaterally ordered more troops north across the yangtze to bolster the border defenses which would take days to implement other precautions must be taken accordingly cheng called an extraordinary meeting of both the central committee and the military commission all the members having their offices in the luxurious zhongnanhai compound on beijings avenue of eternal peace he explained the position succinctly pointing out that it was imperative that neither the siberians nor americans violate chinese territory it is clear comrades that if the americans move south across the black dragon novosibirsk will have no objection to us moving troops through siberianheld mongolia to repulse them but what if the americans imposed sanctions upon us general asked chairman nie as they did with hussein it would have no effect comrade cheng assured him one of their own has supplied and can go on supplying the pla with whatever it requires he meant la roche cheng leaned forward on the table his medal of merit ribbon for stopping us aggression in korea catching the fading snowreflected light that had penetrated the serenity of the zhongnanhai and for a moment he could hear the birds twittering outside above the two lakes while the americans hightech victory over the incompetent hussein might have been impressive to the western world comrades here the americans are back in asia here comrades they will not find demoralized disloyal badly supplied republican guards but the peoples liberation army who from the time of the long march know more about surviving and fighting on the land than anyone on earth there were knowing nods about the table but cheng was warming to his subject the pla had been was his life the chinese infantryman travels light comrades his mobility in the mountains is legendary cheng stood up like a schoolmaster knowing that all eyes were upon him this is precisely how general sung in under the very noses of the americans could move twelve divisions of the pla a hundred and sixty thousand men comrades from manchuria across the korean border to the chosin reservoir and the americans detected nothing until it was too late the plas ninth field army slaughtered the american marines general sung ordered his troops to kill these marines as you would snakes and we did even by the us imperialists own admission some marines went insane in the minusthirtyfourdegree battle they cannot take it and now they are far from home comrades their supply lines stretch across the pacific we would chop them to pieces and they have long noses added chairman nie which produced the only general laughter of the afternoon it signified the central committees confidence that cheng clearly understood the situation and was prepared to meet any contingency in the far northeast the central committee was also reassured by the knowledge that cheng had an important american who could provide whatever materiel was needed probably from south korea via vietnam should it become necessary after the meeting cheng was informed by his secretary that his request for artillery shells and aif smoke rounds had been received in shanghai and that mr li the cover name they used for la roche himself would be personally informed of the request in the interests of expediting delivery hao good cheng nodded and immediately placed another order by fax for three airport luggagetrain typeb axles the three meant three thousand and typeb axles stood for erfbbb shells these were extendedrange fullbore shells with a base bleed so that immediately after firing the gas was forced back into the shells air wake instead of around the shells where it would create drag when the round hit with little or no drag it had twice the explosive power two for the price of one la roche had told cheng but the one was very expensive even more so than usual because of the shady south african connection with the canadian gerald bull who had invented the superlong gun it was bulls research that made it possible for the erfbbbs rounds to be made the longrange bull gun that maximized their efficiency already on order by cheng but cheng wasnt a fool in the capitalist pool filled with sharks like la roche payment for the shells was contractually contingent upon the delivery of the guns first cheng already had a brigade of a far mm howitzers another offshoot of the canadians phenomenally effective sixwheelmounted thirtyfivemilerange gun the longestranged mobile gun in the world to get those at three million dollars apiece la roche had to go personally to austria to talk with voestalpine sa and sell them a line that he was buying them on the quiet for the us army for though bull was dead killed by the israeli mossad in brussels shortly before the iraqi war the americans were still touchy about bulls south african connection the ship the guns would be loaded on would suddenly disappear in a local storm somewhere in the east china sea en route to south korea its stated destination on top of that la roche would skim off the insurance and it would be substantial from lloyds during wartime there would be no chance of getting insurance but this was a ceasefire and he could get lloyds to underwrite it cheng knew that the vision of the lutine bell sounding at lloyds in london signaling another vessel lost at sea would make la roche smile it would mean millions more for him no matter that the base bleeds might well be being purchased for use against fellow americans along the chinesesiberian border and how if this was the case because of the guns ferocious accuracy twice as many americans would be killed and injured as under a normal artillery barrage while cheng finalized troop dispositions for the battle defense of the borders and the siberian omon black berets were taking alexsandra malof to the cells in harbin over five thousand miles away jay la roche was high drunk and aroused in his eightieth floor new york penthouse above the il trovatore bar asking francine what the hell she thought she was doing what you told me mr la roche dont mr la roche me you slut you love it dont you you he lurched up from the bed pulling the strap from her flinging it across the room dont have to be invited do you like it right bitch he lunged at her both hands grabbing her breasts losing his balance falling back on the waterbed the heavy slush sound mixing with francine crying in pain on top of him shut up you bitch they rolled off the bed onto the thick shag carpet he still hanging on to her letting go only when her rain of blows became too difficult to fend off she was screaming at him she ran to the bedroom door but couldnt open it he laughed there was a tearing noise like crushed cellophane and she saw him pulling on a condom for a moment or two he had his back to her and she saw him searching for something then he swung around holding his hand up victoriously showing her the snuff box flicking the lid open snapping it shut tossing it at her take a snort she did and in a few moments felt another rush i dont want to hit you again mister jay i dont want to hit you again jay turn around no please mister please jay she gasped he jerked her hard toward him then unsteadily swung her about slamming her face first up against the wall and she felt the searing pain as he entered her and tepid liquid running down her legs onto the carpet as he poured the bourbon over her buttocks the liquor spreading in a pool about her feet youve been to melvilles he charged yes but i you clean yes i the fuck you are thought you could pull a fast one on the boss eh eh no no he smacked her hard on the buttocks with his left hand im not getting your shitty germs she gasped again at the hot raw pain inside her rectum her arms spreadeagled against the wall nails hard into the wallpaper she felt she was going to black out he was breathing hard panting oh oh oh calling out i love you baby i love you but she knew he was talking about his lana now he was making blubbering crying noises as he pumped her harder and harder until he fell full against her lathered in sweat his breathing irregular and then he was sobbing clutching her waist and off to her side she could see he was still clutching a picture of his wife a moment later he staggered back from her collapsing on the bed get get out you slut his voice was hoarse and the next time he spoke barely audible ill get her back youll see ill get her back francine ran toward the bedroom door expecting it to be locked but this time it sprang open she didnt know how hed done it the place was full of buttons and traps and she didnt care moving quickly out into the living room lifting the phone punching the bar button jimmy you gotta help me i you in the penthouse yes for gods sake jimmy hes he use the knife on the bra what yes why get out im on my way up meet you at the elevator francine yeah you get out real quick hes not finished babe next cut wont be your clothes francine dropped the phone slipped off the chain and a moment later was standing out in the hallway next to the elevator in the il trovatore jimmy had called over a waiter to fill in walked quickly into the elevator and pushed the button for the penthouse floor the moment the doors slid open in she came stark naked jimmy gave her his bar jacket his other hand holding down the bypass lever his thumb pushing the button for the thirteenth floor she was shivering this is the only building in new york with a thirteenth floor jimmy said suddenly wanta know why hes crazy her eyes

congressman hailey had an accident la roches tabloids said it was suicide months later la roches wife was transferred to the aleutians another congressman in his pocket i guess so you be careful hear yeah francine yeah you enjoy it chapter nine for marshal yesov beijing had given the answer his forward observers reporting that from the ruins of kublai khans xanadu miles north of beijing on the great north plain as far north as manzhouli just south of siberias argunskiy mountains and in the northeast as far up as the black dragon river that formed the northernmost siberianchinese frontier chinese garrisons were being reinforced to repulse any incursion by the americans through northern chinas river valleys into siberia yesov was so pleased with the chinese action that he ordered all his forward observers and consulate liaison officers like ilya latov in harbin to simply refer to the amur as the jiangthe river in deference to chinese sensitivities and if so much as one american footprint or one shell or one american helicopter was sighted straying even for an instant across the border both siberian and chinese headquarters were to be notified immediately given their common watchdog duty some of the chinese and siberian junior ranks formed congenial relations during their daily radio reports to each other on the status of the wide ribbon of frozen river where temperatures had dropped to minus thirty in the passes the cold was no special travail for the northern troops from shenyang military region in china or for the siberians but it was a torture for the chinese regiments who came from south of the yangtze these southern chinese regiments some from as far away as canton hated the cold and were grateful that patrols were kept to a minimum so that the american helicopters buzzing up and down the border during the ceasefire would see nothing else but normal chinese patrol activity along the western part of the amur hump where the northern part of chinas inner mongolia jutted like a blunt spearhead around hulun lake into the northeasternmost sector of siberian mongolia finding that his eyes got tired after only a small time at the computer screens freeman had the reports run out on hard copy and was now going over them for any signs of an earlier than normal thaw at the same time trying to put himself in yesovs shoes should the siberian commander decide to attack across the westernmost defensive line of the ceasefire namely lake baikal freeman marked off possible siberian jumpoff points on the west bank of the fourhundredmile lake especially those down around the small port of baikal at the southern end which now lay in american hands under the terms of the ceasefire if yesov attacked freeman decided he would send in stealth bombers to try to take out the line along the cliffs that formed the southern arm of the transsiberian as it curved about the lake before dipping south into mongolia even with smart bombs however a rail line was notoriously difficult to take out as ties and rails could by replaced in a matter of hours he poured another black coffee and looked at his watch it was with only the ceasefire skeleton staff on duty even dick norton who tried to keep pace with the general had gone to bed at times freeman felt guilty for not having the time to think more about the welfare of his staff he hadnt even thought much about doreen his wife who had died only a short time before and for whose funeral he couldnt return the battle for ratmanov island raging at the time but he knew his first responsibility was to second army as a whole knowing that a surprise attack which neither washington nor london nor any of the other allies expected could presage a disaster doreen he was sure would have been the first to understand she had been the ideal servicemans wife uncomplaining ready to follow at a moments notice and if the truth be known the source of much of his earlier strength when as a young officer he was trying to make his mark in a field crowded with other veterans of the iraqi war he had experienced both hosannas and hoots the former when hed led the raid on pyongyang and reached baikal the latter when hed used fuel air explosives over ratmanov la roches tabloids in particular had alternated between making him a saint and a warmonger presently they were saying that he was a man obsessed by war unable to see that there could be an end to it they were right he was a warrior saw the world with a warriors eye but there was nothing he could do about that it was the way he was made when they walked on the spring grass people marveled at the beauty of swallows sweeping low so close to yet never quite touching the grass their darting bluemetal sheen a thing of joy to watch freeman enjoyed watching them too but he knew that it was the feet of the people visiting the park that scared up insects which the swallows then swooped low to kill and that this was every bit as much a part of the scene as was the beauty even the most tranquil scene he could remember the tidal pools he and doreen had seen around monterey were in fact miniature seas populated by creatures for whom battle was never ending you fought or you died dutch harbor was in darkness if the aurora borealis was kicking up its eels doolittle said some ruddy great clouds are in the way mate but his fellow patient frank shirer wasnt listening the flier his convalescence rapidly coming to an end was engrossed in the wall street journal that doolittle had given him it wasnt a paper frank normally perused neither did doolittle investment to the cockney constituting an eternal mystery stocks in his family were things robin hood was put in if the sheriff of nottingham ever caught him doolittle dragged heavily on his cigarette glancing down at the xeroxed page hed inserted into the newspaper so that no passersby including the md he called joe fridayjust the facts soldiercould see frank studying it bit of a fudge doolittle conceded fudge replied frank its downright cheating well mate this is the first time ive ever eard that a man who wants to get imself killed is cheatin thats a new one that is personally i wouldnt do it ive already done my bit squire for me its out on the old compo disabled soldiers pension to you and a deck chair on brighton beach lookin at the birds strolling up an down an i dont mean bloody sea gulls yep thatll do me nicely that will me the deck chair wiv a jar o flowers bitter he exhaled cigarette smoke appearing to come from every orifice in his head behind the bandages that covered the horrible burns hed suffered during the taking of ratmanov island and thats what id do if i were you mate he advised frank shirer crikey youve already done your bit for king and country besides you got a goodlookin bird that lanas a real corker she is all you need mate is the ruddy beach instead what you want to do go up in one of them bloody death traps again doolittle took another heavy drag on the players leaned back and shook his head hands together head smoking again like a double boiler about to blow he leaned over and tapping the xerox of the snellen eye chart told frank conspiratorially best days monday see when old joe friday snt around the new docs a bit unsure of imself so es followin the same bloody routine day after day same chart same sequence ail you have to know is which letters where right he puts is black patch stick over your good eye and asks you what you see you can make out the blur wiv your bad eye cant you yes just there you are then e points to the third blur in the fourth row and youve got it cause you memorized the chart right piece o cake the smoke came pouring down from the cockneys nostrils like a dragon and frank drew back out of range theyre so many guys es got to do see explained doolittle even if he changes the routine from one blur to another you memorize the chart youve got it besides you got one big thing going for you old cock yeah said frank wryly i could be courtmartialed the cockney laughed which was appropriate frank thought doolittle wouldnt be the one on a charge nah mate listen what you forget is none of these guys wants to pass the test what they want what youd want if you werent so bloody daft is to get home fast as they can start usin the old joystick in bed not up in the blue fucking yonder for doolittle his plan to put one over on the authorities in this case a greenhorn md fresh from medical school and not yet wise to the ways of the army was a bit of a lark but to frank it meant a restless night of old dreams of adolf galland the oneeyed german luftwaffe ace of the british ace douglas bader and the canadian rosin who after a sevenyear court battle with the army had won the right to be a paratrooper despite having only one eye visions of lana invaded the dreams as she fought her way through the crowd of pilots not saying a word and through it all there was the crackle of fighter pilots mixing it up in a furball a soviet mig going into the radardefying stall slide sergei marchenko the mikoyan works emblem on the fulcrums fuselage coming at the tomcat at mach in a steep dive the migs thirtymillimeter cannon winking followed by two white puffs as two aphid airtoair missiles streaked toward shirer his copilot yelling ive been hitand all because of information overload on the one good eye misreading the headsup display he pulled the tomcat hard out of the finger four formation going into the scissors so as to get marchenko to overfly him get the tomcat into the migs cone but then it was the tomcat his radar intercept officer screaming marchenkos fulcrum now in the tomcats cone of vulnerability there was a bang the cat shuddering violently and frank screaming at his rio to get out the next second he pulled the strip heard the explosive bolts go felt the wind tearing at his face like rushing through some vast refrigerator and heard the snap of his chute opening the rios on fire going down like a roman candle shush said a calming voice youll wake the whole ward and then the voice was gone it was dark only the dim pinpoints of light on the iv drip monitors telling him he was still in hospital they had been the same nightmares that had plagued him for weeks nightmares that he hadnt told lana about and which had been responsible for his sudden mood shifts unlike him but which he knew lana had noticed with increasing anxiety and so finally now with the arctic wind howling mournfully about the hospital at dutch harbor he made the decision to hell with the nightmares there was no way he wanted to live the rest of his life like so many haunted by regret hed have to find out in the only way he knew how hed do a bit of a fudge as doolittle had put it besides before they put him in a cockpit hed have to pass on ground simulators there he wouldnt kill anyone if his singleeye vision couldnt cope the worst hed do would be to flunk the course hed risk a courtmartial in the event that the green doctor wasnt as green as doolittle figured he got up put the hospital robe around him and made his way quietly through the ward and to the right toward the tv room he could hear that someone else was watching an old johnny carson rerun buddy hackett telling a joke about a guy yowling wah wah wah with awful genital pain so the guy goes to see doctor after doctor finally the only thing they could do they said was to remove his testicles they didnt have any other answer after his operation the guy goes to a mens clothing store buys a new suit asks for a couple of ties and asks for size thirtyfour waist underpants the clerk says he should get a size thirtysix the guy tells the clerk he knows what he wants and its a size thirtyfour clerk runs a tape measure around the guys waist and says no sir if you wore a thirtyfour youd have terrible pain in the testicles wah wah wah shirer roared laughing he was feeling so good now that hed made the decision the man watching the show another pilot whod also been wounded over ratmanov was just sitting there hands tremulous you okay asked frank the pilot shook his head but kept looking up at frank for help shirer saw a packet of cigarettes in the mans robe pocket and though he didnt smoke he took one and lit it up for the guy and sat with him watching the carson show the longer he sat there the more he wondered if somehow he should take the guys condition as a warning remembering one time how a top gun on salt lake city who graduated top of the class got shot down after fifteen missions everyone thought he was fine after and he was for seven more missions then bam everything came apart now just hearing the sound of going on afterburner made him a head case when you were young you never thought youd crack up it was the first time in months that general freeman had seen his aide dick norton unshaven and in pajamas the flannelet bottoms sticking out from underneath the greatcoat like redandwhitestriped barber poles as he came through the door and pulled the blackout curtain aside a flurry of snow blew in after him like an angry ghost despite the fact that his quarters were only ten yards from the hq quonset norton already looked half frozen freeman knew it must be urgent minus forty said norton handing the general the sitrep the buffcolored situation report folder with a crimson stripe across the righthand corner and marked top secret it told freeman there was marked activity all along the siberianchinese border the chinese had been moving up the shenyang army at night but here and there in gaps through the cloud cover infrared satellite photos had detected them only thing we can do dick is to keep a close eye on it i want to see all sitrep reports over china secret and above hopefully of course everyone else is right and im wrong and the ceasefirell hold maybe the chinese are just being prudent taking precautions as i would but if it doesnt hold i dont want to be caught with my pants down no sir meanwhile long as the chinese keep out of it we wont bother them the door flew open a sergeant his voice muffled by the khaki scarf that hid his face up to his eyes staggered in dusted with snow not bothering to look up and certainly not expecting the general to be up and about at this hour he stamped the snow off his boots proclaiming to the skeleton headquarters staff i dont think this fuckin bergll ever thaw out good answered freeman to the startled soldier if we have to engage son i want hard ground under our tracks chapter ten i must be sure insisted yesov i promise you marshal it was kirov head of the kgbs new and improvedas novosibirsk sarcastically put it first directorate covering canada and the us once the signal arrives in yes yes i know all that but this is not enough that your people are ready the point is your operation must precede my operation that is vital for me to begin concert the american convoys must lose their ability to reinforce freemans siberian garrison marshal i can assure you everythings in order you can start operation concert as you have planned my people will already be doing their part this i guarantee what is the code name youre using inquired yesov he wanted no mistakes no matter how remote the possibility of two operations being accorded the same name ballet sir said kirov smiling the marshal was not known for his sense of humor and in any case looked blankly then sternly at kirov who seemed very pleased with himself with the joining of his kirovs operation ballet with yesovs concert this is no joking matter kirov my intention is to kill every american in my sight gorbachev the fool might have liked them i do not nor i comrade with that the marshal of all the armies in the united siberian republic abruptly left he was ready despite the sudden drop to minus forty degrees reported in the american sector the longrange forecast was for a dramatic warming within the week and only then another plunge in temperature chapter eleven the two black berets were having a little fun with the jewess on the way one holding her tightly in the back of the police van the other feeling her beneath the long mongolian peasant skirt shed worn on the escape route from baikal through mongolia to harbin only now did alexsandra realize why latov without as much urging as she had thought would be necessary had told her about the troop buildup on the siberianchinese border and the movement of troops from the southern military regions across the yangtze at nanking the approach roads to other bridges over the great yellow river effectively useless because of the early spring floods in the warmer south cold she was shivering as much from fear as from the musty boneeating dampness of the cell in the gong an jus public security bureaus socalled new jail on zhongyang street the songhua river that ran past the jail was still frozen but water beneath the ice seeped into the cells from around the embankment and from stalin park for some reason she didnt understand instead of immediately dwelling on her situation indeed as she later realized as a way of denying the terror her capture now held for her she found herself thinking about how ironic it was that the chinese who took such pride in their selfreliance insisted on retaining and paying homage to two foreigners parks and streets were still being named after marx and stalin when the rest of the world including the new cis and the other soviet republics had torn down the demagogues of marxleninism a mr lo a pla guard behind him turned up promptly officiously flashing his id from harbins public security bureau he asked her ni hui shuo zhongwen ma do you speak chinese hui yidian i can a little her accent was not good ni hui shuo yingwen ma do you speak english mr lo asked shide she replied and completely disarmed him by asking why cant china think for herself why do you import foreigners to revere not once she pointed out had she seen even a small park named after mao mr lo scrambling for an answer explained that unlike the running dog revisionists of eastern europe who had betrayed marxism china had remained loyal as for her insult that china could not think for itself he said china had always thought for herself mr lo explained that the great helmsman had expressly forbidden personality cults and the deification of any particular leader this is why she had seen no mao parks or statues did the great helmsman tell the central committee alexsandra asked remaining seated calmly on the wooden stool looking up at him to let novosibirsk push you around to send troops at their bidding mr lo struck her once knocking her off the stool his voice if anything was quieter than before you are a stupid woman we do this as a protection against the american imperialists the americans wont invade china alexsandra shot back contemptuously she had learned enough from her previous interrogations to know that weakness only made them recognize their bullying for what it was and in their guilt they lashed out often more viciously than if you stood up to them the guard hauled her roughly to her feet putting her back on the stool ha said lo insolent you are a stupid woman you should have babies and concern yourself with wifely duties one child per family comrade retorted alexsandra but mr lo was long experienced too in interrogation and he suspected that her initial defiance was only gongfena centimeter thin the file he had been sent from her lake baikal interrogation had revealed the same pattern a brazen attempt to tough out the questioning right from the start very well mr lo thought he did not have time to mess around with stupid foreigners the public security bureau had instructed him to find out who were her cohorts in harbin she told him there were none she had come all this way on her own mr lo spoke to the guard who answered respectfully and immediately left the cell only to return a minute later with another guard the second man carrying a wooden chair to which they tied her and proceeded to beat her legs about the shins with split bamboo cane she did all she could to withstand the pain but soon was biting her lip tears running whimpering like a whipped puppy who are your cohorts asked mr lo quietly alexsandra didnt answer you are a bad woman she said nothing if you do not tell me in five minutes i will turn you over to black berets you understand she understood it would be much longer than five minutes any earlier and hed lose face you are a spy said mr lo who are your cohorts she could hear the slow drip of water from the wall nearest the river the cell so dark she could only make out a bead of sweat on mr los face and the dull sheen of the guards bayonet mr lo shook his finger at her we will put snakes in you do you wish this yes she told herself there were no snakes in harbin the idiot man it was too cold but unconsciously she pressed her thighs together it was a mistake lo now knew the long nose was more afraid than she made out he whispered to the guard who nodded quickly tied her hands behind her and left the room chapter twelve new york apart from the few guests from the plaza who had dared brave the cold briskly crossing from the luxurious comfort of the hotel to the chestnut barrow by the southeast entrance to the park a jogger was the vendors only customer what can i tell ya complained the vendor i had em poifect then bam bam bam everyone comes for lunch all in a bunch so now ya gotta wait they look done enough said the jogger a tall gangly man clad head to toe in a gray tracksuit his goatee beard crusted with snow his hood laced tightly in front and back of the gray jacket in dayglo tape there was a sign announcing to the world i dont carry cash credit cards or wristwatches he kept jogging in place you want them said the vendor stirring the chestnuts perfunctorily with his scoop you can have em but they aint cooked please yourself s only five minutes theyll be done whats your hurry the gray man slid a hand inside the tracksuits midriff pocket peeking at a stopwatch attached to the pocket with a safety pin got an appointment in five minutes the vendor pointed the scoop at the mans midriff thought you had no valuables the gray man shrugged worth a try hey hey hey yelled the vendor a limo passing fast by the curb throwing up an icy wave of slush you sonofabitch sticking his head under the barrows meager awning he turned to the gray man big shot jay la roche thinks he owns this fuckin town probably does said the tall man still jogging on the spot how you gonna pay me if you dont have no cash the jogger bent down and extracted a five from his right sneaker emergency funds he winked yeah right said the vendor his grin thin with cynicism some of those boys cut you up good you hold out on em he scooped up the chestnuts into one of the white bags and handed it to the man four bucks the runner kept jogging in place while the vendors hands did a number in his apron frowning and mumbling something about not having change the jogger kept marking time until the vendor grunted and gave him four quarters before throwing on another fistful of chestnuts it was a dead drop a note in the bottom of the paper bag with instructions for the next meet daytime meets were normally eschewed but with the first directorate under pressure from yesov kirov had decreed that operation ballet should go ahead as fast as possible the splash by jay la roche or whoever it was in the limo had nothing to do with it but the vendors reaction made it more convincing if the fbi or cia had been watching which the jogger doubted the americans hadnt yet broken a single threeman cell in the poisoned water crisis pcbs dumped in new yorks water supply earlier in the war true a member of one cell in queens who had kicked off the sabotage at the con eds indian point nuclear plant had reported to the jogger his control that he suspected he was being followed but control told him to relax everybody in the plant whod been on the shift and had clocked off twenty minutes before the bomb had exploded in the monitor room was being followed routine hell since the water crisis thousands of people were being followed besides con ed was turning out to be the cells best friend their pr busy talking down the sabotage as a nut case scared shitless that any sign of vulnerability at the indian point plant would start off fears of a meltdown not only at con ed but every friggin nuclear plant in the country the fbi cia and white house were going along with the nut case story too the water supply poisoning had been cleaned up many of the toxins leached out water quality measurements taken constantly instead of once a day and so now everyone was reassured on that score but if radiation got loose thatd be another story the americans were on the verge of panic security was now so tight at nuclear plants hell they wouldnt let the president in without thumbprint id for fear it might be a double the jogger kept moving cracking the chestnuts on the run as he made his way along central park south turning left on the fifth avenue dogleg entering the park proper on the east side down by the fountain a small man in a dark navy tracksuit doing stretching exercises started running a few seconds after the man in the gray had passed him catching up to him by the dairy they were both on the circuit pathway and headed down the mall before cutting across the sheep meadow to the snowcovered strawberry fields where they slowed and drew level blue and gray see you got your chestnuts okay said the man in the blue yes said the other man temporarily out of breath they hadnt stopped but were walking fast in a strong longdistance gait i thought the price was quite reasonable four dollars yes wellcooked best ive ever had all right said the smaller man ive got everyone set wheres the main event going down no idea all i was told was to get everyone in place weve had everyone in place for ten fucking years said the shorter man youre impatient doesnt do to get in a hurry we cant luck out much longer the gray man cracked one of the nuts dropping the shells on the pathway as they passed under a copse of snowdrooping sugar maples if somethings gone wrong he told the shorter man youd better tell me right now nothings gone wrong everybodys a bit edgy thats all why whats the rush after ten years a day here or there doesnt matter i dunno guess im stressed myself i mean i dont really know how it works yeah okay so i organize the team match the talent for the job but i dont know how its actually going to be done youve no need to know responded the man in gray his breath visible in short puffs of mist organizers arent supposed to know we cant all do one anothers job huh said the shorter man grabbing several chestnuts from the packet thats what the cia says is worst about our methods we dont have cross expertise so someone else can step in that right said the man in gray so who did in their water supply and knocked con ed out were doing all right theyre in a panic all we have to remember is everybody does one thing and does it properly its worked so far thats the only thing that matters id still like to understand the guts of it its not classified said the man in gray you can figure it out from any public library he knew it was a barren response one of the things you didnt do as a sleeper was to take out a lot of technical manuals from american libraries it was a sure invitation to surveillance what if something goes wrong said the shorter man then id have to do it shit this jobs the most important thing any of usll ever do right you could do it thats like telling me i could be a i dunno mario andretti cause i can drive i mean if something fizzes out halfway through if one of our guys is made ands taken out all right said the taller man but lets keep up the pace joggers dont stroll they increased the speed and he explained it not only how they would simply sow further panic but how theyd bring the country to its knees the old system of phones still used in most places back home he meant the cis they use analogwave signals sound waves goes out through the telephone exchange where you hear the clicks electromechanical switches then the signals go down cable pairs or to conductors if you like to the next switch and so on at the receiving end the telephone converts the electrical wave back to sound now with digital used all over america now you use the binary scale a series of zeros and ones representing any number you dial informations broken down the same way into zeros and ones like fax its sent via the bipolar pulsing system follow me no okay look christ youve eaten all the nuts you can buy some more what about this digital crap what im saying its a computerbased system that transmits all information voice data you name it in a binary code so for example the number sixteen is onezerozerozerozero ten is zeroonezeroonezero got that sort of not much good at math doesnt matter dont worry about it the point is what we get is a coded stream of pulses at megacycles a second thats over a million and a half pulses a second computer uses a wave form code anyway just think of it as a whole bunch of pulses containing zeros and ones right go on the taller man stopped for a moment to tie a lace his gray tracksuit patched with sweat despite the cold looking around to see if anyone was following then started off again now because youre dealing with all info in binary combinations of zeros and ones you can process signals much faster and more cheaply than with the old mechanical switches that have to clunk through one two three four five follow that yeah fine now digital networks all have to be synchronized otherwise in a sequence of zeros and ones you wouldnt know where the start of a message or the end of it was only problem is in order to have all the computers synchronized so they know where the start middle and end of a message is you have to have em all keyed into a cesium atomic clock its got the most accurate beat in the world thats why our guys are gonna hit the clock you win the car now when you lose synchronization with the clock you can free run awhile without synchronization but the ones and zeros start to pile up in no time run into one another like rush hour on the turnpike you have one big godawful traffic jam you with me yeah okay when that happens a pileup youre out of sync computer networks become a horizontal tower of babel most important thing data circuits like radar are much more sensitive than voice circuits so the data circuits pile up much faster or as the boys in the trade say the byte errorthe slippage becomes unmanageable and its garbage out so a page of printout that should normally take half a second runs two seconds loss factor four and alarms arent set off in the digital system the same way as they are in analog circuits you can alter the alarms through interfering with the software but another jogger was coming their way when he passed the man in gray turned about to double check then continued the weak link is that with the cesiumatomicclocksynchronization system everybody and i mean everybodythat is every computer has to be on the same mark the same clock right including the military no matter how many different codes there are military has to use the same synchronization so you hit the clock military computers go out at and ts stations board in new jersey lights up like the fourth of july massive computer network breakdown you remember the big screwups in the early s no biggest one was ninety january twentyninth two twentyfive pm hit every one of a hundred and fourteen big computers cost em over forty million year before in paris the big police computer went on the fritz misread over thirtynine thousand magnetized labels of drivers licenses started charging auto drivers all over france with everything from rape to homicide it was beautiful doesnt the military have a backup sure dont have to use land lines can use satellite pulses but if the cesium clocks out its all over except for the crystals what are they crystals closest things to the cesium clock in their beat accuracy only trouble is they have to keep them in double ovenconstant temperature if you lose the clock the idea is you go to holdover using the crystals as your drum the tall man paused then smiled course if you cut off the electric power no oven thats what your third man in the cell is going to do so then all the defense computers are down youve got it military gets the old all circuits are busy crap just like everybody else the entire continentalbased missile defense system of the united states shuts down because over ninety percent of all military phones in this country are slaved to at and t and the other companies private enterprise at its best my friend what about the other carriers ma bell and all in the same boat the clock goes they go i love complex microchip technology its so easy to fuck up when do we move when you see the ad they walked down toward the swedish cottage where they said goodbye they would not meet again everything was in place the man in blue turned left and exited on west eightyfirst street the other walked into the american museum of natural history there was a new acquisition of precambrian fossils it put everything in perspective the fossils were all that remained of an entire epoch the christians were right about that in the end it was all dust to dust ashes to ashes the exhibits attendant who looked a little precambrian himself gave the jogger a glance that said he wished visitors to the museum would be better dressed then again he was mollified by the fact that unlike the ruffians on the streets here at least was a man of breeding a man of cultural refinement the jogger looked up at the museum clock it was hours kirovs ballet was about to begin what the man in gray hadnt told his cohort was that the really big payoff of such a massive computer screwup would be the havoc it would play with the navys burst coded communications for its submarines at sea they wouldnt know what the hell was going on and if they came up near the surface to get emergency tacamo take charge and move out aircraft messages novosibirsk would pick up the displacement bulge the radiant heat difference between the sub and sea temperature and bam theyd be targeted by the siberian fleets hunterkiller subs before the americans knew it its wonderful isnt it commented the attendant for the precambrian exhibit certainly is chapter thirteen khabarovsk freeman was kneeling saying his prayers there was a crack like pine board splitting he spun about grabbed the riot gun its five rounds filled with razorsharp flechettes and aimed it at the door hed dismissed the reporters rumor about a possible spetsnaz attack but all the same there was no one at the door he lifted the phone connecting him to the duty officer what in hell was that river sir ice splitting call our baikal command on the ceasefire line ask if the lakes breaking up yes sir and lieutenant sir you wake me the moment you hear yes general the duty officer rang back moments later reporting everythings fine at baikal sir nothings moving the worlds moving lieutenant we just arent aware of it most of the time yes sir relieved freeman knelt to finish his prayer almighty god arm us amen before putting out the light he scribbled a memo to the padre who had given a sermon for twenty minutes ten longer than necessary in freemans view a homily in which the padre had told the second army congregation that prayer may not indeed be heard by a supreme being but was a way of personally reminding ourselves of our individual responsibility to the collective spirit freeman had been appalled it wasnt enough he told norton that he had to put up with weakkneed strategists back in washington now he had to contend with goddamn revisionist priests who rather than delivering the word of god straight and undiluted had to stoop to secular interpretation of prayer so as not to offend the liberal fairies the general in an unprecedented move had risen in the quonset during the service and looking about at the congregation of servicemen helmet under his arm declared with all due respect to the padre here i feel it is my duty as your commanding officer to inform you that as far as i am concerned god directly hears your prayers and will not fail usif we prove worthy as the padres face grew redder by the second freeman had continued it is our bounden duty to thrash these neocommunist sons of bitches in their new garb so soundly that they will never again doubt americas will on the memo pad by his bed he also scribbled an order to colonel dick norton for immediate attention to supply no fairy bibles will be permitted in second army king james version only i dont want my men fighting and dying should it come to that with some nambypamby god is my pal version of some liberal new york hippy diocese i expect your cooperation signed general douglas freeman on the south bank the chinese side of the argun river which formed the western side of the amur or black dragon hump the first round to rupture the ceasefire was audible to the chinese seconds before it hit them its staccato shuffling sounded like some giant steam locomotive moving rapidly in the blackness above them the heat envelope of the mm he head having concertinaed the frigid air it landed a hundred yards behind them its explosion lighting up what looked like glasscovered brambles as the hoarfrost melted from uprooted bushes that a moment before had been under a mantle of virgin snow and were now flying through the air in an eruption of black dirt and snow shrapnel singing like bees slashing into the advance battery of the shenyang military regions sixteenth army its mm field guns dug in under snowcamouflage netting high above the river their forward observation posts using the sovietmade combination infrared laser rangefinder caught the flash of the second round two to three miles across the river and the officer commanding the battery was on the radio to group army headquarters at manzhouli reporting that the direct fire was coming from high ground in the direction of srednearaunsk in the hills on the americanheld side within two minutes four other he rounds had bracketed the chinese position killing one loader and exploding a long march ammunition truck and the chinese battery had returned fire with six rounds of he from their mm thirteenmilerange guns soon in this the southwestern sector of the amurargun hump firing erupted all along the line especially along the west to east dip formed by the still extant wall of genghis khan fortythree miles east of manzhouli quickly other american and chinese batteries opened up on one another american mlrss multiple launch rocket systems lit up the night sky with what the mlrs troops called white lasers streaking salvos of thirteenfootlong nineinchdiameter pound rockets each rocket with a range of eighteen miles twelve rockets fired at once from each of a dozen mlrs units spread along the length of the khan wall at times there were salvos of rockets in one minute white parallel lines in the night sky the rockets not designed to take out pinpoint targets but to saturate a wide area and to sow chaos among the enemy troops this they did especially among the forward units of the shenyang sixteenth army as the coffee cups or polyurethane foam containers from pound mlrs rockets each carrying over six hundred antipersonnelantimatériel submunitions rained down after each warheads time had set off its blowout black powder charge thousands of tiny submunition chutes were scattered over an ovalshaped area of several miles in which the m submunitions exploded on contact ripping through flesh andor light armor in the chinese battery that had been first hit there were twentysix dead and over two hundred wounded in the first ten minutes of combat within two hours three group armies the shenyang military regions sixteenth sixtyfourth and thirtyninth were on the move the spearhead of an attack on a seventyfivemile front formed by the twentyseventh army group whose reputation had been made when they had swarmed down changan avenue and shot children as well as the young protesters of the democracy movement on the night of june when above tiananmen the voice of big brother in the loudspeakers had declared your movement is bound to fail it is foreign this is china not america the twentyseventh promised general cheng who had particularly ordered that the imperialist battery that had fired the first shot of the war be taken alive for all the world to see will know what to do with them after in general freemans khabarovsk headquarters hundreds of miles to the north the noise level of radio traffic was near deafening the situation board a computer screen blowup showing fighting had broken out all along the border in the southwest sector of the hump chicom divisions were already moving north en masse fanning out toward kulusutay to the east and dauriya seventy miles to the west and in the foothills of the fourthousandfoothigh argunskiy mountain range the infamous twentyseventh had already crossed the border men and equipment making good time across the frozen marshes just south of genghis khans wall freeman for all his warnings about a breakdown of the ceasefire was in shock stunned now that it had actually happened staring at himself in the mirror he slipped the ninemillimeter parabellum into his waistband and was buttoning up his tunic as if in a state of hypnosis as dick norton knocked waited knocked again then alarmed at not receiving an answer opened the door to the generals room he took the generals silence for extreme calm under pressure not realizing what a devastating blow it had been to freeman now that it had actually happened it made no sense to freeman the american second armyhis army was suddenly in a war with china a country of over a billion people he didnt have to imagine what effect it would have on the american public on the white house the almost certain attempt of his enemies in and outside the pentagon if not on the presidents staff itself to hold him personally responsible for having broken the ceasefire he was stunned by the supreme irony that of all his warnings about the ceasefire being broken the possibility that it would be broken by china had never deep down been seriously entertained by him he had taken their border movements to be merely precautionary but he knew that those against him back home looking for a scapegoat would recall his warnings about a possible ceasefire rupture together with his wanting to pursue the siberians before the ceasefire and in it they would see him guilty of having made a preemptive strike the shock was wearing off now he had always been contemptuous of stalins state of mind upon being informed that the wehrmacht legions were upon him after he had signed the hitlerstalin pact now as much as hed detested the communist leader freeman knew what it must have felt like but for freeman the very recognition he was in shock was the signal he was on his way out of it general it was norton following him out into a river of khaki some officers still with white snow overlays on passing about freeman and norton like rapids in a stream what is it dick sir the chinese are claiming we started it bullshit norton handed him a satrecon photograph it had been taken with an infrared sensor a white spot like a pinpoint of overexposed film circled on the photo freeman felt his heart pounding you cant see it with the naked eye commented norton but on computer enhancement they say you can actually see the black side blasts coming out of the muzzle brake its definitely a us mm howitzer towed not selfpropelled so normally norton would have lowered his voice for what he was about to tell the general but in the nearfrantic hubbub of the hq it was unnecessary this was fired at oh five hundred hours general ten minutes before the first report from our side of chinese fire freeman grunted not wanting to acknowledge the frightening implication of nortons words probably took ten minutes for our reports to get passed down the line you know how it is fog of war dick the fog of we had the report within a minute sir it looks like we fired first norton continued anticipating the generals next question were trying to pinpoint the unit seems to be one of five corps batteries near kulusutay they shouldnt be where they are but maybe they saw chicom infantry on the move and changed positions for a better traverse anyway we cant raise them either their radios out or doesnt make any difference said freeman and norton knew the general was right whatever the cause battle was joined the white house however demanded that responsibility for the first shot be ascertained immediately repeat immediately the decoded most secret message from the white house added that all hell had broken out in the un the suspicion that freeman had precipitated a war trumpeted to near certainty by the media especially the la roche chain of newspapers in the us and abroad already the new york times had obtained from an anonymous source another print of the photograph from the pentagon showing the first shot satrecon snap which the times said was confirmed by independent analysis to be genuine the time on the photograph being automatically registered on such satellite overflights on the bottom righthand corner of the photograph with three chinese group armies in excess of men coming at second armys left or southern flank men freeman was in no mood to bother with the white house request but knew if he didnt he might be out of a job he might be out of one anyway dick sir it wasnt norton answering but the communications duty officer cutting in what is it major sir five corps hq say theyve tried to reach the battery that supposedly fired first but theres no radio communication and the chicoms are closing five corps g estimates that unless we haul them out within the next ten to twelve hours the chicoms will overrun the position well what in hell is five corps air cavalry doing demanded freeman sitting on their butts get the goddamn helos in there thats part of the problem sir its still pretty cold but the temperatures rising so now we have a lot of fog and weve run into qing fives qing fives retorted freeman angrily contemptuous of the chinese fighter god damn it major a qing fives just a bucket of crap with a jet engine strapped to it yes sir our fightersll make mincemeat of the qings all right when they get there but the best they can do is keep the chicoms away from the five corps battery getting helos in there to get our boys out is another question chicoms are reportedly using surfacetoair missiles even against our light reconnaissance aircraft god damn it said freeman glaring at the situation board soviet munitions whatd i tell you dick birds of a feather well sir the siberians havent moved and thank god for that replied freeman dick send in a commando team to help get those five corps artillery battery guys out before the damn chicoms overrun it freeman glanced up at the special forces availability board we have any sasdelta force men around david brentwood guy you used on ratmanovs here somewhere in khabarovsk where in khabarovsk i dont know exact well find him dick tell him to get a team together men hes worked with before i dont want any screwups use army lynx helos to fly noe i want that sasd team in and out fast tell them to rescue as many of our guys as possible and bring them straight to me try to get me the battery commander if possible so i can shoot the son of a bitch myself norton was already making notes and issuing orders for the best noe nap of the earth lynx chopper pilots in the division even as the tote board above freemans hqs radio row was going crazy with blipping red lights each the size of a glowing cigarette tip and representing a chicom regimental advance of over two thousand men the reds outnumbering the stationary blues the us regiments ten to one what a screwup opined a radio operator giving up his seat to his replacement indicating the unofficial but widespread assessment of the situation shut up it was the duty officer reprimanding him freeman held up his hand to intervene you got a complaint soldier the radio operator who hadnt realized the general was nearby visibly gulped complaint no sir yes you have weve got most of our divisions on baikals west shore to stave off a siberian violation of the ceasefire and instead i get hit on the southern flank by the chinese well son youve got every right to be mad so am i yes sir freeman putting his arm around the operator steered him toward the coffee urn tell you fellas something else everyone was listening im gonna change that right about now yes general with that freeman ordered alternate divisions every second division on the baikal line pulled out to head southeast to block the chinese advance on his southern flank and ordered airtac strikes against the chicom divisions to hold them off long enough until the alternate divisions from baikal can reach the chinese and attack were going to turn that goddamn yellow peril into chop suey the surge in morale that the generals words produced was palpable in the hq hut and norton shook his head at the duty officer smiling in admiration of freemans ability to so quickly raise the spirits of his troops freeman called norton over the general was still grinning but his words told a different story tell washington i want every reserve every ounce of gas every bullet theyve got and i want it over here pronto i know we cant do it all by airlift but get those big cs started dick and get em moving those convoys out from pearl and the west coast i smell a big fucking rat and his names yesov if that son of a bitch violates the ceasefire at baikal well have a twofront war on our hands he paused norton noting that he was short of breath any sign of him moving dick no sir norton indicated the met board therere blizzard conditions around baikal anyway he could still move dick visibility or not besides the temperatures rising doesnt feel like it i know but it is ice is starting to break up besides blizzards only thing that can stop our air force laser bombs and all not even the stealths can laser designate targets in that lot i dont think hell attack general by god i hope youre right dick twofront war east and south our backs to the sea be a goddamn nightmare chapter fourteen between irkutsk forty miles west of lake baikal and the lake in the village of bolshaya rechka a babushka wrapped her black scarf tightly around her head before she stepped out on her porch as she stooped to grasp the two splintery pine sticks that stood up from the frozen paper cups of milk she heard a squeaking noise that reminded her of her youth on the communes tractors starting the harvest then the giant popsiclelike milks at her side she stood transfixed staring through the thick white curtain of falling snow the enormous shapes becoming more distinct by the second armor tanks and enormous field guns their weight on bipods atop the biggest tractor tracks shed ever seen they were all around her albino leviathans crawling inexorably eastward toward lake baikal after a while the old peasant woman stopped counting each of the more than three hundred threemancrewed siberian tm main battle tanks an apsds armorpiercingfinstabilized discarding sabot round in its big mm gun stopped seven miles from the western shore on the southern end of the fourhundredmilelong bananashaped lake the tank regiments overall komandir general minsky of the tenth guards slutsk division had at last been given the task he craved his orders to spearhead the attack and defeat the americans he was eager but tense his head tank regiment with ninetythree of the slutsk guards divisions main battle tanks assigned to undertake zadacha dniaa total rout in the american sector in the southwestern baikal and the zadacha dnia had to be completed in no less than twentyfour hours before the americans could recover and regroup minskys initial artillerytank attack in his sector would be followed by what yesov had declared would be a merciless presledovatelnyi boia pursuit of lightning savagery designed to finish off the retreating americans on the ice before they reached the relative safety of the taiga twenty miles across the lake from the small town of port baikal and following minsky ready to spread out north and south of him after his blitzkrieg were the remainder of the four thousand tanks advancing on a fortyeightmile or eightykilometer front the maximum that anyone like yesov trained at the frunze academy felt comfortable with immediately behind minskys ninetythreetank spearhead came the regiments fortysix bmps armored personnel carriers with higher velocity and harderhitting thirtymillimeter guns replacing the old seventythree millimeters and behind them the regiments eighteen selfpropelled mm thirteenmilerange guns and the bm multiple rocket launchers forty tubes to each launcher the slutsk divisions artillery regiment of nine selfpropelled s mm guns was kept as far back as possible while up front yesov had his selfpropelled howitzers their crews so razorsharp that it would take them only seven minutes under half the time required for the towed guns to have the guns fully emplaced and ready for firing these selfpropelled howitzers were the new ms amphibious versions of the old m mm degreerotation howitzer their drive sprockets while wellprotected being located forward and beneath the sloping glacis plate nevertheless squeaked like the unoiled rail cars of the transsiberian which a few miles back on minskys right or southern flank were even now hauling the supplies toward the lake including a full range of main battletank mm he apds and hesh heat squash head ammunition the babushka now back inside her small bungalow the woodcarved fretwork beneath the snowfilled window boxes shuddering like something alive watched fearfully as the entire advance came to a halt for a moment she could hear only the noise of mournful howling of the blizzard driving itself against the already snowladen birch forest but then she saw something that completely mystified her as the armored personnel carriers with their blunt bargelike snouts advanced in line through the columns of main battle tanks and selfpropelled artillery and obeying flag signals yesov having banned any radio transmits slowly turned left northward in unison like a long line of prehistoric monoliths issuing forth enormous billowing clouds of thick flourwhite smoke into the white purity of the blizzard stranno crazy the babushka told her husband an old reservist who had lost a leg in the final days before the ceasefire during the american commando attack on the missilelaunching midget subs base at baikal theyre making camouflage he answered grumpily cutting one of the rationed brickhard sugar cubes in half clenching it between his teeth before sucking through the strong hot samovarbrewed tea the samovars brassy shine in stark contrast to the dank darkness of the cabin what do you mean camouflage she asked him its crazy the snow is already white camouflage enough you dont know anything he grumped the sugar only now starting to dissolve its smallparticle smoke he explained thicker than usual it will stop the americans infrared scopes from seeing the heat exhaust of our tanks and big mobile guns when they begin the attack infrared can see through normal smoke its crazy she repeated ill tell you whats crazy he told her reaching for his crutch a rough triangle of birch wood its shoulder pad a small arc of rubber from an american humvee part of the american equipment captured in one of the last firefights around the southern end of the lake before the ceasefire its crazy for us to stay up here wed best get down to the cellar before there was a tremendous crash the door flung open the blizzard howling in a halfdozen whitehooded whiteclothed figures barging in like angry ghosts idite you must go ordered the lieutenant we are commandeering your house the other men were already pushing past the babushka two of them moving toward the basement unraveling a coil of wire held between them idi go said the babushka where to pray back answered the lieutenant using the ak to motion westward over his shoulder in the general direction of irkutsk but thats over forty kilometers she protested the husband caught a glimpse of a blueandwhitestriped tshirt as the lieutenant took off his white camouflage overlays to better handle the land lines that they were in the process of laying the land lines would be much more secure for being sheathed and so much less likely than wireless radio traffic to be jammed by american electronic countermeasures once the fighting started the old man however was more interested in the blueandwhite tshirt it told him they were spets be quiet natasha he cautioned his wife theyll have a truck to take you back to podkamennaya said the lieutenant sticking the ak through the line spool thats no good protested the babushka defiantly thats still over twenty kilometers from ir its warming the lieutenant said on the lake the ice is starting to break up it wont be such a cold walk come on said the husband he knew the spets would have another kind of answer if they protested too much didnt she realize that a major attack was about to start radi boga tishe for gods sake be quiet he told her pushing at her with the crutch anxious to get as far away as possible once the land lines were connected hell would erupt chapter fifteen khabarovsk i tell you declared freeman i dont trust the sons of bitches theyre going to hit us dick he paused looking at the map god damn this snow his hand swept up covering the entire northsouth axis of the lake no way we can protect it all so we have to narrow the field if he penetrates our defenses and gets on that ice four hundred miles he shook his head at the thought he could move a division anywhere across there in less than well i know aerial reconnaissance doesnt show anything because of the blizzard general but theres no ir report either not a sign theyre advancing could be using ir suppressor smoke if only i could launch a preemptive strike on irkutsk or wed be condemned by every country in the un cut in norton as well as our allies fighting to push back the chinese is one thing sir but us breaking the ceasefire with the siberians would youre right dammit conceded freeman turning away from the map to the toteboard display trying to put himself in yesovs shoes great weakness of a democracy dick we can only finish a war cant start it would you want it any other way proffered norton anticipating the question might be asked in the news conference about to start in the briefing room freeman didnt answer but his grimace was reply enough hell im in trouble enough with washington trying to convince them beijing started this crap on our southern sector peering down over his reading glasses he swept his hand over the midsection of the map course yesov couldnt spread himself too thin either even if he had every division of his he wouldnt risk a fourhundredmilelong front soon as the bad weather lifted our tacaird rip him to pieces the general took off his glasses and pinched the bridge of his nose in his fatigue then again we cant hold very much of it either having to move most of our forces south to help push the chinks back norton experienced a surge of panic instinctively looking around for any media types who might have somehow wandered through security from the briefing room where even now chairs were scraping the quonset hut floor as a gaggle of over media vultures as freeman called them from around the world were assembling they were hungry for general douglas freemans latest assessment of and explanation for what the chinese and others in the un were calling an unprovoked imperialist attack upon the peoples republic of china and one that would be severely punished by the peoples liberation army general urged norton youd better be careful what you say if the la roche papers got hold of something like that freeman was looking at him amused what the hellre you talking about chinks said norton they get hold of something like that general and youll have every civil rights group from here to ah to hell with them you know i dont mean any disrespect toward the little yellow bastards damn good soldiers only color i care about is anyone whos yellow inside i know that general but well you know what newspapers are like i think wed better stick to chicoms norton advised pointing out that ironically it was the gutter press of the la roche papers who were the real racists who would make such a big deal of such a slip la roches tabloids were already talking about swarms of chinese communists attacking the american positions in the southwest corner of the amur humpswarms creating the nonetoosubtle implication that the americans were being attacked by subhumans on the front with american casualties mounting not because of the chinese numbers but because of their tenacity and skill u s soldiers were already making their ironic comments on the la roche reporters telling sergeants theyd just shot another swarm when only one chicom fell theyre all out there sir it was the generals briefing room aide in charge of setting up the appropriate charts and maps freeman turned away from baikal ran a comb through his gray shock of hair put his forage cap on square and center and hitched his trousers a notch careful to make sure his tunic waistband was over the ninemillimeter parabellum with which hed replaced the old hivel automatic that he used to carry and sleep with beneath his pillow hed debated about replacing that hivel hed had it all through europe and korea and it had become a kind of talisman but he liked the sig sauer better and anyway he hated staying with anything because of superstition said it bred lack of selfconfidence didnt go with ball players not changing their underwear because they believed it brought them luck hell only reason they make another home run is because one whiff of emd knock any baseman off the bag as the general and norton stepped into the press room norton was momentarily blinded by the multiple explosions of flashbulbs amid the mass of mikeclutching reporters already in a feeding frenzy over what the chinese incursion meant and what wording the general was going to use and what washington thought about the general and was it true that they were keeping him on a tight leash the general looked serious yet not grim concerned but not stressed the furrows in his brow as much a signal to those members of the press who already knew him that he not the press corps was going to set the agenda and that the television klieg lights were too bright he held his hands up for silence ladies and gentlemen before i take any questions i wish to clarify an unfortunate error reported by some of you who shouted one young reporter a woman midtwenties goodlooking her red hair conspicuous in the glare the strap of the pentax camera slung about her neck bisecting her breastline making her figure even more prominent as she lunged forward with a fishingrodlike boom mike her emeraldgreen eyes keen with the determination not to let her inexperience stand in her way unfortunate error by whom general she shouted freeman wanted to say by the toilet newspapers of the la roche chain but nortons cough by his side cautioned him from being specific to remember what he himself had told norton that vexatious reporters are the most venomous vengeful bastards in the world its been reported freeman began that our positions in the southwestern sector of the amur hump have been attacked by swarms of chinese infantry now im here to tell you the chinese have never attacked in swarms here in korea or anywhere else that was a myth concocted by overeager reporters trying to win brownie points with fat unfit editors back home there were ripples of laughter and norton starting a coughing fit chinese infantry freeman proceeded hands akimbo seldom attack above regimental level and they attack welldefined targets they dont swarm over anything like any other army the chinese army norton coughed whispering dont offend taiwan the chinese communists continued freeman have never launched hordes or swarms as one of your colleagues put it thats a bunch of coon dirt there was more laughter and those stories about one in ten chinese infantry being properly armed the other nine yahooing and beating bamboo until they get a chance to pick up a dead mans weapon are a figment of some reporters imagination now admittedly that might have occurred here and there in korea but not here the peoples liberation armys weapons are simple highly reliable and theyve got plenty of em i can assure you we are not beating swarms we are fighting highly trained ground troops on their own ground you mean you dont think we can win another vietnam even some of the older reporters turned around surprised by the redheads chutzpa though most of them norton suspected were drawn as much by her cleavage as she once again thrust the mike above her colleagues heads toward the general not at all replied freeman icily what im saying is that the enemy is formidable but that i believe the american soldier can and will regain lost ground and but can we win general the redheads mike was barely a foot from freemans face other reporters ducking out of the booms way the general didnt notice he was reading a scribbled note hastily passed from the duty officer to norton and thence to the general thats all thank you he announced crisply and was gone the uproar from the media reminded norton of rock and roll aficionados just informed of a noshow where demanded freeman whipping off his forage cap in the ops room throwing it down on the table before the map of lake baikal the hum of computers and bursts of radio traffic stabbing in the background here said norton indicating a point just north of the southernmost end of the lake his fingers slid farther along and here then he tapped a third position farther north of the other two and like them on the western side of the lake estimated strength asked freeman four possibly six divisions least a hundred thousand men the duty officer cut in g suspects spets troops are the spearheads whatever the troop concentration general were looking at three breakthrough points satelliteconfirmed pressed freeman he wasnt about to commit any reserves to possible feints by yesov until in the absence of aerial reconnaissance reports he had confirmed visual sightings infraredconfirmed in each case general theyre moving east all right straight toward our three corps at port baikal no doubt about it radio intercepts nothing there sir apparently yesovs got them moving by flag signal and sheathed land line so we have no intercepts now lookit jimmy freeman replied his eyes fixing his duty officer i dont want another skovorodino road trap here the duty officer was aware that there were no roads along most of the lake but knew immediately what freeman meant were they fake tanks as theyd been at skovorodino before the ceasefire giving off infrared signatures in hopes of dummying freeman into committing his revetted armor at port baikal to precisely the wrong places leaving port baikal largely defenseless ive already thought of that one sir no sir its the real thing all right infrared images were moving flashlights can move how about our ground sensors got that one covered too general snow muffles the sensors all right so nothing registered for a while but then port baikal started registering definite shakes horizontal movement mileandahalfadvance rumble theyre main battle tanks sir theyre not driving fake tanks around on truck chassis if thats what youre concerned about the duty officer turned and snatched up a sitrep sheet saving the best evidence for last besides one of our patrols out of port baikal halfway down to kultuk at the southern end of the lake got an law round off he was up a tree general literally put his shot right through the tanks cupola said the thing went up like the fourth of july kept rolling couple of siberians tried to get out on fire when they hit the snow and our patrol inquired freeman not so good general three confirmed dead two missing but the other four got back to port baikal freeman was nodding looking worriedly at the map the three points fifty miles apart now marked with red circles a large s inside of each a milelong front how did our patrol get back so fast ahead of the siberian tanks they used four arrows freeman nodded the arrows werent the israeli antimissile missiles but the small snow vehicles that young david brentwood and his sasdelta commando team had used to go across the lake before the ceasefire to take out the midget sub pens at port baikal we gentlemen said freeman looking from the duty officer to norton and back are in a fix if we recall any of our troops weve ordered south against the chicoms the chicomsll punch an even bigger hole through our southern flank but if i dont stop this siberian triple playhis knuckle rapped the middle of the three red circles marking the milewide siberian offensiveour boysll have to hightail it across that ice leave all our heavy equipment behind if theyre to make it in time he dismissed the idea of such a retreat as quickly as it had occurred to him it was die worstcase scenario any sign of the weather clearing fraid not general answered the duty officer showing him the isobar printout from harvey simmet the senior met officer its warming but thats only going to mean more fog and theyre only miles from our boys on the lake even if we call in tacair now that we more or less know their positions our as are gonna have one hell of a time with iff he meant identifying friend or foe freeman knew the duty officer was right and recalled that even in the relatively unlimited visibility of operation desert storm schwarzkopf had lost over twenty percent of those killed in action to friendly fire these socalled fratricidal casualties ten times higher than in any military action in the twentieth century including world war two and vietnam that cunning bastard yesov said freeman facing the map knows damn well we cant use tacair when hes so close and you know why hes so close freeman turned around eyes bright with anger because those fairies back in washington insisted on a ceasefire all right dick now listen up i want all our units north of the siberian midpoint here on the west side of the lake to pull south fast as they can to reinforce the units between the midpoint designation stwo and the siberians southernmost point at the end of the lake designation sthree thatll buy us some time now when that northernmost part of yesovs assault line sone reaches the lake itll start to pivot south already norton was seeing the generals plan and not for the first time was filled with admiration at the sheer speed of freemans analysis this wasnt grace under pressure it was brilliance right said norton and when they pivot their armor will have to come out onto the ice and so will their southern arm said freeman sthree theyll try to pincer us box us in with their triple play their armor coming at us through the taiga west of the lake down from the north on the ice and up from the south on the ice freeman was smiling at norton the marshal is going to get a big surprise dick son of a bitch waited until the warming started figuring i couldnt move armor east fast enough through the thaw least not as far as lake baikals west shore to stop him well hes right but that cocky bastard is in for an earlier springtime than he anticipated gentlemen freeman was positively beaming striding to the huge wall map he took the dayglo marker pen and drew a crimson slash line from the siberian mid or stwo position east across the lake drawing another line parallel to it east across the lake from the sthree position farther south those tramtracks are our corridor gentlemen fifty miles wide south to north on our front twenty miles deep west to east from port baikal to the lakes eastern shore now dick i want volunteers to lay the flare lines for the corridor a mile or so out from the western edge of the lake then once thats done tell the tacair boys to hit anything outside the corridor now the duty officer was starting to see it the flares would mark the outer limits of the american defense any siberian tanks north or south that ventured out onto the ice attempting to encircle and cut off the americans from the far eastern shore in a pincer movement would have to forego the formidable protection of the dense taiga even in heavy fog their infrared signatures would be more easily picked up on the completely uncluttered background of the ice it would be a killing ground for the a thunderbolts thirtymillimeter guns a killing ground that would be as devastating for the siberians as the basra road had been for die fleeing iraqi armor just as the republican guards tanks had broken out from their underground shelters to do battle only to be slaughtered in the open the siberian tanks would be doomed the moment they emerged from the thick cover of shoreline taiga convinced he was approaching the crowning moment of his career freeman tried but simply could not contain his excitement knowing that snatching victory from such an apparently massive defeat would astonish the world and forever place him in the annals of warfare meanwhile as the babushka and her husband were driven west of the lake toward podkamennaya township general minskys regiment sat still including the bmps which though stationary were still churning out thick white smoke into the already thick whiteness of the blizzard waiting chapter sixteen aleutian islands alaska as if the lineup outside the doctors office at the dutch harbor hospital wasnt creating enough pressure on the new young ophthalmologist no one could find the pointer hed brought with him to use for the snellen eye chart it was a small detail but it flustered him as more and more it seemed he was losing control of the situation just when he wanted to be most impressive in the wounded veterans sight and to top it off an obstreperous patient a limey by his accent was loudly complaining outside the doctors office ere whats the bloody oldup then avent got all bloody week ave we you know the army commented another patient hurry up and wait well said doolittle we aint in the bloody army are we this is the senior bloody service would you behave yourself it was mother attila the head nurse doolittles fellow britisher assigned to the allied naval hospital she was big and heavy her trajectory so unpredictable they had begun to call her scud ill put you on report she threatened the cockney oh dear retorted doolittle insolently terrified i am thats wot bloody terrified she was taking out her pen when the ophthalmologist redfaced and harassed appeared at the door nurse you havent seen my pointer have you in your trousers mate said the cockney there was a roar of laughter from the queue the doctors head withdrawing quickly to his examination room and doolittle now definitely on the scuds report even more flustered now the young ophthalmologist smiled apologetically at shirer who during doolittles diversionary play had been sitting patiently in the hardseated examination chair cant seem to find my occluder sight blocker well just place your hand over one eye fine said frank which line wha uh any line read it all said frank feigning surprise and was reciting it by heart when he had a moment of inspiration hesitated then said last letter fourth line bit blurry an e or an f the doctor glanced up at him convinced that this pilot he looked back at the file shirer knew very well it was an f and like so many others was probably trying to fudge it in an attempt to eke out a little more rest and recreation if at all possible it was known he was keen on a young nurse lana la roche well the young ophthalmologist thought i might be green but not that green he wasnt about to underwrite malingerers and he told shirer straight i guess you dont want to hear it major but youre fit for flying duty again frank mumbled an obscenity taking the rtd return to duty slip with feigned reluctance the head nurse and doolittle were still arguing outside it was getting on the doctors nerves he knew he shouldnt have wasted so much time looking for the damn pointer but hed had it since medical school and it had become like a charm to him he rose opened the door and called out briskly next it was doolittle only his eyes and nose visible the remainder of his head still bandaged right said the doctor sitting on the stool in front of the examination chair what letters can you make out where on the chart what fucking chart that afternoon frank shirer was officially posted back on the active duty list but the day was to end in disappointment it hadnt occurred to him that once he got back on the active list he would be assigned anything else but fighters however with not enough fighters to go around and his earlier experience of flying s coming up on the pentagons screen he was assigned to far east bomber command nayoro japan bs for shirer it was like being told youd been assigned to driving a mack truck after having been at the wheel of alfaromeos lana was delighted with japan so close to siberia only fs and one or two of the precious few stealth b bombers were being used as far as she knew the long distance bs merely on reserve standby too bad she lied but itll help you to have a new challenge challenge i can fly a b blindfolded is it that easy well no but hell after flying tomcats they dont call bs buffsbig ugly fat fellows for nothing anyway theyre not using bs over there least not where it counts oh lana said sounding disappointed too bad hon he turned to her you serious of course really yes ill grow old in bs he said morosely when will you be shipping out he handed her the fax tomorrow they dont waste any time once youre fit do they well its what you wanted i mean at least youll be flying and yeah sure it was a bright clear day over roosevelt island with manhattan towering against a background of a hard blue winter sky johnny ferrago bent down to hoist his sixyearold daughter linda onto his shoulders so she could see over the crowd gathering for the opening of the third water tunnel johnny was what was known in the excavating business as a sandhog one of the unsung thousands as the new york times editorial put it who risking deafness silicosis and a range of other subterranean maladies not to mention caveins had labored for the past ten years to keep not only manhattan but the whole of new york alive blasting and drilling over seven hundred feet below ground the sandhogs had carved out a sixtymilelong twentyfoot diameter third tunnel this would boost the billionton capacity of new yorks water supply to billion the third tunnel taking the strain off one and two which fed by the underground aqueducts coming down from the hillsview reservoir passed under the bronx exiting on west thirtyfourth daddy yes hon wont all the water be dirty ferragos wife lenore smiled as he pulled young linda forward over his head and looking up ostrichlike said hey what you think your daddys been doin all this time that waters clean as you can get ferragos twelveyearold son danny his face all but covered by the collar of his parka and earmuffs grumbled cant be clean as snow water what the hell you talking about said johnny you shouldnt say that daddy came lindas voice from above sorry little girl but that waters passed the sniffer test danny better than half the bottled water you can buy whats a sniffer test asked danny sullenly wanting to know but his pride at odds with his curiosity they could hear a murmur in the crowd of several thousand strong someone saying the governor with police escort was approaching he wasnt it was traffic control cops on bikes keeping everyone behind the tape sniffer test johnny ferrago explained to danny is done by a lady who sniffs the water right like a wine tester they dont drink it daddy sure they do lindy no daddy i saw it on mister rogers they spit it out she means wine tasting put in lenore his wife oh said johnny looking up at his daughter thats right honey they dont drink the wine maybe the lady doesnt drink the water but its the best test they have he looked down again at danny to include him in the conversation some people can smell bacteria better than a machine how about that eh danny yeah said danny i cant see anything well you scuse yourself johnny told him and move up front your mom cant hold you up youre too big dont want to go up front all right then stop squawkin im not squawkin all right you two said lenore cool it were supposed to be having fun remember how do they clean the water daddy asked his daughter her head bending down over his dont have to honey sunshine kills a lot of the bugs and all the other bad stuff settles down in a big dam whats a dam well place where you collect water lots of it keep it still so all the bad stuff can settle out then they put a seki disk sort of like a black and white lid down into the water they have to be able to see it for at least two meters thats just higher than daddy if they can still see the disk then the waters safe how come we drink bottled water then pressed danny dont be a smartass danny said ferrago sharply because i dont like all that chlorine they put in tap water thats why miss lawson at school says they put fluoride in it its good for your teeth yeah well said johnny far as im concerned the jurys still out on that one whats a jury daddy asked linda never mind said johnny crabbily you keep your eyes on all the people going up there on the dais the stand you see the mayors limo yet no can you see em ferrago asked his wife irritably no just a few motorcycle cops she nudged johnny lowering her voice dont let danny get on your nerves hes just pushing your buttons yeah well hes doin a damn good job linda started jumping up and down on his shoulders as the band began to warm up whats the big deal anyway said danny its boring lenore ferrago reached in front of johnny grabbed the shoulder of dannys jacket and gave it a good shake the big deal danny is that your father has spent the last ten years digging that tunnel and without it all those flashy manhattan offices up there would be empty a lot of men got killed in that tunnel and a lot of others got silicosis and whats sili began danny unrepentant lungs fill up with dust said johnny matteroffactly the dignitaries were collecting now on the flagdraped dais decorated in front of the head frame that had taken johnny and hundreds of others down countless times beneath the east river where theyd had to continue blasting through bedrock apart from increasing the citys water supply a third tunnel would allow the old aqueducts many of whose huge valves had all but rusted away to be maintained without the new tunnel what now were maintenance crises for new york would soon become a colossal disaster for johnny and the hundreds of other sandhogs who had spent so much of their lives in the subterranean tunnel and complex of risers or overflow shafts and who knew every inch of it there was a shared feeling that it wasnt so much new yorks tunnel as theirs despite all the problems its onandoffagain financial history the biggest job of its kind in the history of the world had not only provided the sandhogs with work at some of the highest blue collar wages around but had given them a deep sense of purpose the kind that for a tradesman sometimes comes only once in a lifetime they knew that without water everything in new york from flushing a toilet and mixing martinis to lifesaving hospitals would come to an abrupt halt and a diseaseridden halt at that while lenore was trying to convey something of what it had meant to their son johnny recalled the time he had been pinned for hours by a fall in one of the riser tunnels that led up to the street and the manhole covers that millions of new yorkers walked over daily without a thought of the unseen world that kept their seeing world going he wondered too about his future the question of how many of the workers would be kept on hadnt been settled or rather thats what the union had been told ferrago and his friends however believed that the city officials already knew whod be kept on but not wanting to precipitate any job action that might mar the opening celebration hadnt yet released the information what they did know was that because of the war thered been a lot of talk about cutting the completion ceremonies to a bare minimum the mayor a few local politicians the police band and thatd be it but the mayor had overridden any such cutbacks arguing with unexpected support from the post and the times that it was precisely because of the war that a very public celebration of americas industrial knowhow and determination evidenced in the worlds largest tunnel should be held it would demonstrate once again especially to the siberians that this was a cando nation whose role as the arsenal and foundry of democracy could surmount industrial and logistical problems that would have confounded most others there must be fifty people up there commented lenore indicating the dais through the thicket of heads in front of her theres even an admiral whats he in charge of they sail boats in the tunnel matter of fact they do johnny answered little propdriven tv robot jobs push through all the crap and take pictures of any fractures fore they get a chance to get any bigger and blow those gases build up and that baby explodes those brokers in wall street are gonna get more than their ankles wet i can tell you stock exchanged be goddamned swamped daddy you shouldnt say that yeah sorry lindy so whats the admiral began lenore her voice drowned out by the throaty roar of a v formation of harleydavidsons the mayors limo drawing to a halt in front of the dais the serious men with the shades despite the pale winter light on either side of him looking hard beyond the line of uniformed policemen at the tape how come youre not up there daddy linda called out theyre vds stupid said danny a sousa march crashed into the air what said johnny straining down to hear danny and seeing lenore laughing so hard she looked like shed fall down he means vips she explained jesus said johnny i hope so dont call me stupid said linda bending toward danny so that johnny had to take a quick jerking step forward to keep his balance johnny saw lenore standing on her toes waving calling out to someone johnny its mike ricardo thought they werent going to come over here mike ricardo a small wiry man made his way through the crowd his new york yankees cap lost from view now and then as the crowd moved forward someone saying something about a movie star johnny and lenore had got to know mike and betty ricardo when both men had been working on the bronx section of number three hiya johnny called ricardo hey mike whats the story thought you and the missus were gonna watch notre dame nah betty says i got square eyes already so what the hell figured id give her a day out big deal said lenore ricardo grinned shes havin a ball stuffing herself with candy floss he jerked his thumb in the direction of the dais i think shes got a thing for the mayor lenore shook her head mike always had an answer listen johnny ricardo started but had to repeat himself the band was killing sousa with the base drum you want to come over to petes place after for a few beers johnny nodded toward lenore have to check with the boss here petes looking at a camaro cut in ricardo indicating a copy of the post classifieds wants us to give it the onceover before or after the beers lenore sighed well you know said ricardo grinning yeah she said resignedly i do well she turned to johnny her elbow pressing his be home by midnight yeah he replied but it was said as if he hadnt really heard the truth was he was in shock the ad for the camaro was the tipoff for another ad in the personals man in early thirties desires livein companion sexual preference not important must like cats and be prepared to share household chores no republicans hed been waiting so long that now it was here he suddenly felt he was no longer ready yeah he answered no problem ladies and gentlemen began one of the politicians a democratic representative for new york its my pleasure and privilege to introduce you to i cant see grumbled danny after all the waiting all the years it took only three hours to answer the ad to drive up to the hillsview reservoir when johnny returned that evening he was in a hell of a mood and they were saying thered been more power outs at con ed so he knew everyone had been working that the ad had been the signal for all of them danny yelled johnny ferrago his shadow enormous in the candlelit kitchen get away from there young danny jumped back from the kitchen sink and despite a brave effort began crying i forgot well dont whatd i tell you in the car i forgot repeated danny now clinging to his mother who drew him close lay off johnny she told him he just forgot whats the big panic anyway you said youd turned off all the water johnny rose picked up the cup danny had been about to use and put it in the dishwasher theres still water in the pipes i thought you said you ran it out you cant run it all out besides from what they say on che radio one dropd be enough to kill you how come they dont know how to fix it quicker complained lenore last time some idiot poisoned the water they because last time was just peanuts snapped johnny his metaphors going to hell with his temper car radio says this time its much bigger poured it over the spillways apparently so i dont want any of you going anywhere near taps and danny stop your goddamn blubbering why cant we use the toilet daddy asked linda because you cant flush it thats why johnny told her gruffly pouring himself another scotch putting in a dash of the bottled mineral water i dont like using that poopy seat said linda referring to the portable camper toilet in the basement its scary down there and how come con eds on the fritz again said lenore johnny ignored her turning to linda tell mummy when you want to go down he said you can use the big flashlight thats what its there for his tone continued to be gruff angry at his own bad temper but unable to rein it in it wont be for long he said you all right danny no im thirsty come over here johnny told him and gave him a glass of the bottled water there yare danny gulped the water taste good inquired johnny in a conciliatory tone danny shook his head vigorously from side to side for chrissakes danny youre spilling it cant you lenore interceded quickly yet gently ushering the children into their bedroom off the hallway danny was still grumping its not time for bed you dont have to go to bed lenore assured them just sit and play or do why cant we watch tv mommy asked linda cause answered danny there isnt any power stupid dont you call me stupid knock it off yelled johnny from the dark recesses of the kitchen or ill tan both of you there was silence lenore aware for the first time she could remember that she could no longer hear even the faint hum of their refrigerator as she hustled and cajoled the children to get into their pajamas if they were quick shed read them a storyby candlelight havent cleaned my teeth said danny all right said lenore then go no wait a minute ill bring the brush in here with some bottled water yuk out in the kitchen the shadow of her arm stretching like a huge derrick in the candlelight lenore poured the mineral water sparingly into a big bird cup this is getting to be a real pain she said how long do you think well be without power and water johnny shrugged probably wont get full power back for weeks from what the radio says itll be staggered i guess brownouts a bit here a bit there as for water he turned his scotch and canada dry club soda nearer the candle no idea what kind of people could do that she asked screwing the cap back on blowing up power stations is one thing but poisoning the water thats thats sick so was agent orange said johnny sipping his scotch thats different lenore said reaching to put the bottle into the refrigerator from habit sure said johnny you werent in vietnam neither were you she said an edge to her voice she really didnt know how long she could put up with the inconvenience theyd most likely close the schools and then god help her the kids would be home all day anyway that was war christ what do you think this is he shot back no worse than what we did to the vietnamese she peered in the flickering candlelight at an unrecognizable shape deep in the refrigerators vegetable bin my god whats this what this she made a noise as if she was picking up a snake the lump in the plastic bag half solid half liquid squishy she held it out toward him outstretched fingers like laboratory tongs face grimacing with repulsion its a cucumber i think or was she was heading toward the bathroom holding it at arms length you cant

over with the kettle to she mustnt have heard that radio announcement you oh my god johnny she dropped the bag in the kitchen garbage pail then grabbed the phone it was dead slamming it down she ran out the kitchen door clattering down the darkened steps onto the crazystone backyard yelling as she called out to her neighbor across the lane an elderly woman from where lenore was a small figure bending in a soft square of a camp light no no mrs james daddy daddy whats the matter called out linda nothing ferrago replied go to sleep it was pm at pm when lenore ferrago had pounded on her neighbors back door she so terrified the elderly mrs james that the woman dropped the cats filled water dish the plastic bowl creating an enormous shadow in the candlelight as it bounced high against the dishwasher before banging to the floor and rolling toplike already empty of water and reverberating as it spun to a stop on the pale green linoleum floor martha bellowed mrs jamess husband you okay when he came in from the living room the cat meowing safely behind him his wife had one hand on her heart the other on the doorknob using it as a rest as she opened the back door its its all

the fridge moved off to get the radio les his wifes shout struck james with the force of a physical blow by the time he had returned to the kitchen she was crumpled on the floor the cat having licked up some of the spilled water already in convulsions writhing in an agony the likes of which he had never seen nor wanted to ever again in that tiny kitchen the threat to the eleven million people in new york had become real and meanwhile all over the state and indeed the nation the threat was becoming a palpable nightmare of sudden yet agonized death its full extent withheld from the american public not by any government decision but by increasing power failures resulting in communication brownouts when the news of the explosion in hillsboro first hit the streets there was confusion over the name some reporters confused it with the hillsview reservoir others thought it was the hillsboro of movie fame the standin for dayton tennessee made famous or infamous depending on the point of view by its monkey trial in wherein newspaper luminary h l mencken writing for the boston globe reported the clash of the titans when presidential hopeful william jennings bryan and the great defense attorney clarence darrow battled it out over the tennessee school law forbidding the teaching of evolution but the hillsboro in question was in wisconsin and there was no confusion on the part of the sleeper spets team suspected by fbi investigators later to have consisted of two cells of three men each which using heavy eightyonemillimeter mortars blew the cesium clock building to hell also knocking out the electric feedin for the backup atomic clock kirovs ballet had begun atts big tote board in new jersey went crazy the byte eight bits to a byte slippage in every mainframe computer irreversible this meant not only that lana la roche nee brentwood couldnt phone from dutch harbor to california to find out whether frank shirer was as yet in overseas b training or had been caught in the helterskelter sabotage that was apparently breaking out all over the us but also that all defense computers and most phone lines were down in fact shirer was already en route to nayoro for freeman had sent out an urgent request for buffs no one knew why because while the big ugly fat fellows could bomb from thirty thousand feet outside most aa missile envelopes all the pilots including frank knew that you simply wouldnt have the accuracy from that height and certainly not in the blizzard conditions in any event even if the us phone networks hadnt been shut down lana wouldnt have been told where shirer was but if the shutdown of all personal calls was a trial for the ordinary citizen the defense department had a much more serious problem all icbm silo computers were down including those inside norads cheyenne mountain and those responsible for the prearranged coded burst messages to american submarines like robert brentwoods uss reagan a dual purpose ssbnssn icbmhunterkiller sea wolf ii in the pacific northwest in washington state another sub the uss corpus christi a ton trident ii her gold crew aboard slid effortlessly through the long moonlit race of water stretching out from the bangor base into hood canal the pinescented banks slipped by like spiked velvet and the boomeras they called the intercontinental ballistic missile trident headed out to join the first pacific fleet several thousand miles west norwest of bangor she was to become part of the hectic american buildup and resupply of second army or rather one of the hidden protectors of the convoys racing to satisfy the enormous appetite for materiel created by the logistics of fighting a twofront war across the other side of the world the ood officer of the deck ben cashell reported degaussing station coming up informing the captain and the crew in the reddedout control room beneath the sail that the sub was entering the huge magnetic wiping shed which would temporarily erase the corpus christis telltale magnetic signature at the very least her signature would be sufficiently altered so that it couldnt be easily identified by any of the siberian nuclear subs some of the sibirs as they were known by the us submarines had passive sonar arraysbig spools of transparent oilfilled cable that housed listening mikes which they trolled hundreds of yards behind them in the oceanic sound channels off the american west coast cashell a native of the drier regions of texas before he graduated from annapolis as the first black to be so rapidly promoted to executive officer aboard tridents iis reveled in the sheer natural beauty of the deepwater sound the fresh ocean smell mingling with that of the pine forests that swept right down to the sea the moon a silver disk above the heavy dark foliage of the timbered hillsides all of it elemental in its mystery he heard the depth readout from control and looked farther down at the bow watching the thin line of phosphorescence caused as much by the incoming tide as by the subs egress speed and he knew that soon a moment he always savored once they were beyond the sound and approaching patrol speed the corpus christis thin line of foam would become a creamy bow wave before the cutout speed then there would be no visible bow wave at all just a continuous oilylooking hump of water sliding over the forward section as the sub carrying ten mirv nuclear warheads on each of its twentyfour missiles more than all the explosive power used in world war ii headed quietly out to deep water for some the subs represented a monstrous intrusion into natures realm but for cashell the ship immersed in the sea represented not a conflict but a harmony between man and nature far from violating the integrity of the natural realm the sub became part of it its very shape a giant fortytwofootwide footlong cylinder with a bulbous bow like that of a great whale and streamlined sail diving planes and pressure hull moving in concert like the fins of a great fish in a perfect marriage of function and form and because of this unlike the older submarines of world war ii which had to make most of their torpedo attacks on the surface the tridents and their smaller cousins the sea wolfs attacked from below here even the enormous bulk of the ton trident a whale compared to the smaller sea wolf was as responsive as any marine mammal to the slightest change in the oceans environment corpus christi was all but through the chicken wire of the degaussing station and when cashell saw the light he thought it was a hunters flashlight blink from shore then the starboard lookout yelled incoming thats all cashell remembered the first blink was followed by two others three ninetyfourpound hellfire antitank missiles no one in the subs control was hit but fourteen seamen on the forward starboard side were killed instantly when one of the subs mark torpedoes exploded beneath them following the hellfires impact the antitank missile ripping open the hull forward of the sail at the waterline wiping out all bowinset sonar sensors as well as gutting the torpedo room three more men were found dead trapped in the tangled wreckage of the forward sections fourth level another five having survived by being sucked out after the initial inrush of water which had doused fires immediately as the sub had been on the surface these five managed to swim ashore but the sub barely kept afloat by a chief of the boat who had quickly ordered all affected compartments sealed off from the rest of the ship was effectively out of commission for what the bremerton yard boss later estimated would be at least six months in san diego the aegisequipped guided missile cruiser the santa fe had been sunk the torpedoes used in the attack thought by both the cia and fbi to have been two of three stolen from the san diego naval yards during the super bowl game the attention of perimeter guards diverted subsequent spectroscopic analysis however proved that the torpedoes though definitely us mks had come from the canadian west coast naval base of esquimau presumably they had been smuggled across at some point along the threethousandmile uscanada border by illegals who like their cohorts in the us had entered north america during the gorbachevbush honeymoon possibly having slipped in from a russian trawler in for repairs at one of canadas ports the cia in particular drew the presidents attention to the peculiar reluctance of csis canadian security intelligence service to follow suspected illegals across their border into the us theyre very good in signals intelligence sir reported presidential press secretary trainor but when it comes to humint he shook his head quite so im afraid agreed british liaison officer brigadier general soames representing her majestys government in the crisis canadians are rather reserved in this area im afraid not their line of country at all really they wait to be invited rsvp if you get my drift i do said president mayne glumly novosibirsk must love it oh yes novosibirsk st petersburg theyre very fond of ottawa home away from home cold as well the only thing seriously challenging the cias theory of the origins of the torpedoes was that the dredged remains of the two that had sunk santa fe and killed over us sailors indicated that several critical gearing sprockets had been constructed of nylex a steelhard plastic sheathed in fiberglass the only reason for this would have been to make them undetectable at airports where contrary to somber international agreement metal detection scans of diplomatic bags were routinely carried out by cia ground crews all of which would suggest that the two torpedoes could had been smuggled in by air piece by piece whatever the reason in a concomitant sabotage attack in san diego eight f phantoms were total writeoffs the fortymilliondollarapiece aircraft destroyed not by the explosion of the airfields ammunition dump as was first reported but by surfacetosurface handheld shoot and forget missiles of undetermined type most likely twentyonepound nightfiring us dragon antitank guided missiles with a onethousandyard effective range out on the harbor another handheld missile struck only one of the densely packed planes in the forward starboard parking area of the carrier john f kennedy but five mcdonnell douglas f hornet fighters disintegrated as the fire from the first spewed out engulfing the other four five men were killed on the carriers deck two in prifly control eleven injured forward of the island and three were still unaccounted for in all a courtmartial was a certainty for the senior officer on duty at the time unless he could explain to the board of inquiry why contrary to general practice the five planes were parked on the flight deck instead of being distributed around various shore bases until the carrier had cleared port the fact that one of the shore bases had been hit at about the same time would be no defense a motor pools cyclonewire fence at fort hood texas was penetrated and twentyfive hummers or humveesthe army replacements for the old jeep were destroyed by fire it was later discovered that this act of sabotage however was sheer vandalism by local teenagers completely unconnected with the more highly organized and selective attacks launched in other parts of the country by now reactivated sleepers five thousand miles away under cover of the blizzard minskys six batteries of siberian bm multiple rocket launchers broke the ceasefire unleashing their salvos at hours delivering mm rockets on a quarter square mile within two and a half minutes the most intense bombardment by mlrs or tube artillery since the iraqi war for the american iii corps stationed at port baikal on the forward line of the ceasefire along the southwestern edge of the lake it was nothing less than a catastrophic eruption high vs of jagged ice blocks snow and black frozen earth exploding in their midst over were killed outright hundreds more wounded by the hot metallic rain of the shrapnel scores of others concussed by the simultaneous pummeling of air that accompanied the massive rocket offensive within the next three minutes by hours the americans mm howitzers were returning fire at least those whose crews had not been taken out by the siberian mrl attack ground sensors at iii corps hq indicated siberian armor moving east rapidly toward them already deep into the dmz over a hundred american abrams ma fiftyfiveton main battle tanks moved forward to meet them another hundred opening fire from their revetment areas behind the frozen lakes treeline their mm guns in defilade position though the siberian tanks exact positions could not be ascertained because of the antiinfrared smoke screen created by minskys armored personnel carriers forward siberian observers however could see the us infrared blurs that were the iii corps echelons exhausts the siberian observation point then directing the siberian selfpropelled mms as the latter opened fire in a sustained thunder whose shock waves denuded trees of snow in the taiga the us mas immediately returned fire but their maximum fourthousandmeter range was of no avail falling into dead air the siberians selfpropelled mms thirteenmile overreach putting minskys batteries well outside harms way from the american tanks fire apache squadrons now rose en masse from behind the protective barrier of the foot primorskiy mountain range north of port baikal heading low across the angara river intent on redressing the imbalance and on the hipole siberian radars the apache gunships appeared like so many gnats at least sixty minskys aide informed him all heading for the siberian armor obviously leaving the less agile and for the helicopters at least less dangerous less mobile selfpropelled siberian artillery until later their first priority undoubtedly minskys scores of frontline ts the fate of the apaches however only confirmed freemans countless warnings to washington about how the ceasefire would prove to be nothing more than a time for the siberians to dig in minskys phalanx of aa guns and missile batteries dug in and waiting beneath their snow lizard pattern camouflage nets were about to create a bowelchilling sense of déjà vu at american hq in khabarovsk the frantic atmosphere of unrelenting radio traffic filling freemans control center with the nightmarish visions of the siberians deadly feint on the neverskovorodino road there fake inflatable siberian tanks lamps for infrared inside had suckered freemans gunships into the siberianheld territory where the apaches were destroyed in a deadly crossfire of aa guns missile batteries and vertical area mines bloodying freemans second army in what was the lowest point in the american preceasefire campaign freeman had been awakened as soon as the attack on baikal was radioed through and entering the din of the hq quonset at khabarovsk he was advised by dick norton that in addition to the attack on iii corps at port baikal large formations of siberian motorized infantry were moving north against iii corps from fifty miles south of baikal around kultuk and north of baikal a second siberianarmorled spearhead was materializing heading south from maloye goloustnoye a schoolboy could have seen it was a pincer movement as freeman had predicted designed to hit iii corps frontally and from both sides to encircle the men of american hi corps what to do about it however given the worsening blizzard conditions was an entirely different matter the problems were legion despite stateoftheart doppler radar cas close air support freemans immediate and obvious first step wasnt possible now in the whiteout conditions unless he wanted to risk dozens of collisions between the fighters and the swarms of apache gunships and other helicopters below already rushing ammo resupply westward from kabansk eightyfive miles northeast of baikal across the lake to add to his worries freeman was informed that patrols out of kultuk near the clifftop tunnels high above the lake a small but important railhead held by a company under a major truet were completely cut off from port baikal fifty miles to the north freeman would have been even more worried had he known that many of the siberians three thousand attacking tanks were towing siamsky bliznetssiamese twin t mockups infrared signatures from the hauled mockups being emitted through the use of cheap twelvevolt batterypowered heaters this doubled the potential targets for the apache gunships at least for those that could manage to get below the whiteout or fly closer to the ground than could the fighters a hellfire optically tracked antitank round for each of these targets even if the helos got through baikals aa ring defense guaranteed the depletion of the americans already strained supply of the expensive ninetyfivepound missiles the logistics involved in a battle area more than twice the size of iraq were rapidly limiting freemans options chapter seventeen when the pla guard came into the cell he was smiling telling alexsandra malof he had brought her some refreshment bai chiwhite tea he explained in perhaps the only english he knew tipping up the thermos and handing her the hot water without a speck of tea in it ha ha he knew she wouldnt think it funny but hed underestimated her energy despite having gone thirtysix hours without food or water most prisoners were so cowed they had no strength left for a retort he certainly wasnt used to a mere woman prisoner causing trouble but thats what he got with a flick of her wrist she threw the boiling water into his face the completely unrelated thought racing across her mind that the chinese made the best thermoses in the world the moment he yelled hands to his face she kicked him hard in the groin and he collapsed the submachine gun rattling on the damp flagstone floor the last time shed seen a soldier prone was the siberian whod raped her in baikal she lifted the wooden stool high above her and brought it down on the mans head the green cloth of his pla cap turning dark with blood in the dirty yellow light of the passageway as she frantically pulled the slung ak from his arm she could hear footsteps two perhaps three guards coming down the hall toward her cell she stood back from the door there were two of them the cell exploded in cordite smoke and the ripping tarpaper sound of the aks burst both men hit one already dead on the floor the other flung back against the corridor wall as if bodily lifted and thrown by some giant hand she was running down the grimy corridor her left hand swishing the hair away from her eyes right hand gripping the submachine gun her breath steam as she ran into the colder air bleeding in from the entrance of the jail as she reached the door she swung the ak in the direction of the duty guards desk and seeing he wasnt there realized he must have been one of the two shed shot when she pushed hard opening the door the frigid air outside stung her someone shouted but she was already beyond the penumbra of the lone arc light outside the jail into the dark where she dropped the heavy gun in the snow and kept running glimpsing fog rising from the songhua river by stalin park on her left as it spread smokelike coursing eerily about the multicolored ice sculptures of zhaolin park one of the citys old soviet oniondomed spires pierced a bluish blur of moon fog was everywhere spilling out from the boat dock to sankeshu station she could hear police whistles behind her glancing back she glimpsed a dim shape one of the ice sculptures a dragon headless in the fog not knowing where to go the foreign consulates friendly to america and its allies bound to be the first to be cordoned off she paused in the pitchblack dampness seeing the fog clearing cloud swallowing the moon and she leaned against a high wall suddenly feeling dizzy from her exertion and weak from having gone so long without food or water she made the decision to go to the guoji fandian hotel on dazhi street latov had taken her there a couple of times the manager would no doubt recognize her two barbarians for dinner but wouldnt be surprised to see her the hotel catering to many international tourists if only she could get to a friendly foreigner who would get the message out about the massive chinese buildup taking place via the nanking bridge it was a long shot but there would still be foreigners caught in china by the war waiting for exit visas from the public security bureau it was risky but if she did it with brio she might succeed if she did she knew she would save thousands of american lives and hit back at latov and his chinese comrades their one big mistake a typically chinese delay she thought was not to have issued her immediately with the bright orange prison clothes which would have doomed any effort to simply walk into the lobby of the fandian the first foreigner she saw as she entered was a small bluestripedsuited man with moustache bald head and wrinkled brow obviously a european he wouldnt do even sitting he looked harried a worrier his gaze fixed on the lobbys slimerimmed driedup fish pond its fountain encrusted with a coppery greenish detritus the man looking at it forlornly as if his future was as bleak as that of the nonexistent fish a second man an indonesian wearing a muslim songkok cap his bags by the reception desk looked more promising medium height potbellied smiling talking with the chinese clerk he seemed at ease as he filled in the card then pulled the english edition of china daily from the pile on the counter and moved off toward the restaurant unhurried he was skimming the front page with only a modicum of interest turning the paper over revealing a gold wristwatch as he did so an affluent man and indonesia a neutral in the war if she could get to him maybe she decided it was too risky his business connections with china would be too precious for him to risk doing anything for her she might offer herself as the price ask him to send the fax and wait for a confirmation of receipt before keeping her end of the bargain but he could turn her in just as easily after she could hear a siren in the distance a porter early twenties by the look of him eurasian was being bawled out by the manager who was calling him a lan xueshenga lazy studentand a turtle the worst kind of insult telling him to hurry up and take the indonesians suitcases up to a secondfloor room the incident convinced alexsandra that the indonesian would be a bad choice for only someone who traveled a lot in china would choose the second floor over the higher more scenic suites above the groundlevel smog room service was quicker on the second floor and when the elevators broke down with or without an accompanying fire you had a chance to get out from the second floor the fire escapes any farther up sure to be too decrepit and illmaintained to work she watched the student sullenly pick up the suitcase heard him murmur cao nide xingfuck your name to the empty fish pond and followed him up the first flight of stairs to the second floor eager to get to him before he reached the two women floor minders who in stained white smocks would be smiling asking her room number so as to jot it down for future reference fornication with unregistered guests being strictly forbidden in the peoples hotels wo shi meiguo ren i am an american she whispered to the porter the energy shed expended catching up with him on the stairs exhausting her ni keyi bangmang ma can you help me he took her to be an american she was a big nose and white her chinese fractured he glanced at her but did not pause and kept walking down the stained red paisley carpet that clashed incongruously with a guilin mountain design of turquoise silk tapestry that covered most of the waterstained wall the air was heavy with stale cigarette smoke and this combined with the kerosenefired heat made it difficult for her to breathe the two whitejacketed minders folding linen were putting it desultorily on a trolley one of them asked her the room number er ling si said the porter grumpily as he strode on impatiently with the heavy suitcases once he opened the door she stepped inside and closed it behind him she began to speak quickly he held up his finger shaking his head vigorously it was her fatigue that had made her so momentarily careless of course not all foreigndesignated rooms would be bugged but you could never be certain which ones the public security bureau had decided to listen to on any given night he indicated the bathroom and tried to flush the toilet it didnt work and it took him a minute to reconnect the chain to the pull lever when finally it gurgled loudly and coughed she moved closer to him i want you to take this to the baltic legations she told him keeping her voice as low as possible despite the noise of the toilet the estonians lithuanians and latvians she knew shared the same trade legation in harbin and if a message could be got to them they would love nothing better than to pass it on to the americans only now she realized her mistake the sudden alarm in his face telling her hed completely misunderstood having thought she like most foreigners had wanted to change money getting more yuan on the black market than from the official exchange rate perhaps he didnt even know there was a war going on yet beijings ironfist control over the media made it more likely than not i cannot give you money she told him truthfully i have none they took it all away at he stared at her did he understand or not she felt unable to go on her legs trembling from fatigue and tension seeing a thermos on the table by the frostcovered window she poured a cup and her fingers shaking now tore open a bag of green tea spilling half of it stirring the leaves frantically watching them swell and blowing on the hot liquid the student porter looked at his watch as if that would somehow enlighten him about what had happened alexsandra sipped the tea it was glorious it seemed to give her instant strength sitting on the edge of the bed seeing her disheveled appearance in the wall mirror she put down the tea turned to him and slowly without taking her eyes off his opened her blouse he looked away then looked back walked toward her and buried his head between her breasts like a child will you help me she intoned stroking his head gently he stood back abruptly looking down at the floor ashamed then nodded quickly she scribbled a note and gave it to him the baltic legation you must throw it over the wall you understand be careful it will be surrounded and you now he dared to look up at her you cannot stay here no you must take a taxi where the place i will give you they will help hide you from the police she smiled doing up her blouse you are not a turtle it was the only time he smiled you must wait here i will go for a taxi i have no money for a taxi no matter we must help each other at that moment alexsandra could have cried taken him in her arms made love done anything that would make this young man happy wait here he instructed her i will send up a friend and he will take you to the taxi stand down from the hotel he walked toward the door hesitated glancing back the noise of the toilet subsiding he walked closer to her you must not walk out too quickly it will raise suspicion you must be natural she said unafraid just so ten minutes passed her fear more intense with every second every footfall she heard soon there was the sound of a trolley more footsteps fading then knocking on the door her heart jolted what a fool shed been but where else could she have gone the door opened another porter a smaller stockier man a little older than the other beckoned to her quickly while looking down the corridor once in the lobby he led her to a taxi and though she tried to walk more slowly than usual the intense cold quickened her pace and in a moment she was inside the taxi and whisked out into the night how the chinese loved secrecy it came with their mothers milk from having to contend all their lives with the paranoia of the regime i will let you out next street said the driver whom she could not see beyond his dim outline behind the wheel you go out next street to your left there will be another taxi waiting ask to go to stalin park for the festivities before she could answer the cab had stopped she knew nothing of festivities in stalin park it must be thirty below the only people out those watching the ice sculptures and the driver reached over and quickly pushed open the door out the cab was gone alexsandra found herself alone again in the darkness as she started hesitantly to walk down the two blocks crusted snow crunching beneath her feet so loudly that she felt everyone in the street must hear her she saw the dark shape of another cab sensing a trap she stopped the air was pungent with coal smoke that made the fog seem heavy and gritty even more suffocating than it had been in the hotel she glimpsed a small flame illuminate the darkness the waiting cab driver lighting a cigarette she breathed in deeply felt giddy almost slipping on an icy patch as she steered herself resolutely but nervously toward the cab her whole body felt in the grip of a deep damp cold and she thought of the tea shed had at the hotel long jin she would remember the tea forever even if ganjin hurry up came the drivers rough command and the back door flew open she stood there hesitating trying to think stalin park yes said the driver yes then hop in we must hurry as they drove off the taxi quickly gaining speed she thought it impossible that he could find his way through the dimly lit fogswirling world but at one point she could see the speedometer needle quivering on a hundred kilometers an hour they hit a dip and for a second she was suspended her head tapping the cars roof before she crashed back down on the seat she smelled and felt dust all about her as granular as that from the gobi desert the car braked a maosuited figure a woman how old it was impossible to tell opened the door come and the next moment she found herself following the bent black figure down a narrow hutong to a small mud brick house pungent with the smell of something overripe on the verge of rotting and vegetables frying she was shown to a singlecellsized room a lone tallow candle burning on a small wall table flickering in a draft you must stay here the woman told her the busybodies are everywhere worse now there is war the busybodies she found out as the old woman brought her tea were the neighborhood grannies nosey parkers with red armbands fanatically loyal to the party and much more feared than their male counterparts these were the bullies of the onechildafamily rule and other party edicts spies who despite their age or because of it were much more dangerous than the police for their job and one they followed with zeal was to know everything that was going on with everyone in the street sooner or later they would find out the old woman told her so we will try to get you north as quickly as we can who are you asked alexsandra cupping the tea as much for warmth as for nourishment i mean not your name but why do you do this you are so kind to a stranger tiananmen said the woman simply there are many like us and suddenly a burden was upon her and she shuffled away young xiao ping a kitchen helper at the fandian hotel who had been sent to the baltic legation by the porter to deliver the note had no difficulty whatsoever despite snow now falling heavily and the poor street lighting as in all chinese cities the recent order of the harbin peoples council to dim streetlamps still further adding fuel to the rumors of war xiao ping simply wrapped the message about the nanking bridge in a clean linen pillowcase from the fandian hotel the hotels monogram carefully removed and tossed it over the legation wall well away from the main gate which might be under surveillance the rockweighted pillowcase landed softly in the compound on the other side of the wall it hadnt occurred to xiao ping to wrap it in any other color than white and in any case by morning it was completely covered with snow where is she now asked latov seated at the siberian consulate table at the banquet celebrating the chinese lunar new year the public security bureau man standing behind him in a waiters uniform informing latov that the psb car had had difficulty following her from the hotel in the fog to have followed the cab too closely would have given the psb car away you idiots said latov though still smiling raising his glass as his chinese host began an interminable speech about the new and glorious socialist brotherhood between the new united siberian republic and the peoples republic of china dont worry comrade the psb man assured him we know the general area all we have to do is carry out a housetohouse search and we have already identified at least two contacts she made at the hotel two porters have you picked them up no we were waiting until we told do so immediately must i remind you comrade replied the psb man offended by the siberians tone that you are our guest in harbin latov did not even deign to turn about bored though he was with his chinese hosts babbling about socialist brotherhood and you forget comrade he told the psb man that weve purposely let her escape so that we might break this entire northern ring of spies and saboteurs if you fail itll be your head in beijing comrade and yours comrade in novosibirsk where are my men snapped latov he meant the black berets at your legation tell them i want them to be in on the search for her they know what she looks like it was a stupid thing to say and latov regretted it the moment he had uttered it feeling the psb mans contempt almost immediately we have no difficulty recognizing foreigners comrade you mean barbarians said latov as you wish i want my men involved in the search insisted latov you find out whos hiding her but when thats done shes to be brought back to me that was the agreement shes a siberian national shes a siberian whore as you wish but she is my whore and i will punish her we will see youll do as youre told comrade or else youll find yourself on the amur front you mean the black dragon front comrade its forty below up there comrade we chinese are used to the cold latov gave a contemptuous snort and reached for his wine its forty below and the americans are shooting at you comrade not for long said the psb man we know how to deal with americans we defeated them in korea they ran away well latov conceded finally seeing the sniping was getting them nowhere thats one thing we can agree on comrade we both want to defeat the americans so you find the girl and let my men return her to me agreed latov waited i apologize for any untoward remark the psb man nodded curtly he knew the barbarian didnt mean it but nevertheless it allowed the psb to save face nodding abruptly he left what was all that about latovs wife asked him ah said latov dismissively reaching for black fungus a manchurian delicacy a prisoner giving us trouble since when are you concerned with chinese prisoners im not shes siberian one of our people said latovs wife surprised no a jew oh stalin knew what to do with them chapter eighteen in less than two hours american iii corps had suffered twenty percent casualties seven thousand killed or wounded against yesovs first echelons anything over thirty percent casualty level and the us commanders knew that iii corps would no longer have enough fire power to withstand an onslaught by a second echelon siberian attack the printout on the analysis computers in freemans khabarovsk headquarters was unequivocal the ler loss exchange ratio of would mean that the troops manning the mm howitzers and the m tanks on lake baikals southwestern shore would have to destroy twentythree russian guns for every american gun lost merely to stay even to make matters worse mm batteries had to be diverted left and right of iii corps defense line that is south and north of iii corps front at baikal in order to meet yesovs flanking attacks this meant in the next hour that as the tracks of the m tanks fought to grip the watery mirror finish of the lake translucent in places down to thirty and sixty feet the cold statistics of the loss exchange ratio jumped to the apaches were swarming now over the vast snowcovered taiga from the primorskiy range their yard fireandforget hellfire airtoground missiles streaking down in crimson balls taking out thirtytwo targets siberian ts in spectacular explosions of which fourteen were actual tanks going up the remaining eighteen were poddelkifakes yesovs vertical aerial mines and mobile mounted zsu twentythreemillimeter shilko aa gun quads and kuadrat surfacetoair missiles taking out eleven of the sixty apaches it was such a loss rate that freeman knew he couldnt sustain iii corps present position the situation aggravated by the blizzard which prevented any effective close fighter air support and so his counterattack effort in tatters almost as quickly as he had launched it freeman in an order that all but choked him instructed the remaining men of ii corps to effect forthwith a fighting withdrawal across the seventeenmilewide lake and to set up a second line of defense in the taiga along the lakes eastern shore hopefully it would give him time to rush in support both men and materiel from khabarovsk and skovorodino the latter atop the amur river hump it was the only thing freeman could do and yesov knew it refusing to yield to minskys impatience the marshal had held his massive taigahidden formations in place waiting for the temperature to fall while the lake remaining frozen would result in a less hard iceair interface this widened the vs or the coneshaped eruptions of the siberians howitzers exploding on the lake sending more shards of splinter ice and whitehot metal fragments even lower to the ground over an even wider area the perimeter of the american ii corps was now a bloody mess of body parts interspersed with the junk of shattered matériel and gutted tanks burning fiercely the explosions of their fifty rounds of high explosive squash head and discarding sabot ammo killing and maiming more americans than yesovs howitzers in the us the latest and to date most devastating attack of operation ballet was that experienced by the us navy during a fiveminute heavy mortar barrage of miramar naval air station this attack totally destroyed or put out of action an entire squadron of twentysix fe strike eagles a confidenceshattering display for the american top guns of just how vulnerable hightech aircraft were to the determined and highly trained infiltration units all ten men in the two spets mortar crews were killed by perimeter guards at miramar but not before shrapnel from their last mm fiftyfivepound rounds sliced open the fuel tanks of two lockheed fat alberts the cavernous transports replete with the new snowtaiga pattern replacing their old nato greengraykhaki splotch camouflage were in the process of loading marines to relieve british commonwealth ceasefire troops guarding the allies rr barracks along the amur river outside khabarovsk in the explosion so enormous local residents thought it was a nuclear bomb marines died some killed by their own ammunition set off by the fire all of them charred beyond recognition most teeth showing through the black leathery grins still strapped to their seats apart from the terrible loss of life it wasnt the millions of dollars wasted in destroyed equipment that shook americans who well understood their industrial capacity was still the best in the world but all over the country the ghosts of vietnam arose in the american psyche invaded by memories of the infamous tet offensive when the north vietnamese army through infiltrators had brought the war to the americans doorsteps in saigon a turning point in the only war america had lost worse the attacks on the sub at bangor in washington state and on the carrier john f kennedy in san diego were the first on the west coast since the second world war when one of the big japanese iclass subs had shelled the oil installations near santa barbara and point estevan on canadas vancouver island that enemy was again bringing the war to the fortyeight contiguous us states and the repercussions of this shook washington to its foundations trainor couldnt remember the president being so angry as mayne subconsciously massaged his forehead reading the reports streaming in from hillsboro san diego bangor and miramar his aide knew if no one else did that the president of the united states was on the verge of a migraine attack so that the next file trainor brought him contained two sumatriptan pills taped to a report of the marines who had been killed in the attack on miramar the sumatriptan were perfectly legal and trainor knew were prescribed for more than one senator but in the roughandtumble world of politics trainor was as discreet as possible with the medication fearing that some boozy congressman doing three times as much damage to his body with his afterwork martinis might make political capital of it it was a grim morning all around the simultaneous successes of the attacks on hillsboro bangor miramar and the rest proof positive that novosibirsks network of sleepers were wreaking havoc on american morale quite apart from the human and materiel carnage theyd already inflicted on americas ability to wage war how long till i go on mayne asked trainor two minutes mr president mayne closed the latest damage reports and went over his speech once more as the red light went on and mayne cleared his throat and shuffled his papers readying for his extraordinary address to the nation david brentwood lana brentwoods younger brother attached to britains sas and now on a longawaited honeymoon in the canadian rockies was being urgently summoned like so many other americans for immediate return to active service across the pacific it was dusk along the black dragon river on chinas northern border and colonel soong commanding the fourth battalion of the peoples liberation armys shenyang xvi corps was readying his nine hundred men to overrun the position just north of manzhouli from where the chinese army had first been shelled and which had precipitated their entry into the war soong had designated five attack points so as to break up the enemys fire which he estimated was battalion size with three batteries of eight guns each together with a headquarters battery containing communication and fire control with about ten men per gun crew plus ammunition and support troops the us battalion on the hill soong estimated would number around five hundred men it had been a fierce fight with the enemys mms having the advantage of the high ground even as they had pulled back to the horseshoeshaped summit of the mountain designated a in the argunskiy range and soong knew it would become even fiercer the dead lying everywhere as he ordered his three companies to regroup for yet another assault nearby off to his left he saw what he guessed must have been one of the most forward american firecontrol spotters the mans torso missing an arm his other sliced neatly through the americans shoulder patch stuck to his shoulders shattered bone and showing the screaming eagle of the eightyfirst airborne had been cut neatly in half by shrapnel as if sliced through with a band saw blood congealing purple against the snow in the fading light soong took it as a good omen and crouching made his way through the dead clumps of uprooted aspen and pine their earthclogged roots dark against the now freezing snow the acrid stench of cordite and the singedmeat smell of burning bodies heavy in the air soong was so occupied making sure the slope leading down to the river still a half mile ahead wasnt mined that he didnt notice a mottledgreencamouflaged enemy helo american a blackhawk uha hung up in tall pine a hundred yards to his right normally soong would have been back with his battalion hq staff and not so far forward with his troops but the capture of a mountain had become a top priority of general chengs and indeed pla photographers had been sent to record the event the battle of the black dragon river which beijing was now calling itblack dragon having much stronger patriotic connotations than mount awas a misnomer as southwest of the amur hump near a there was no amur but for beijing the battle for a came to symbolize the war for the amur hump as a whole and a victory on the mountain would be a showcase victory early in the war against the americans colonel soong now ordering up heavy mortars was determined to lead the final attack he was disappointed that there seemed to be so few dead about no more than a dozen or so suggesting that despite the distances involved from chita to the northwest and from khabarovsk to the east the americans might already have managed to withdraw most of the battery crews and spiked the guns if so the fierce battle so far might now suddenly give way to a hollow victory one that if the enemy had managed to be snatched from the surrounding chinese battalions would deny cheng the crushing total victory he and beijing so urgently desired as if in answer he heard a shout from a company commander off to his left a long burst of ak fire and then the steady chump chump chump of a us marine mk throwing out highvelocity fortymillimeter antipersonnelarmorpiercing grenades from its linked belts no more than a thousand meters away from some unseen clearing deep within the taiga at a rate of fire of over rounds per minute the american grenade gun was a deadly weapon in any situation in defense it was particularly formidable capable of breaking up the most determined infantry assault its persistent dull thumping filling in the vacuum created by the temporary lull in mm artillery fire the latter having dropped off in intensity under the oxhornshaped advance of the shenyang armys ix corps exhorting his men not to stop soong moved forward into an area of taiga that had the strange appearance of having suffered a forest fire without the trees being burned as leaves and whole branches were shredded by the flaying shrapnel of the grenades he heard a shuffle of air felt the increasing pressure on his eardrums and dove to ground using the body of a dead comrade as protection only now could he properly see the american chopper wedged high in the branches of two trees its shattered rotors no doubt responsible in part for the fallen foliage when he saw a body in it move the pilots and a fall of snow he instinctively raised his kalashnikov but it was the whole chopper moving whether from concussion of the incoming mms or from the wind groaning through the trees or both the american helo slid tail first another foot or two then stopped its scraping noise against the branches barely ceasing before he spotted the body moving again against the angle at which the aircraft was leaning firing a long burst soong saw the body jerking in violent spasm and watched the chopper suddenly plunge another ten feet tail first upended in the pine the now dead pilot still in harness head and arms dangling from the twisted fuselage blood pouring from his neck splattering the snow and branches beneath it wasnt that soong particularly hated americans that he hadnt even thought of taking the american captive but there were no real provisions for pows in beijings opinion they cost too much as soongs battalion moved forward taking out the grenade gun at high cost over seventeen dead the shenyang infantry came across more american choppers that had been brought down by the highly effective chicom antiaircraft fire equally as deadly in soongs view was the fact that the enemy battery itself was so far from american air bases in siberia mat even after succeeding with hazardous airtoair refueling the wouldbe rescue helicopters could have had only enough petrol for several no more than five to ten minutes or so over the besieged summit the upturned chopper in the trees nearest him moved again and instinctively he raised his kalashnikov and swung toward it but the only thing moving was the chopper itself a local gust sending the craft crashing down advancing once again soong concluded from the relatively few enemy dead he was now seeing and the failed chopper rescue that shenyangs xvi corps was on the tail of a panicked american withdrawal to as summit he could have no idea that five thousand miles away across the pacific many in the continental united states itself were on the brink of such panic chapter ninteen my fellow americans nothing is more repugnant to our sense of justice and fair play than the curtailing of individual rights but the unprecedented and coordinated enemy attacks on our ports and other bases within the united states not only constitute a grave threat to the vital supply lines to our troops in siberia but also constitute a grave threat to all of us here at home when trainor reached the press room another aide a younger man wideeyed and pastyfaced from the cataclysm of bad news that was spewing through the white house fax machines asked what the hell are they doing i mean the military attacks yes but now weve got news of forest fires in california the southwest manmade i mean what the hell do they hope to achieve by chaos answered trainor simply on a scale weve never seen before trainor glanced up at the bank of press room tvs it was probably the first presidential speech in years written entirely by the chief executive himself this administration therefore has no alternative but to invoke the emergency powers act under this act stricter access and exit controls for all us ports civil and military facilities and bases will immediately be put into effect these are already in operation in most of our bases around the world but they will be extended to all bases in hawaii and within the continental united states itself this will mean that normal policing arrest and detention procedures will have to be shortened so as to best use our limited resources and manpower in combating sabotage within the president was looking straight at his audience i realize this will involve inconveniences for many of us and the implementation of restrictions on individual liberty which is as repugnant to you as it is to me but there are times and this is one of them when if a free society is to remain free it must be prepared to expect as much from those at home as those we send to do our battles abroad for those at home to do as much as they can to support and protect those brave men and women who are at this very moment fighting and dying in siberia and on the sea lanes leading to that embattled place and so beginning at ten pm eastern standard time tomorrow the following federal agencies will be authorized to use extraordinary measures to meet the threat of extraordinary times the federal bureau of investigation a sound man earphones comically high on his head cords trailing behind him appeared from the dark fringe of the klieg lights and handed another sheaf of papers to trainor returning from the press room the wisconsin sub farm a vast acreage of vlf very low frequency aerial array for contacting submarines at sea had been attacked apparently a pack of stray dogs and cats had been let loose at several points on the northern side setting vibration and heat sensors off diverting most of the security guards attention from the real point of entry on the southern perimeter which had been penetrated by saboteurs someone later reported having seen a weather forecast news chopper in the area in any event the demolition on the farm for the second time in the war was such that already nine of the north pacific sub fleet including the uss reagan had not received their burst messages updating the positions of submarine friends and foes hawkeye tacamos take charge and move out aircraft had been ordered aloft from the west coast stations to take over the always tricky task of making radio contact with the subs at their next rendezvous points but it was always more complicated than it seemed the hawkeyes rotodomes degree sweeps had ranges of up to three hundred miles with overlap patterns so they could cover all nine subs that had already missed their first call together with the overlap patterns necessary to reach another six nuclear subs in the pacific due for callin within the next twelve hours this meant the endurance of the halfdozen allocated planes and their crews would be stretched to the limit that quite simply some of the subs would not be reached meanwhile a large siberian fleet was now in the process of gathering in the fogshrouded seas where the kuro siwo or japanese current meets the icecold waters south of the aleutians the new york times argued that the president was overreacting to the sabotage while the washington post editorial agreed with the adoption of the emergency powers act the post tempering its approval however with the warning that emergency contingency planning must not usurp reasoned restraint that there was a danger of the restriction of individual liberties becoming a habit all too easy for a majority to accept as the new norm the washington post also joined the times the christian science monitor the la times and other major newspapers in recommending that an oversight body representing all segments of society should be established as soon as possible to monitor the emergency powers act while looking soberly concerned wholeheartedly welcoming the idea of oversight committees the countrys police chiefs were ecstatic but played it down in front of the press conferences for the first time since the vietnam war editorial offices raged with argument calm debate no longer possible in the atmosphere of growing panic about whether or not to release certain stories and sow further fear one holdout was peter ovan the editor of a small new hampshire daily the logan examiner the short balding editor argued that a tip hed received confirmed by a second source about a small team of arsonists who had been able to start a fire that gutted the lockheed stealth fighter plant at burbank california should be told to the american people if the government cant protect one of our most vital defense plants argued ovan then what hopeve we got hell responded the pentagon chief of pr anyone can start a fire mr ovan that supposed to comfort me major responded ovan shifting the phone from one shoulder to another tearing off a fax of a reported sniper attack on the approach road to the secret savannah river atomic weapons production plant in south carolina it was a better story in ovans opinion for the truth was that if he wanted to nail the administration for incompetence the stealth fire story wasnt the best besides hed already run a column on the open secret among the pilots of the th tactical group at nelles air force base in nevada that the twinengined multimilliondollar stealth fighter with swept wings and v tail had been flown at night since and was responsible for many ufo sightings over the mountains and deserts of the western united states more importantly in the pilots opinion it was perhaps the most overrated plane in history inherently unstable and therefore remarkably maneuverable kept on the edge by its computers the stealth fighter hadnt proved to be the ultimate radar evader after all the soviets had designed low frequency detection sets that could pick up the fighters almost as quickly as they could the stealth b bomber it was one of the reasons the b program had been drastically cut ostensibly for economic reasons as it turned out ovan didnt run either the stealth or the savannah river sniper stories in the logan examiner for at am just before he was to go to press his wife rang saying there was an urgent federal express overnight courier envelope for him from washington dc cautious by nature and made more so given the rash of reported crazies and sabotage ovan asked his wife the senders address he could hear the rustle of ida handling the plastic envelope ida dont open it im not im looking for an its from a mr carlisle internal revenue service washington since when do the irs use courier ovan asked since most of the phones arent working said ida all right have billy run it down here ill go over it with the rod he meant the metal detector he kept in the office as a precaution against crank mail you be careful said ida all this violence in new york to ida all violence happened in new york another country i think you should call the sheriffs office ovan considered it for a moment his pride battling the pressure of his deadline still the irs gave him a turn rumor was everyone gets audited sometime all right have billy take it to the sheriffs office first seventeen minutes later the local police car pulled up outside the logan examiner when the sheriff walked in ovan was busy tapping the computer keys selecting type size for the leader pete we opened your package then i guess it wasnt a bomb ovan replied wryly sort of ovans fingers stopped on the keyboard what you mean sort of the sheriff opened the plastic bag and showed him it was a fish wrapped in an old copy of the logan examiner ovans hands came off the keys you tell ida about this no one cept the deputy i told your billy to stay up at the station you checked the sender asked ovan carlisle irs yep put a radio call through all the way to washington phones there arent working too good well said ovan impatiently no such person besides pete irs dont send dead fish how bout live ones reparteed ovan but he didnt think it was funny himself he thanked the sheriff for calling personally asking him not to tell billy ovans assistant a young frecklefaced coed mary had just finished trimming the ads as he walked over to the window and pulled out a cigarette he always asked mary if she minded whether he smoked and she always said no she didnt when they both knew she did but this time he didnt ask he just lit up and inhaled deeply looking out on the sunlit folds of virginal winter snow deep and crisp and even he thought drop the leader he said glumly mary looked up surprised the story about the stealth do as i say he snapped well run that nba payoff scam instead he exhaled bluish smoke filling the small room everyone likes baseball basketball mary quietly corrected him but he hadnt heard her he was furious and rang the cia public relations major whose staff had been ringing the newspapers to hold back the stealth sabotage story the major was polite given ovans tirade about receiving the dead fish mr ovan if youll let me speak for a moment sir go on then grumped ovan finally we dont operate that way sir im not going to pretend that im not glad youre holding the story but we dont work that way mr ovan i shouldnt damn well think so said ovan his voice now an asthmatic wheeze christ thats just the kind of thing were fighting against over there goddamn it in siberia exactly concurred the major look well have the fbi this kind of thing is really their jurisdiction look into it if you like yes i would fine ill have them contact you as soon as possible appreciate it said ovan brusquely but grateful nevertheless when the major hung up he shook his hand as if it had been on fire boy was he steamed the petite second lieutenant nodded i could hear him from here did he buy it yeah hook line and sinker he wont print the major paused you didnt leave anything did you nothing answered the lieutenant dumped everything plastic gloves everything good and they went into their little federal express routine laughing when it absolutely positively has to be there overnight later that day the editor of the atlanta journal in georgia received an anonymous tip that in addition to a sniper attack on the road to the savannah river plant there had been two explosions near its three nuclear reactors none had been perforated but a truck carrying thirty drums of nuclear waste was blown clear off the road at least four of the drums had ruptured spilling their deadly poison which in a heavy rainfall was now believed to have entered the water table through the porous soil the editor of the journal upon being paid a visit by the cia after running the story said he wouldnt give the name of the tipster even if he knew it was it from new england the cia asked from logan whos logan place in new england the editor shook his head we get all kinds of courier mail from all over the country especially now the phone systems are so yeah yeah said the cia agent and left in the maze of brooklyns back streets and in the vandalized cores of dozens of american inner cities that had decayed in the seventies been rejuvenated in the eighties only to die again the nineties the dealers and users passed through americas night with impunity the police outnumbered and often outgunned if not by the accuracy then by the sheer number of weapons on the street most of all the police were consistently outmaneuvered by the highpriced lawyers who had the gunmen back out on the streets often in less time than it had taken for the police to book them in a brooklyn alley not far from the bridge there was a tinny noise of underground ventilation gray steam bleeding into the night many of the users already shooting up in the galleries freebasing the real badasses on crack levitating not knowing where they were or what they were doing tvs left on screens flickering blue as the presidents speech containing the phrases arrest on reasonable suspicion and suspension of habeas corpus was being broadcast so many stations were carrying the address that some of the dudes uptown the suppliers like bobby badass duguid were cussing and instructing their boys to turn off that prezeedential shit man duguid demanding video instead his favorite wrestlin witches duguids preppy lawyer detested wresting especially the degrading sight of women in mud in fact he hated everything about bobby duguid except the vast amounts of money he had to launder for bobby and muh associates smith smith and wesson ha ha ha the young lawyer liked something else too the raw power of a man like duguid who could daily rip off the system as bobby so accurately put it and not even touch the money man bobby made it a point of never carrying cash and let it be known in the intricate psychosiswebbed world of drugs that he never carried it his lawyer handled that a sight bobby loved to see fine striped shirts his whitey with the cartier watches and rockport shoes handling the lucre with tearoff surgical gloves terrified of catching diseeze from muh clientele at tenthirty outside one of the dozens of harlem galleries owned and supplied by duguid and his associates the four men in the unmarked police car from the sixth precinct the alamo knew that if they didnt move within the next five minutes even the crackheads who didnt know what planet they were on would slip away into the garbagetainted air but theyd been ordered to wait no cart before the friggin horse as their chief had put it when we hit its all got to happen simultaneously i dont want that roach in his flamingopink whorehouse uptown to get tipped off praise god for president mayne ill vote for him till i die there had been a rough chorus of heartfelt amens the steam was still rising going this way and that like some living thing fuming but in confusion a red and blue neon slashing the vaporous cloud every four seconds infusing it with a surrealistic look hard on the eyes no need for all this palaver said one of the fourmember squad the shortbarrel pumpaction shotgun in his right hand whats the difference with this new emergency powers thing we could pick him up in the morning right we could be home getting sleep by now johnny said a detached incharge voice from the backseat once these friggin lawyers hear maynes speech theyre gonna go ape and tip off every slimeball in the territory so where can they go asked the policeman with the shotgun we shut all the fucking airports to canada and mexico they dont have to leave the country said the man from the back just hide out till the emergency powers repealed then well be back to square the radio crackled its volume low car fortyfive a code oneeightseven on jefferson onefoureightnine corner storeeleven a was a homicide jefferson the other side of town it was the get ready code to foil the smartasses who might be listening in on police radios all right phil said the lieutenant in the backseat patting the man in the front who had the shotgun you do the kick ill be on your left marty to your right josé stays with the car got it got it the radio crackled again ah car fortyfive that oneeightseven on jeffersons bein looked after it meant the alley behind the shooting gallery was now covered right remember said the lieutenant no one out to the back door or youll get your balls blown off drabinskys got a pump back there and hes so fucking short he cant aim any higher than your prick how the hell he get on the force whispered phil opening the front passenger door aerobics said the detective stretches simmons tapes ahone and ahtwo and all as they slipped through the steam the detective felt his stomach muscles tightening sometimes the kick didnt work then it was a shmoozle and you ended up having to either shoot the friggin lock off or use the ram log by the time you got in theyd all rushed for the back and then it got really dangerous finding their way blocked they turned and headed back spaced out and wild knowing they were trapped and that if they rushed you most of them would probably get away at duguids uptown said phil quietly ill be theyve got jeeves answering the door he was nervous but he loved it tonight especially reasonable suspicion meant no announcement no badge shit no miranda entering the crumbling brownstone they heard an odd scrabbling noise and the gutthumping beat of rock in the air there was a candle halfway up the stairs the power long disconnected phil saw a soft light issuing from beneath the second floor door and heard the scrabbling noise again a rat scurrying into the darkness over newspapers on the stairs he could smell human excrement they walked up slowly the candle flickering now only the slit of light beneath the door to see by the stink becoming worse ready whispered phil ready when phil hit the door it was so rotten it caved in he was on the floor looking up through a cloud of dust and crud the air reeking of dirty bodies maybe fifteen or more junkies some astonished cigarettes bottles held motionless in their hands stilled for a second before they broke for the rear door there was movement on the left side of the hallway phils flashlight picked out a man his pants down the mans right hand flashed to his pocket phil fired twice the blast lifting the man off the floor slamming him against a doorjamb a woman breasts flying came running through the dustfilled gloom screaming her head off tried to touch the man but couldnt blood everywhere now they were all coming back from a rear door a madeyed sprinter dirty tshirt and jeans some red thing in his hair a shooter in each hand he got off two wild rounds before they took him out too the man behind dropped his gun and raised his hands but was knocked flat by a scrawny teenager born to raise hell on his chest phil gave him the butt full face and he was down phil heard his left ear ringing like an express train as the lieutenant fired twice be cool be cool came a voice from the hysteria of candlelight and dust put her out yelled phil one of the crackheads a latin was on fire her blouse ablaze but no one did anything phil stepped forward knocked her down covered her with his jacket and began stomping out flame the dust rising like talc the smell of singed hair joining the sickly sweet smell of dude rube the local wino rotgut hey man it was a white male transvestite early thirties cadaverous unshaven wildeyed wheres your warrant hey said another thats right brother you aint got no right to bust in you know said phil standing up resting his on the white ones nose i think this ones a saboteur lieutenant armed as well said marty extracting a switchblade from the mans handbag what the shut your face greta phil said now all of you against the wall move he and the lieutenant started kicking legs apart the alley team came in looking disappointed you bastards have all the fun said drabinsky all we got was tiddlydick some crackhead trying to hide in a friggin garbage can well said phil clicking the cuffs on the last of the addicts i wouldnt sweat it drab downtown says we can put in for all the overtime we need drabinsky followed phil out helping to steer the last cracker down the spotlighted stairs past the other cops the high spitting crackle of walkietalkies calling in the meat wagons through the hysteria of the crackers screaming an arm shooter smiling eyes glazed not caring drabinsky said phil for the first time in this country were gonna clean house drabinsky shifted the weight of the shotgun to the other hand is it true we can bring em in lock em up for three months without no said phil six six weeks or six months months said phil six fucking months everybodys gonna get well drab give us all the time we need you think youve seen plea bargaining itll be a buyers market for songbirds taking off the flak jacket he put on his police jacket and zipped it up how do you like them apples christ said drabinsky the full implications washing over him what i wouldnt give to be in miami greedy phil said smacking him on the shoulder thats your trouble damn right when they got back to the precinct they thought there was a party on bobby badass duguid the tall black man in flamingopink suit hat and white mink coat was in the cage with his lawyer and assorted entourage his hairs all wet said phil duguids eyes were afire with rage his lawyer pale white beside him yeah agreed the sergeant im very worried about that phil because if mr duguid gets a cold we could be sued you motherfuckers arent gonna get away with this you hear me whitey another policeman his puerto rican accent cutting through the hubbub handed phil a waxpaper package guess what we found him doin in his jacuzzi said phil wanking himself off no said another cop she was wanking him wheres she asked phil downstairs said the puerto rican cop but lookee here have a look at the package my my said phil sarge you see what we have here plastique you mother yelled duguid a hand coming out of his mink through the bars thats a plant and you know it well then mr duguid said the sergeant well have to put this aside for evidence it joined another two plastic bags large ones heavyduty each bag containing firearms including two uzis four aks and a grenade launcher under the emergency powers act mr duguid was confined for six months pending further investigations including intensive audit by the irs and investigation into the illegal importation of prohibited semiautomatic and automatic weapons asked about reports of widespread persecution on good morning america the fbi spokesperson jennifer lean replied sir weve known for years that ever since the lessening of tensions between premier gorbachev and president bush a large number of illegalsspies and potential saboteurs have been placed in strategic areas for just such a situation we also know that these people did not come with large amounts of money this would of course have immediately raised suspicion or at least alerted the immigration officials the question then you mean interjected the interviewer that the money used to purchase such weapons was drug related that illegals are or were involved with using drug money to finance their clandestine war efforts the money had to come from somewhere said the fbi spokesperson incredibilized as she later put it to her colleagues that the tv host could be so dumb it was pointed out to her however that a good interviewer isnt afraid to appear naive so they can get the guest to give them answers they want privately most of the fbi agents believed the illegals had brought in all the money they needed by diplomatic pouch years before and that drug money wasnt involved while duguid was being photographed scowling to update his file twelve miles south of port baikal jason thomis of charlie company or the forgotten company as they were calling themselves from iii corps second infantry battalion was digging in with the rest of his platoon along the rail line that ran parallel to the cliffs from between baikal and kultuk at the southernmost end of the lake thomiss company had high precipitous icesheathed cliffs behind them the surface of the frozen lake hundreds of feet below it allowed them to look down on the blizzardcovered lake as far north as baikal the thick whiteness about baikal trembling and flashing crimson with the thunder of war occasionally they could spot a thunderbolts coming from the far eastern side of the lake after protective f strike eagles had penetrated the screen of mig fulcrums that had come screaming eastward out of irkutsk led by the siberian ace sergei marchenko but for the american eagles having won the furball with the migs and driving the fulcrums off it was all in vain for though the a thunderbolts were now free to dive beneath the blizzard to engage the enemy ground targets they reappeared only seconds later without having fired a shot their pilots confounded by the zero visibility minskys forward siberian armored spearheads being so close to the fleeing americans that it was near impossible to tell friend from foe the us m and m tanks were so close in most cases to the siberian armor that the a s were forced to rise and circle like frustrated birds of prey waiting for the weather to clear which it didnt and all the while the as continued to burn up their precious avgas as the battle raged beneath them now and then an a would make another attempt only to reemerge frustrated from being unable to differentiate between the american and siberian tanks many of the american and the pursuing siberian units were so near one another that even accurate fire from the as thirtymillimeter nose cannons while it would have no doubt set siberian tanks ablaze would through the resultant explosions have done as much or even more injury to the american ground troops now and then thomis could see a bulge of dull orange light in the cottonwoollike cover of the blizzard the backflash of siberianacquired aerospatiale milan yard and hot yardrange antitank missiles the few that didnt hit the american targets failed not because they had encountered the kind of thick antiinfrared smoke that minskys troops were using as cover but because the armored us target had crashed through the splitting ice opened up by the pounding of minskys eighteengun batteries of amphibious m mm howitzers in addition to hearing the howitzers distant thumps thomis and his buddies could see contrails of the siberians multiple rocket launches arcing momentarily above the blizzard unleashed in ripple fire sequence the fifteenfootlong threehundredkilogram twentyfourmilerange he and fragmentation rockets were being fired from scores of twentyton zil trucks which with sixteen missiles apiece created plotnost or saturation density completely devastating a square mile at a time it was the equivalent of several battalions of field guns sustaining rapid fire for ten minutes and four times as great as the mindnumbing pounding of berlin in world war ii by the red armys katusha rockets in addition to this yesovs northern arm each of his battalions equipped with eighteen mobile trailers of forty bm rocket tube launchers was unleashing round salvos of the mm projectiles screaming down into the american positions the scarlet trails of the rockets momentarily visible in the swirling fog and snow appeared to thomis and the rest of charlie company like hundreds of ribbons before disappearing the rockets crashing in thunderous unison momentarily swelling the blizzard in huge blisters of flame where in the hells our mlrs thomis asked no one in particular as the rumble and crash of the artillery and rocket barrages rolled across the icy plain up through the fog the broken icefloe sea beneath all was quiet for the moment but the northward storm was rolling ever southward coming closer the deceptively lazy orange and green tracer arcing out of the swirling white candyfloss roof above the lake only making the danger more not less ominous coming up from khabarovsk answered valdez manning the squad automatic weapon next to him traversing the saw left to right so that its arc of fire should there be an attack from the taiga would be able to swing through degrees without endangering any of the other men in the foxholes anyway said another c company infantryman no friggin good firing our mlrs into that lot take out as many of our boys as they would the siberians then how about the fucking siberians said thomis agitatedly their rockets must be hitting their own guys sibirs dont mind taking out a few of their own neither does freeman said someone bullshit snapped a corporal he had to do that on ratmanov man without the air strike hed have lost more marines than he saved yeah well you werent there were you ricky boy knock it off you guys interjected the platoons sergeant cut the yap and watch your front what the fuck for challenged thomis what are we gonna do if armor comes out of those trees sarge throw fuckin snowballs at it the hueysll be here by then answered the sergeant oh yeah pressed thomis when soon but none came thomis and his buddies cared nothing about the logistical nightmare that had descended upon freemans headquarters that was hqs problem all that second platoon c company wanted was out and no amount of explanation by their co major truet could make them see that freeman as cincfe commander in chief far east had to divide his already overextended chopper forces especially his apache gunships to try to inflict what damage they could west of the lake on minskys airfields while ordering what chinook and huey transports he had south to the chinese border the simple fact was that charlie company the farthest south of iii corps was simply too far to reach given that those choppers not assigned to attack the siberians thrust now in progress on iii corps main front around port baikal were urgently needed to stem the chicom breakthrough farther south chapter twenty in and around the battle of port baikal at the southern end of the lake american iii corps reeling from the forward elements of yesovs right hook spearheaded by minskys armored regiments was rapidly approaching disaster for the americans it was a carnage unparalleled in american arms for not since the marines fighting retreat from chosin reservoir in the korean war had there been such a savaging of americans at close quarters at one point an entire company bravo from iii corps motorized division was lost within five minutes disappearing into the lake in a massive sinkhole as the ice already treshchinapaukspider splintered as the siberians called it by the pounding of their artillery suddenly gave way beneath the ton american hets heavy equipment transport rigs and armor that tumbled into the fivethousandfoot deep twentythree men who had managed to escape the sinking trucks clambered frantically for a grip hold on jagged chunks of carsized ice floating in the freshwater sea other clumps of watersodden men having been spilled from the trucks and trailer units as vehicles careened off the ice were now slithering on the mirrored finish of the floes like so many stricken animals many of them died like animals clubbed to death by omon and spets commandos who preferring not to waste ammunition or give their positions away by shooting moved like ghosts through the blizzard their white overlays making them indistinguishable from the americans whom they beat to death referring to it in their reports to yesovs hq as the reznya tyuleney seal slaughter to be sure that the american public especially us students eligible for the draft got the message spets video closeups of american dead though not how they died were quickly sold to french tv and cbn by novosibirsks ministry of information within an hour photographs of hideously bluishblack bodies of american dead were flashed around the world the french tv anchorman andre focault in paris talking of the unnecessary and undeniable carnage the direst result of general douglas freemans violation of the ceasefire spawned by american arrogance in asia the la roche networks and newspapers had a field day with the stills of decapitated americans littering the bloodsmeared floes the la roche tabloids calling for freemans immediate recall only the jewish lobby many of whom knew what it meant to live under siberian domination in the jewish autonomous oblast spoke out against what they called the blatant bias of the networks in showing such revolting pictures of our dead the networks said they were just reporting the news but whatever was said or shown on the networks nothing could really convey the full horror of the reality the smell of disemboweled americans or rather what was left of them after the siberian mm howitzers rained down on iii corps retreating east flank a retreat that area commanders were frankly reporting to freeman was becoming a rout except for three rifle companies over three hundred men cut off in the vicinity of sthree southernmost of the siberian breakthroughs the american line had simply collapsed as men panicked by the world of shifting disintegrating ice beneath them fought each other to get on the few remaining trucks which in turn were slowed by the necessity of having to put on chains the blizzard dumping fresh snow on the lake the ice around and in the corridor marked out for iii corps disintegrating like splintered glass as minskys mm kept up their relentless barrage the omons and spets on the periphery clubbing and drowning any iii corps stragglers north and south of iii corps the rolling barrages of the siberian artillery kept up yesovs pincers already beginning to close the trap minskys guns midway between the north and south pincers overshot iii corps creating a virtual moat between the main body of the retreating americans and the western shore of the lake still ten miles eastward the fury of the siberian bear as yesov was being called and minskys slutsk division was being described by many as unstoppable the siberian pincers moving as inexorably as two lava flows of a volcano spewing death as iran radio ecstatically proclaimed on the americans who were futilely trying to outrun its fury in fact more siberians were wounded though not as many killed than americans but for freemans iii corps given the overwhelming number of siberian divisions over fortyfour in all versus the americans eleven it was an unmitigated disaster the mood was quickly conveyed to everybody else in second army including david brentwood who like his former sasd colleaguesinarms lou salvini from brooklyn and the welshman choir williams was now arriving in khabarovsk in response to freemans order for the sasd team to reassemble another comrade of david the profane aussie lewis was already in khabarovsk on what he thought was going to be some welldeserved rr david brentwood was in khabarovsk less than half an hour before he realized how grim the situation was how iii corps retreat was a humiliation that eclipsed any prior victory by second army before the ceasefire to make matters worse while temperatures north of the lake around yakutsk continued plummeting those around the amur hump in the areas between latitude fortytwo and fifty covering northeastern china mongolia and southern siberia were continuing to rise in yesovs favor as his meteorological offices had predicted these warmer temperatures were turning the already inadequate sixteenhundredmile siberian khabarovsk and baikal roadway into quagmires for the us armor artillery and trucks trying to relieve baikal the sixtythreeton mas atop their heavy extractortransporters and the eleventhousandpound m road tankers needed to satisfy the voracious twogallonpermile thirst of the m along with the hundreds of tenton trucks hauling vitally needed spare parts were all bogging down into the slush stew as norton called it when the survivors of the decimated iii corps began arriving at the naval hospital at dutch harbor alaska lana brentwoods fear for frank shirer grew proportionately she thought she had seen it all earlier in the war the terribly deformed burn victims of ships that had been hit by missiles resulting superheated temperatures melting faces like wax or suffocating them in toxic smoke others like her brother ray were considered the unluckiest of all having lost part of their face because of either fire or deadly ag aboveground submunitions needlecrammed bomblets detonated while in the air directly over a target rays face had been partially reconstructed through surgery by laser the very kind of technology that had ironically allowed enemy pilots like the siberian ace sergei marchenko to have so accurately delivered their laser glide bombs against the american ships as lana saw more and more men being carried in on the stretchers she felt a growing sense of helplessness and knew that the lucky ones had been those who had died on the ice floes in hypothermias final perversely warm sleep the men being brought in here at dutch harbor would have to undergo months of painfilled surgery during facial reconstruction and limb amputation if they survived that long of course a few she knew would come through it stronger than before like ray who had the sticktoitiveness as her father used to describe it to fight the pain as well as the deep depression and worst of all the hatred of ones own image in the mirror ray had come back not merely to survive but to go on after being decorated for surface attacks against enemy subs off california robert too also navy captain of the uss reagan and young david a marine corps graduate now with the joint britishamerican sasdelta commandos were of the same stuff always pushing themselves lana was as dismayed by her brothers as she was proud of them no matter what anyone said she was convinced there was something very different about mens and womens psychological makeup even her father who first wanted robert to rest on his laurels after winning the navy cross for action above and beyond the call of duty in the terrible arctic hunterkiller battles off spitzbergen trench was now speaking admiringly of roberts decision after a nearmiss escape from a ruptured ssn during the arctic sub battles to volunteer for seal duty considered the toughest in the navy not only had robert upgraded the escape drills but he had submitted his name for the sal special assignment list young david was no better lana thought proudly quieter than either ray or robert who was oldest hed been bitten by the same warrior bug all three were married david just ray with two children and roberts wife rosemary with one on the way so what made them do it hadnt they done enough lana thought too of frank well of course he was no better just as anxious to go off into danger to prove what none were fools all had admitted to her in their different ways though certainly not among themselves that their fear in action sometimes all but paralyzed them so why did they do it was it no more than sibling rivalry still that didnt explain frank her anger at them was her love for she admired them enormously at the same time as she did frank whatever the reason they were brave and unlike the sleazeballs of jay la roche et al selfishness had no part of it when the young lieutenant from freemans headquarters round the australian lewis in full winter combat uniform complete with white overlay his face covered in white camouflage lotion against the reflection of the weak spring sun from the snow lewis was perfectly still the stock of his beloved haskins m singleshot boltaction sniper rifle firm against his cheek as he took steady aim through the rifles tenpower scope only one of itscaliber bullets would be needed to take out a man at a distance of miles an enemy would be hit before he ever heard the sharp crack the depleted uranium slug exploding his head like a melon a combination he and incendiary bullet from the same haskins was capable of striking a much bigger target like a chopper exploding its fuel tank which lewis had amply demonstrated against a hind a gunship when the siberian chopper had followed the sasdelta team during their attack on the midget sub pens sergeant lewis freemans young lieutenant inquired who are you mate asked lewis not stirring a muscle the haskins straight as a die betraying no movement lieutenant stimson sir general freemans all right all right shush now and for gawds sake get yer loaf down heard you a bloody mile away not exactly captain thunderbolt are ya young stimson was nonplussed captain thunderbolt he thought of an a yeah thunderbolt repeated lewis still not moving bushranger yknow highwayman back ome robbed the bloody government and kept it for himself thats the ticket eh whats on your mind general freemans hq uhoh said aussie still not moving bloody trouble stimson didnt know whether the australian was referring to freeman or his target whatever it was ah i dont under began stimson ere said lewis as he rolled away from the haskins slapping out the bipod legs his impish grin made fiercelooking by the camouflage cream go on ave a captain cook polar bears stimson had heard australians spoke another language but he got the gist of it lay down on the patch of snow and lifted the rifle fuzz buttons on your right instructed lewis and in a second the blobs probably a quarter mile away suddenly jumped into focus it was a woman or rather one part of her that lewis had zeroed in on howd you like to grab onto those mate he asked young stimson biggest nungas ive ever seen whadda ya reckon stimson was stunned by the magnification the womans bust completely filling the scope then she turned and he caught a glimpse of her face the contrast from what hed expected was so striking his eye started back from the scope and he looked up incredulously at the australian shes he didnt know quite how to put it for a second ugly you reckon said aussie who in a second was down by the rifle on the offside using his left eye to sight ah shes not that bad son call emselves polar bear club skinnydip through the fucking ice stimson was standing up brushing the snow off him shes shes got a moustache aw dont be fussy mate give her a gillette for a present i will fix her up in a flash anyway its not er bloody moustache im interested in lewis winked stimson was still trying to regain his composure as an officer and a gentleman her tits mate said lewis didnt you see em magnificent i dont want one of those skinny birds fucking model i want big nungas lewis thrust his hands bowl shaped out in front of him to here know what i mean i get the general idea lewis bent over snapped the cover on the sight and clipped the bipod legs beneath the barrel how long you been over here stimmo two months twono wonder youre particular said aussie listen mate thats the first bird ive seen worth looking at that yesov the bastard hes hiding em all somewhere shipped all their younger women west conscription you see you remember that if were heading back into baikal you remember that the aussie paused course back there big tits probably mean a bra full of hand grenades comin at you gotta be careful he glanced back down the river i agree with you bout olgas moustache he made a face hairy armpits too hairy armpits are the limit stimmo pong too much right still all the same in the dark eh stimson had never met an australian before hed heard they could be rough but so whats freeman want dont know im just the gofer no hint no hint well thats nice isnt it here i am r and r welldeserved i might add and first time yesov farts im called up i tell you stimmo said lewis smacking the young american on the back its diabolical whats your first name mate as a mere lieutenant stimson didnt exactly stand on ceremony but after all he was hq staff and hed never been so casually addressed by an nco before nevertheless he found himself answering raymond before he knew it grinning the gregarious australian put out his hand goodo ray everyone calls me aussie stimson nodded well ray said aussie i just hope there are sheilas wherever were goin i doubt it thought you said you didnt know well no i dont but i dont think youll be going back home yeah well you re probably right there they walked over the crunching snow toward stimsons humvee another aussie mate and me were billeted on an english estate began lewis as they climbed in and buckled up before the war in training down at hereford anyway this pommie sergeant a brit tells my mate you aussies are too crude got no subtlety watch me he says so we watch this brit lothario chatting up the lady of the manor nattering on about nature the farm how natures grand hinting that the mating season wouldnt be far off so my mate a corporal from mundubbera says he gets the brits message you see like you have to sort of introduce the idea of sex more gradual subtlelike talk about nature and stuff like you just dont hit it wham right right said stimson driving over the potholes back to freemans hq yeah right continued aussie well my corporal gets this idea see like how to approach the lady more indirectly see if he could get a bit so he goes into the barn that night and paints a geegee a horse green stimson looked across at lewis yeah lewis assured him green anyway in the morning everyone gets up for breakfast wandering down past the manor house the lady of the manors up as usual smiling and greeting us my mate watches her go up to the paddock as usual and sidles up next to her lights a cigarette as shes looking out at the animals good morning my lady he says real polite like tips his hat morning she says and my mate gives one of our blokes the office the office asks stimson the office the signal oh yeah so bam barn door opens and out runs the geegee my mate turns to the lady and says real casual like look a green horse how about a fuck stimson was appalled lewis doubled up barely able to hold the rifle steady in the humvee stimson was shaking his head for a few seconds he actually felt sorry for the siberians youre sick man bullshit said aussie one hand gripping the roll bar the siberian roads were unbelievably bad im horny stimson didnt know what to make of it all but then he didnt know what had gone before the sasdelta training quite simply the toughest in the world in the sas there were no drill instructors screaming at you they talked softly the training did it all with over an eighty percent failure rate only the toughest men managed to climb wales brecon beacons in gale conditions with ninetypound packs of bricks every brick numbered only the toughest could survive being forced to live off the land having to eat rats raw the slightest smoke if you cooked them being a dead giveaway and learning to live for days in a shallow trench not moving defecating by pushing it down slowly to the slightly deeper depression dug in the trench the sas had been unknown until may when millions sat enthralled before their tv sets all over the world watching as the sas commandos stormed the iranian embassy in london freeing the hostages in a dazzling blitzkrieglike display of rappeling stun grenade and machine gun assault and yet the sas ability to immediately distinguish a hostage from a terrorist the latter often changing places at the last minute in the hope of confusing wouldbe rescuers was only one of their skills in order to merely pass the course an sas trooper had to be able to enter a room shoot kill and be capable of rolling clearing a jammed gun and come up shooting dead on target within seconds they were men whose natural dispositions lay in selfreliance but who paradoxically were required to get along as a team but young stimson knew little or none of this and had seen only the wild slightly ridiculous side of a man whom death had stalked from ratmanov island to baikal and not all he knew were like lewis david brentwood about stimsons own age they said was quiet reserved more like the sas welshman they called choir williams and like salvini the american delta commando both of whom were now also on their way to freemans hq near kultuk thomis hunched in his foxhole was complaining again brushing fresh snow off his white overlay lets get out of these friggin foxholes while we still got the breath where you gonna go thomis asked valdez fingering the safety on the saw frappin great cliff behind you man yeah well lets pull back into those railway tunnels least wed get some cover oh yeah posited emory who hailed from georgia those tunnels man theyre just big coffins waiting for you hey listen georgia id rather have a ton o fucking concrete over my head than this friggin snow hole this aint gonna stop shit the sergeant let them bitch it wasnt as if theyd give away their position to the siberians who must know it already besides hed sent patrols out emory thought he heard a creaking noise but hed been hearing creaking noises like tanks all night despite the fact that charlie companys forward patrols and those from the combat support company strung out farther north along the rail line had reported no enemy in sight holy toledo said valdez will you look at that no one had to the red tails of the siberian mlrs north of them streaking out from minskys southernmost flank were arcing out of the fog higher above the lake their fiery parabolas seen only briefly above the fog before they disappeared followed by more speckling in the blizzard like explosions of firecrackers beneath some vast sheet where thomis knew americans were dying only three seconds later which told charlie company the mlrs were hitting about forty miles away would they hear the sound of the mlr explosions amid the steady rumble of the big selfpropelled siberian mms and the sounds like wood splitting of more fracture zones opening up in the lakes ice cover trapping so many americans in the retreat the siberians were in the rail tunnels said valdez near port baikal where they had those midget subs on the rail tracks ready to slide em into the lake tunnels didnt help them none when that sasdelta team hit em so charged thomis so they got roasted man southernfried that brentwood guy and his outfit popped an at round in that tunnel and boom scratch one midget lucky shot said thomis unconvincingly i thought there were two brentwood guys in that attack said emory one sas the other in the navy or two brentwoods three said thomis spitting into the snow whats the difference man i heard there was three of em in the family i mean so the three of them are fucking nuts growled thomis stamping his feet the snow having melted beneath his boots so that he had to bunch up snow in front of his foxhole to make his shoulder position against the m more comfortable id still rather be in one of those tunnels get some concrete covering my ass than stuck out here like a fucking tree tunnels are fucking death traps said valdez concussiond pop your eyeballs so you been told thomis looked away knowing hed been caught out on a fundamental point he knew valdez was technically right about concussion in a shelter but knowing valdez was right didnt matter psychologically being stuck in a foxhole was a hell of a lot worse as far as thomis was concerned huh way i heard it it was a lucky shot that sd team got in that tunnel that mad fuckin aussie that fired it jesus man who gives a shit who fired it well that aussie said it was a lucky shot said so in the stars and stripes so now you believe the fuckin papers countered valdez im tellin you once and for all tunnels are bad news besides if you want to go hide man hey hey davy crockett countered thomis dont give me your hero shit you want to hide your ass just as much as i do thomis looked around like everybody does aint that right he looked at emory on his left for support but emory wasnt going to get involved so thomis shot an angry glance back at valdez over his right shoulder point im makin juan is that sasdelta team were the aone cream of the crop the best and they knew just what they were looking for the tunnel they blasted was no accident it was their mission to get the sub pen man sibirsll just come at us willynilly were in a tunnel we stand a better chance man cut in the corporal from new york wish to fuck that sd team was here now yeah said thomis well they aint probably sunnin emselves in khabarovsk they say its gettin nice and warm there yeah said valdez minus ten instead of minus thirty great yeah well put it this way id rather be there than here so whats new relax said the sergeant its gonna warm up here pretty soon a machine gunner at the end of a threeman trench made grunting noises very funny sarge gonna warm up yeah said thomis regular fuckin riot heeeeres jay leno still say wed be better off in a fuckin tunnel wed be better off if those sasdelta commandos were here said the machine gunner dreamer said thomis theyre probably pissed in khabarovsk and deep in poontang shit it was their platoon sergeant putting down the field phone in disgust our land line to hq is cut so we use the radio said valdez yeah so they can jam it said thomis nice goin valdez knock if off said the sergeant maybe it was an accident said emory tree fallin or somethin right said thomis a tree knocked over by a fucking t youre as stupid as valdez thomis warned the sergeant knock it off thomis was shaking his head his breath like puffs of smoke in the night air a tree falling jesus he was terrified aussies immediate inquiry on seeing david brentwood was to ask him about his honeymoon has it fallen off yet david ignored the australians vulgarity the four of them david aussie choir williams and salvini liked one another well enough when theyd been in action but away from the fighting for a while each had albeit briefly entered a world in which war was no longer the norm and where fear of death was talked about so that now their civilianheightened sensibilities inhibited a camaraderie that for most of them only exhibited itself under fire you look chipper aussie informed david as they shook hands been doin the old inout have you she teach you a few tricks how you been doing aussie asked david lousy since the ceasefire went down the tube theres been no more beer oh the poor fellow chimed in choir williams winking at salvini deprived are we lewis nuts put in salvini i saw cases of our stuff piled up in vladivostok japanese beer said aussie horse piss nah i mean the old tsingtao chinese stuff beautiful big bottles too drink that stuff all day and no hangover nothing oh yeah asked salvini skeptically whats so special about it dont ask warned brentwood smiling across at choir okay said aussie so youve heard it before smartass but salvinis ignorant hes from brooklyn and its my duty to educate the poor sod when the germans had the beer concession in china began choir imitating aussie as best he could quiet you welsh bastard cut in aussie stimson telling them that freeman and his aide colonel norton were coming across the quad from the hq communications nut aussie took no notice the krauts bottled their beer under the old german purity law of no preservatives allowed now when old mao cow dung beat cash my check in fortynine and booted out all the foreign devils they still kept the kraut beer factory in tsingtao if you say so professor jibed choir i do say so and attenhun called stimson the sasdelta team snapped to it but despite freemans entrance stimson sensed an air of equality about the men there was no disrespect toward the general he was even if under attack from the media especially the la roche newspaper empire already a renowned figure to the men he commanded the new american armys patton besides the more media scumbags attacked him the more his men would defend him at least those not under fire around lake baikal there his general strategy was neither divined nor if understood countenanced freemans headquarters bulletins quoting tactical necessity affording little comfort to those like private thomis in charlie company who knew that the possibility of being overrun was growing by the hour but here in the briefing hut at least freemans reputation was secure so far his knowledge of the minutiae of battle legendary as was his fury against many pentagon directives such as the one that had distributed technicolor condoms to the whitecamouflaged troops in the siberian midwinter at ease gentlemen said freeman taking off his heavy winter coat the outline of the ninemillimeter sig sauer barely visible beneath his tunic no time to waste ive called you here because were getting the ass kicked out of us on that lake and i have to find some way of taking the pressure off those boys at the same time ive got to stop this breakthrough down south around manzhouli in chinese mongolia with those chicom divisions swinging west yesovs moving east theyll close the box on our boys whats left of them around baikal and split our entire eastwest khabarovskbaikal supply line in two as if that isnt enough my g tells me northern siberian divisions are moving south toward the lake from up north around yakutsk to get us in a threeway squeeze now the pentagon has suggested i withdraw all forces to khabarovsk buy time to consolidate for a summer counterattack colonel norton here concurs there was a long silence stimson struck by the fact that none of the four sasdelta veterans made the slightest attempt to venture an opinion though he sensed that none of them was afraid to speak up it was as if they were telling freeman its your decision thats why you get a generals pay stimson was wrong the truth was that all of them including norton already knew what he was going to say their silence was their consent they were with him now it was now merely a matter of details where you going to hit them general asked david brentwood jesus thought stimson hes being clobbered left right and center and hes talking about going on the attack nizhneangarsk freeman said then turned abruptly to the map knuckle rapping the northern end of the fourhundredmile lake the railhead on the bam baikal to amur mainline we cut that we cut the bulk of their supplies for their army of the north and for yesovs left hook farther south across the lake that is part one of three gentlemen any one of the three fails and we are in the manure up to our neck freeman saw the frown on young stimsons face you ill lieutenant ah no sir im fine you look ill come on spit it out son well sir ah stimson was glancing nervously at the map estimating that nizhneangarsk was at least fourteen hundred miles northwest of khabarovsk and wondering why in heck no one else had seen the problem sir he began i know flying conditions arent much good right now arent much good said norton theyre appalling yes agreed stimson but i was wondering sir well why dont we just bomb the railway wouldnt that be much he stopped none of the others exchanged knowing glances or in any way tried to make him feel embarrassed the lieutenant was young and all young men even the brightest from west point had to learn freeman took out his george c scott reading glasses and opened a reddiagonalstriped green file showing the lieutenant the arps area reconnaissance photos taken by fg phantoms and a few stealth fas the latter having gone in bravely despite the low impulse radar that had undone the defensive blocking action of their radarresilient angular technology two of the stealths and phantoms had paid for it though and had gone down in the enfilade of heavy radarguided aa fire son began freeman let me tell you something the public dont know something our fliers learned in vietnam had to relearn in iraq and what their granddaddies knew when they were fighting the luftwaffe at any time i stress at any time rail lines especially railway bridges where the enemy can sink pontoons right next to the bustedup bridge a couple of inches under the water to fool reconnaissance and run the box cars across at night are notoriously difficult to knock out but with smart bombs began stimson freeman nodded impatiently tapping the stills taken from the blackandwhite video shots through the thicket of aa fire around the nizhneangarsk rail head problem is son and here were ignoring the flak and the fact theyve got smart aa defenses up there problem is the damn snow he showed the lieutenant the pertinent reconnaissance photos the rail lines and black ties scattered about like broken sticks in the snow the next photo timemarked twentyfour hours later showed the same photo view the rails back together in working order the next photo showing the rails scattered again in the fourth and last photo the rails and ties were all in place once more same area freeman assured him the thing is lieutenant ground sensors we air dropped outside the immediate area of the station registered movement at the rail head within an hour of our stealths air attack heavy movement tanks moving up proffered stimson freeman slipped his glasses off no our analysts are sure of that itd be a different overpressure weight of the vehicles if it had been tanks no it was rolling stock all right moving through the area wed just plastered half an hour after wed bombed it and lost four aircraft into the bargain those broken tracks and ties you see are fake extruded plastic we thought point is they were just shiftin them around son meanwhile the snow kept covering the real line two three hundred yards away our bombs were just blowing up snow so we sent in smart bombs to lock in on the real snowcovered lines then we found wed been wrong they werent plastic lines they were using to fool our recon cameras they were genuine rail lines spares just moved around after each attack to make it look as if wed hit the main line no son its the same old story had to do it with charlie in nam had to do it with that son of a bitch insane in iraq you have to go in on the ground well use the airborne its the only way where do we fit in general asked aussie lewis freeman gave the four sasd men an enigmatic smile well i thought after that sub base you knocked out you boysd be bored up there had enough of that lake havent you before they could answer freeman moved closer to the map and using his glasses as a pointer tapped the northern sector not of the lake but of the southwest corner of the amur hump on the siberianchinese border were in this war gentlemen because the chinese said we broke the ceasefire right here he was tapping a well whether we did or not weve got to get our boys out of there weve tried sending in choppers theyve been blown to bits he turned to david brentwood what we need is a small wellequipped commando force flying in noe to go in secure a chopper lz on the top of that damn mountain before the chicoms overrun it now our boys werent supposed to be in that area anyway at least not that close to the border and weve had no communication from them but we can sort out blame later most of all i want to get as many of them out as i can you game for it lewis noe nap of the earth flying in which the choppers were often no more than twenty feet above the treeline following the lands contours by radar alone didnt particularly worry lewis but choir williams he knew hated it well general choirs your boy for noe gives him a high it does good said freeman grabbing his coat ill leave you with norton to figure out the details he paused as fast as you can boys meanwhile i promise you im gonna hit those bastards of yesovs up at nizhneangarsk if i can stop the son of a bitchs offensive from getting east of the lake then i can wheel whats left of three corps south to reinforce our boys ranged against the chicoms bring cheng to a standstill and if your brother does his bit brentwood we might just be able to launch a counterattack defeat into victory eh with that a question still on david brentwoods lips freeman was gone over here gentlemen norton informed them weve already got the choppers fuel and sundries allocated for you now weapons he looked at david brentwood who everyone instinctively knew would lead the raid on the mountain excuse me sir but whats all this about my brother robert or ray i dont robert the submariner seal man too right robert yes nortons tone informed david that he would be told no more sorry said norton but its on a needtoknow basis and you dont need to know all i can tell you is that hes step number three a heck millimeter barrel for me said lewis without further ado referring to the heckler and koch machine gun run short of ammo we can strip the siberians you brentwood said norton the same and immediately david brentwood was drawn into the urgent preparations a seal team for the third part of freemans plan had been needed so quickly that there was no time to bring them from their conus continental united states navspecwargru navy special warfare group at either coronado california or little creek virginia instead freeman had requested the nearest seal contingent team nine from pearl harbor and had personally requested submariner captain robert brentwood of the sea wolfhunterkiller uss reagan to join the team as leader cincpaccommander in chief pacific admiral leahy responded in top secret immediate cable that this wasnt possible the admiral had nothing against brothers serving in the same theater the services were replete with such cases but robert brentwood captain of the reagans blue crew was now back at sea on a seventyday war patrol around the southern kuril islands north of japan guarding the vital entrances to the sea of okhotsk and so would not be back in pearl for the gold crew changeover for another fourteen days furthermore because of the strain on tacamo aircraft following the sabotage of the sub communication aerial in wisconsin admiral leahy said it might not be possible for the tacamo aircraft assigned the uss reagan to contact the sub for several days all right dick freeman had told norton now weve requested ill pull rank im ordering it as commander in chief far east i want robert brentwood because that submariner performed magnificently in baikal before these jokers pulled a ceasefire on me so did young david brentwood thats why i put them on my list theyre men ive worked with before and when youre in a corner pearl also points out that hes too old general interrupted norton robert brentwood i mean at fortyfour hes pushing it even for a sub captain let alone the seals they usually limit entry to seal special ops to twentysevenyearolds god damn it dick you know the age of the oldest tornado pilot in the iraqi war before norton could give him an answer freeman charged on a tornado pilot dick those boys went in on the deck needed goddamn windscreen wipers to keep the sand off their cockpits most dangerous air missions of all fiftynine thats how old he was dick fiftynine a fiftynineyearold brit a granddaddy and some pen pusher in pearls telling me fortyfours over the hill not exactly sir but well you have to admit for what you have in mind its going to be pretty rigorous lifes rigorous dick said freeman turning to the wall map and i need someone i can personally trust and know on this one taking up the dayglo pen he circled nizhneangarsk terminus now nizhneangarsks mine next he moved the marker south to the siberianchinese border area around a the sasdelta boysll have to take care of this one number two but he turned back to dick norton no way we can break through south of baikal and stop cheng unless robert brentwood does his job and it has to be done before the full moon so you tell cincpac i want robert brentwood out of that pig boat if he has to put every goddamn tacamo onto the reagan and i want him in pearl within fortyeight hours for a weeks refresher course send them the details most secret needtoknow basis only yes general but they will have to know the specific target sooner or later later not over the air coded or otherwise when he gets here yes sir robert brentwood was passing through the uss reagans blood alley the reddedout narrow corridor between the banks of the sea wolfs missile firecontrol computers into the ethereal blue of the sonar room where he had just been handed the millisecond burst transmission received via the long trailing lowfrequency aerial he preferred using the quick popup highfrequency mast to receive transmits the time needed to reel in the longer vlf could be the margin between life and death in the tight turning war of the hunterkillers besides with sound passing through water at four times the speed it moved through air the reelin now under way could be heard miles away despite the fact that the hydrophones spools were heavily insulated to prevent noise shorts from alerting the enemy but after the catastrophic breakdown of the computerphone networks in the states the vlf had been his only bet of picking up the tacamo aircraft robert brentwood was tense but it was more the content of the burst message man the reelin that made him so and only hale his executive officer could sense it the message had been brief and to the point pickup for transport to pearl to be made by a carrierborne chopper at the next morning dont they realize well be violating the first rule of a war patrol said brentwood handing back the decoded message to hale must be important then said the xo by way of making his skipper feel better about having to surface besides we have air superiority its not enemy air that im concerned about its those alfas they can pick us up breaking surface a hundred miles away through the sound channel brentwood turned around to the officer of the deck merrick whats state of sea topside beaufort scale eight gale force said the ood should be enough turbulence to cover our bustthrough noise might have to be a wet pickup for you though captain well better me wet than you guys have to agree with you there sir responded merrick easily any idea what they want you for asked hale no but its from cincfar east so i figure freemans behind it maybe more subs in lake baikal proffered merrick possibly i hope not too darn cold the pickup by a navy sea king helo and the transfer to pearl via one of salt lake citys mach f tomcats went much more smoothly than robert brentwood had anticipated apart from being told he was to be taken to the bud school at pearl harbor brentwood was still in the dark about the operation and on his arrival in pearl he discovered that not even chief petty officer brady the bullfrog the chief and most senior instructor at the navy special warfare group knew much more than he and the six enlisted men who besides the bullfrog would make up the seal team requested by freeman well said the bullfrog happily one thing we all know gentlemen bud doesnt stand for budweiser thought it did said one of the enlisted seven basic underwater demolition training was essential for the seals and was one of the prerequisites for wearing the coveted badge a trident grasped in the eagles right talon a flintlock pistol held in the other the anchor between them beach clearance posited one of the men come on chiefie pressed another of the seals such informality allowed nowhere else in the navy except in the tightly knit band of elite ud teams honest to god reilly replied the chief i havent been told the specific area none of usll know till weeks end freemans orders till then well be doing a rerun of motivation week in pearl he had everyones undivided attention motivation week was the sanitized naval version of what used to be called hell week it meant a week of cdu combat demolition unit training a week of deliberate sleep deprivation to slow your responses and wear you down weed out the weak ones if there were any dropout rate was fiftyone percent part of the treatment involved flying the men over to the outer island of kauai to the muddy taro fields around the wailua river where the men would have to avoid detection by a squad of instructors one of the methods being to stick a reed in their mouths while lying submerged in the mud waiting for the searchers to pass by problem was every now and then a leech draped itself over the straw and the air was cut off in the past some men came up purplefaced gasping wildly for air only to attract the attention of the instructors thereby failing that part of the course the eightman team robert brentwood the bullfrog and the other six enlisted men knew of course that regardless of whatever the specific mission was theyd be issued with special uba underwater breathing apparatus specifically the military version of the cobra closedcircuit oxygen breathing apparatus a rebreather system which apart from not issuing any telltale bubbles while you were going into a beach for example allowed the swimmer by means of the carbon dioxide filter canister to rebreathe the same gas additional oxygen being bled as needed from a front waist tank into the inflatable bag it was much better than the standard scuba or scaphandreautonome system there were still problems however and during the motivation week one diver seaman michael rose his last name reminding robert brentwood of his wife rosemary back in england ran into what the chiefs report blandly designated as some difficulty at feet in pearl being in saltwater the helium inject needed at that depth to prevent nitrogen narcosis or nitrogen drunkenness was bleeding in too slowly and rose despite his wrist fathometer lost all sense of direction going down to feet thinking he was going up before being located by the bullfrog and robert brentwood on the third day the team under brentwoods direction practiced egressing from a submerged subs forward escape hatch with the sub under way at one and a half knots for brentwood it was the first real indication of what their mission might be on the fourth day the eight of them were split into four twoman udtibs underwater demolition teams the ibs or inflatable small boat issued each of the four pairs a thirteenandahalffootlong f fiberglasshulled zodiac each pair of seals was then assigned to a landing craft the first of the four twoman teams consisted of brentwood and dennison a stocky man who despite his shorter height was probably the strongest swimmer of the group and who possessed a wry sense of humor as the landing craft started its run he crouched low in the zodiac on its outboard side and then on the signal from brentwood rolled over the rubber boats outer tube into the roiling water on the landing crafts port side a quarter mile out from pearls sub net brentwood followed and they began casting dennison unreeling agauge nylon fishingline marked for feel every one hundred feet at which point robert brentwood let a knotmarked lead sinker line down to the bottom quickly recording the depth by scratching it on his plastic knee slate and noting any other underwater obstructions apart from the sub net that an amphibious landing might encounter including the positions of channel markers and angle of breakwater to the beach each numbertwo man in the four twoman teams had to keep radio contact with the other team via waterproof cigarettepacksize walkietalkies it being vital for the teams to act in concert to effect a proper extraction or pickup if the zodiacs didnt cut out from the lcts at the same time on full throttle the muffled thirtyfive horsepower outboards streaking at right angles from the landing craft to pick up the swimmers each mans left hand raised high to mark his position there wouldnt be a second chance to be snared by the rubber loop held outboard from the fastmoving zodiac once a swimmers arm passed through the loop he would immediately bend his arm to a v and kick toward the zodiac as an lct crewman grabbing his webbed belt at midriff hauled him quickly aboard where he would ready himself in turn to snare the second man until all eight swimmers had been accounted for the four rubber boats would then turn and head out to sea away from the enemy shore to await their submarine pickup you did good bullfrog told dennison remember we lost more marines from drowning off tarawa than we did from jap shore fire if wed known just how deep some of them holes were in that coral we could have saved a lot of guys the chief hesitated for a moment then added but we still got a problem for the moment the other seven men including robert brentwood said nothing sitting back on the gunwales of the tender exhausted from more than six hours in the water brentwood though he didnt show it was sure he was the most fatigued he was old enough to be some of these mens father what problem asked dennison reaching tiredly for a squeeze bottle of gatorade none of us drowned speak for yourself put in rose the california tan of the twentyfiveyearold contrasting with the stubble of what had been a full head of strawcolored hair no conceded the chief swimming was okay but it was a screwup on the walkietalkies hell said dennison ours worked fine didnt it captain waterproof one hundred percent oh they all worked fine said the chief thats the problem did pearl pick it up put in brentwood on the hydrophones pearl said the chief captain they heard you up off diamond head frightened the fish in hanauma bay he grinned so now you guys know why you were made to learn american standard he meant the sign language used by the deaf and mute hold on said robert brentwood i dont know anything about sign language oh said the bullfrog clearly caught off base for the first time since the refresher courses had begun special orders from general freeman sir thought you knew hell no answered robert who despite the normal giveandtake of profanity in the service wasnt in the habit of swearing even mildly then captain said the chief youre going to have to learn sir rose youre the best with a bunch of fives the chief turned back to the commander of the uss reagan you have twentyfour hours captain brentwood gave an aye aye chief the only situation in which the captain of one of the most powerful warships in history would have done so at least so obligingly besides brentwoods momentary annoyance was mitigated by the growing conviction that he was now solving the puzzle of the missions precise location well aware as a commander himself of the needtoknow rationale for keeping an operation secret until the last he couldnt help taking pride in the certainty that he had divined freemans plan he wondered whether any of the enlisted men had put it together a sub approach offshore casting for obstacles sinker line depth measurements width of approach general douglas freeman was about to do another macarthur another inchon launch a daring seaborne invasion across the china sea and unless he brentwood was all wet the ssn uss reagan would be used to insert a survey udt underwater demolition team and once the underwater terrain was known the reagan would most likely use its torpedoes to clear any major underwater obstruction just prior to the amphibious assault the giveaway from brentwood was the concern over the walkietalkies if they were going to be that close to shore that they had to worry about the walkietalkie sound being picked up by a beach garrison then it had to be a preinvasion mission the final clue was the sign language it meant they were going to be very close to the enemy plus sign language wouldnt help you in the dark a dawn invasion he put this last conclusion to the bullfrog without revealing any of his other deductions and couldnt resist a quiet satisfaction in seeing the chief completely surprised the chief looked quizzically at him and brentwood got the distinct impression the chief was thinking that perhaps at fortyfour the sub skipper was getting a bit old for it darks no problem responded the chief explaining wed have pvs it wasnt equipment that they used on a sub much unless they surfaced at night and the bullfrog could see brentwood had been caught off base infrared added the chief unconsciously adding insult to brentwoods injured pride same kind they used in the iraqi war pick up hand signals no problem warm arms in a cold sea stick out like you got a hardon for the bullfrog it was a joke but everyone else was too tired including swimming time theyd been refreshing themselves with all the minutiae of seal underwater techniques for thirty hours without a break still as fatigued as he was brentwood recalled the bullfrogs earlier mention of tarawa it mightnt be that the seals would go in during the daylight given the chiefs mention of the pv goggles but youd have to be crazy to try a massive amphibious landing at night then again a lot of people had thought freeman was crazy for making a night attack on pyongyang until hed pulled it off right gentlemen said the chief six hours sleep and we start on some lovely abutments where asked rose down on waikiki doesnt matter put in smythe a tall string bean of a man what matters is how big these mothers are eh he turned to the bullfrog how big are they chiefie mothers are big answered the bullfrog truthfully quartermasters got us down for primacord with demolition knots with threefoot trailer cords to tie your charge to the master primacord be using bladders asked smythe yup confirmed the chief well all need tits he was referring to schantz bagbasket flotation packs that would take most of the weight of the explosive charges off the swimmers heavy fuckers then said reilly if we got schantzes whats the load added rose everybody seemed to come to life with the prospect of having to suffer more than they had already fifty pounds a tad more rosie said the chief smiling an even hundred jesus said rose and smythe whistled we gonna refloat the arizona well do a splashrun practice tomorrow announced the chief oh five hundred ill designate flank swimmers and fuse pullers ill have it ready by breakfast remember now light meal gents dont want anybody sinking light meal quipped dennison if im still alive as they dismissed young rose told robert brentwood that the scuttlebutt around pearl was that the chinese had some kind of longrange rockets by some lake in far western china and that the seals were going to hit them well if its the scuttlebutt you can be sure its wrong you got it figured out then skipper well rose brentwood answered still unused to uttering his wifes name so far away from her ill tell you what i think providing you keep it to yourself no use violating needtoknow before we have to absolutely captain freemans going to launch an attack from korea across the yellow sea against chinas right flank shantung peninsulas my guess just over two hundred miles due west of inchon rose paled jesus but theyd chop us to pieces robert brentwood smiled to do that the chicomsll have to withdraw troops from their northern borders now rose saw the light take the pressure off our guys up there right course well have to skedaddle on out of there once they start pouring down from the north toward the peninsula what if they dont go for it rose what would you think washingtond do if enemy troops landed on the baja peninsula way i figure it freemans going to do another macarthur the unexpected and were going in at night to take out the underwater obstacles robert brentwood would soon be glad he hadnt told the others of his hunch after all being half right doesnt get you the kewpie doll he was a firstrate navy man but was talking through his hat he was no politician and as things stood washington virtually under siege at home had no intentions of expanding the war further by invading china such a move would be implicitly taken by taiwan as the green light for it to attack and that flash point could ignite all of asia chapter twentyone harbin the hutong stank the truck which normally collected the night carts cargo delayed because of the snowfall from the tiny window alexsandra could see twowheel pushcarts sitting forlornly at the end of the hutongs abandoned the granny brigade seemed oblivious to the stench much more offensive to them was the odor of their siberian allies many of whom were now in harbin frequenting the unofficial brothels that lay in the clutter of dwellings along the riverbank like most whites the siberians smelled of old wet dog and this morning as the granny brigade its three members red armbands vivid against the snow their aged backs bent like vultures looking for carrion made their way up the hutong soldiers both pla and siberians descended to assist in the continuing search for the spy alexsandra malof the underground had managed to hide her successfully from the granny brigade so far by keeping her in the claustrophobic room which she had since discovered lay in the rear of a small bicycle repair shop one of those allowed under the partys liberalization program the alleyways had remained choked with snow and piles of it were accumulating at the end of the alley as one of the wonders of china complete snow removal by hand took place each day as people emerged silently from the hutongs hovels to clear the narrow byways on command of the local committee the grannies as usual were supervising noting who was where who was absent stopping every now and then assiduously sniffing the snowcleansed air for the taint of wet dog theres a foreigner here announced the smallest of the grannies all three dressed in identical padded and faded navyblue mao suits it was an announcement clearly meant for everyone to hear the three of them turning crooked necks watching the two dozen or so people from their hutong silently busy with wooden push shovels and bramble brooms the latter whisking against the bare flagstones long crystals of ice snaking along in crazy patterns theres a foreigner here the brooms kept whisking as if no one could hear her save for an old man who straightening up looked about confused unsure of whether hed heard a command the few children who had been playing quickly disappeared swallowed by the hovels as if struck by some silent felt message from their parents the grannies also split up their heads moving now with an extraordinary agility for their age as they shuffled along noting the numbers of the houses the smallest granny blowing her whistle shrilly within minutes the street security committee arrived three young zealots their gender hidden under identical mao suits red armbands at large they had a right to inspect each house indicated by the granny brigade a policeman would normally accompany them at least this was the party regulation but with a war going on against the american imperialists the security committees had assumed greater authority engendering more fear than usual in every soul in every hutong in the city of million soon an army policeman his thick cottonpadded olivegreen winter uniform flecked with snow appeared walking in from the direction of the main road there were no histrionics for the lings who ran the repair shop besides there was nowhere to go as mr ling looked out the window of his cramped kitchen he spotted a khaki truck its tire treads choked with packed snow pla troops spilling out of it a dozen heading left down the main road another dozen or so to the right encircling the hutong directly behind lings repair shop lay more cluttered snowcapped hovels leading down to the frozen river ling knew it was quite hopeless he was surrounded besides if there was the slightest opposition theyd take his eightyearold son his only child away as well he went in and told alexsandra they had discovered her he was sorry their eyes met only for a moment in the grim morning light and in that moment they both understood there was nothing they could do to run was futile she might as well save her strength the charges were that she and ling as running dog jackals of the fascist prodemocracy movement were guilty of treasonous antirevolutionary activity i could smell her pronounced the diminutive granny victoriously i could smell her mr ling looked at the old woman with quiet contempt you smell nothing but your own fear within minutes the public security man arrived and alexsandra and ling were shackled hands behind their backs the chain passing around the front of the waist between their legs and back up to a metal collar she was taken out to the psb car a battered blue fiat ling to a police motorcycle and sidecar nearby someone has betrayed us he yelled back at the hutong the psb rider slapped him across the ear with a rough suede driving glove zhu kou shut up the moment alexsandra felt herself pushed into the small blue fiat its upholstery a dusty fadedgray velour she experienced a strange sense of relief the warmth of the cars heater was luxurious it was the warmest shed been for days and in her relief came the sudden smothering fear that if she was so weak as to have already surrendered to this slight creature comfort what would she tell the psb interrogators once faced with another boneaching cold cell even the yakuts of her native siberia who lived in the region where the temperature often dropped below minus sixty grudgingly admired the legendary ability of the northern chinese to endure the cold her fear of dying cold was she knew as irrational as having hoped she would ever be free her rape by the siberians at baikal had never left her and what was it all worth her silence she didnt even know whether the message about the nanking bridge had gotten through yet all this now paled next to her simple but overwhelming desire to be warm again her craving for even the smallest candle subduing all reason all prior resolve for now she knew it would almost certainly end with a bullet in the neck the traditional party execution for counterrevolutionaries most likely it would be a public affair as public and as exaggerated as her arrest a warning to all those who might have sympathy with the prodemocracy movement and if she was cold she would shiver as she knelt and they would think it was fear if only to deny them that she longed to be warm chapter twentytwo as freeman finalized preparations for his attack on nizhneangarsk major truets charlie company cut off from the main body of iii corps waited anxiously at the southern end of the lake still dug in facing westward the rail tracks and concrete tunnels atop the cliff overlooking the lake a hundred yards behind them in the night the moonlit fringe of the boreal forest stood like an impenetrable curtain barely a hundred yards in front of them the snowdrifts so high theyd climbed halfway up the trunks of the trees whose branches were now stiff to breaking point from the weight of snow despite thomiss incurable pessimism the rest of second platoon remained confident that freeman would eventually get evacuation choppers across the lake from the east but for now all they could do was wait all available choppers busy ferrying what men they could find in the hell that lay beneath the cloud covering the lake the sound of yesovs juggernaut was still rolling and thundering the siberians now getting behind as well as in front of iii corps to finish off what was left of the american retreat though knowing this thomis remained bitterly disappointed at the choppers failure so far to rescue him and he continued to argue forcefully that they should move back to the cover of the tunnels when it came the weak creaking sound of the siberian reserve armor no more than half a mile away sounded like unoiled rail cars the occasional clankiness of more tanks moving through the forest belying the awesome power of the main battle tanks each t weighed pounds and was outfitted with a mm smoothbore one of the largest tank cannons in the world they moved at no more than fifteen miles per hour until general minsky gave the order for a thirtyfivemileperhour burst of speed as they approached the edge of the treeline beyond which lay c company cold was seeping down from the forests edge pouring into the foxholes and trenches around thomis and his buddies like dry ice at times obscuring the slit openings between the lograft cover of some of charlie companys trenches what thomis valdez emory the georgian and others couldnt figure out was how with the treeline so thick at the forest edge the tanks could hope to exit directly in front of the trenches unless the siberians intended bringing bulldozers forward but this would give charlie company time to triangulate mortar attacks which while they mightnt harm the tanks would give c companys antitank crews more time and pin down the siberian infantry but then siberian tactics werent known for showing particular concern for numbers of troops lost so long as the objective was obtained and anyway thomis hissed it didnt matter what the fuck their strategy is man where in hell we gonna go with a sheer hundredfiftyfoot drop behind us jump into the lake opined valdez nervously thomis was stamping his feet to keep warm very fucking amusing valdez a reconnaissance patrol from c company was almost shot as it scurried back from the treeline their report succinct fuckers are everywhere headin straight for us how far asked major truet half a mile maybe less we could try rappeling down the cliff said emory thomis sneered oh terrific he said cupping his hands about the ms breech to stop it freezing up and while were going down what the fuck you think the siberiansll be doing having tea anyway where the hell would we go on the ice taking a fucking stroll while they pick us off from the cliffs no one answered thomis was a pain but on this one his pessimism was justified valdez said the tanks were probably farther in the woods than anyone thought that maybe theyd turn run parallel to the tracks and would go past charlie company not toward them maybe they were going along some logging road north toward port baikal to reinforce yesovs attack on the retreating iii corps jesus said thomis looking behind him down out over the moonbathed white cloud that obscured the lake what asked valdez but then he saw as thomis had what looked like a canal or rather a long jagged slit in the ice in fact it was through a narrow break in the cloud cover that he and the rest in the squad glimpsed the flashes of the guns theyd been at it all day and now through his starlight binoculars valdez for one could see clearly in the surreallooking green world of the night vision glasses the slaughter of the remnants of iii corps caught out on the ice theyre being massa began valdez shut up hissed thomis listen the creak of the tanks had stopped to the right of second platoons heavy machine gun trench and scattered foxholes a branch collapsed the snow pouring down from the tree like sugar valdez slid his m forward on the frozen ice rest hed sculptured in front of him hold it cautioned emory softly maybe it just fell course it fucking fell hissed thomis you idiot emory took no offense he knew it was thomiss fear talking the same kind of fear that had suddenly made his own mouth dry as sandpaper no firing said the lieutenant softly yet urgently his voice on the walkietalkie distinct without a trace of static as he turned the volume as low as he possibly could he was listening so intently that he seemed to feel everything at once the wind moaning through the trees snow plopping down here and there a crack of a branch the distant crackle of small arms fire on the lake below and in the distance the scream of more siberian rocket salvos their fiery tails a fizzing white in the night goggles his concentration and the weight of the goggles giving him a cluster headache that started to radiate down his right arm bastards said thomis by which he meant what the hell were the siberians up to no such luck thomis heard the lieutenant reply in answer to valdezs hope that c company was being bypassed by the siberians another patrol sent out earlier following the rail tracks south of c companys position had spotted an enemy troop concentration at least five hundred possibly brigade size collecting around kultuk there was absolutely no doubt about it charlie company was trapped between kultuk twentyfive miles to the south and port baikal twenty miles to the north and by cliffs above the artilleryruptured ice behind them suddenly someone said they could hear a chopper one of ours said emory one of theirs countered thomis the truth was it was impossible to tell amid the cacophony of echoes rebounding about the cliffs i told you said valdez old doug said hed try to get evac through to us old dougs in khabarovsk said thomis can it ordered truet who could hear them as he came down the line but excitement was rising emory said it sounded like a chinook throw all the crap out of it seats fire extinguishers rescue winch you could get forty or so men in a c evac a whole platoon more if you jettisoned your weapons truet said nothing raising expectations was bad news if you couldnt follow through menll lose confidence in your leadership they told him at west point and he knew they were right thomis was in the worst state and only emory knew what was eating away at him thomis and his wife had had a real dustup the night before hed shipped out from frisco all the way through the tunnel theyd argued because hed smacked young wendy she was ten that morning for giving lip to her mother he tried to make up telling her hed buy her something really nice for her eleventh birthday but shed gone into the big sulk hed hit her pretty hard on the backside and now he was thinking about how he used to kneel down say her prayers with her jesus tender shepherd hear me honest to god hed told emory in a quieter moment idve given my right hand not to have left her like that hurting her her old man goes off doesnt come back all shell remember the chunkachunka sound a cgrew louder and a few of the guys started to get wound up easy now the sergeant told them watch your perimeter thomis promised god right there and then that if he ever got out of it hed never hit wendy again wouldnt take any crap but hed never hit her never he could smell her warm babypowder smell after her bath and her hair golden just like her moms there was another fall of snow from the trees and he wondered whether other men in the line were making deals with the almighty just get me out of this god and i promise in the dank cell the harbin public security bureau guards had difficulty attaching the small alligator clamps to lings testicles ling was so terrified despite his determination not to show it that his sheer fright and the cold combined to shrink the skin around the scrotum into a small tight corrugated ball with the consistency of tough old elephant skin one of the guards jerked hard on the single rope tie that passed through lings arms and around his neck the guard had a lot of practice having been very active in the thirtyeighth armys police action against antisocial elements following tiananmen square in the summer of he had tied the arms of many of the hooligans of the prodemocracy movement before theyd been executed what did the jew woman tell you asked the psb interrogator ling was silent his gaze downcast fixed on a spot of rat droppings to better focus his resistance the white woman you had hiding in your house said the interrogator what did she tell you ling shook his head she told you nothing proffered the interrogator lings head moved but it seemed more a stiffening of his own will than an answer personally the interrogator had told his superior hed much rather talk to the comrade to convince ling in a calm logical manner that helping the siberian jewess against his own people was treason an act not only against the party but against the people and the party loved the people the siberian at the consulate however latov was in a hurry to break the underground movement in harbin the major distribution center of food and munitions not only for chengs armies fighting the americans around manzhouli but for chinese divisions spread along the manchuriansiberian border ling didnt feel the electric shock hed braced himself for instead the interrogator suddenly leapt out of his wooden chair with a bulllike roar the current having shortcircuited along the table you idiot he shouted slapping one of the guards so hard that the mans cap went flying the other guard fumbled with the wires again while the interrogator strode angrily up and down the side of the cell farthest from the table the shock had jolted his nerves so badly he had lit another cigarette while one was already on the go he told the guard to turn up the amperage and when the shock hit ling his scream could be heard in stalin park ling blacked out and had almost choked the idiot guard having forgotten the tongue clamp and having turned the amperage too high the interrogator his nerves rattled for the second time reminded the guards that if they didnt get results quickly then someone would be taking their rice bowl to the front and they would be thrown into the battle for a american gangsters had already inflicted seventeen percent casualties on the pla and though they would be undoubtedly overrun they were putting up a fierce resistance disconnect the wires ordered the interrogator you fools will kill him before he can talk he turned on the man at the door well just dont stand there go and get the boy from the hutong it was a thing the interrogator didnt like to do but now his job was much more than an internal matter of running a democracy movement cell to ground it was war between the american imperialists and the peoples army whatever was necessary had to be done while they were waiting for the boy lings wife was dragged screaming from her cell farther down the corridor the interrogator put a cigarette into lings mouth ling spat it out but it was as if the interrogator didnt see it i dont dislike you comrade he told ling his tone affecting sincerity i admire your courage ling tried to spit at him but it had no direction or force merely dribbling down the faint stubble of his sallow chin now said the interrogator throwing down the cigarette hed barely started grinding it into the timepolished floor and shaking his finger like a schoolmaster you have made me very angry a halfrunning halfshuffling noise came closer to the cell and in the dirty saffron light of the corridor ling saw his wife crumpled between the sweating arms of her captors put her in the next cell the interrogator commanded mrs ling had not looked at her husband fearing it would weaken both their resolve and both knowing he was a dead man well let them think about it for a while announced the interrogator now lighting another cigarette lets see the siberian whore the two guards followed him eagerly from lings cell not only did they want to see her tortured but if someone didnt talk soon theyd be in manzhouli the helicopter now was high above charlie company in the darkness but whether it was in front or behind them or coming down directly overhead was difficult to tell the heat wash of its rotor column and engines presenting no more than a white blurred image in thomiss night vision goggles icy gusts of snow stinging their faces like sand the next instant the treeline a hundred yards in front of them was vibrant in light the fuel air explosive detonated overhead then came the sounds of men screaming on fire scrambling frantically from their foxholes rolling desperately in the snow other men leaving their positions running to help only to be machinegunned as the siberian mi havoc its silhouette often mistaken for the american apache pulled out of its mileperhour dive the havoc turned in a deadly pirouette its slaved fiftymillimeter still firing the guns flame suppressor hiding its position except from those directly in its thermalimage range finder and they were now dead or wounded the havocs stream ofs was hitting them at pointblank range bodies disintegrating as the depleted uranium armorpiercing explosivehead bullets tore into the men of charlie company including the twoman aa team forty feet from thomis their charred bodies still burning flung back from their airtoair stinger the shadow of its barrel flickering on the snow in response to the crackling spitting fire now raging in the curtain of flame that was the forests edge tall birch burned like oilsoaked torches and beech trees exploded from the superheated gases as the burned barbecue smell filled thomiss nostrils he was crying the havoc now only faintly visible before it disappeared into the blackness above the forest stay where you are the sergeant was yelling emory get the fuck back stay back emory was throwing his groundsheet over someone stomping its edges to smother the fire but the groundsheet billowed and rose in a soft burst of flame valdez seeming to have melted what was left of his skin dripping like hot wax slipping away from his face his eyes cooked white glaring into the burning night some of the fuel air gel had splashed onto emory and he was slapping it trying to get rid of it as he stumbled back to his foxhole the supreme irony was that a radio signal had just come in from freemans hq informing major truet that an evac of c company wounded having first priority would be attempted within the next hour ammunition on the american dead bodies was still cooking off exploding from the heat and the sergeant was shouting at everyone to keep their heads down that an evac would soon be on its way thomis upending his m resting the barrel on his right foot pulled the trigger the sound of the shot lost in the general melee his foxhole like so many others was filled with the reek of cordite and urine look to your front the sergeant was yelling his voice on the edge of hysteria medic shouted thomis the medic heard him but there were so many others who had also been hit it would be another ten minutes before he could reach thomis use your field dressing he shouted and thomis hands trembling felt for his field dressing pack beneath his helmet band inside his v heavyarmored artillery command vehicle general minsky moved from the folding seat immediately beneath the turret the dull thick vibration from the generator pulsing through his body as he folded the traverse table easing himself forward to use the pw periscope sight through which by determining polar coordinates he could doublecheck the firing position of the mm battery and train the batterys master gun but the blizzard was still in progress and he moved back to the traverse table having to rely on previously computed positions as he readied for the next phase of the shock attack a twoinch broken red line indicating the positions of the isolated american company as reported by the havoc minsky missed the open vent days of the afghan war here it was so cold you had no option but to have everyone shut up relying on the nbc nuclear biological chemical air filter for fresh air even so diesel fumes still got through and at times made him feel nauseated still the battle as recorded on the command vehicles data terminal was going well the slutsk division living up to its reputation its radio operator aboard this minskys stateoftheart command vehicle was picking up some of the frantic radio traffic from the americans just hit by the havoc chapter twentythree by god said freeman on being told that iii corps was effectively off the board theyll pay for this dick ill teach those sluts and yesovs other mongol hordes that butchering americans comes at a high cost two for one norton thought it unwise at that moment to point out that the siberian divisions were not exactly mongols but the pentagon knowing of freemans affection for the good book had succinctly cautioned the general against too hasty a reaction by somewhat sanctimoniously reminding him that vengeance is mine saith the lord and i freeman had replied am his sword gathering the last of his gear for phase one of his threephase counterattack the general was looking at the section of the onc e chart showing the southern end of lake baikal where the remnants of iii corps were being devoured by yesovs armor even the goddamn weathers against us should lift in about fortyeight hours general norton tried to reassure him its getting colder up north round yakutsk but the met boys predict quite a jump in temperatures round the siberianmongolian border well said freeman shaking his head at the enormity of what was happening on the lake over five thousand casualties already reported medevac and must medical unit selfcontained units overextended jump in temperature might clear the weather but itll be too damn late dick only jump thatll count will be the airbornes over nizhneangarsk and that wont be any good unless the seal team does what its supposed to each part of the plan depends on the other i know that sir now listen if we insert that seal team and have trouble extracting i dont want them written off left on their lonesome understand yes sir if they say theyre in trouble you get an sasdelta team in there with everything theyve got to provide cover freeman held up his hand to stay nortons objections yes yes i know it might put any rescue team in the hole but its a matter of policy americans have to do everything to get our boys out if they get in a jam hell thats what were all about we could move a team in now suggested norton i dont want to increase the traffic unless absolutely necessary if anyone gets spotted prematurely the seals whole operationd be shot besides closest sd team weve got is the one going in on a to help out that goddamn battery that started this whole thing youre right theyd be the closest to the seal objective but we can only use them after they secure a perimeter for a chopper withdrawal of the battery if they manage that thatd be one for the books commented norton younger brother rescuing the older hand freeman looked blankly at norton the generals mind having been so preoccupied with the minutiae of preparation for what would be his and historys biggest airborne invasion since arnhem in he had momentarily forgotten that two of the three brentwoods would be in action at more or less the same time the general paid it no mind it was hardly unprecedented brothers in second army were fighting a lot closer together than young david brentwood would be at manzhouli and robert farther south the general also paid it no mind because he knew that if robert brentwoods seal team met heavy resistance his entire threepronged counterattack plan against the siberianchicom alliance would fail and it was a thought he didnt want to entertain it was the first time norton had seen freeman willfully turning away from an unpleasant possibility which was a measure not only of how badly the war was going for second army and how tired the general was but above all just how vital the seal mission would be along with freemans impending jump over nizhneangarsk freeman turned his attention to the map of the naval supply line stretching all the way from americas west coast through the kuril island gaps immediately north of japan through the sea of okhotsk to siberia it was another possible weak link for if the siberian alfa hunterkiller subs could plug the narrow shallow gaps between the kurils the gateway to the sea of okhotsk then the enemy could quite literally turn off the oil supply to freemans entire second army the general reminding norton of george pattons famous dictum my men can eat their boots but my tanks gotta have gas which for just one ma meant two and a half gallons for every mile even as freeman spoke the sonar operator aboard the sea wolf uss reagan on war patrol just east of the kuril islands heard a faint pulse through the undersea frying of shrimps clicking and whales moaning and alerted the executive officer hale now captain in robert brentwoods absence merrick in turn had moved up to be the xo when hale heard the sonar bong by his bunk he got up so fast he knocked over the picture of his wife and two children and within a minute still stuffing his shirt inside his trousers was standing inside the brass rail that skirted the scope island in reagans reddedout combat control center he wanted coffee but robert brentwood had strictly enforced his noliquid nofood rule in the ccc whatve we got sonar hale asked raspily looking at the threetiered green screen unidentified submarine sir suspected hostile by nature of sound signature negative it meant there wasnt enough noise being emitted by the unidentified craft as yet to get a propprint from the computer library which could identify a specific vessel by matching its intransit sound which like the sound of every human being had an individual voice print but sometimes the enemy tried to add a baffle a steel plate welded here or there or extra acoustic soundabsorbing tile on the superstructure to alter their noise signature even so a good operator like leading sonarman rogers whose higherrange hearing hadnt been damaged by too much hard rock music when he was younger could often identify the class of ship from a sound which to someone elses hearing would have been the faintest pulsing of a prop id say an alfa said rogers adding might have flaked indicating that the fast fortyfiveknot hunterkiller alfa might have lost part of its anechoic paint designed to absorb rather than reflect the ping of a searching subs active sonar but hale had the uss reagans sonar on passivelistening mode only the sub itself on silent running while its nuclear reactor was unable to be shut down completely it was heavily muffled the reactor crew wearing their yellow booties not only to prevent them from transferring any possible radioactive particles from the coffeepot or nuclear reactor throughout the sub but to prevent even the sound of footsteps radiating through the hull sir correction said rogers louder now its a diesel a quiet one all right but a diesel beat for sure ten thousand yards closing print out possible hostiles ordered hale also informing the crew quickly calmly mr merrick retains the deck i have the con they were now well beyond the relatively shallow shelf of the kuril gap into deeper water merrick as xo in brentwoods absence immediately took up his position as officer of the deck behind the two planesmen noting one whose face was beaded in perspiration wordlessly he pulled out a damp tissue from the flipup box and so as not to alarm the planesman or divert his attention he simply said wiping and drew the tissue across the mans forehead a millisecond lost because of stinging perspiration in the eyes could put them all dead in the path of a torpedo or subroc sonars auxiliary screen was now a column of brown xs signifying the different classes of diesel to the right of each listing speed surfaced and dived displacement missiles radar arrays sonars and officercrew complement your best estimate hale asked rogers they had worked together on the nuclear submarine roosevelt which after sinking an enemy sub and sustaining considerable damage herself had to be scuttled in the arctic lest her vital coding machines be captured present speed submerged said rogers his tone controlled and assured plus or minus twentyfive knots displacement plus or minus two point five id say soviet kilo class three thousand eight hundred yards and closing bearing zerothreeniner man battle stations ordered hale the chime alert bonging softly throughout the submarine speed twenty knots answered rogers hard left rudder to onethreefive degrees ordered hale left rudder to onethreefive degrees confirmed rogers the diving officer watching rudder and trim control bearing asked hale zerothreeniner came the response mark range four thousand angle on the bow said hale beginning the litany of his attack starboard onefour firing point procedures master onezero tube one firing point procedures master onezero tube one came the confirmation solution ready sir weapons ready ship ready final bearing and shoot announced hale master onezero tube one bearing and speed confirmed the firing officer took over the procedure stand by shoot fire one fired and running the sine wave that was the other sub changed its vector on the screen then fired shift to zeroeightfive commanded hale gripping the periscope island rail anticipating the turn zeroeightfive sir very well fire two fire two two fired and running sir take her to four hundred maximum angle twozero degrees four hundred maximum twozero degrees the second mk of reagans two mks was homing in the enemy unable to shake off its lockon the visible sound blip of the other sub hastily and now noisily retreating suddenly swelled from the size of a pinhead to that of a quarter then just as quickly shrank becoming two microdots of light on the screen fading sliding slowly down the screen into nothingness it was hours it had all happened in just under seven minutes it was only ten minutes later at that hale and his crew received the information via an urgent tacamo vhf burst message that they had sunk a setoshio class diesel electric not a soviet kilo the setoshio classs displacement thousand tons a diesel similar to that of the soviet kilo also with six torpedo tubes but a jdf japanese defense force attack submarine the reagans attack killing all seventyfive men aboard no bodies had so far been found or any other substantial wreckage the identification having come instead from the contents of the pressurized garbage chute packets of shogun noodles floating to the surface and spotted by a jdf asw patrol boat off the kuril islands hale immediately knew that like captain will rogers of the aegis cruiser uss vincennes who had shot down an iraqi airliner by mistake in and unlike the captain of a uss guided missile frigate stark who in had allowed his ship to be fired on first he would be completely exonerated by the navy he also knew that the japanese defense force sub shouldnt have been in the grid that it had strayed out of its predetermined patrol area most likely lured by a russian huk probing the strait near the japaneses sacrosanct islands yet neither he rogers nor the firing officer would ever be the same again but in the massive conflict raging all about them whatever stayed with them no matter how deep it ran would have to run silently aboard the reagan eleven minutes later at the downed subs big diesel imploded the noise momentarily deafening rogers so that only his training made him hit the squelch volume button rather than tearing off his headset the noise so loud it smothered all sea sound within a threemile radius it was no surprise then that the reagan didnt hear the alfa that had been lying quietly on the bottom beyond the kuril gap closest to japan by the time rogers sonar did pick it up and hale ordered the sharp turn it was too late the alfa having had ample time to hear the reagan firing earlier to have already vectored in the americans the alfa captain had fired his three twentyoneinchdiameter surfacetosurface torpedolaunched subrocs each of the fourthousandpound warheads when detonated above the surface capable of killing any submarine to a depth of three thousand feet well beyond most subs crush depth with the reagan level at fifteen hundred the first subroc exploded above the reagans hull forward of its sail hale heard the fire alarm go off for aft compartment three above the torpedoes the temperature gauge already registering degrees fahrenheit the sub quickly filling with the pungent reek of an electrical fire inject lock he ordered hoping the freon gas would extinguish the fire within seconds over the intercom and above cries of men in the sealedoff section he could hear the freon hissing into compartment three and then a tremendous explosion as an oxygen tank ruptured its noise bursting eardrums its contents blowtorching the degrees fahrenheit to degrees fahrenheit plastic fixtures spontaneously combusting sending more choking toxic fames throughout the boat in the next moment two torpedos exploded ripping the sub apart forward of the sail the pressure at three thousand feet over pounds per square foot driving the mortally wounded sub down toward the bottom in excess of a hundred miles an hour first officer merrick and sonarman rogers barely made it from control into the sixman forward popout escape capsule with three others but the release mechanism wouldnt work weighed down by what sounded like a pile of junk blown back from the disemboweled forward section then quite unexpectedly they heard the pile of metal above shifting like a collapsed barn in a hurricane the debris that had been holding them down suddenly jettisoned release arm ordered hale there was a sound like a small grenade as the escape hatch burst free of the control section but the sea wolf by then was already too deep well over crush depth of four thousand feet the sub plummeting at over miles an hour the release capsule shooting up from it through the water column like a cork released from a bottomless column jesus christ it was the voice of a bosun aboard a us trident sub a hundred miles east of the kuril gap the trident picking up the death throes of the reagan the agonizing warping of her bulkheads astonishing like a dying whale heard via the sound channel as clearly as if it had been only ten miles away the sine wave that was the plummeting reagan was drooping like a u of green pasta on the green screen the dot of the escape capsule streaking up through the tridents three trace sonar windows at terrific speed its noise like a rush of ice scatter heard by everyone aboard the trident then there was a tremendous wallop like a space capsule smashing into the earth the reagans escape module hitting the airwater interface its cone shape pancaked by pressures for which it wasnt designed its blip on the tridents screen now resembled nothing so much as coffee grounds sliding down an opaque window the slow rain of detritus all that remained of the reagans capsule and crew falling lifelessly and silently back into the very deep from which they had sought to escape poor bastards said the tridents bosun no one else spoke by the time the news was being conveyed to robert brentwood that he had just lost his second submarine this time with all hands going down with her he was about to learn that the target of his missionoperation country gardenwould constitute the third phase of freemans unexpected counterattack against yesov the other seven members of the seal team were as eager as brentwood had been but just as taciturn in not showing their expectation a nonchalant stance typical of the swimmer commandoes tempered by the knowledge that whatever the mission was it was bound to be highly dangerous it was at this moment of unspoken tension that brentwood experienced an attack of freefloating anxiety this time it was guilt which he irrationally yet understandably felt for not having been in the combat control center when the reagan had been caught out and destroyed all her crew had been lost all men he had made it his business to know his extended family many of whom had served aboard the roosevelt before hed had to scuttle her in the high arctic and now he had not been with them after all he had detected the alfa that had mortally wounded the roosevelt had made it pay for the blast from one of its twentyonefootlong torpedoes which had resulted in a hairline fracture in the roosevelts reactor brentwood knew that for him as for some of the other men who had been farther away from the radiationcontaminated water before it had been pumped out the borderline rad dosage of radioactivity hed received could kill him before his time he had been surprised to learn from the doctors in the oxford radiation clinic that the same dosage could have widely different effects on its victims some went on living without apparent damage as he had so far then quite suddenly as the result of high stress a man with the same dosage would rapidly decline in health the psychological factor in the words of the military mds was all but unmeasurable you never knew brentwood now felt doubly at risk enmeshed by depression upon hearing of the reagan had he been aboard maybe he would have trailed the hydrophone array a little longer instead of relying solely on the inboard builtin hull sensors and thus might have picked up the whoosh of the alfas torpedoes or subrocs whatever had hit her ranged against his depression there was his wife rosemary in england to think about and the impending birth of their first child all his training told him hed have to put the reagan behind him it wasnt his fault everybody made mistakes in their job yet he knew from his experience after hed scuttled the roosevelt that for the foreseeable future he would be plagued by a disturbing dreamfilled sleep a parade of faces known and served with now gone or was it all stressinduced premonition parading in the guise of memory a foreshadowing of the seals mission outcome he had a look at the d mockup of the china coast that had spawned the rumors of an amphibious invasion rumors bolstered by the fact that their refresher courses here at pearl had included depth sounding and obstacle clearance another rumor this one correct was that word of freemans target had arrived by handcuffedsatchel courier in pearl by the time robert brentwood and the seven others were assembled in the shed the briefing officer from freemans ho drawing on what a us president had once counseled reminded the eightman seal team that in crisis situations you never have all the information you want you nevertheless have to make a decision based on whatever information you do have what freemans g intelligence section and the cia knew before they received the vital information from the underground democracy movement was that the bridge over the yangtze was considered one of the engineering wonders of the world certainly more impressive to many chinese than the great wall its guard towers built along the milelong dragonbacked barrier against ghengis khan one of the reasons for the chinese reverence toward the great bridge was that during the bitter sinosoviet disputes of the sixties khrushchev had suddenly pulled out all russian advisers including the plans for the bridge in effect saying to beijing if youre so damn smart build it yourselves to the worlds astonishment especially the siberians for whom the bridge was now so vital the chinese did build it themselves producing one of the greatest engineering feats of all time not only did the mighty bridge nine piers in all support a deck with miles of road way but it had a railroad on a lower second deck that spanned the great river for over four miles when mao and his communists crossed the river on april chasing out the nationalists they had also for the first time united the two chinas that cold china of the north the country of the noodle eaters and the warmer country of rice eaters south of the yangtze the nanking bridge began the seal briefing officer without ceremony he might as well have been talking about the ventura freewayis the largest bridge over the yangtze vital link between north and south china at any time but now with early rains flooding out the approach roads to the other crossings this nanking baby is their only one especially given its railhauling capacity he switched on the projector and brentwood could hear the quiet whir of the air fan which was strangely comforting given the monumental task that eight men now realized lay before them air force continued the briefing officer havent been able to get anywhere near it its not only the lousy weather but the aa ring around this sucker is something else five times denser than it ever was around hanoi sam sites zsu aa batteries you name it theyve got it including a nifty little number they bought from israel the arrow mach two plus nasty besides he dimmed the lights and focused the blackandwhite blowup of a blurred satellite picture of the bridge which they used in pearl for a scale mockup it always amazed brentwood that they claimed a camera on some of the satellites in geosynchronous orbit like the k could read a newspaper in red square all he could see was a black blur indicating the bridge the latter circled in white on the slide difficult to make out with the naked eye conceded the briefer as if reading brentwoods thoughts but under the magnifier you can see the nine piers all right set on concrete blocks now the big problem is that this was built in the heyday of red chinas paranoia about america had a touch of that ourselves didnt we asked rose the briefing officer shrugged the comment off his grandpa had said something about it a senator joe mccartney or something yeah well what youve got to remember is that this bridge has like i say nine piers and its a truss bridge that is there are vshaped steel supports arcing out either side from each of the nine concrete piers these steel arcs hold up eight individual sections between the nine piers i repeat eight individual sections its not all one span brentwood was right on it so even if we blow a hole in one section if we dont take out the whole span they just build over the hole right and even if you hit the top level theres a second the rail deck underneath so youre going to have to knock out a pier or bring down a whole section between piers chicoms knew what the hell they were doing not building it in one continuous span they built eight of the bastards in the event of war the problem is in order to get enough high explosive to blow out a pier youd have to drill deep holes for the charges and the commies dont like that said the bullfrog brady nah said the briefer scrunching up his face adopting bradys tone make too much noise and concrete dust might hit a sampan get in their chop suey probably get melvin belli to sue the shit out of you that sounds fair said rose thats all we need said dennison who was just coming out of a messy divorce more fucking lawyers what we need gentlemen said the briefing officer is to insert you clandestinely and have you do what damage you can now we cant drill into the pier so youre going to have to get high enough above the piers waterline to attach the he to the trusses place the explosives near the bottom of the vshaped steel supports where theyre embedded into the concrete remember this isnt the movies its not the blast per se thatll bring the steel supports down but the heat generated for a second or two just long enough to soften the steel so itll droop like taffy on a fork and then the whole damn shebangll come tumbling down its all in raising the temperature high enough to plasticize the steel for a split second or two failing that go for an earmuff he charge on two piers supporting one of the spans if you dont get a span theyll just lay a few planks across the hole from a halfassed explosion like they did on that baghdad bridge we hit in the iraqi war trafficd be going across it within twentyfour hours freeman wants this sucker closed down for a week two if possible and one span coming downll accomplish that sever the chicom supply line while were hitting them in the north put in dennison thats a gamble isnt it were in enough shit up north already three corps is getting chopped to pieces whats going to stop yesov long enough for freeman to wheel his muscle south against the siberianchicom border general freemans attending to that right now answered the briefer your job will be to knock out the bridge well sir rose said wryly turning to brentwood you were right its clearance work all right the others laughed brentwood responding in kind ah what the hell he said same country anyhow okay said the briefer we cant take you in by sub as first hoped he looked at brentwood thats why you were seconded captain but weve had to scrub that idea chicom sub nets at the mouth of the yangtze are too well placed set just deep enough for their guided missile destroyers and gunboats to skittle over but too shallow for any of our subs he turned to brentwood sorry about that sir we thought originally we could have you take the team in via then im excused joked brentwood getting up as if to leave it got the biggest laugh of the day which was just as well the details of the task facing them were not encouraging insertion would be by two pave low choppers rather than one in the event one was hit or experienced mechanical difficulties flying low nap of the earth to avoid radar they would take off from the carrier uss salt lake city on station miles out in the south china sea outside the nanking aa perimeter extraction would be by the same method if the seals got into difficulty the sos emergency code word or signature selected by bullfrog brady to initiate an sasdelta interdiction would be mars the bullfrog had thought hard and long about the code word while the yangtze was a hell of a lot warmer than the manzhouli front where the sd team were now en route to it was all relative for though no ice would be on the yangtze it would be cold enough even with the protection afforded by the trapped layer of bodyheated water in the mens rubber suits the temperatures would be below minus forty degrees fahrenheit while the suits would protect a man who would otherwise freeze up in twentythree minutes in such water even a suitprotected swimmer working a closedcircuit uba such as the cobra rebreather could be so exhausted his lips so cold that it would be hard to form words properly anything beginning with an s was particularly difficult and had in the past sounded like an f on an emergency radio band m words were the easiest to pronounce no matter how cold you were in any event the bullfrog hoped there would be no need to use it and everyone go over your sign language added the briefer with no radio itll be sign language on the surface feel line when submerged and penlights only in an emergency study the model all you like for the next couple of hours we leave for the carrier at oh four hundred and youll go in tomorrow evening at eighteen hundred hours two squads four men each designation echo one captain brentwood the boss echo two cpo brady the boss flight to the nanking dropoff seven miles south of the city and upstream will be three hundred twenty miles from salt lake city one and a half to two hours depending on head winds pickup four hours after dropoff river currents estimated four to six knots youll take thirtyfive horsepower outboards on the zodiacs but only use them if you have to in strong local crosscurrents questions choppers have the range without inflight refueling asked dennison no sweat auxiliary fuel tanks detachable he makes it sound like a training run said one of echo twos fourman squad if you dont screw up it will be said young rose his desire for reassurance dressed up as a question right bullfrog yeah said brady turning to brentwood right captain what oh yes absolutely what is it the brits say piece of cake yeah bullfrog told rose thats it piece of cake no sweat chapter twentyfour colonel soongs fourth battalion traveled light as did all pla infantry they had even discarded their nbc masks confident that the americans were too squeamish to use gas unless it was used on them first besides the pla had discovered a moderately effective method of dealing with gas they ran away from it oh part of their force would be lost in any such attack but maneuvers involving tear gas had demonstrated how valuable time was lost donning cumbersome gear and rapidly changing local wind and humidity conditions had taught beijing what the pentagon had discovered years before that at best a commander could contemplate using gas only as a tactical that is local weapon in a tight corner during a large battle and not as a wider strategic weapon in any event general cheng had saved the pla millions of yuan by not purchasing gas masks protective clothing and sophisticated robot sniffers through paying the money instead to la roche industries for better artillery shells in doing so cheng had also enabled his divisions unencumbered by the heavy nbc protective gear to move faster on foot than any other army it counted for soongs battalions closing in so quickly on the southern side of the foothigh argunskiy even without his spotters soong could tell from the less intense yet more localized area of bombardment that the enemy battery after losing most of their guns in their retreat to a had regrouped atop the six acres of heavy timber that formed the horseshoeshaped western part of the mountains snowcovered summit not surprisingly soongs supporting artillery had been slower to move up than his infantry but based on the plas yuji paoduimobile guerrilla artillery units all of his artillery was capable of being borne by hand broken down like so many pieces of a lego set with even the wheels of each gun in four segments so that the guns could be hauled piecemeal and assembled by manpower alone it was an old pla tactic but one the pla knew continued to astonish more mechanized foes whose trucks were more often than not stopped by the taiga chapter twentyfive david brentwood sat on the thin hard seat by the door of the ach a fourengine lockheed c transport converted to a spectre gunship and checked his wrist altimeter and watch it was thirty thousand feet and no moon as dark as a bloody coal mine in a blackout as aussie lewis put it at david readied himself to lead the stick of the haloc high altitude low opening circle jump from thirty thousand feet after which the spectre aircraft would rapidly descend in everwidening circles all the while pouring down fire into the mountains collar of timber that surrounded and ran about the lip of as horseshoeshaped summit hopefully his sasd team would be able to inject sufficient firepower on the ground to secure a perimeter around the horseshoe long enough for the battered survivors of the mm battery no one knew how many there would be due to the break in radio contact to get to the northern edge of the horseshoe clearing providing a secure perimeter could be achieved the area no more than two acres could be used as a landing zone for rescue helicopters which would follow on from the kalga strip ninety miles to the northeast lying in the valley between the argunskiy and nerchinskiy ranges but it would work only if the sasd team could gather in the remaining defenders probably by now no more than a score or so fast enough and lead them to the clearing before the whole mountain was overrun by the advancing chicom battalions check masks ordered brentwood standing up one gloved hand gripping the canvas webbing the other making sure his oxygen mask seal was secure infrared goggles check next he held up his left arm tapping its wrist altimeter looking down the line of fifteen sasdelta men who would accompany him hearing himself breathing in the mask like some trapped animal lumbering forward as he carried the inverted bergen pack that would dangle beneath him in the fall and which would carry everything from ammunition to a winterissue calorie mre meal ready to eat otherwise known as meals refused by everybody everything changes and everything remains the same it was the last phrase david brentwood thought of as he dove from the spectre into the void above a the frigid air screaming about him in its banshee rage aussie lewis went out after him then came salvini choir williams leading the sd troop of one officer david brentwood and fifteen men each sas man a veteran and most graduates of either sass cqb close quarter battlehouse in hereford near the welsh black mountains or of fort braggs fourroomed shooting house where they had been trained relentlessly for rapid deployment surgical strikes during the twominute free fall his arms and legs out in frog steering position simultaneously braking and guiding his fall careful not to grab air too much in front of him lest he put himself into a spin and shifting the weight of his pack away from his center line david could hear the feral roar of the ac still in its pylon turn far beneath them the air force brass called the ac an aircraft capable of substantial support firepower to the crew of fourteen who manned the converted lockheeds however the ac was simply called spectre or spooky two and until this morning the official designation given the plane by the chinese high command was special operations enemy gunship but from the moment it began unleashing its deadly thunder over the mountain the ac would be forever known as the flying dragon it was so named because of the long thin red tongues spewing down parabolas of fire from the left side of the aircraft where its two mm sevenbarreled twentymillimeter vulcan gatling guns fortymillimeter bofors pompoms and mm howitzer filled the air with hot metal the worst part for the chinese below was the fact that the dragon was not flying blind merely shooting for effect its irr imaging infrared and lltv low light television sensors mounted midbelly between the black crow radio directionfinder pod and the twin vulcans showing up the chinese infantry as clear white dots on the flickering gray screen in this way the gunships target computers in attaining their own vectors were overcoming the failure following the initial chicom attacks to receive any radio beacon guide from the mm battery the infrared sensors also obviated the necessity for using the twokilowatt millioncandlepower searchlight mounted near the dianes rail a fact which the five gunners aboard the spectre appreciated for while the beam would have better illuminated the moving targets below it would also have pointed directly back to them colonel soong gave the order to cease firing at the dragon and to hit the ground an order calculated by him to both conserve ammunition and as the only real way of combating the infrared sensors which could identify moving targets much more readily than stationary ones it was probably the only order of soongs that had ever been disobeyed for it was a natural human reaction to turn on whatever was shooting down at you the spectres mm shells and the chicom enfilades of small arms fire rounds filling the air with multiple highpitched whistles the smallest piece of the whitehot metal penetrating skin and bone as if they were butter the very air was vibrating with the sustained roar of the spectres weapons the howitzers gunners in particular priding themselves on having one of the thirtytwopound rounds en route even as the preceding one was exploding the noise drowning the steady pulsation of the aircrafts four turbo props he and shrapnel continuing to crash into the chicom positions the chicom infantry return fire was ineffective literally bouncing off the pounds of armor plate that encased the spectre whose highly incendiary metalalloy rounds from its fourclip fortymillimeter pompoms kept exploding among soongs hapless infantry then as quickly as it had begun it ended with the spectres firecontrol officers command to break off the attack an order which apart from the obvious told all crew members that the sd skydivers circle was now entering the daw designated air window above the landing zone as he approached nearly mph the thunderfilled air that was streaming past his oxygen mask and over his tethered ammo pack below him seemed colder to aussie lewis than in any of the other jumps hed made he was nearing the chuteopening height of feet the earshattering noise caused by the spectres covering fire now ended the irregular circle of snow that was the twoacre clearing on as summit rushing up at him he checked the wrist altimeter saw it was feet pulled the rip cord and felt then heard the snap the jerk of the twoply bananashaped chute opening immediately he began playing out his weaponsequipment pack twenty feet below on the tether to lessen his landing impact and started working the riser cords pouring air quickly from the left to rightside panels sliding into a spiraling corkscrew trajectory that would bring him away from the snowcovered timber around the clearing each of the fifteen sasd men knew he had to establish a perimeter fast there was another snap but this time it was followed by the steady tattoo of a machine gun and aussie lewis saw red tracer climbing lazily toward him its deceptively graceful arcs curving past him his feet hit the snowy ground and he tumbled the tracer arcs lowering in his general direction dont shoot you stupid bastards he yelled ineffectually into his mask furious for all his training to be cool and at heart deeply and truly afraid of only one thing the ever present possibility in each rescue mission that you could end up as collateral damage killed by friendly fire everyone on the sasd team was more aware than most in freemans second army of the acute danger of being hit by your own side that even in americas most successful war in iraq twentyfour percent of the americans killed died because they were mistaken by their own side as the enemy it was a percentage that brentwood lewis salvini choir williams and the rest knew could double here in as many minutes given the fact theyd been unable to make radio contact with those they were attempting to rescue dragged a few feet by the chute lewis punched the release and within a minute had hauled the bergen pack across the waistdeep snow and had the heckler koch a out of its wrap the butt stock of the fortyinchlong gun in place its safety off his thumb moved from the white s through e to full automatic as naturally as he breathed the guns barrel tooled to accept either the old nato mm round or the heavier but harderhitting siberian mm soviet surplus it had been an important consideration given the unlikelihood of being resupplied by air should they find it necessary to counterattack into the timber where if their ammo ran out some ammo boxes would inevitably be lost they might have to use abandoned chicomsoviet mm in their attempt to secure a perimeter snapping out the bipod lewis planted the gun left of a shattered tree stump at the edge of the clearing and unwrapped the spare barrel placing it by his side should he be forced to overheat the first barrel in what he already expected to be a massive counterattack by the chicom the one thing on which the sasd team was depending was that most if not all of the artillery batterys gunners they were trying to extract would have starlight infrared binoculars andor goggles so that although not being in radio contact they would readily make out fellow american shapes in the clearing even so it was risky for it was possible that a pla patrol had penetrated farther into the timber about the clearing than anticipated the tracer coming at lewis just before he touched down a case in point through his own bug eyes lewis could see the infrared blur of brentwood who had made a perfect walkaway landing immediately taking up his position to the right of lewis on the westernmost arc of the snowy horseshoeshaped clearing meanwhile salvini choir williams and others were spreading left of lewis around the eastern curve of the horseshoe then through the trees he saw a shape moving through a clump of pine that had been stripped of their needles by what he guessed must have been artillery and mortar rounds the stripped trees looking strangely naked like so many huge torn umbrellas upended in the snow and through this wild denuded wood lewis saw shapes moving several others their outline more indistinct because of a stand of unshelled timber following the first lewis and the other sasd men whod spotted them holding their fire while peering anxiously through their nighttime goggles to make a clear friendorfoe identification chapter twentysix devoid of star or moonlight to guide them coming in low westward from the east china sea lost to enemy radar because of the sea clutter the two mhj pave low helos carrying four seals apiece skirted the wide confluence of the huangpu and the yangtze deltas ten miles to their south sea clutter gave way to the low stratus and cumulonimbus thunderheads massing along the coast and the two sos special operations squadron choppers were still below the chicom coast radar net their lookdown radar guiding them up and over the contours of the earth no more than fifty feet above ground the seven men aboard each chopper four seals and the choppers crew of three were hoping and praying noe flying would keep them undetected on all the aircraft specifications charts provided to avid journalists in the iraqi war the big fat squat pave low hadnt been featured it didnt look sexy enough in some editors opinions but it was the unmentioned pave lows four of them despite the apaches reaping all the glory in the press that had struck the decisive blow against saddam hussein loaded with depnav the highly precise deeppenetration navigation computer and nap of the earth early warning equipment including their doppler radar the four pave lows had led the four apaches in the predawn darkness of january flying low and deep across the iraqi border into the western desert the apaches hellfire took out two critical overlapping zone radar sites thus assuring a radarblack hole then pouring through the hole came the undetected allied air forces delivering the first thunder of desert storm with insertion by air rather than by submarine having been decided on by freeman because of the unknown configuration of sub nets at the mouth of the yangtze and huangpu robert brentwood felt even more that he was the odd man out among the seals though with his rank he was the wheelthe senior officer in charge of operation country garden he was at least ten to fifteen years older than most of the two fourman echo one and echo two teams and there were dozens of details he had to worry about any of which if not attended to could foul up the mission even the relatively quiet purr of the muffled thirtyfive horsepower outboard engines should they have to use them might be picked up by river traffic though during the bullpen briefing board salt lake city intelligence reports had assured him that the noise wouldnt be heard amid the distinctive and unvarying twostroke puttputting sound of the chinese barges the chinese apparently used the same engines on all their waterways it was as if in his freefloating anxiety before the mission his mind keyed for action needed to alight on some concrete detail as a temporary way of escape a way of filling in the time before the inevitable unknown but the other seals were giving all their attention to their weapons in the first pave low carrying brentwoods echo one team rose was checking the numberfour buckshot cartridges for his aai aircraft armaments inc double s or silent shotgun using a plastic pusher piston the gun could send the buckshot out at over four hundred feet a second the shells expanding metal preventing any gases escaping meaning that if the weapon had to be used its only sound would be the soft click of the double ss firing pin apart from the explosives the remainder of the seals small but lethal arsenal included smith wesson pistols fragmentation and smoke grenades emergency flares and in bullfrog bradys echo two team a smith wesson model submachine gun carried by echo twos radio operator in echo one robert brentwood was also armed with a smith wesson model while diver first class dennison packed a stoner mk with a round beltbox feed in echo ones lastminute check brentwood had rose dennison and medical corpsman smythe who was also echo ones radio operator make sure each of the three thirtysecondfuse claymore mines was in the semiinflated boat trusting that brady was making the same equipment check aboard the echo two pave low a quarter mile aft of them unconsciously brentwood felt for the griptite sheath of the highcarbon steel knife strapped to his calf and for the small pensized signal light glancing at the c plastique explosive packs he detected an odor that shouldnt be aboard the helo hed ordered everyone to eat one of the regional chinese meals before theyd taken off from the carrier chicoms could smell american food a hundred yards away more than one us soldier had died in korea and nam because of that the americans red meat diet especially detectable by asians everyone on rice and fish before we took off dennison rose and smythe all nodded affirmatively the perfumelike smell of gum apparently coming from the choppers electronic warfare officer brentwood told him to get rid of it well gentlemen brentwood noted to ease the tension a little according to my gps here were right on the money the handheld global positioning system fed by satellite atomic clocks in orbit was giving him a secondbysecond readout of precisely where they were over the velvety blackness of rice fields south of taizhou just seventy miles east of nanking were exactly five hundred and eightyeight miles east soueast of beijing error factor no more than twenty yards in case you were wondering where you are reminds me of a story said smythe his voice made tremulous by the rotors vibration this guys at an outdoor indian convention is he indian asked rose what yeah course hes indian said smythe anyway the head honcho asks him what tribe hes from ticking em off on a clipboard right indian guy says im a member of the farkarwee tribe head honcho looks down reads through the whole list from apache to sioux says to the guy you sure i cant find the farkarwee tribe on the list how many are you only me and my granddad says the guy but i know were definitely the farkarwee tribe smythe shook his head like he was the guy with the clipboard head honcho didnt know what to do didnt want to offend the guy but he couldnt find the tribe maybe it was extinct wiped out so he asks the guy again says you sure its the farkarwee tribe sure im sure says the indian you positive says the head honcho cause its not on my look the indian says therere only two of us left but i know were the farkarwee tribe how can you be so sure asked the head honcho because says the indian every mornin when we were comin across the country to this convention my grandfatherd go out in front of the tepee put up his hands and say where the fark are we brentwood saw the cargo hold light go to red they were five minutes from the landing zone once they reached it they would rappel from the chopper down onto the muddy bank seven miles south on the rivers western bank where the yangtze straightening out upstream was at least three miles wide a sevenmilelong spatulashaped island lay threequarters of the way across from their touchdown point on the western shore both fourman teams and zodiacs would be out and the chopper gone within three minutes the men having to take out the zodiacs semiinflated like pallbearers as rose had indelicately put it during the briefing full inflation of the rubber boats by carbon dioxide cartridge would take place once they were outside the chopper moments before carrying them to the riverbank the pave lows banked left to the southwest in a wide end sweep that would be longer man a direct run in but would keep them low over the rice fields and levees and most importantly clear of the three foot towers situated north of the bridge two minutes from the insertion point the paves pilots went from manual to hover coupler the latters computerfed data from the gyroscope inertial guidance system and altimeter automatically altered trim and yaw through rotor control to keep the chopper coming in on a steady vector low over the levees toward the preprogrammed dropoff point by the river now four minutes away the pulsating red light turned to amber as leader of echo one brentwood like brady leading echo two would have preferred a dropoff point closer to the bridge and to land on the eastern downchannel traffic side but most of nankings population lived on the eastern shore besides the island would shield them from the more populated eastern bank inside the cargo hold brentwood felt the tremulous vibration prior to the dropoff saw the amber light switch to green go said the copilot and the pave lows gaping door ramp opened within seconds brentwoods echo one and bradys echo two teams were both out of the choppers the second robert brentwood touched ground the smell of riverbank mud and human excrement from the rice fields snatched his breath away then his infrared goggles revealed a broad shimmering expanse that was the river and before it a gradually sloping gray that was the riverbank from the first step in his rubber reef walkers which doubled as fin slippers he could feel an icy wind moaning about his rubber suit through the infrared the shimmering negativelike image that was the expanse of river became crazyquilted dark patches caused by gusts that had ruffled the surface and suddenly lowered the temperature of the waterair interface brentwood heard the gentle hiss of air as brady pulled the carbon dioxide cartridge on the other teams boat a moment later he heard another hiss dennison pulling the cord on echo one brentwood feeling the gunwales of the rubber boat stiffening against his thigh as he caught a glimpse of dennison steadying the wox underwater gun its rocket projectiles against the beltfeed drums of ammunition for the minigun the latter a cutdown mm gatling had a hitherto unheard of firing rate of six thousand rounds a minute another weapon robert brentwood fervently hoped they wouldnt have to use echo twos rto radio telephone operator petty officer jensen had already slipped aboard bradys boat his anprc radio in its waterproof pack on the back of his inflatable black lifepreserver vest farther back in echo one in a last minute check brentwood his left hand firmly gripping the forward starboard lug of the boat slid his right hand over the waterproof holster of nis stainless steel smith wesson ninemillimeter hush puppy as dennison rose brentwood and corpsman smythe eased the boat into the icechilled water echo twos fourman team and their pounds of equipment were already pushing off making a sucking sound on the sloping bank which seemed to them as loud as a gunshot but brentwood knew it was probably no noisier than a rat plopping into the river mud the last of the four seals in bradys echo two ahead of them having stepped into a kneedeep silt hole brentwood pushed the thought of water rats out of his mind it was one of the reasons he used to tell his younger brothers that he joined the pig boats the submarines and not the surface navy in a sub there wasnt enough room for a rat to hide waiting several seconds for echo two to make some distance before his echo one pushed off brentwood could already hear a distant puttputting river boats he was surprised however that there wasnt more sound given the volume of water traffic freemans hq had told them to expect glancing at his gps through the infrared goggles he saw it was the current was running around three to six knots and so all being well using paddle assist they could expect to be in the vicinity of the bridge well within the hour only using the engines in the event of unpredictable swirl holes pickup unless something went wrong and they were forced to go sos on the emergency band would be at hours ample time as the briefer aboard salt lake city had put it to recon the shore defenses near the bridge and slip in unseen using the faint navigation lights on the sampans as pointers for the channel approach to the piers if either boat thought they had been sighted the decision to either start the outboard engine as cover or to engage would be left up to brady commanding echo two and brentwood in echo one the two small boats caught the current echo two already well offshore about a hundred yards ahead robert brentwood back in echo one wishing dearly that the chinese would never imagine let alone suspect such a daring raid the four men of echo two in bradys boat had a bad fright within thirty seconds of shoving off when an enormous barge its navigation lights airraid blinkered port and starboard lights mere pinpricks in the vast blackness of the yangtze all but capsized the twelvefootlong sixfootwide rubber boat heavily laden as it was with anchor ropes tackle c plastique and weapons brady in the bow of echo two only managed to see the barge loaded with four railcar tankers heading for the tank farm downriver of the nanking bridge at the last moment giving echo two a bare two seconds to avoid it the barges wash alone threatening to swamp them as brady managed to swing the zodiacs tiller putting her bow on to the barges waves the tank farm faintly visible through the recon photos despite the smog over nanking had itself been a tempting target for the seals but one that theyd rightly decided to forego in lieu of blowing up the bridge to sever the chicom supply line another surprise for echo two being the first boat out was that though they had been told by freemans hq that according to chinas river traffic laws the right lane was the downriver route in fact the rule as evidenced by the sight of the enormous barge in the middle of the river was made by the boats captains it was the oldest rule in the world on the river or anywhere else the biggest won normally it would have been of little moment to the seals but it made for an added hazard in their clandestine mission brady making a mental note of it for their debriefing the two boats echo one a hundred yards farther back due to its later pushoff brady farther toward the right shore were about fifty yards apart going downriver the smell of china washed over them the odors of nanking like the few lights the great metropolis showed in the darkness less exotic than anticipated difficult to isolate in fact beneath the pervasive smell of the ordure from the fields on either side of the mighty river chapter twentyseven now aussie lewis saw the shape of an american helmet coming out of the artillerycropped copse of aspen and gave a low whistle hey mate buddy over here the man about thirty feet away silhouetted by a moon break in the clouds stopped dead then fell his weapon spitting fire as lewis rolled firing his hk in a tight overbody arc his face splattered by snow he was aware of a searing sensation in his left foot there was more firing off to his right from choir williams and the man whod fired at lewis fell screaming hands flailing in the snow for his dropped weapon lewis gave him a full burst and in lewiss infrared goggles the mans body jumped was still then became a flapping gray lewis could smell a burning rubbery odor where the man who lewis thought had obviously mistaken him for a russian had clipped lewiss left boot singeing part of the vibram sole lewiss foot felt wet but whether it was blood or snow he couldnt tell he felt for the elasticbandheld medipac on the side of his helmet sas and delta were bred to be tough they were also taught it was false heroics stupid not to take a shot of morphine if it could keep you fighting rather than being a burden on your buddies it was david brentwood who under cover of a long burst of mm from choir williamss hk a made the dash across to lewis to break the news it had been discovered that the man theyd shot and a second one brought down by a delta trooper on the northern side of the horseshoe of timber didnt have dog tags special forces seals the sas and delta force did the same thing if they were on clandestine ops but not regular army artillery they never but never took off their dog tags some widow might miss out on the death benefit christ said lewis as the import of brentwoods no id information hit him what you think davey omons or spets has to be special forces of some kind david brentwood conceded as he spoke he saw more shapes slipping through the artillerydenuded pine into the thicker timber encircling the mountaintop clearing freeman was right said david brentwood in a whisper we didnt start the war cunning bastards hissed lewis now grimacing a sharp hot pain piercing his ankle siberian bastards started it shelled the chicoms themselves made em think it was us to get the chicoms in on their side freemans not going to like this said brentwood in what had to be the understatement of the war so far fuck freeman hissed lewis i dont fuckin like it wed better get out of here davey and fast fuckin sibirs arent gonna want witnesses why the hell didnt they get out asked david i mean why the hell then he stopped the answer frighteningly obvious as he had told lewis the siberians novosibirsk to be correct obviously hadnt wanted their spets omons whichever to get out obviously all theyd been told was to shell the chicom positions and hold purpleflare time mate said lewis get those friggin wokkas in here fast he meant the ch chinook evac choppers from kalga there was nothing to rescue now but themselves and they had to get out the word about who had really broken the ceasefire it wouldnt be believed by the chicoms of course in any case beijing was probably now only concerned with having the opportunity to gain more territory but maybe the truth would make some difference to internal chinese resistance flickering high above them the parachute flare turned night to day transforming the two acres of snow into an undulating mauve blanket it also unleashed a fierce siberian counterattack in seconds the air was flailed with the crack and whistle of small arms fire punctuated by the stomachpunching crumpcrumpcrump of heavy hundredmillimeter mortars least the chicoms wont use their artillery this close to their own said aussie lewis clipping in another mag and immediately realizing the foolishness of his remark both he and david brentwood knew that unlike the americans the chinese commander would have no compunction about sacrificing a hundred or so infantry more to gain a position and every sasd man on the mountaintop now knew that the siberians caught out in their deception would be more intent on killing americans than worrying about being overrun by the chinese jesus what a mess uttered aussie his words lost to the feral roar of david brentwoods heckler koch submachine gun and the crash of mortars where are those friggin chop began a delta trooper ten yards to brentwoods left but he never finished decapitated by shrapnel the stump of what had been his neck bubbling white with blood in davids infrared goggles chapter twentyeight his f and f strikers already aloft from yerofey pavlovich second armys forwardmost air base flying ahead to provide an air umbrella the pilots searching for breaks in the blizzard but not finding them general freeman looked at his watch it was hours cold and still overcast he tapped the pilot of the c transport lets go son cant wait here all night with that the big hercules lumbered forward on the marsden steelweb runway followed by another whose paratroopers together with freeman and his paratroopers in the first aircraft would be responsible for securing the nizhneangarsk drop zone a frozen salt marsh ten miles east of lake baikals northern end the remaining airborne troops would follow and be jumping from eight much longer foot c galaxies each holding men freeman had few worries about the twohour mile flight to the bam baikalamur mainline railhead at nizhneangarsk although there would be three thousand men in all the biggest airborne operation since the disastrous american and allied drop over arnhem in he was confident the siberians wouldnt be expecting him as added insurance a usaf squadron of wild weasels electronic jammers was already airborne to scramble the radars ringing yesovs crack sixtyfourth division at nizhneangarsk the problem would be once the siberians made visual contact how quickly yesovs nizhneangarsk garrison could move up their heavy artillery and tanks to the drop zone freeman regretted the operation had to be carried out at dawn but with any operation involving more than a hundred men he knew it would have been suicidal to try it at night when the zone on the frozen marsh was no more than a quartermile square in the taiga the jamming around nizhneangarsk was only partly successful the wild weasels four hundred miles from yerofey pavlovich coming under attack by a squadron of mig fulcrums diving from fifteen thousand freemans assumption that the siberians could be fought off by the eagles and fs proved correct most of the furballs or dogfights going in the americans favor but one c transport was taken out whether by the fulcrums or friendly fire was not known in the confusion of dogfights and thick cloud no one knew what freeman aboard the lead hercules did know however was that already over three hundred of his paratroopers were dead cutting his force to twothirds before hed even reached the drop zone inside the roar of the hercules the beefyfaced jumpmaster stood up both gloved hands outstretched in front of him palms forward as if about to push against an invisible wall his voice raised against the thundering roar of the engines get ready there was a long shuffling noise the heavily laden paratroopers still sitting but moving closer now to the edge of the long plank seats stand up yelled the jumpmaster stand up repeated freeman the first of the stick but at this moment no longer the boss aboard the aircraft the jumpmasters hands moved from the palmsout front position to his sides as if he was describing the big one that got away and as one the paratroopers rose awkwardly with their heavy gear hooked up and checked that snap hooks were clipped on properly to the overhead cable without allowing too much slack on the long yellow static line each man checked the static line of the man in front of him the light still red the jumpmasters right hand shot out down to the right like an umpire pointing at the bag obediently freeman as the first of the stick crouched at the door looking out into the enormity of a swirling gray world of cloud mixing furiously with snow his tight chin strap giving his face an older yet even more determined look than usual the red light turned green go the stick fell out as smoothly as could be expected under the circumstances only one paratrooper fouling his fifteenfoot static line still holding the deployment bag but his connector links breaking too early in a wind shear he was jerked hard against the fuselage the soft crimson explosion of his head seen but not heard by the next two men in line four saranwrapped lynx helicopters going out on the skids of their c transport also got into trouble despite the multiple braking chutes on the cs palette the latter crashed through the ice cover of a pond at the edge of the salt marsh disappearing in about fifteen feet of water another badly damaged lynx was lost when its palette having been blown off course into the timber ended up in a mass of splintered treetops dangling chute segments hanging forlornly ripped by severed branches that had been broken off like matchsticks under the impact several of the branches had pierced the weatherprotective wrap of the helo impaling fuselage and tail rotors warping the choppers main blades and its chaff dispensers the result was thousands of varying lengths of the silvered antiradar foil blown about aimlessly in the storm like silver streamers from some abandoned new years party one of the two remaining lynxes ahs landing skis had been bent but a paratrooper master sergeant had it fixed within five minutes taking his assault knife stripping a fir branch and lashing it with parachute cord to the ski just as he would have splinted a broken leg there was a treetoppling crash that resounded throughout the entire drop area one of the six eighteenmilerange ultralightweight titanium mm field howitzers hitting and passing through the marsh ice the other five guns though two were almost buried in snowdrifts were quickly assembled and their small but powerfultracked vehicle haulers brought up as well as humveemounted pads positive azimuth determining gyro systems the pads meant that within ten minutes the howitzers were laying direct copperhead and rap right with boat tail he rounds fire against the bam railhead just over three miles to the south the accuracy of the fourroundaminute fire was also due to one of the lynx choppers serving as fire control after it and the only other serviceable lynx had hauled their basketsflipbottomed mesh boxes of heatsfw selfforging highexplosive antitank warhead mines scattering them in a rough circle around the quartermilesquare drop zone this left only one side a southern exit toward the bam open for the attack on nizhneangarsk station itself an attack that hopefully would not only sever the vital eastwest supply line afforded yesov by the bam railway but also cut off the siberian sixtyfourth and other divisions already moving east between baikal and yerofey pavlovich for the moment despite the loss of some of his bombers and helos freeman was as satisfied as a commander could expect to be with only a two percent casualty rate of sprained ankles and jarred spines except for the man lost aboard the c there had been no concussioncaused deaths scores of men landing on the frozen reedtufted marsh feet flying out from under them on the ice before they could roll properly and release their chutes colonel general litvinov the military commander of all siberian northern forces including kirensk garrison miles northwest of the north end of lake baikal received a panicky call from nizhneangarsk it was from the recently appointed commander of the railheads two infantry regiments men eighty tanks thirtysix mm selfpropelled howitzers twentyeight armored personnel carriers and two antitank batteries of fiftyfive men each the commanders tone was rising by the second for despite bad weather moving in another arctic blizzard forecast patrols were reporting that beneath the heavy overcast american airborne troops in their hundreds possibly thousands were landing only four miles away in the taiga litvinov however remained calm he could afford to be he was well away from nizhneangarsk besides he was under strict orders from novosibirsk to keep his division of eighteen thousand six thousand fighting men and twelve thousand in support at kirensk marshal yesov had stressed that the kirensk division must be so held for possible deployment to yakutsk eight hundred miles to the northeast should the americans decide to attack there along with novosibirsk irkutsk and krasnoyarsk yakutsk was one of the most strategically and industrially important cities in siberia what can we do shouted the general from nizhneangarsk whose two regiments had been assigned the specific responsibility of guarding the bam railhead his anxiety fueled by the memory of his onetime superior at nizhneangarsk the latter had been arrested by the omon before the ceasefire for what novosibirsk was pleased to call insufficient initiative in having failed to recapture those prisoners who had escaped through the taiga following the allied raid on port baikal whether or not this was the real reason for his execution or a cover for a power struggle in novosibirsk the general had been courtmartialed and shot by omon enforcers uspokoysya idiot calm down you idiot litvinov shouted into the phone youve nothing to worry about you say that youre not here there must be the line was crackling and he told kirensk that one of the american dikie volki was jamming the what dikie volki dikie volki wild wolves wild wolves repeated the nizhneangarsk general diki lasochki wild weasels corrected litvinov i dont care what you call them said the nizhneangarsk commander theyre already cutting communica put your deputy on the extension demanded litvinov immediately and you stay on the line when the two nizhneangarsk officers were on the line litvinov curtly announced general youre dismissed colonel you are now commanding general of nizhneangarsk defenses how many americans do you suspect have landed two possibly three thousand sir answered the colonel now general fyodor malik bozne moy my god you outnumber them two to one outflank them and attack immediately do you hear the newly promoted general had to ask litvinov to repeat the order the line was fading by the second the demoted general was in shock not knowing whether to feel relieved insulted or both he knew he was afraid family connections had got him his command but uncle vilna couldnt help him now he was shaking he could hear litvinovs voice on the phone again through the frying sound of the static all you have to general litvinov advised his newly promoted colleague malik is send a message to ort baikal give them the coordinates of the us airborne and theyll take care tell them release the aists malik frowned but then aware of his previous commander watching him smiled knowingly of course i will call them immediate the line went dead the demoted generals voice now wavering between outrage and unmitigated fright was tremulous and rising and how will you get any message to port baikal now he shouted no phone what are the aists how can we by helicopter malik replied unsure as to how he should address his former boss well send two helicopters with the message he explained theyll be there in two and half hours less with drop tanks and no troop load and what will happen then malik wondered if the comrade was serious but merely put his confusion down to his hyperanxiety the aists malik explained calmly you heard litvinov has released them once theyve got the coordinates theyll slaughter freeman and his troops how do you know its freeman because said malik the new authority growing on him by the second sweeping over him now like the pleasure of a mounting orgasm as he carefully but quickly wrote out the coordinates and gave a copy each to both hind d chopper pilots of course its freeman its his style to attack where you least expect it malik straightened up from the desk freeman loves the underdogs position makes winning all the sweeter for him but now hes made a bad mistake gen uh colonel but now hes finished malik told the two helicopter pilots that en route over the miles of taiga between nizhneangarsk and port baikal they must remain on radio silence rather than risk detection by an american awac even if the american advanced warning aircraft were hundreds of miles off their rotodome radar could nevertheless pick the helos up if they used their radio and though it was unlikely might be able to get an american fighter through the fog and the ring of baikals aa gun and missile defenses meantime malik told the commanders of his two motorized rifle regiments well prepare a little surprise for freeman here with that malik strode to the map and drew in two arrows aimed at hitting freemans airborne simultaneously on the americans western and eastern flanks get every civilian in town that you can find issue them with greatcoats and take them to the front any resistance to your order and theyll be charged with gulgiganstvo it meant hooliganism against the cis the commonwealth of independent states and just as in the old soviet union it would get you onetofive in a labor battalion malik turned and looked past the man who had been his commander to the infantry major who would be in charge of calling out the civilians maliks tone was steely brooking no objection have them surrender to the americans in twos and threes over the next hour the major was stunned it will slow them down malik explained the americans are soft about prisoners freeman will also be slowed down by the blizzard coming south it will be here in a few hours by then our aists at baikalll do the rest malik couldnt hide nor did he wish to hide the look of satisfaction on his face as he now saw the wisdom of novosibirsks longstanding insistence based on the experience of the nazis that all military garrisons be manned as far as possible by troops from another oblast a garrison made up in part of local conscripts or volunteers were naturally tied too closely to their fellows in the town rather than to the iron fist of military necessity it meant there would be no difficulty in having his troops round up the locals for the surrender as freemans troops continued to advance on nizhneangarsk fog was rolling over the frozen marshes and the general ordered dick norton and his two aides in the humvee to pray for good weather god damn it opined freeman the almighty answered georgie pattons prayers at bastogne he can answer mine only dick norton knew he wasnt joking but later as the cold front kept moving south a disgruntled captain whose humvee windscreen was being constantly splattered with lumps of snow kicked up by the treads of freemans humvee was heard to mutter that apparently this day second army was out of favor with the almighty by god said freeman as he too saw any hope of close air support disappearing were being punished for white house stupidity if id been allowed to pursue these sons of bitches when we had em on the run before that goddamn ceasefire wed general sir fors forward observer reports were flooding in on the humvees flap flat panel lap display to the effect that nizhneangarsk was falling without a fight and apparently intelligence had screwed up those surrendering werent crack troops at all but the infirm and inexperienced old men and young boys even women general maybe proffered an incredulous dick norton your prayers are being answered general their motorized must be pulling back possibly conceded freeman it was difficult in the now heavily falling snow to tell whether the general was grinning with the anticipation of easy victory or whether he was grimacing chapter twentynine hundreds of miles to the south atop a the barrel of aussie lewiss heckler koch a was steaming in the early morning fog like a bloody chinese laundry he quipped as he reached forward right thumb squeezing the barrels plasticcoated handle rotating it hard left pushing it forward then back and hard right dumping it out on the snow slipping in the spare the gun back on full automatic in less than six seconds too fucking slow he told himself and he was right but hed taken a second to make sure the spare barrel wasnt plugged with snow in minus fifty degrees snow would turn to ice in the barrel and bam youd blow your head off in a wide leftright sweep the guns backwash warming his face lewis dropped at least five maybe six of the siberians but they kept coming and a few yards to his right david brentwood was tossing his last frag grenade even as they heard the beautiful bowelturning roar of the spectre reappearing lighting the clouds in giant swelling red sores the firespitting dragon went into a tight anticlockwise corkscrew forcing many of the wouldbe attackers back into the heavy timber crackling now from the vulcans fortymillimeter and mm howitzer rounds as if on fire you bloody beaut yelled aussie lewis in praise of the spectre jesus christ you yanks can make machines he told david ill give you that one oclock two of called david but aussie or was it choir williams had already fired downing two siberians the real trouble however was that in the moat of snowfilled craters that lay between the heavy timber and the rough hundredyarddiameter circle of sasd men still holding out on as summit any fighting between the circle and the timber confused the spectres operators the gunships sensors couldnt distinguish between friend and foe especially when both sasd men and the siberians were wearing american uniforms already david brentwood suspected that several sas men had been killed in the initial wellintentioned enfilade from the spectre and radio contact with the gunship confirmed the confusion well try to keep em bottled up in the trees the gunships pilot told brentwood his voice fighting to be heard in the cacophony of air and ground battle but you guysll have to establish a chopper zone roger responded david brentwood asking urgently eta for the choppers repeat eta fifteen minutes max answered the spectre the pilots voice quickly lost in the roar of the twin vulcans tattooing the gray blur of timber below with what seemed solid tracer more explosions and flares the chinese now attacking the siberians who in turn were attacking the ring of sasd men fubar shouted aussie clipping in another mag of mm by which he meant he was in the middle of a fog in a fog of war confusing even for the usually confused state of closequarter battle a situation in short that in the sasd lexicon was definitely undeniably fubarfucked up beyond all recognition chinese were fighting siberians who were fighting americans who were fighting everybody where are those fucking choppers im out of ammo yelled aussie david brentwood tossed him a drum it was the most anxious hed ever seen the australian the man who was normally so cool stressed now by the fear not so much of dying but of dying at the hand of his own mates jesus christ choir yelled aussie stop you mad fucking welshman choir williams had stopped though just in time his degree arc of fire kicking up snow just short of lewis and davids position salvini on the far right saw another two sas men badly hit and sent up yet another purple flare for the medevac choppers to see if they ever came where are the bastards aussie began but then ducked his kevlar helmet pushed hard into the snow legs drawn up into the fetal position his right arm pulling david brentwood down by the collar as a heavy mortar round went off shaking the earth showering them with a blackwhite spew of snow and earth our chopper pilots wankin themselves off or something he saw a tongue of machine gun fire in the timber and answered with a long burst with the hk well im not it was a man called edison nicknamed lightbulb whod dragged himself over to aussie and brentwoods position his left leg a mass of bloody pulp but edison not yet in shock down to my last clip he told aussie david tore the last one he had from his vest and picked out a body twenty feet in front of him one of the siberians hed stopped whom he might ransack for ammo and they heard the distinctive wokka wokka wokka of the chinook evac choppers closing fucking cavalrys arrived said lewis and gave a shape moving through the aspen stand fifty yards away a quick deadly burst suddenly the sky was brighter than the sun so intensely lit that for a moment all firing stopped as the spectre turned to oxbloodred then black the sound of it exploding creating a ringing in davids ears and only now did they hear the sonic boom of the mig fighter a fulcrum that had downed the spectre and was now screaming low overhead banking in a tight turn away to the west no one had predicted a lone mig would dare bingo fuel an empty tank at the farthest extent of his planes operational radius and try to interdict the gunship but nothing was predictable certainly no one in the sasd company could have had any way of knowing that the mig was flown by siberias top ace sergei marchenko whose fulcrum sported the yankee killer motif left forward of the left engines box intake within hours novosibirsk was boasting about marchenkos bravery which was undeniable but the propaganda broadcast failed to point out the element of sheer luck involved in hitting the gunship in the thick fog in its spiraling turn the gunship its guns ablaze had quite unexpectedly presented marchenko with a target that a child couldnt have missed having made only one pass he easily downed it with a twohundredpound aphid airtoair missile traveling at nine hundred feet a second before pulling out all the stops to disappear westward into the safety net of baikals aa ring to all siberia marchenko was a hero but to the sasd men several of them wounded and dying in their fighting retreat into the choppers where ironically the downdraft from the chinooks was so fierce that it knocked them off the rope ladders marchenko only added to the sense of bitterness they felt with their discovery that it hadnt been the americans whod started the war to them marchenko was no better than a vulture hed come in not on equal terms but merely to turkeyshoot the lumbering ac and then hed hopped it as choir williams described it to the safety west of baikal out of the american air striker reach to commander soong now the victor of a the mig pilot was a comrade hero having made it all the easier for him to conquer the summit and plant the red flag in the la roche chain marchenko got more space than the presidents victory over internal saboteurs and the arrest in central park of the man who the fbi said had engineered the massive computer debacle for sergei marchenko his downing of the spectre meant another us plane for his ground crew to paint on the side of his fulcrum his daring kill on nearempty only adding to his reputation in the siberian air force for having devyat zhizneynine lives even those who disliked his haughty manner which included most everybody at irkutsk had to concede his bravery in going it alone his sheer talent and his mediastar status after what the western press had thought was his destruction over korea earlier in the war it not only added to his legend at home but burned the ears of all those allied pilots whod come up against him this was especially so for frank shirer who seeing a mig crash had claimed the korean kill adding insult to injury shirer was given the information in the mess of the b squadron at nayoro japan here so far from home his sense of being a hasbeenfrom porsche to bus driver as hed put it was confirmed when he was told of marchenkos resurrection at dinner where ail the b crews also heard it frank thought of lana telling him it didnt matter a fig about marchenko that what mattered to her was that he frank was alive that if la roche ever conceded to a divorce they could get married but her hopes were no consolation to shirer there were just some things you couldnt explain to a woman shirers gunner a gregarious murphy from philadelphia tried to make light of it but as shirer cut into his steak he pressed so hard on the knife that the screech of the steel on china went through the mess hall like nails on a blackboard dont worry about it skipper said murphy who as well as resident optimist was the bs designated hitterthe tail gunner though he had not yet seen an enemy plane and didnt plan on seeing one this mar whatever his name is marchenko yeah marchenko hell get his how are those tail guns coming along asked shirer shifting away from talk of the siberian ace wandering a bit on the way over werent they he meant on the flyover from the states to japan ah theyre okay it was me wandering skipper had some of that sushi last night dont think raw fish agrees with me had the runs all night you should stock up on peptobismol said shirer murphy thought he was fooling but he wasnt you might have a long flight if the weather clears up north murphy patted his left vest pocket got me a whole packet ah know what the target is skipper no shirers tone sounded like he didnt care either only that it depends on clear skies or enough to see where were bombing could be important right oh sure said shirer feeling as bitter as the coffee its always important yeah right said murphy confident hed helped shake his skipper out of his depressed mood then quite suddenly murphy turned pale whats wrong man you got the runs the crews navigator asked murphy look like youve seen a ghost sushi said murphy pushing himself away quickly from the table obviously in pain goes through ya like crap through a goose chapter thirty big dick said aussie lewis wearily unloading his pack thats what got us out and the choppers added david brentwood wryly the weapon lewis was referring to was called the minigun by some of the sasd commandos whod provided the withering cover fire as theyd loaded the litters of wounded aboard the helicopters the minigun one carried by each of the ten commandos was a modernized minigatling gun a weapon with a phenomenalalmost theoretically impossible the experts had said rate of fire of over nine hundred rounds a minute the ten of them fired by the sasd commandos had thrown up a steel wall of over ten thousand rounds a minute the circle of sasd men clearing the lz for the two chinooks that supplemented the commandos fire with the frontmounted heavy machine guns the extraordinarily rapid fire due in part also to revolutionary c magazines feeding both the m scopemounted sniper rifles with mm bullets and the mpks with ninemillimeter parabellum enabled the sasd team to secure the snow moat between the timber and the landing zone long enough to get the wounded and dead aboard the chinooks the wall of depleted uranium bullets not only keeping down the heads of the siberians but the chinese infantry coming up behind them the sasd team had lost seven men and four wounded and for that they now had the hard intelligence for freeman that the chinese had been conned by what had been a siberian artillery barrage into firing on american positions all along the northeast chinasiberian border breaking the ceasefire but lewiss prediction was borne out it made no difference the siberian member of the un representing the largest of the commonwealth of independent states said the american allegations were groundless and a pathetic attempt by the washington warmongers to rationalize american aggression against the peaceloving peoples of siberia and china on the flight back to kalga field northeast of a mountain before changing planes for a fast jet to rudnaya pristan on the siberian coast the chinook pilots had a bad fright when fighters in fingerfour patrol formation appeared on their flir forwardlooking infrared screens the pilots thinking that like the downed spectre they were about to be attacked by more migs but instead the dots were american f eagles sent away down from skovorodino to escort the choppers back it was a tightlipped bunch of sasd men who deplaned at rudnaya pristan it was one thing to lose seven of your own in an attempt to rescue your own but the sheer waste of the a mission not only gave la roches tabloids more screaming headlines but was a waste emphasized by the failure of the chinese to break off hostilities youd think theyd call their lot back commented choir williams as he watched a medic bandage up lewiss left foot it was only a flesh wound but had made a mess of the boot nah said lewis looking at the medic who lewis saw was carefully obsessively putting on a double pair of rubber gloves and rubber mask before he went anywhere near the blood dont worry sport i dont have aids the medic didnt answer and lewis turned his attention to williams ah forget it choir beijing doesnt give a shit who started it not now they see their chance to gobble up more rich border territory their price for helping the sibirs anyway what you think those old farts in beijing are gonna tell the masses mate sorry but we made a mistake and started a war all our propaganda about yankee aggression was a bunch of bullshit lewis watched the medic open a brown bottle of iodine its smell bringing back unpleasant childhood memories theyd lose face wouldnt they said lewis his eyes fixed on the iodine and all their bloody perks as well the medic tipped the amber bottle against a cotton wad and stroked the wound the astringent odor of the antiseptic rising seeming to fill the barracks sting a bit choir asked pokerfaced nah oh well then boyo said choir youll be fit for further service then i will said aussie undaunted and confident that the sasd team would now have a bit of welldeserved rr aussie turned to salvini and told him hed now managed to find out the name of the bird with the big nungas hed seen in khabarovsk just before theyd been called for the a mission olgas her handle he explained salvini was cleansing his minigun and looking down each barrel as he did so he winked across at choir olga sounds like a wrestler dont care mate said lewis she can wrestle me smother me to death if she wants squeeze the life out of you i should expect said choir aussie held his hands out bowllike in front of him i tell you theyre this big and ive got her address ah wouldnt get all excited aussie if i were you chimed in salvini might be a while before you see khabarovsk let alone any poontang rumor is theyre got something lined up for us aussie lewiss glance shot from salvini to choir and back again lewis could usually tell when they were kidding him but salvini looked totally disinterested as if the rumor was already known by everyone except lewis where challenged aussie suspicious south choir said nodding in the general direction of china aussie shook his head and immediately relaxed horse shit no dinkum said choir using the aussies own expression for the absolute truth the genuine article the medic taped the bandage and left the truth was he was overawed by the men of sasdelta aussie thanked him glanced again at salvini and tore off a piece of cleaning rag to wipe down one of the high capacity c mags salvini didnt have a trace of a smile he looked bored all right said aussie standing up wincing slightly shifting his weight to his right foot his grimace quickly replaced by a knowing smile youre tryin to take the piss out of me salvini bet youre wrong two to one on it was odds on youd have to bet two to win one you could make money but you had to be sure of your information salvini looked up shifting the blame to choir shouldve known aussie would bet on it australiansll bet against the friggin sun coming up fortyeight hours without a bet sends lewis into delirium tremens aha said aussie triumphantly seizing on choirs hesitation whats the matter the cat got your fucking tongue ive never heard you speak boyo without a swear word you always have to swear dont fart round boyo put your money where your mouth is is there a mission or not pay up or shut up salvini began black taping his heckler kochs twonotch pistol grip aussie squatting down beside him giving salvini a friendly elbow nudge that almost toppled him five bucks then piped up choir his tone however hardly enthusiastic aussie stood up mock shock all over his face looking around the barracks in wideeyed surprise five whole dollars jesus choir dont go overboard salvini how about you five what a pair of wankers aussie said disgustedly shaking his head hardly worth making book then dont said choir which only confirmed aussies suspicion that theyd just made up a rumor oh ill take it said aussie a mission south is it he was reaching up for the small blue indelible pencil and paper he had tucked under his helmets medevac band within a week said salvini upping his bet to add credence ill bet ten bucks a week and a high roller okay a week lewis licked the tip of the indelible pencil leaving a purple stain on his tongue as he wrote down the two wagers next he cast a glance about the barracks the rest of the sasd team in various stages of undress andor busy cleaning weapons anyone else david brentwood declined as did the rest of the troop okeydokey said aussie slipping the pencil back beneath the helmet band the welsh wart and the brooklyn dodger five and ten done takin candy from a baby better not be so cocksure cautioned david brentwood dont worry about my cock ill have fifteen bucks to blow and shell blow me david brentwood shook his head the australian was incorrigible listen davey boy said lewis if these blokes are right ill run starkers into freemans hq promise someone yelled laughingly absolutely said lewis you all heard that said david copied came back an sasd chorus the jocular mood died suddenly with the sight of the unit padre walking in with the dog tags of the dead chapter thirtyone pele i am the goddess of fire it was all robert brentwood in the bow of echo one could think of when he saw the fiery incandescent ball of light for pele played by a polynesian beauty had risen from the fake but realisticlooking volcano during a hawaiian show hed once seen on kauai the waterfall in front of the mountain turning molten red like lava as the lights behind it changed from white to pulsating crimson peles right hand flashed quickly into the darkness like a karate slice and a ball of fire perhaps it had been done by lasers had shot with incredible speed across from the fake volcano to the rain forest like a bolt of lightning but the red ball he saw now streaking through the darkness across the river two miles from the nanking bridge was no conjurers trick it was the tracer flash of a pla eightytwomillimeter rpg a recoilless rifle round in reality a shortrange artillery shell tearing across the yangtze darkness at five hundred miles per hour striking echo two midships only seconds after her bow had hit a tween channel wire the sudden increase in tension triggering the rpg the outboards fuel ignited ammunition was exploding the boat its spine broken in the air afire and coming apart bodies and equipment spilled into the boiling brown water of the yangtze illuminated by the fire both sections of the boat still turning in air as if in slow motion water pouring from one half in a gossamer spray the acrid reek of burning rubber and cordite floated back to echo one a hundred yards behind and to the left of what had been echo twos zodiac in that split second of echo two being hit robert brentwood had to make his decision to go and try to save whoever if any of the seals had survived or to head immediately left closer inshore to avoid the midchannel trip wire he told rose in a harsh whisper hard left instructing dennison and smythe to man the paddles almost immediately he felt the zodiac picking up speed water slopping over the gunwales as it moved beamon to the current heading at a sharp angle inshore ten seconds later the cold darkness was lit up again as the yangtze was swept by searchlights their stalks reaching out like long white fingers from the right bank and from the city beyond came the distinctive wails of sirens robert brentwood pulled hard on the front starboard paddle all the time wishing to god hed given the order to row to shore a second after the searchlights had appeared the searchlights would have vindicated his order his decision not to go looking for the men from echo two even though he knew hed made the right decision that the mission was the thing that counted that every man knew that his gut was still in a knot machine gun fire was now raking the river at the floating debris several hundred yards ahead of them theyre just guessing whispered dennison right said smythe unconvinced rose kept paddling soon as we get ashore instructed brentwood we hide the boat swim down to the bridge in two pairs dennison youre with me smythe you go with rose rendezvous extraction point in two hours remember no grace period chopperll come in and out no chance for a second run understand rose smythe and dennison nodded intent on putting on their litton m b night vision diving goggles and closed circuit oxygen apparatus in their quarterinchthick neoprene wet suits with the flexible breathing hose and small front oxygen tank attacked the four looked more like jet pilots than divers as they deflated the zodiac making it the outboard engine and paddles easier to hide on the bank in the vegetation that spilled down from the rice field to the very edge of the river cloud broke revealing the moon and for a moment or two the threemilewide yangtze took on the sheen of molten quicksilver as robert brentwood chalked his rubber shoes before slipping them into the long flippers he was struck again by how cumbersome even absurd they looked but he knew that once in the water a small amount of which would almost immediately form a bodyheated layer between his skin and the rubber suit with the first breath in the rebreather suit and the first kick of the long fins a metamorphosis would occur probably they would have to go deep thirty to thirtyfive feet to avoid the kind of trip wire that echo two had triggered but not below the safety limit of fortyfive the searchlights were still sweeping the wide race of the river beams splitting then reconvening like flocks of ghosts finding their way over the floating body parts that had been the men in echo two brentwood heard the distinctive long rattling sound of a chinese rpk machine gun on the more heavily defended right bank but because of the rpks limited nine hundredmeter range its bullets didnt pose any problem for echo one the rounds plopping in the mustardcolored spotlit water like tired hail around the flotsam of echo two the boats halves floating now like two dead manta rays wings torn and shredded by the explosion the moonlight breaking through clouds revealed what looked like staggered platforms in the river several hundred yards apart of the kind robert remembered kids in the states used in the summers to push out in the lakes and dive off it told him how the river traffic theyd heard earlier was able to get past the trip wire or wires without incident whereas echo two had been blown up the chicoms had anchored the floating platforms and mounted them with rpgs not in a straight line across the river but rather in staggered fashion as one would place a series of overlapping gates at a sheepdog trial you would have to know where they were of course in order to weave through them for the sampans he guessed it must be akin to a motor vehicle driver in any other country having to negotiate a series of overlapping staggered speed bumps like those the communists had rigged up at checkpoint charlie in the days before the berlin wall had come down and the united siberian republic had arisen as clouds closed back over the moon like a cloven hoof not even the night vision goggles could pick out the platforms except for the one from which the rpg had just been fired a residual infrared blur from its heat still hugging the platform the brief glimpse of the platforms hed seen at least six of them told brentwood hed made the right decision in bringing in his boat hed spotted at least one pair of platforms possibly two between him and where echo two up ahead had been hit he listened carefully for any increase in the puttputting sounds of the river for any indication of a patrol boat moving cautiously around the trip wires but could hear none perhaps one of the sampans or barges puttputting was in fact a patrol boat he didnt feel lucky not after echo two being hit the odds against a single round from an rpg hitting it smack on like that werent good and if the chinese luck kept up like that well sounds like the sampans are bunching up downriver whispered rose about the bridge yeah added dennison maybe theyve closed the upriver channel on our side sounds as if theyre working the river traffic like a singlelane bridge opening it for down traffic for an hour then to up traffic smythe agreed pointing out the chicoms could watch one channel more easily than two maybe acknowledged brentwood simultaneously smelling the polluted stench of the river and hearing the heavy somehow ominoussounding heavy breathing of the other men testing their cobra circuits the flexible air bladders designed not to give off any telltale bubbles of air rose and fell like an anesthetists bag responding to inhale and exhale as dangerous carbon dioxide was absorbed by a sodalime compartment and oxygen bled in from the small eighthour waist tank to robert brentwood the flexible breathing bags rising and falling imparted a tension that was unrelieved by a new development smoke from a factory on the eastern bank wafting down over the river though cooling rapidly over the water the smoke was joined by water particles to form a rolling mist which because it was still relatively warm interfered with the infrared goggles but even if he could see whether there were any patrol boats brentwood knew he couldnt do much about it anyway he told himself it might simply be that the pla had thought theyd already got all the saboteurs probably content to pick up the bodies from echo two or what was left of them maybe the chicoms thought the zodiac had been manned by democracy movement underground saboteurs and not us seals yes said brentwoods alter ego and what happens when they pick up the debris and discover they were americans thatll bring out more than a sampan or two but he knew he had to put such worries on hold and press on to the bridge and the thought of the tens of thousands of americans whom echo one might save if the seals could sever the vital supply artery helped him quell his fears easing himself quietly down the riverbank from which the zodiac was hidden beneath a camouflage throw wrap brentwood went over the equipment giving most attention to the four javex bottles as the upgunned ma conicalshaped charges were called twentyfour inches long by sixteen wide the charges looked like four big magnums of champagne sawed off at the neck if they could earmuff the charges on the south side of piers four and five the four pairs of earmuff tnt charges having a foot rod rate of detonation pentolite detonating cord the two simultaneous explosions should create shock waves to penetrate over four feet from either side of both piers into the solid concrete brentwood hoped that the chicoms always afraid of highaltitude bombing attempts despite their walltowall aa sam missiles about the bridge would keep the bridge in darkness observing their full blackout but he thought it a vain hope the pla troops guarding the bridge mightnt be firstrate most of those would already be at the front but if he were the chicom commander in nanking after the destruction of echo two he would order the bridge lit up and have every available man on and around it looking for and shooting at anything that moved in the river quickly having gone over their recognition codes call signs and hand squeeze underwater signals the four seals entered the water but not before dennison suddenly realized and pointed out to smythe rose and brentwood that the emergency code mars chosen by the bullfrog was the same as the name of the zodiacs outboard well if we have to use it whispered the more taciturn rose our guysll know we dont mean a frappin outboard dont sweat it brentwood said we wont need it submerged brentwood and dennison as one pair rose and smythe the other were connected by a nylon feel line brentwood and dennison heading for pier four rose and smythe toward pier five barely a mile ahead the current was swift and it seemed that in no time they were closing only a quarter mile from the enormous black shape of the doubledeck nanking bridge hearing the rumble of the motor traffic on the bridges top lane and the roar of three steam locomotives in tandem thundering across the lower brentwood could also hear the puttputting of the sampans through the water a sound that was progressively overwhelmed by a slower but heavier and more persistent beat shot through with a sound of metal on metal and then a lazy plumpplumpplump dennison tugged the feel line but brentwood already knew hed heard it all before aboard both the roosevelt and the reaganthe sound of depth charges rolling off a boats stern brentwood estimated that he and the other three seals were now five hundred yards from the bridge the whump of the first explosion sent shock waves racing through the water at over three thousand feet per second even the outer rings of the depth charges detonations so gutwrenching that brentwood felt a wave of cold nausea and he could only hope for the safety of smythe and rose chapter thirtytwo flying side by side the better to communicate while they observed radio silence the two siberian choppers bulbouseyed hind as taking the coordinates of freemans position from general malik in nizhneangarsk south to port baikal and irkutsk beyond the blizzard were halfway down the mile lake the overcast was still thick metalliclooking and low but visibility was at five kilometers when they spotted what looked like a spets chopper coming toward them it appeared to be a hind d but given the near whiteout conditions when depth perception suffered it was possible that it could be a bogey an american sea stallion one of the enemy choppers that coming in low over the frozen lake were attempting to pick up remnants of the retreating and decimated american iii corps whose tiny fleeing figures looked like white ants amid the black and burning detritus of their rout the hind a pilot wasnt about to take any chances and had his copilot use the flashlamp to signal his comrade in the other hind a a hundred meters on his right side nearer the western shore of the lake and port baikal that he was going to warn off the oncoming chopper even if it was a spets the pilot in the other hind gave a thumbsup acknowledgment of the message and put his hind in a tight right bank toward port baikal the remaining hind headed straight for the oncoming bogey now only two miles away but still indistinct in the blur of snow and began a hard leftright rightleft swaying motion signaling the other chopper to land the chopper kept coming and so now maliks order in mind the hinds pilot hesitated no longer and began to jiggle and jinx in response to his weapons officers commands coming up from the nose bubble below him switching on his flowerpot infrared suppressor he fired two aphid airtoair missiles the other chopper turned sharply rose then dropped like a brick both missiles missing him their white contrails now clearly visible to the fleeing americans of iii corps beneath but the choppers evasive action was to no avail its cockpit disintegrating the attackers undernose mm gun slaved to the pilots sighting system already pouring a deadly fire into the bogey bits of rear rotor flying off now the attackers could see it was a us marine sea stallion as it fell hard to the right hitting the ice with a whoomp sending spidery fissures racing along the ice its main rotors striking the frozen lake wheeling the chopper around in everincreasing circles until the rotor blades snapped sixfootlong segments of rotor flew into a fleeing american sapper company like errant boomerangs making a heavy chunkachunka sound beheading and disemboweling clumps of us troops trying desperately to cross the lake their blood and entrails smearing the ice chapter thirtythree alexsandra malofs tongue was raw from licking the rough wet stone wall of her jail cell chained to the wall she had lost twenty pounds in ten days in the harbin number one jail on ilya latovs express orders her jailers hadnt given her any food or water for the last three days they were further instructed not to give her any until she told them who helped her in her escape from baikal to harbin and what information shed given to the underground chinese democracy movement which had aided her before she was captured though she hadnt been fed her licking the condensation off the cells cold stone walls prevented her from becoming fatally dehydrated but the stones were so rough her tongue had become badly lacerated and swollen and now her mouth was filled with the metallic taste of blood her nostrils filled with the stench of her own waste emanating from the small wooden bucket by her side but only once during the moment of her arrest in the hutong had she weakened considered telling them anything and even then she had been determined not to tell them about sending the message about the nanking bridge to khabarovsk via lings underground cell she had been afraid her determination would weaken with her body but her refusal to talk had become the one thing that had kept her going the one thing to which she could tether her sanity even so alexsandra knew that all the will in the world to resist couldnt prevent her dying soon she must eat but what she had no strength left to try to catch the rats and roaches that scrabbled over her at night when she tried to sleep and even if she could think of a way of killing them the thought of eating them raw revolted her she had managed to squash several of the cockroaches but could not bring herself to devour them the thought of their hard shell crackling beneath her teeth enough to make her almost vomit yet she knew she must eat if she was to survive one of the chinese guards whom she knew only as wong a middleaged man in his late forties perhaps took particular pleasure in her plight in any other country wong could have looked merely wellfed but here in harbin he looked positively rotund compared to the other guards wong smiled a lot at alexsandra and on the third day of her imprisonment when he had come in to take out her toilet bucket he had stood over her holding a fresh stick of youtiao the long sweet bread undoing his fly with the other hand and pursing his lips his gesture with the youtiao telling her what she had to do to get the bread contemptuous she turned away from him he laughed and left making a snorting noise as he ate the bread telling her that soon she would submit that he had seen it all before at the door he turned and declared that a prisoner would do anything for a scrap of bread let alone sweet stick it was a basic instinct she refused to look at him keeping her head facing the cell wall but shed been badly frightened afraid he was right if he offered her the bread again tomorrow she could feel her resolve slipping remembering the time she had spent in the hands of the siberian secret police and now this squalor and degradation she began to cry half choking she ordered herself to stop knowing that her very tears were robbing her of vital moisture she thought of the russians starving of her greatgrandfather in leningrad during the great patriotic war of and of how they had begun eating the wallpaper paste and even with her fear of how she might be tempted to satisfy him it still took all the courage she had left but slowly she did it dragging the toilet bucket over she removed the lid tentatively the flies so insolent they didnt even bother to move steeling herself remembering how her forebears had survived she stared at the putrid stools at the tiny imbedded scraps of undigested rice and chicken innards here and there a speck of corn if her forebears had found the will to do it to survive she could she would not give in one of the guards whod heard wong laughingly tell everyone in the station house that the white jinu whorein number is eating her own shit had told his brotherinlaw chen whod laughed too and who was a blood member of the june fourth movement harbins offshoot of the democracy movement chen knew it meant that alexsandra malof hadnt broken hadnt told her captors about the bridge message but all evening chen was grumpy shouting at his only child calling him a little emperor thats the trouble with the governments onechild policy he told his wife it turns them into spoiled brats when i was young later that evening his wife mentioned that wong had asked another guard and his wife and them over for dinner wong could afford it she told chen while everyone else is on war rations wong gets extra food from the prison her unspoken question was why cant you scrounge more food wong ba muttered chen disgustedly his wife gaping it meant turtlethe very worst kind of insult she knew that night they would not be making love chapter thirtyfour personally overseeing the first prisoners brought in freeman noticed that their greatcoats were surprisingly devoid of snow which was coming down in tiny balls so hard that it bounced off the coats collecting at the collar folds the moment he saw that the surrendering siberians were wearing civilian clothing underneath freeman got on the humvees radio and ordered the entire airborne to ignore prisoners giving themselves up unless they opened fire in which case they were to be cut down apart from that prisoners were to be simply disarmed and left to find their own way to the rear im not about to fall for that old ploy he informed norton letting columns of refugees cloy your advance general maliks planned attacks against freemans flanks by his two motorized regiments were foiled by the ushaped area of chopperdropped mines the two mm howitzers meanwhile laying deadly fire on nizhneangarsk the blizzard afforded more cover for freemans foot soldiers than for the squeaky siberian ts whose laser range finders were cut by the blizzard four of the tanks erupting in flame hit by american law rounds and in one case engulfed by flame thrower it didnt mean there wasnt hard fighting freemans first battalion engaging a company of spets troops in the open area immediately northwest of the nizhneangarsk tower where the brine of the salt marshes had turned the edge of the lake a dirty cream color here combat was often handtohand and the two lynx helicopters with eight ninetyfivepound hellfire missiles apiece attacked having dealt with another six of maliks lead tanks one of the lynx helos that had helped lay the mines so that the siberians had only a quartermilewide front on which to attack was temporarily downed because of shrapnel from a prematurely detonated mine whose fragments were too big for the selfsealing fuel tank to handle nevertheless the lynx had taken down one of maliks vital forward hind d spotter helos just before the blizzard promised from the north hit full force but if there was a general collapse of morale among nizhneangarsks regular troops there was no such weakening of the siberian sixth guards regiment aboard the enormous aircushioned vehicles aists whose huge propellers were speeding them north from port baikal under orders from irkutsk hq though freeman had as yet no report of them they were now only a half hour from his paratroopers the siberian sixth guards quite apart from being the best shturmovikitrouble shootingregiment unit in the siberian army had a special reason for wanting to close with freeman the guards were veterans of the sixtyfourth siberian division which boasted among its battle honors the defeat of the wehrmacht at stalingrad but who had been routed and humiliated by freemans second army before the ceasefire indeed it was in part the devastation wrought upon the sixtyfourth by freemans breakout at that time following the destruction of baikals sub base that had convinced yesov to yield and to sue for a cease in hostilities it was only when freemans paratroopers had reached nizhneangarsk securing the rail line the surprise and rapidity of the american paratroopers attack having overwhelmed the garrison that the first of several reports came in from one of the lynxes that the aists at least eight maybe more had been sighted the report said they were approximately fifteen miles south of nizhneangarsk which meant theyd be at the railhead in fifteen minutes freeman knowing his paratroopers didnt have anything like the huge heavily armed and armored aists with which to resist colonel dick norton felt his throat constrict what now general standing on a slight rise arms akimbo in his characteristic defiant pose snow peppering him as he overlooked the white on white that was the expanse of the lake stretching south from him freeman thought he could see the aists blobs or was it a mirage or some other trick of the whiteout it couldnt be them as it was still snowing too heavily reducing his visibility to no more than a quarter mile or so it struck him that he may have momentarily been a victim of what he called hegel sightthe everpresent danger he constantly warned his troops about that in times of excitement particularly in moments of high stress you often see what you expect to see projecting your worst fears outward in this case to the ice to a small boy at night for example an old coat on a doorknob could easily become the feared intruder it took training and a victory over fear to see what in fact was there dick i want those two howitzers up here right now plus heavy mortars and sappers fast as dick norton radioed back to the main force now collecting about the railhead a quarter mile back he knew they were in serious trouble there was nothing absolutely nothing a couple of howitzers and heavy mortars could do to stop the giant ton footlong fiftyfivefootwide aircushion assault aist crafts these amphibians propelled forward by two push two pull props and driven by two gas nk mv turbine engines at over seventyfive miles per hour could move about a hundred times faster on the mirrorsmooth ice than could the two mm guns or their crews and each of the ten ton aists in addition to carrying fully armed shock troops boasted eight surfacetoair grail missiles which could make very short work of the remaining choppers and of anything else as if to support dick nortons pessimism the snowfall eased and freeman through the tenpower binoculars could see white blobs on white the tiny hard snow racing at him like huge tracer through the dancing screen of the snow particles he could see what appeared to be clouds of steam the upblow of snow and moisture from the aists onefoothigh cushion of air billowing out from beneath the bulbous rubber skirting on each of the huge craft behind and all around him freeman could hear the sappers and mortar crews arriving and behind them the clank of the two howitzers anchor spades in the snow and ice norton too could see the aists there were not eight but ten still out of the howitzers effective range but steadily growing bigger like bluntnosed destroyers their superstructure bulky and bullying in appearance they were big targets but norton knew there was no way two howitzers could handle the aists with the siberian crafts maneuverability freeman announced that if he were the siberian commander he would deploy the troops aboard each aist into the taiga for a flank attack before using the pt tanks four aboard each aist and their fivemilerange grail sn missiles the second thing hed do he said would be to use the aists which could not traverse the timber taiga for a swerving s frontal attack against the railhead nortons accurate estimate that such a maneuver would mean no less than two and a half thousand enemy shock troops coming at them was interrupted by someone shouting that the fleet of aists which norton could now see clearly through his binoculars were moving closer to the taiga they were about a hundred yards apart and five miles away to the right of the american position and now turning to their left to the americans right the upblow from the assembled aists skirts forming a huge flourwhite cloud of snow norton could see their shock troops unloading streaming out of the white cloud like small wooden sticks disappearing into the snowy umbrellaed taiga the aists closest to the forest having spewed out their human cargo now moved off and were forming up in single file so as to deny freeman any effective lateral fire their commander was obviously intent as freeman had predicted on a frontal attack against the americans the second part of what was obviously going to be a scissor offensive one blade would be made up of the shock troops from the aists moving now through the timber cutting in toward freeman from his right flank and putting stiffener into maliks two motorized regiments which had been driven back into the forest from the railroad only a short time before the other blade would be the aist attack itself freeman grabbed the field phone and relayed his instructions his paratroopers taking up positions all along the rail line left and right of his humvee picking the spots where the rail lines encrusted with ice formed the rim of a slight rise in the ground the rise having been manmade in order to lift this section of the transsiberian above flood level it created a natural firing mound behind which freemans sappers also set up their mortars several of the crews already crouching over the dial sights the two howitzer crews pathetically it seemed to dick norton yet bravely aligning the guns against the missilearmed aists freemans two remaining lynx choppers one of them with the patched fuel tank rose like huge dragonflies frightened by noise their cargo nets of pressure mines slung pendulously beneath them as they headed to the right west of nizhneangarsk to do what freeman still glued to his binoculars called a little oat sowing still watching the aists for the first wink of a missile he shouted over the roar of the choppers to dick norton about the mines mightnt help stop their infantry dick but it sure as hellll slow em up damned if id like to be feeling my way through the forest fearing any moment id be wearing my balls for a necklace yes sir said norton but the aists i know their missiles arent any good over five miles but what are you going to do when they oh you beautiful bastards yelled freeman without taking his eyes from the binoculars norton took up his and in the circle of eyeblinding white saw the aists or rather one of them obscuring any view of the others which had apparently lined up behind the leader it presented freemans artillerymen for all the good the two mms could do with the smallest possible crosssection of target and only one target at that it was a frontal attack all right just as freeman had predicted hopefully thought norton the hero of pyongyang and ratmanov had also figured out a defense weve only got two friggin guns said one of the loaders pulling on his helmet but careful not to strap it lest an explosions concussion tear his head off why the hell doesnt the old man open up now weve got em in range might be lucky and pick off the lead one anyway least do some friggin damage dont ask me commented the battery officer general told us not to fire until he gives us the green light after calling the aists beautiful bastards for the second time and several of his treetop spotters reporting there were twelve and not ten of them freeman gave the twohowitzer battery and the sappers the order to fire norton involuntarily jumped startled by the feral roar and crash of mortar bombs and sapper charges freeman was pushing him down for safety behind the humvee as the frigid air came alive with the singing of deadly ice particles whizzing overhead at first norton thought the aists frontal attack had begun already although he knew that the grail missiles were still not in range it was a minute later as he glanced back at the two mm howitzers seeing their belching flame and hearing the clang of ejected casings that he realized what was happening and why all the explosions seemed so close it was because they were close the two gun crews like the sappers were following freemans orders to the letter ignoring the rapidly approaching aists now only seven miles off and closing fast the mortar crews were firing their bombs in a degree leftright fan arc its farthest point only a hundred yards or so in front of them and not at the aists now less than six miles four minutes away from them racing toward the americans at seventyplus miles per hour across the perfectly unobstructed ice instead of firing at the aists the americans were firing into the threefoot ice several hundred yards out into the lake for the howitzers it was pointblank range give the bastards a bit of their own medicine goddamn mongols declared freeman as ice chips smacked into his humvee the explosions from the heavy mortars and the sappers c he packs acting like depth charges chopping and smashing up what had been the mirrored surface of the lake within minutes it was a boiling jumble of mini icebergs rolling over and over in the manmade turbulence some of the bergs jagged tops rising over five feet above the water then norton saw it in a flash the aists with a draft of only one foot might have difficulty negotiating above a bumpy terrain as it turned out there was no difficulty there was only disaster the aists balking for a moment or two clearly decelerating their upblow of snow increasing then ironically rapidly decreasing as they hit full throttle hoping to get enough air cushion to overrun the americans in freemans elegant phrase the icebergs sticking up like giant knives ripped the ass off the aists causing a pileup the likes of which norton had never seen one aists drum tilt firecontrol radar took off like a flying saucer another aists bow ramp imploded pierced by the ice the aist rolling its lift fans coming to pieces with the sound of some monstrous air conditioner suddenly filled with metal chips particles of ice having passed through the protective mesh buckling the fans blades the aist still rolling now capsized the display of its enormous black bottom looking somehow obscene covered as it was in a froth of chocolatemoussecolored bubbles one of the hovercrafts enormous push propellers still functioning having whipped up hydraulic fluid into a frenzied spill that soon all but obscured the rubber skirting god damn it dick yelled freeman one hand putting his helmet back on after a concussion had blown it off the other hand pulling out his sig sauer ninemillimeter looks like tacoma demolition derby out there goddamn mongols he fired until his magazine was empty oblivious of shots being fired his way slapping in a new clip firing again into the boiling sea of blood and ice and dying siberians amidst which norton again didnt feel it politic to point out that these werent mongols but siberians he knew what the general meant freeman had told washington he would avenge the slaughter of iii corps but even so freeman had given strict orders that any sibir who put up his hands gave any sign of surrender was to be treated accordingly fished out assisted as required and put in line to be airlifted back to khabarovsk chapter thirtyfive the immediate effect of the aist disaster meant that now freemans paras could give all their attention to preparing indepth defenses of nizhneangarsk freeman opted for a broken diamond of razor wire two hundred yards a side the pattern which had been used to telling effect against the japanese in the jungles of new guinea in to the fact that there was so much snow to help hide the springcoiled razor wire as it was unraveled to form a diamond shape helped his plan the left top run of wire went out for fifty yards or so beyond the end of the top right run creating die impression to anyone approaching the railhead that the top of the diamond was open that there was a gap blown open in the perimeter defense either that or theyd assume thered been a break in the wire but once through the break they would in fact have entered a trap wire on their left and right coming to a closed v dug in behind the bottom of the wire v would be a corresponding v of american machine guns to keep the approaching siberians unloaded earlier from the aist occupied freeman sent patrols a mile east of nizhneangarsk around the lakes edge so as to avoid the mines and to engage any siberians who tried making their way out of the taiga to the less obstructed lake edge in this way the siberian shock troops were being herded back into the forest and ultimately into the diamond of wire in this freeman as hed anticipated was aided by the slow going of the siberian troops due to the mines that had been scattered by the lynxes in the forest between nizhneangarsk and the aist troop dropoff point personally directing the layout of the razor wire at the railhead freeman was pleased to notice that while they had plenty of snow with which to hide the bottom v the blizzard itself was letting up which meant that he could soon expect air drops to resupply and thus consolidate his position it meant he could also now order m tanks westward on the baikalamurmagistral line to nizhneangarsk to meet any counterattack that might be contemplated by litvinovs northern army around yakutsk the longrange effect of freemans taking the railhead quite apart from the fact that m tanks were now rolling westward to nizhneangarsk under heavy fighter protection was that he had as hoped not only struck the siberians a counterattack on their home ground which would strike a blow at siberian morale in general but in doing so had created the massive diversion of vitally needed siberian troops from the south around baikal this not only caused yesov to lose the momentum of his eastward lunge but simultaneously enabled what was left of iii corps to make the eastern side of the lake and to escape into the taiga and join the troops heading south in all freeman having thrown yesov off his stride had bought valuable time for second army to continue its buildup on the chinese border still freeman knew that a breakthrough of his in the south any attempt to take the general offensive against the chinese would be impossible unless the nanking bridge was blown cutting the logistical tail of the pla the vital line of supply for chengs northern chinese armies as if to underscore the tentativeness of his nizhneangarsk victory there was a sudden swish of air like that of an automobile passing another at high speed on a highway and freeman was yanked down into oilstained snow by dick norton both of them lifted bodily by the concussion of the hundredmillimeter shell hitting freemans humvee twenty yards away there was a soft woof the humvee or rather its buckled chassis split and afire the scarred snow around it a junkyard of humvee parts its burning engine spewing out a thick churning column of sootblack smoke what in hell began freeman but immediately hit the ground again as did norton and the others a second round hitting the burning hulk with a loud whang the chassis disintegrating filling the air with shrapnel for a moment norton deafened by the noise of the impact couldnt hear what the general was saying freeman hauled himself out of the snow dusted himself off and pulled out the beretta from his belt band god damn it thats the second time no need for that the generals outrage was directed at something none of the americans had seen during the chaotic fighting amid the aist pileup some of the siberians being hauled out of the frigid waters of lake baikal were still fighting the last three aists had floundered but seven of their twelve pt upgunned cannon amphibious tanks had been able to roll off the aist before the latter had been taken out by the now pointblank howitzer fire these seven tanks were now firing their hundredmillimeter cannon even as they swam with flotation boards out toward the american positions at ten kilometers an hour navigating their way through and largely protected from american fire by the very icebergs that had incapacitated their mother ships perhaps norton was the only one who fully understood freemans outrage at the appearance of the amphibious pts they had been the nemesis of his armor earlier in the war the goddamned coffeepots as he called them had been used to killing effect in north korea the relatively light amphibious pts at only fourteen tons able to move with much more maneuverability in the flooded korean paddies than could the heavy abrams ms sixty tons but if the nka had unleashed hundreds of them in the flooded rice paddies where they could move much more easily and could ford swollen streams with their flotation skirting and the sixtyton ms were often stuck and found it difficult if not impossible to negotiate on the flood plain at least here at nizhneangarsk the game was over for the pts or so it seemed for some inexplicable reason perhaps because the driver of the pt was concussed by the enfilade of mm and heavy mortar fire raining down about him one pt of the seven now approaching the americans position had its lights on and in the snow made a wonderful target attracting fire from every kind of weapon the americans had its turret suddenly imploded and it was gone in a huge bubble along with a cheer from several of the mortar crews only freeman and the paratroop commander woke up to the ploy at once and had started to yell at the mortars and antitank law crews to spread their fire among the others but a quickthinking and brave siberian commander had succeeded nevertheless while every tom dick and goddamn harry as freeman later reported was throwing everything but his socks including infrared homing rounds at that pt with its lights on the remaining six amphibians had precious seconds to find breaching aprons of ice that allowed them to get a grip onto the mainland at the edge of the fanshaped sea and to fire back in those few seconds at least three got off a hundredmillimeter round each one of these taking out one of freemans mm howitzer crews there was another round screaming overhead so low that freeman and norton could feel its heat wash a split second before it hit one of the two lynxes which had come down to refill its string bag with antipersonnel mines the explosion of the chopper was more a burst of black oil not yet alight then a crimson flash followed by a deep steady roar as the antipersonnel mines went off filling the air with fragments that killed or wounded thirtysix of freemans paratroopers nearby the pts paid dearly as the oneman portable oneshot law antitank weapons nearest them were brought to bear the sixpound at rounds sinking all but one of the remaining six amphibians some of the siberians afire inside these tanks were trying desperately to get out the sound of them beating against the inside of the cupolas whose seals had been warped under impact of the antitank rounds clearly audible to the law teams only one cupola managed to open and a gunner aflame tried futilely to abandon the tank falling forward as the tank went down its gun coming up striking him faceon and knocking him back into the water the man was pushed toward the edge of the ice by a wave from the sinking tank its gun now at a crazy skypointing angle disappearing into an enormous bubbling the tanks choppedup flotation boards ripped letting the tank slide backward into the oblivion of three thousand feet of water ill tell you dick said freeman i dont envy those poor bastards there was no reply when freeman turned about norton was out cold his left hand lost from view in the blood gushing from his left eye medic yelled freeman with the medic came more bad news satint over china showed what the g officer surmised had been a pinpoint burst of light situated about a mile upstream of the nanking bridge freeman said nothing kneeling by norton who had been with him since his days in europe since ratmanov sir the intelligence officer pressed unsure as to whether freeman had heard him i know freeman growled up at him youre telling me the country market teams been discovered well yes sir but were not sure about both boats we think this photo is definitely of one boat but theres a chance the second is still operational so theyre in trouble said freeman curtly cant do anything about it from here right no sir but whether they blow it or not theres the problem of getting them out chicoms are sure to be looking for them around the bridge well we sure as hell cant leave them there no sir they issued an emergency call not yet sir extractions scheduled in ninety minutes what do you suggest a line of siberians dripping wet some shivering so much from the cold that freeman could actually hear their teeth chattering was passing them under guard one man saw him and saluted solemnly the general rose and returned the salute hearing the small arms fire in the background at the edge of the taiga a half mile to the east freeman knew he had a formidable problem either way if the seals didnt blow the bridge thered be no hope of contesting the invasion by the northern chicom armies if there were some seals still alive and they did blow the bridge chances were their original dropoff point would no longer be usable chicoms now searching upstream from whence theyd come any suggestions freeman repeated well sir tom pierce the pave low commander on salt lake city says that if his helos went in under the radar undetected they can go in and out again problem is therell be absolutely no chance of even a touchandgo extraction on the riverbank mud apart from possibly bogging down if that chopper landed the chicomsd swarm all over em is there any other way asked freeman well sir pierce says its possible seals carry an iff friendorfoe identifier pierce thinks he could try a stabo link if you approve freeman raised his eyebrows watching norton coming to the colonel having involuntarily soiled his pants in the shock of getting hit the general nodded to his g that they should move away give the medic room first problem those sealsll have the general told the g is that damn bridge whether it goes or not theyll know any attempted pickupll have to be made soon as possible after wed have to have those helos from salt lake city in the air pretty damn fast have em almost to the china coast a siberian officer an american army blanket clutched around his shoulders his face covered in oil stumbled by toward what he obviously thought was a vision or the grandest american invention since the model t the paratroopers portable must already inflated taking in wounded its sterile air filter unit humming a soft song in the din of battle well youd better get everything ready son freeman told his g use black hawks for that he meant one of the ubiquitous utility helos of vietnam fame the best for a stabo pickup pierce thinks the pave can handle it sir hes all set to go whats the seals emergency call mars all right have those paves airborne soon as you can yes sir and lieutenant general you tell those big ugly paves to add some firepower yes sir freemans use of the phrase big ugly paves momentarily reminded him of the big ugly fat fellows the bs he had ready at nayoro should the weather ever clear over the black dragon river with americans and chinese so close together in such foul weather not even the bs pinpoint bombing could avoid killing as many americans as chinese lieutenant sir seals carry that stabo stuff no sir its dropped all right you attend to that ill see if our navy boys on salt lake city can give us a few strikers offshore if we need them i hope those seals blow that bridge sir they dont son freeman called out youre gonna miss the world series he bent down again next to norton who was now sitting up having his head bandaged and we my friends he told the medic and norton will be up shit creek without a paddle you think theyll began norton then stopped feeling the bump of the bandage over his eye he was having trouble seeing with his right and it felt as if his head would fall off he began again quietly you think yakutsk will hit us from the north i mean the weathers still pretty bad for us having any hope of air cover they might try it they might said freeman in the presence of wounded men he always tried to sound confident reassuring it was a commanders job it was also a commanders job to look facts square in the face and if he was the c in c of yakutsk and american cover was socked in then hed go for broke release his armor and attack the railhead overwhelm it with armor still freeman didnt regret having brought his airborne to nizhneangarsk for it had achieved its aim of stalling yesovs eastern advance and given him time to move his ms west to nizhneangarsk the next move was yesovs to stay put or maybe said norton his voice dry groggy from a shot of demerol maybe theyre already on the move chapter thirtysix looking up from thirty feet below the rivers surface robert brentwood could see a tancolored sheen moonlight on the water which would make it easier for him and his codiver dennison and for the other echo one pair smythe and young rose but robert brentwood also knew that it would be welcomed by the chicoms the better to see anything moving on the river already the chinese were holding up traffic on the righthand channel off the eastern bank not allowing any vessel under the bridge brentwood estimated he and dennison were now two hundred yards from the bridge smythe and rose though farther out in the river were presumably about the same distance away from the piers for a moment he toyed with the idea of using his penlight on the handheld gps affixed to his weight belt to get their exact position but decided that even at this depth it was too much of a risk with the chicoms up and about he and dennison would have to reorientate themselves visually regarding pier four in a minute or so the current moving them more swiftly now that the river was narrowing from three and a half to three miles wide as it approached die straightway leading into the big leftright hook of river that lay beyond the bridge dennisons mask was misting up as he closed his eyes fighting the temptation to scratch an indescribable itch that was moving malevolently up from his testicles to his backside where the friction caused by the heavy flippers and explosive loads was exacting its toll or maybe it was something he was allergic to something he ate on the salt lake city before the mission the carrier was a world away and he yearned for the safety of it even though hed joined the seals precisely to get away from the bigness of the surface fleet where you were lucky to get to know your own section let alone anyone else in the fivethousandman crew or rather any of the five thousand men and women aboard now that congress had empowered females including those in the air arm to be combat soldiers he wouldnt mind one of them scratching the itch it was crazy thinking about that at a time like this but it drained off some of the tension still unable to resist the itch now spreading up his loins like spiders he was careful to use his right hand rather than the left one hard jerk of the latter on the feel line would have signaled to brentwood they were under attack yet despite dennisons precautions brentwood felt the tension on the line increase and swam closer in the pitchblackness only to be reassured by the okay squeeze signaled on his upper arm by dennison brentwood signaled him in return that it was time to go up anyway this being as good a moment as any in brentwoods estimation to reorientate themselves when they saw it silhouetted by moonlight both mens pulses quickened you could practice all you wanted in pearl stare for hours at a scale model with wallsized satint blowups planning just where and how you were going to place the charges but the nanking bridge standing proud over two hundred feet high and over four miles long its two decks separated and held in position by enormous xshaped trusses was massively impressive only a hundred yards from it now brentwood and dennison could quite clearly hear the movement of traffic the faint sing of tires and boomboom sound of wheels crossing the join grates between each section of the eight spans supported between the nine piers the lower railway deck was seethrough for a second bathed in moonlight that silhouetted the crisscross trusses beneath it then suddenly it was blacked out by a long goods train its boxcars traveling right to left across the moon heading northward carrying muchneeded supplies for chengs army from the mission briefing brentwood knew they could expect another train within the next half hour off to the right from whence the train had come he and dennison could see bright dots of lights searchlights starting to probe from atop the ancient citys wall the beams were still concentrating on sweeping the eastern half of the river downstream from where echo two had been hit for this reason the searchlights didnt worry brentwood now as much as earlier and besides the mist coming down from farther upstream caused by the smoke from the factory was spilling over both banks from flooded levees helping to protect them brentwood was confident that unless they were actually caught fully illuminated in the beams circle the latter a hundred feet or so across there was a good possibility of avoiding detection and even if you had your head out provided you stayed absolutely still in the light and betrayed no motion you would stand a fiftyfifty chance in any case much better to have the searchlights up on the wall if you had to have them at all rather than farther down on the bridge itself now that they were on the surface and could see no immediate danger brentwood tapped dennisons shoulder and whispered when we get to the pier well wait till another train starts across to place the charges copy acknowledged dennison and discarding the feel line they disappeared once more beneath the muddy water the current having moved them to within fifty yards of the pier stratus cloud sailing across the moon obscuring more of it by the second it was now that brentwood saw how the tragedy of echo two had unwittingly helped him and dennison for while the chicoms had been concentrating on searching closer to the right bank their searchlight beams faded in the mist over about a quarter mile on the threemilewide river and so had given the remaining seals time to get nearer the bridge brentwoods shoulders were already aching from the weight of his minigun and the heavy pack of his two eighteenpound champagnebottleshaped charges detonating cord waterproof tape grappling tackle stable blasting cap and timers he knew that the big problem for the two twoman teams now providing smythe and rose hadnt been picked up was the question of the delay fuse timer with the chinese already aroused it couldnt be too long but time enough to permit them to make their extraction point downstream brentwood decided that if he and dennison were lucky and managed to place the charges as hed planned hed be able to use a shorttime acat a tenminute acid ampule timer he had to trust that smythe and rose would do the same short fuse being standard procedure when any member of the mission had been discovered and might jeopardize the remainder he turned his immediate attention to two things first where exactly he would place the earmuffs on the pier which was growing by the second as he and dennison neared it and second how he would set the yellowdyed and playdohlike c plastique between the flanges of two crisscross girders the c explosive would have to be fairly high up in order to literally cut through the girders with the heat generated by the explosion rather than by the explosion itself brentwood felt two sharp tugs for danger on his weight belt and immediately put his arms into a reverse breaststroke position his long flippers kicking hard against the current to brake his forward motion his backpack now coming forward thumping into his upper back chapter thirtyseven wake up you aussie bastard said salvini you owe us money aussie was already awake but lying dead still from habit as any sasd man did not moving before you knew exactly what the situation was first put your brain into gear he could hear his instructor telling him before you move aussie cmon get up now he recognized salvinis voice knew where he was safe in a warm kip at rudnaya pristan after the abortive a raid his left foot was throbbing whats up sal what money outside it was still pitchblack yeah bigtime spender said sal lets go briefing in five minutes were outta here in twenty a mission aussie was sitting up on the edge of the palliasse the sasd teams preferring the strawfilled hessian bag to regular special forces foamrubber issue salvini who had been on the eighttomidnight watch was handing him a steaming cup of coffee that seal outfit said salvini one daveys brothers in he glanced about to see whether david brentwood was nearby well satint shows at least one of the two zodiacs bought it were on standby for assist and you sweetheart owe me and choir some bread this jolted aussie more than the coffee hey hey fucking hold on there sal just hold on a mo this just happened right out of the fucking blue right yeah so so this had nothing to do with any friggin rumor you and williams here made up that bullshit choir was filling a cmag for his squad automatic weapon thats right boyo we were just guessin playing the odds theres a war on you know he smiled across at salvini then down at aussie fact is mr lewis sir you owe us fifteen in god we trust all right all right said lewis what a pair of bloody bushrangers he means holdup men choir told sal i mean fucking con men said aussie goodnaturedly all right ill pay you when we get back id like mine now please said choir giving salvini the nod oh thank you choir replied aussie lewis over his steaming coffee thank you for your wonderful display of confidence in your mate think im gonna buy it fore i can square accounts that it had occurred to me boyo jesus retorted aussie fixing sal in his gaze doesnt he take the fucking cake id like my ten too said sal now oh i get it its fucking gangup time on old lewis is it all right sticks and stonesll break my bones but names im gonna report you fuckers to davey what for joshed salvini gathering his kit for being assholes detrimental to my morale suddenly lewis remembered david brentwoods brother did his brother cop it dont know said salvini cant tell from the satellite pix whats the problem poe out he meant the point of extraction yeah freemans hq says the second team if theyre still alive probably hid their kit a few miles upriver and chicomsve probably found it by now so if there are any seals left they wont be able to use the zodiac to get to the original poe how do we know theyre still alive asked lewis we dont but we will if the bridge goes chipped in choir make one bloody great splash for a satellite picture it will a satellitell be overhead then pressed lewis dont know said choir wed probably find out via chinese underground radio anyway same outfit in harbin that put us in the know about the bridge yeah added salvini they tell us the poor bitch who passed it on to us is now in a harbin lockup choir made a face chinese jail wouldnt change places with her boyo well shes not goin to be much friggin good there said lewis shes not gonna see whether the bridge goes down or not from fuckin harbin sometimes salvini got teed off with aussies insensitive streak still it also was what made him a good man in a tight spot no agreed salvini but choirs right well hear through the harbin underground if anything happens in nanking so whats the plan said lewis draining the coffee he saw david brentwood come in sorry to hear about your brother mate david nodded the fact was he was trying to push any thought of robert out of his mind by thinking only of the plan that it was family made all the difference but it couldnt make any difference if you were going to let it get in the way of a good clear standby plan you might as well withdraw he motioned down at aussies bandaged foot the iodine stain now a dark saffron on his left ankle and arch you up to it aussie dont be bloody silly answered the australian got to help a mate out right david brentwood could feel his throat constricting with emotion the simplicity and spontaneity of the australians response to go so willingly into danger though it was the same quality he himself had momentarily threatened to overwhelm him it was an unspoken pride they all shared and he wondered whether anyone outside could ever fully understand but perhaps they did it had often struck david that there was many a civilian in the suburbs of america who like the chinese underground carried on an everyday life with an unspoken commitment to an aged parent a handicapped child with the same kind of devotion and no one knew what it took he thought of what his brother ray had gone through after being so terribly burned aboard the uss blaine of his own wife georgina and roberts wife rosemary and his sister lana still bound to la creep roche they too had to cope with unspoken fears and the absence of loved ones standby plan is this explained david quietly if we get a go from freeman well be flown machplus transport to the carrier salt lake city its moving in as close as possible to the coast then we go into the area north of nanking under the radar screen via a pave one of the two that took them in but we dont go for the actual assist unless we get an emergency call sign no call sign we assume theyre all dead what is it asked salvini mars no said salvini whats the assist stabo choir williams shook his head at the acronyms the bureaucrats had thought up stabo technically meant stabilized tactical airborne body operation and like most military acronyms it made it all sound banal and straightforward like taking the bus the danger obfuscated by the bloodless officialese well hell said aussie we werent planning anything for today were we he looked around id rather be playing football said choir wryly adopting aussies tone knowing that no matter what they said david brentwood would feel badly about them all being involved in the mission figuring that in a way they were doing it as a favor for him inadvertently making him feel responsible football said aussie a mock sneer on his face dyou mean real football choir australian rules australian rules echoed choir looking bemused at salvini and david now theres a contradiction in terms dont be so fucking rude said aussie picking up the mags for his mm mini and turning his attention to david brentwood how many of us davey four answered david im going but if any of you dont he stopped the others were already picking up their gear maybe they wont need an assist said salvini right said aussie and pigs fly replied david looking straight at him right you mean welshmen said aussie oh yeah they fly all the time i hope we dont have to go in said david i mean i hope they get the bridge and theyll get it said salvini though knowing hed fail a polygraph test one for the books hey davey said aussie whats that our mob sasd helping out the navy jesus theyll never forgive us hadnt thought of it that way said david momentarily cheered by the australians light banter in the face of the odds well you should have mate a pave can accommodate us all i take it no problem well if it gets too heavy well just throw choir out may i remind you mr brentwood sir said choir that sergeant lewis here owes me and salvini fifteen bucks i authorize you to collect in my absence mercenary bastard riposted aussie that all you think about dough filthy lucre what choir was thinking about was a filthy river three miles wide and trying to extract seals if there were any survivors by st abo the quartermaster caught up with them in the mess he told them the stabo harnesses were ready david brentwood looked solemn thanks they sat there waiting for the transport to the jet that would whisk them southeast to the carrier his hands cupping a second mug of coffee aussies head suddenly shot up like an eagle spotting unsuspecting prey hey you jokers he said looking at salvini and choir were only on standby unless we get the seals emergency call as of now i owe you sweet fuckall technicality charged choir technicality my ass ha and you thought you could pull one over mr brentwood sir david brentwood looked around it was the quartermaster again yes sir general freemans hq says go bridge down or not he wants to have you guys in the area if they call hey said aussie his eyes turned on the hapless quartermaster shouldnt you be in fuckin bed chapter thirtyeight the sheen above dennison and robert brentwood now like a dull mirror on a darkened ceiling wasnt moonlight for in patches it was particularly intense a minute later they realized that the blobs of concentrated light not moving were fixed floodlights on the bridge and crisscrossing the dull silvered roof of ligns that was the riverair interface were enormous black rectangular shapes the shadows cast on the water by the gargantuan xshaped truss girders they surfaced slowly silently in one of the shadows and their worst fears were confirmed bridge floodlights spaced a hundred yards apart were switched on along the southern side of the bridge and far over to their right toward the eastern shore about two hundred yards from that side of the rivers edge was a long black snakelike object as his eyes adjusted to the infrared lenses brentwood recognized it as a long line of river craft of all shapes and sizes from small sampans and mediumsized junks to the big propane barge all halted and forced to cast anchor a quarter mile upstream from the bridge and it was then that he saw the two men rose and smythe tied to the outer rail of the bridge a hundred feet above the midway point on the span between piers four and five like two black crosses still clad in their rubber wet suits far below them in the penumbra of the floodlights the huge black shadows of the trusses shivered in eddies about the massive concrete piers and now there was a lot more noise shouted commands on the bridge the distant rumble of another approaching train only this time an empty one coming down from the north brentwood knew it would be impossible to scale the pier and place the earmuffs as planned but just as quickly with the speed of a sub captain firing a snap torpedo shot he knew what he must do like seeing a fuzzy slide jump into focus there was barely time to convey the information to dennison including the gps coordinates of the new rendezvous point hed decided on even with the racket on the bridge added to by the rattle of the goods train brentwood was cognizant of just how far the human voice could carry over water and quickly reverted to sign language during the lull that followed the train it took him only a minute to explain it but to dennison who expected a searchlight from the right bank to have him in its beam any second it seemed much longer as dennison checked his cobra pack he got a whiff of foul air blown down by the north wind from the flooded levees slipping beneath the dark water the last thing he saw through his mask was the two blurred cruciform shapes of rose and smythe tied against the outer pedestrian railing of the seemingly endless black bridge going deep to forty feet he took out the penlight and pressing it hard against his watch arched his body to prevent even such a dim light as this from being seen it was he started the count brentwood having told him he must wait twenty minutes before he could go back up and even then it would perhaps take another half hour before brentwood was ready but even now dennison found his thumb impatiently slipping the safety off the remington machineshotgun his left hand feeling the ventilated barrel shield beneath the waterproof plastic sheath that held the gun and its eightshot rounds he was eager yet nervous because along with the new rendezvous point brentwood had also told him that even with this quiet shotgun he didnt want any more fuss than was necessary that he must be able to do it with two clicks two shots chapter thirtynine northeast of lake baikal the five hundred siberian tanks due to roll south from yakutsk oblast to engage freeman before he could build enough armored strength to capitalize on his victory at nizhneangarsk were held back for four hours at udokan clear skies were reported in the sector above which american planes ruled supreme at the outermost limit of the siberians formidable aa network but soon invading the clear skies there came threatening scuds of the storm line of cumulonimbus anvils which would soon swallow the clear sky and further engulf nizhneangarsk to the south the storm as in the case of those preceding it was also coming down from the arctic blowing over the permafrost with a polar wind whose chill factor drove the thermometer in the yakutsk oblast to minus fiftysix degrees with the mercury still falling it hadnt yet plunged to the minus eighties but it was cold enough for exposed flesh to freeze in seconds and metal was becoming brittle still the siberian armored division from yakutsk had pressed south under yesovs orders you are fighting on home soil the marshal exhorted his men pointing out that the americans might have made a name for themselves in iraq at mediny ridge against the sovietbuilt ts but that was in another world one of sand and baked earth and the lessons of mediny had been learned also here the advantage would be with the siberians for whom winter was not so much something to resist but to act in concert with to use so much so that the siberians knowledge of snow fighting was said to be vsosano smolokombred in the bone when dick norton heard that the siberian armor was on the move south from udokan he knew that freeman with nowhere to retreat even if that was his style was now in a makeorbreak situation whether he liked it or not and every other officer on freemans staff was as deeply worried as norton several unhesitatingly expressing their concern to norton that this time fighting freeman might well have bitten off more than he can chew with several officers using the same cliché norton was concerned that the growing air of uncertainty among the senior commanders would spread by that rapid process of osmosis whereby fear is borne effortlessly like a virus from the officer corps to the grunt he knew they wouldnt tell freeman of their doubts that was his job and he was dismayed for when the second storm struck american planes would be yet again denied the opportunity to move effectively against the siberian armor this time consisting of main battle tanks moving south with formidable surfacetoair missile cover it wasnt as if freeman was unconcerned with the weather he had all but driven major harvey simmet the hq met officer to distraction by calling for hourly reports but he seemed overconfident to norton as if he knew as much about the terrain as the siberians who had lived there all their lives what you have to understand dick explained freeman as he stood proudly watching his mas heading north is their permafrost in places its over a thousand feet thick siberians worried for years about how to get their oil and natural gas up from beneath that goddamned concrete buckles everything you try to drill it with diamond bits wear out here faster than anywhere else in the world then this bright spark comes along from novosibirsk and figures out you dont need miles and miles of piping underneath to tap the natural gas or anything else for that matter know what he does norton shook his head it was time for what the generals headquarter staff called jeopardy if you didnt know the answers freeman took you prisoner in a tenminute rundown on littleknown minutiae well it was costing them a fortune in piping dick not just for drilling stock but for pipe to pump the natural gas through dick norton was finding it difficult to concentrate on what the general was saying feeling too sleepy from the demerol and too worried about the siberian armor already reported only sixty miles away pipe he said trying to sound interested but imagining what would happen when the siberians ts with the laser sights and all the lessons of the tanks shortcomings in the iraqi war now known and overcome met up with the hastily assembled american defenses only american tanks having arrived on the bam so far yes pipe replied freeman dont you see they didnt need it holes they drilled through the permafrost vertical or horizontal were natural aquifers natural pipes permafrosts so thick and hard you dont need damn pipes use the permafrost so thought norton good for freeman resident us expert on permafrost but had the general thought through his battle plan to engage the siberians with their twotoone advantage worse still freeman had ordered his tanks to proceed north from nizhneangarsk line abreast any first lieutenant knew that a welldugin enemy tank or at missile battery had a much better chance to pick off tanks if they were coming at you stretched left to right rather than in line of column and so norton used freemans homily about permafrost to alert the general as unobtrusively as possible to this potentially fatal tactical flaw freeman left hand on his hip right clenched thumb outstretched was giving the hurryup signal to an m that had slewed off the marsden matting that the resupply cs had dropped along with the howitzers also being taken north freeman didnt acknowledge that hed heard norton hands back on his hips his collar up eyes squinting in the first snow of the new storm the general shook his head not in dismay at the coming battle but with unbridled admiration for his men norton could see the general was in his attack mode as it was known among his officers his holsters metal clip was undone so that it wouldnt freeze up and inhibit what he had within earshot of a la roche reporter inadvisably called his fast draw the la roche tabloids had picked it up and gone wild with a cowboy general headline asking in the lead does he care about his mena headline that norton had taken care the general hadnt seen nevertheless despite himself norton remained deeply troubled not about whether freeman cared about his troops which was an insulting charge but whether he had thought enough about the tactics of the coming battle of massed armor or was he simply flushed with the win at nizhneangarsk if the nanking bridge wasnt blown everyone on his staff knew the victory at the bam railhead would be a strategic nonentity a mere side blow to yesovs army rather than a knockout you havent been listening dick general well damn it man werent you at the briefing last night all commanders un no general i was checking the situation visàvis the uh nanking bridge freeman scowled whenever norton had screwed up which thank the lord was rarely he started this academic visàvis bullshit a leftover from his postgraduate days after west point visàvis really meant give me time to think up a good answer probably sitting on the damn can during the briefing his good eye soaking up the interviews in playboy visàvis some tarts tits bout her posing nude just so she could afford the tuition at the sorbonne colonel goddamn it dont you slack off on me and go letting the logistical boys run line convoys through this stuff he meant single file through the permafrost permafrost is hard as concrete like i said but you run a line of vehicles over it and the tire friction and exhaust spittlell melt the top couple of inches and before you know it youll be bogged down like running warm water over an ice tray wont melt the damn ice but the top layerll go to mush slick on you half black ice half mush armored tracksll be slewing and sliding like beginners day at the rink sitting ducks for the siberians yes sir maybe freeman had been thinking permafrost tactics all along still that didnt change the twotoone advantage of the siberians the generals expression had changed his tone quiet now ever tell you i met my wife at a skating rink no general in california can you imagine middle of summer too high summer god it was beautiful dick cool she had this kind of green stuff costume said norton all green continued freeman like the color of that water in hawaii translucent and every time she went into a spin it was well hell i knew id marry her right mere and then he paused course never had much time to skate i mean go around with her you know yes general in the howling of the approaching storm freeman stared up at the snow then shifted his gaze toward the last of the tank support vehicles moving out there were too few for the mas the tanks ideally needing a maintenance check every miles but ideally was always somewhere else for every fifty of his plus tanks he knew he could expect twenty to twentyfive breakdowns most could be fixed in the field but all would be timeconsuming the essence of being a good soldier and a good commander as freeman had lectured his officers so often was to make the best of what you had seize the moment rather than wait for a logistics wish list and norton remembered never let your own fears be known to the men dick sir get harvey simmet up here will you yes sir once again norton this time apologetically called harvey out of his warm cubbyhole of isobar charts sat pics and other meteorological data the printout piling up in a small hill by his printer the hourly reports demanded by freeman had now become halfhourly and dick norton didnt take it as a good sign in his experience senior officers including the best of them often albeit unwittingly gave in to the temptation to switch their attention to factors they couldnt control whenever they had a deepseated apprehension about their own strategies it was a form of escape but if thats what george c scott as his troops called him was hoping for norton saw that simmet couldnt offer the general any encouragement by way of the weather in fact it was getting worse a sullen sky overcast enough to sock in any air cover for the outnumbered mas and harvey simmet said thered be no letup in the arctic storm for at least thirtysix hours its epicenter not yet having passed through the yakutsk region and if freeman thought anything including his prayers would change the weather in the next half hour harvey simmet knew the general was about to be bitterly disappointed all the incoming data told the same bleak story reaffirming his earlier forecasts even the khabarovsk relay printouts showed that temperatures were likely to drop into the minus sixties and below not unusual for oymyakon a town in the yakutsk oblast officially recognized as the coldest town on earth a town where minus ninety had been recorded freeman took the message sanguinely and as well as norton knew the general he didnt know whether this betokened superb acting resignation or resolve the thought of second army suffering the same terrible fate that had overtaken iii corps with over four thousand men slaughtered on the ice was too much for norton to contemplate and what would be the reaction back home the very thought of what the la roche tabloids would do to freeman to him to them all likewise didnt bear thinking about as norton and his most senior officers saw it this northern battle was quickly turning out to be freemans greatest risk so far and except for the second army armored column now heading south from skovorodino to the siberianchinese border awaiting the outcome of operation country market it constituted the spearhead of freemans entire army in the end norton knew it was a question of faith in the man a calculated risk based on past performance that he had not gone definitely and finally bonkers like some evangelical who though he was of the earth was not in it lost in a quiet reverie of past glory one general norton remembered had smilingly declined all help to cross the rhine no bother sarmajor hed said i shall walk across i have been sent the circulation of la roches tabloids throughout the world was skyrocketing once again the predicament of freemans second army on a tightrope between defeat and victory allowed la roches chain to make millions by describing the terrible arctic conditions under which freemans soldiers were about to fight the siberian spearhead rumbling south of yakutsk if freeman managed to pull it off which quite frankly neither la roche nor any of his tabloid editors believed he would then the papers could ring their hosannas and theyd make millions on the victory if he was defeated the prevailing opinion of the editors then it wouldnt be the siberian winter that was so much to blame but rather what their headlines would declare had been freemans folly the leader paragraphs and descriptions of second armys incompetence already in the word processors of every la roche paper either way la roche couldnt lose the only impediment to his high his only loss was lana brentwood from his manhattan penthouse he looked out upon the dazzling city much of which was owned by his asian conglomerates a fact unknown by the millions of americans over whose lives the conglomerates nevertheless had financial control buoyed by the prospect of setting yet higher circulation records la roche took a snort of angel dust felt the rush and right then and there determined it was time he made another takeover bid but he knew it mustnt look like that he turned about and spread the two headlines one for victory one for defeat that his new york editors had sent over by courier for his approval francine shuffling over in her mink slippers and carrying two bloody marys had never seen him so selfsatisfied whose side are you on she asked glancing at the headline my side said jay picking up the courier envelope and smacking her on the butt number one baby me he took her bloody mary from her and put it on the polished burl coffee table not now she said half pleading but trying not to look too annoyed that only made him mad hey he said and a moment later he was looking down at her kneeling before him the wispy negligee so transparent he could see it all you ever been to alaska no she said why because were going there thats why dutch harbor sounds cold it is its a berg then whats the big attraction asked francine swishing her auburn hair back my wife oh i dont wanna go youll do what youre told she knew she had no choice hed bought her and if she didnt like it he told her she could always go back to working bar for peanuts when are we going soon la roche chemicals says thanks to the boys and gals at the front all that shit hows that grab you she shrugged disinterestedly come on he told her brusquely pulling her face to his unbuttoned fly and for chrissakes watch your teeth chapter forty on a it was quite obvious to colonel soong despite the american propaganda what had taken place the enemy sasd teams landing on the mountain were sent in with the flying dragon to rescue the american gunners but instead when they found they could not stop the chinese attack they did the next best thing to hide their aggression from the world by removing all the dog tags from the american dead as he had found done on the american bodies ah but they had not had time to remove the incriminating evidence of the shoulder patches which he had sent back to beijing and which were being exhibited to the world to show that america was guilty of aggression of course the americans denied it and said that army patches could be bought by anyone from military surplus stores all over america and that they would be willing to let a neutral country verify this and examine whatever bodies were returned to them and of course the running dog lackeys of america such as canada and england on the security council supported the americans attempted coverup by what beijing rightly called the outright american imperialist lie chapter fortyone while robert brentwood began his twomile swim away from dennison toward the far side of the river colonel soong more than a thousand miles to the north was consolidating his capture of a from what he still believed had been an american battery he was determined that a with its panoramic view of the siberianchinese border would never again be taken by the enemy when the siberians had effected their pincer movement against the americans with their northern armored columns from yakutsk then beijing would claim this territory around a in the traditional buffer zone between china and siberia as chinas they had captured it it should now remain theirs a price that novosibirsk would surely cede to beijing in payment for the assistance that had been rendered them by the peaceloving chinese people against the american imperialists soong had tank traps dug around the entire tenmile base of a and radiating out from these there were more traps and antitank ditches for another thousand meters the weather was bad generally but good for such work little trouble from the odd us air force fighter patrols that dared to risk empty tanks at the outer perimeter of their defense zone west of khabarovsk besides the hard manual labor warmed the soldiers and as they carefully covered the traps with snowladen vegetation like soldiers anywhere they began to treat the traps as their own habitat the snow atop them even though no fires were permitted so as to prevent infrared emission to any us satellite overflights acted much like an igloo and so the deep tank traps became the best cover they could hope for along with their goretex sleeping bags the best the chinese army had ever seen purchased from the american firm of la roche the irony of american sleeping bags making it possible for the pla to better rest up and so kill americans if and when the counterattack came gave colonel soong the first good laugh hed had after his grueling twentyfourhouraday exertions making sure all the antitank fortifications were up to standard two miles south of a soong could hear a noise like that of insects climbing over a metal dish it was the sound of the reinforcement shenyang brigade deployed from harbin and amply supplied with the shoulderlaunched hna surfacetoair missiles and red arrow tubelaunched optically tracked wirecommand infrared antitank missiles these having a kill probability in excess of eightysix percent even if the weather broke and the americans managed to launch refuelinair attacks to drop napalm their most popular aerial weapon against high concentrations of ground troops they would have to come down five hundred meters or so in order to have the freetumbling petroleum gel pods hit the general target area and soong knew that one of the bestkept secrets of modern warfare certainly one not known by the general public was that any plane no matter how fast flying under a thousand meters into a phalanx of saturation smallcaliber highvelocity aa fire had no better than a fiftyfifty chance of survival and soong had such a phalanx of aa weapons including the nineandahalfounce thirtymillimeter fired from the plas mobile multiplebarreled tripodmounted turrets one quad of zsus capable of throwing up a near impenetrable shield of over rounds a minute the zsus ammunition for them purchased from la roche were so deadly that their fire was akin to ancient hunters letting clouds of mosquitoes and black flies swarm onto a galloping caribou until its mouth ears and anus were oozing with them and it finally fell from sheer exhaustion soong recalled how a us observer who had seen the chinese thirtymillimeter zsus in action earlier in the war in korea had in a mixed metaphor described how the quads had nickeled and dimed the fighters to death and only one or two bullets in a jet intake or in one of the black flybywire boxes would be enough soong started to relax with the arrival of the shenyang brigade a would be bristling with gun and sa missile quads for which the tank traps doubled as ideal cover bamboo ladders at the ready should the pla need to move out of them quickly in the event of a us armor attack for soong however it seemed doubtful the americans could muster the wherewithal to attack given that their general freeman was in for a surprise during the big tank fight looming in the yakutsk oblast and given that the logistical pipeline pouring weapons and food over the yangtze at nanking north to the shenyang army was still intact chapter fortytwo the twenty minute count over dennison surfaced in the dark shadow of one of the trusses his remington machineshotgun in his right hand his left reaching forward to tear off the plastic protector cap he found himself exactly where he wanted to be no more than thirty yards from piers one and two flicking down the infrared overlay goggles he could see rose and smythe still strapped to the railing above piers four and five the white blur of their body heat eerily present as a ghostly outline around their wet suits the radiant heat telling him they were still alive he lifted the remington its unfolded butt now pressing firmly but not too tightly in his shoulder the guns telescopic sight was filled with the huge white sun of the floodlight high above the concrete base of pier one deliberately shutting out the noise of the bridge so he could better concentrate dennison took a breath exhaled slightly stayed his breath and squeezed the trigger not even he heard the click but he felt the kick there was no explosion only the whoosh then tinkling sound of the floodlights glass disintegrating the light dying dennison gave a push with his right flipper lifted the gun again sighted pier twos light and fired the noiseless remington expelling nine bullets from a single buckshot casing taking out the second light leaving him six shots in the mag and seven lights to go now there was a lot of screaming up on the bridges top fourlane motor vehicle deck the first lights demise dennison thought probably being attributed by the chinese to a bulb going but two lights in a row had no doubt spurred the bridges guards into action yet they couldnt have heard any other sound than the splintering of glass dennison noted the distance to the next girder shadow cast by the trusses in front of lights three and four and once there only a matter of three minutes swimming he surfaced and took them out within ten seconds now the searchlights from the city side were probing frantically out through the mist crisscrossing one another but after a quarter mile the beams were eaten up by the mist the light too diffused producing phantom images of light on light one of which caused the pla gunners to blast away with rpgs and a barrage of small arms at two of their own tripwire platforms obviously mistaking the shapes for enemy boats from which the lightdestroying shots must be coming this allowed dennison who was on his fourth hail mary full of grace to get off his next two shots taking out lights five and six leaving him only two shots with lights seven eight and nine to go but as he took aim at the seventh a wash wave perhaps from a patrol boat midriver slopped over him knocking him off aim at the precise moment he pulled the trigger his last shot took seven out cleanly this left him with an empty chamber with lights eight and nine still on and the other seven out most of the southern side of me bridge was in utter darkness anyway except for the pinpoints of flashlights frantically dashing back and forth like fireflies on the top deck by then robert brentwood had reached the logjam of black shapes the riverine craft that had been held up before the bridge and which were now tethered to the right bank taking the load of the explosives off him by tethering one end of the explosive line to the keel guard of the propane barge the other end to his weight belt it was easy for him to do a chinup on the stern rub water dripped from the mm minigun slung around his neck as he hauled himself over the stern and crouched on the mistslippery deck every muscle taut he could hear two voices approaching the stern on the narrow walkway that ran alongside the flatroofed bamboo wheelhouse quickly he slithered back over the stern holding on to the prop guard as he submerged his head about a foot or so underwater directly below the prop the voices above him were muffled but he could still hear them and then another sound a sprinkling above his head then more of it the two chinese continuing to talk as they urinated off the stern in a few moments they were gone and he was back up and over drawing his kbar knife from its ankle sheath through the slats of bamboo he could dimly see a small coal fire like a ruby heart in the darkness a man squatting beside it brewing tea the other man was still walking forward disappearing on the catwalk a couple of feet above the decking of the barge between the two huge cigarshaped tanks which brentwood guessed were about thirty feet long and ten feet in diameter he knew earmuff charges alone would have been enough to weaken a pier if he could have climbed up on the bridge to place them the idea had been that shock waves from either side of the pier meeting then rebounding would have stretched the molecular structure of the concrete to its limit but there wouldnt have been enough elasticity in the concrete to take the shock resulting in a fracture but with echo two gone rose and smythe prisoners surprise had been lost he and dennison wouldnt get onto the base of the concrete piers let alone high enough above them to place the earmuffs what he needed was to cut the trusses as with an oxyacetylene torch use the c plastique as a primary charge to raise the propane to its flashpoint making his way quietly forward by walking around the starboard stern walkway brentwood felt for the stern line his knife cutting its hemp with surprising speed as if it was string the man in the wheelhouse immediately felt the slight shift the barge yawning slowly out from the bank the man no doubt alert to every nuance in the barges movement as he turned about and stepped outside of the bamboo wheelhouse to investigate brentwoods left arm closed quickly the mans hands instinctively coming up to pull brentwoods arm from his neck leaving his chest completely exposed into which brentwood drove the kbar to its hilt and twisted sharply before he lowered the man to the deck quickly almost slipping on the blood he moved up toward the dark crevice between the propane tanks and saw the other man coming back toward him the man called out something chow mein said brentwood the man stopped then turned but brentwood was already on him the mans body hitting the slick decking hard for a moment brentwood feared hed broken the mans neck but he was only winded gasping for air and dissuaded from yelling by brentwoods bloodwarmed knife against his throat the man was rigid with fright brentwood lifted him up turned him about swiftly slamming him belly first against the side of the port tank and within four seconds had a slip knot of primacord tying the mans wrists behind his back next taking him by the collar brentwood steered him up toward the bow the bowline now extremely taut cracking and creaking as the barge strained to be free as he cut each strand it protested with an anguished spitting and splitting then just as quickly the big barge was floating out into the channel bow swinging out slowly caught by the eddies at the periphery of the main channels current someone in front of the barge shouted up from a small sampan and the shouting became a tirade then other sampan skippers joined in cursing the barge and its turtle owner as the barges wash if not its sheer bulk threatened to swamp them invisible in his black wet suit brentwood took the man into the bamboo deckhouse lashed him to the tiller spar then just as rapidly hauled up the bag of explosives from beneath the prop guard he heard a voice yelling aft of the barge and another huo yelled brentwood next to pijiu beerit was the most important phrase for any us serviceman in prewar china huo brentwood yelled again fire there was pandemonium suddenly the long traffic jam of riverine vessels came alive the shouts of huo galvanizing every chinese throughout the long string of backedup craft frantically vessels began casting off terrified they might get caught in the fire the sampans nearest the propane barge using their long stern oars as well as the puttputting motors that were coughing awake trying to put as much distance between them and the barge as possible but it was chaos as sampans collided with other sampans and junks the air filled with accusation counteraccusation and ancestral insults both in mandarin and cantonese the docile water was slapped with jettisoned tether lines under the orders of the pla guards themselves running about confused on the riverbank screaming orders to the boat owners many of whom instructed the guards to perform acts that were anatomically impossible the extent of the confusion was a bonus that robert brentwood hadnt counted on but one he felt the seals were due for after the disastrously unlucky beginning of operation country market standing by the man at the wheel gripping his arm in a half nelson cutting him loose brentwood held him under the threat of the knife and directed him to start the barges engine the man nodded furiously with a string of imprecations which brentwood took to be a plea for his life once the huge barge was under way nosing out under its own power the cursing from the motley flotilla trying to escape through the darkness rose to a frenzy as the sheer bulk of the barge overruled any questions as to who had right of way to add a touch of authenticity to his shouts of huo brentwood tore a rag strip off the hang curtain from the wheelhouses sleeping compartment stuffed it into a large tsingtao beer bottle of cooking oil by the stove lit it and tossed it astern there was a small whoof as it exploded a flash of light and a sampan afire it was now definitely huo what had merely been angry profanity rose with hysterical urgency all down the line and in the added mayhem brentwood indicated to the bargeman exactly where to steer the man nodded again talking quickly not one word of which brentwood understood but the mans terrified tone revealed a universal language it said youre in charge whatever you say as the barge entered the channel proper brentwood heard a dull thud then a slight vibration a junk rammed amidships followed by a string of obscenities in the dark night made blacker by the moon now being totally socked in by cumulonimbus the pla on the bank were shooting in the air not knowing exactly who was responsible for the sudden exodus in direct violation of their orders but none of the shots was aimed at the sampans junks and especially not at the propane barge one shot into either of the tanks and the ensuing blast in its heat alone would be the closest thing to an abomb going off that nanking had seen in its thousands of years on the yangtze brentwood tapped the mm minigun about his neck and gestured the man to move away from the wheel or hed get it after already losing the four men of echo two to the chinese and seeing rose and smythe tied up on the bridge brentwood was in no mood for half measures on the bridge itself off to the left a quarter mile downstream black squares army trucks were pulling up blocking oncoming traffic from either side searchlights mounted on their flatboards the beams now beginning to sweep over the water around the concrete piers and upon the dozens of boats farther aft heading toward the bridge or more specifically toward the two deep channels between piers four and six collisions continued on the way but the puttputting of the twostroke motors kept up with what would have struck brentwood as a comic insistence had it not been for the task and dangers that lay ahead of him there was another bump then another more obscenities but the barge moved inexorably toward the bridge slowly at first then like a monster possessed as it caught the full thrust of the current smacking aside any craft that was so impudent as to get in its way then everything changed dennison seeing the barge on its way had dived and was already on his way downstream jettisoning all equipment save the browning ninemillimeter automatic pistol and gps with which he would rendezvous at the grid reference pickup point two miles downriver on the western bank as agreed on by him and brentwood if brentwood managed to carry it off the gps should bring him within a hundred feet of dennison dennison had been under way only two minutes submerged and beneath the bridge when he heard the muffled drone of a loudspeaker coming from the vehicular deck or perhaps it was from the lower railway deck the noise being too indistinct to betray its exact point of origin on the barge robert brentwood had no such difficulty in hearing the loudspeaker the pla interpreter shouting that the two prisoners tied to the rail would be beheaded in ten minutes unless all american commandos surrendered chapter fortythree whats the forecast harvey simmet redeyed from fatigue which gave his face a peculiar rodentlike stare glared at norton as if he was to blame it was misdirected anger at the general anger for asking what harvey called the fucking forecast for the fourth fucking time in the last fucking hour harvey simmet snatched the latest computer printout from the isobar printer and took it through to freeman storms still heading south general gusts to sixty kilometers per hour and rising visibility near zero the temperature harv the temperature minus fifty general and falling thank you yes general as simmet walked away freeman turned to norton dick i think harveys a bit pissed off oh it was so painfully obvious to norton that he didnt know whether the general was kidding him or not norton had no time to decide for the next order freeman gave him was a shock radio our tank commanders burst code to fire then to fall back ten miles and go into defilade positions when i go up there i dont want to be able to see one turret tell them to camouflage the guns with snow netting if the snow lets up which it doesnt look like it will fall back general something the matter with your hearing dick no general but youve never now dick tell em to fall back what in hell did freeman think he was doing norton wondered as he took down the pad and pencil for the numberforletter burst code he knew it would be nearly impossible to hide every one of the ms if the siberians forward patrols were to spot even one or two hidden behind the snowbanks experienced siberian scouts would be sure to guess that there were many more around and before the ms could move hundreds of ts would be all over them for these troops who had been brought up on the legend of freeman as the swift attacker of pyongyang and the unstoppable general whod kept pressing home the offensive against ratamanov island despite appalling losses and won the fallback order smacked of impending defeat and wasnt it freeman who had preached that withdrawal is the first step to disaster the enemy he had said can smell it and it spreads like a great fart across the battlefield gets em riled eager for the kill ten minutes later freeman got the report from his forward patrols that the siberian tanks had split up into echelons of five eighty feet between them in line abreast the classic attack formations that the siberians had used earlier in the war swarming through fulda gap freeman sent dick norton back to what he called harvey simmets cubbyhole for the latest outside temperature as reported by the men who were now hurriedly retreating to defilade positions behind either already existing snowdrifts or any fallen timber they might find close to hand some of the m tank crews with the rapid sarcasm troops the world over can call up for even the most popular leaders were already calling freeman digin doug no one liked to be a sitting target norton returned from the met room sir major simmets indisposed what hes on the can taken the met printout with him apparently well get him off the can dick hes the best goddamned met officer weve got and i want him to tell me the forecast yes sir when norton entered the latrine module a series of prefabricated stalls he could hear the wind and snow beating wildly against the aluminum exterior when he saw simmets feet and told him the general wanted another forecast harvey jerked the chain so hard it came right off the s arm jesus tell him its fucking cold and going to get colder bellowed simmet cmon harv it was the general how colds that when norton turned to face the general freeman winked at him gesturing toward the cubicle wherein there was a furious unraveling of paper you say something harv norton was starting to get worried it wasnt uncommon for commanders to come a bit unglued albeit temporarily under extreme stress schwarzkopf could lose his temper blow a gasket at times freeman dealt with the pressure by trying to be the far east jay leno but any hope of a joke with simmet died as the outside door slammed it was a messenger coming in from signals a forward american observation post was reporting that the spearhead echelons of the siberian tank army were less than seven miles away from the dugin ms harvey simmet pulling his trousers up was reading off the printout snow gusts increasing to one hundred kilometers sixty miles per hour general visibility zero not zero visibility for infrared and laser sights harvey freeman commented theyve got infrared sights and laser too general freeman said nothing but his frown told harvey that jay leno was gone for the night coming out of the cubicle harvey looked apprehensively at norton for reassurance that freeman hadnt miscalculated norton couldnt give him any temperature freeman asked simmet simmet dropped the printout in a puddle of melted snow by the urinal as he was lifting his suspenders he cussed minus fiftyfive going to get worse he warned looking up at norton norton ordered freeman signal all commanders to fall back another ten miles norton didnt argue he didnt know what to think it made sense to withdraw given the odds but that wasnt the generals style was freeman finally seeing the light or had jay leno metamorphosized into duckaway doug watching the vertical and crisscrosstrussed girders of the lower railway deck coming at him like huge xs in the darkness truckback floodlights above them on the vehicular deck robert brentwood took off his mae west vest cut the chinese bargeman free pulled the cartridge on the mae west handed the inflated vest to the man and gestured back over his shoulder to the river the man was off the stern in three seconds brentwood heard the faint splash even amid the babble and excited yells on the nanking bridge and all around him in the jumbled bumping of sampans and junks caught in the wash of the searchlights scattered every which way putting as much distance between them and the oncoming barge as possible fifty yards from the channel between piers four and five he reached over to the rope trailing from the barges capstan and jerked out the holding bolt the resulting run of the anchor chain sounding like a dump truck upending a load of marbles now there was a splitting sound that grew rapidly a volley of gunfire aimed at the bamboo housing but well aft of the propane tanks in the plas desperate attempt to stop what they now realized was a boat with american commandos aboard the barges bow struck the pier and shuddered its stern swinging about pivoting on the anchor chain the stem bashing into the concrete midway under the bridge along the base of pier four the barge was now completely covered by the rail decking above it the small arms fire ceasing because of the danger of ricocheting off the crisscross trusses into the propane tanks brentwood had determined that to spend time trying to rescue either rose or smythe would be to jeopardize the whole mission and against impulse had to weigh the lives of thousands of americans that lay in the balance to the north should the nanking bridge not be blown he pulled the tenminute acidampule timer but then with heartstopping suddenness he realized that with the plas fear of firing down at him for fear of hitting the tanks he had a sudden chance albeit a short one as he climbed off the barge onto the narrow maintenance ladder running from pier fives base to the rail decking and the vehicular deck above it a roaring like another great river entering the yangtze could be heard off to his right the glaring headlight of a northbound goods train starting across the bridge halfway up the ladder his left hand on a rung he swung the mini machine hard right firing from the hip several of the long bursts crashing into the trains headlamp denying the pla any clear sight of him immediately above rose he saw several pla figures silhouetted against the rail he fired another burst and cut rose loose as the pla clambered over the rail still too frightened to shoot but determined to exact a price go go it was smythe yelling tied high above pier four off to the left cheering them on cmon hissed brentwood rose following him down the ladder above the propane tank so quickly that his muscles stiff from having been tied up rose almost fell his left heel smashing into brentwoods nose with only three minutes to go before the acid ampule would eat through the primacord igniting the charges brentwood went back up the ladder another two rungs putting himself above the level of the passing train its hot slipstream buffeting him he saw three black figures on the northern side ladder under the bridge and fired a long burst two men fell their screams barely audible above the rush of the goods train one body bouncing off a boxcar into the girders the other falling into the river over a hundred feet below the moment they hit the barge deck brentwood handed rose his penlight rendezvous point with dennison two miles down the river if we get separated head for the west shore one flash ill respond with two ten seconds apart got it got it suddenly the train was gone and in the half slice of a flashlights beam on a girder brentwood saw two more pla figures fifty feet above him he fired a burst saw one slump and holding the gun tightly to his chest dove off feeling the cold current moving him swiftly downriver feet kicking as he submerged more powerfully than in the most rigorous training session immediately in the underwater blackness he made for his left where the current would carry him to the west bank for several seconds time raced as he tried to make as much distance between him and the barge as possible waiting for the sound of the detonation then it seemed as if minutes had passed that something had gone wrong that the primacord had there was a tremendous flash of orange light turning night into day the barge going up in a feral roar lifted ten feet out of the water flames from it shooting hundreds of feet high engulfing the two spans between piers four and six the ball of fire a quarter mile across quickly narrowing about its central concentrated core beneath what seconds before had been cold steel but which was now plasticized brentwood could hear the steel groaning starting to cave in dropping then toppling like some enormous playdoh lego set just behind him in fact swept down by the swiftly moving current he was already a quarter mile from it still the shock wave of the explosion hit him like a baseball bat in the small of the back and a moment later his body was literally surfed toward the downstream shore by a series of fivetoeightfoot waves radiating from the explosion he could see the river crimson behind him its turbulent surface reflecting variegated colors the blues and orange of the burning propane eating into the curling thick black smoke that was tumbling over the water through it here and there he saw that not only the space between piers four and five but that between five and six had sagged buckled and come apart pieces of them still falling into the river in a hissing stream and he knew that smythe was dead vaporized in the fiercest fire hed ever seen mars mars mars radioed dennison his message immediately picked up by the pave low as it banked hard south toward the gps coordinates the moment he finished the message and heard fire delay flare he pulled the flare from his pack stuck it into the mud at a thirtydegree angle and pulled the cord it hissed off the delay seven seconds its chute opening two hundred yards farther downriver the flare beginning its flickering mauve burnoff the delay a safety precaution to divert the pla away from the actual rendezvous point which it was hoped would give brentwood time to rendezvous in fact it was rose he saw brentwood nowhere in sight set aussie david brentwood yelled over the thunder of the rotors set right sal you and choir cover fire from the chopper right the pave lows electronic wizardry didnt fail as its automatic fix took it down to a hundred then a bare fifty feet above a marshy levee for it to go lower and risk a wind shear in the unstable air currents from the fire would be to risk slamming down or getting bogged within two seconds aussie and david brentwood were rappeling down two of the five dangerously swinging stabo lines dennison put himself in the spring harness at the end of one of the stabo lines and rose did the same thats it yelled aussie anybody else yeah called out dennison having no way of knowing he was talking to the brother of robert brentwood and making no effort to lower his voice under the roar of the paves blades the boss david brentwood knew it was up to him now they saw more searchlights frantically sweeping through the smoke south of the burning midsection of the bridge at least two patrol boats could be heard david couldnt risk it this was where the speed of a stabo extraction was worth every penny of the taxpayers money in harness aussie he ordered but in harness david shouted aussie took a firm stand to snap on his harness and fell down his injured foot having given way we can wait a began dennison david shouted into his throat mike lets go cmon aussie there was a delay of another ten seconds before aussie was in harness but with that done the pave climbed as slowly as possible but in a steep almost hovering angle the jerk would be abrupt when it came and even as the men braced for it they knew the spring stabo links wouldnt cushion them from possible injury if they didnt do it right without an order they stood close to one another linked arms each mans fingers interlocked in front of him as if in solemn prayer and bowed their heads pulling firmly on one anothers elbows waiting to be literally lifted off their feet once the slack on the stabo lines had been taken up there was a grunting slopping noise behind them dennison felt something gripping his ankle trying to pull him back and he kicked hard with the other foot and heard a crunch of bone suddenly the stabo lines lurched forward with a gutwrenching sensation the cold wind hit them and then they collectively felt the steady tug of the five wires that attached to the brace of harnesses being hauled up were making a singing noise in the wind as their linked bodies swept forward into the void there wasnt a shot fired in their direction or if so they couldnt hear it the chaos on and about the bridge so panicridden and smokefilled that they were away and being pulled one by one inside the pave by choir williams and salvini most of whose effort was taken up hauling the last man in who was not in harness but hanging on to dennisons legs like a very heavy rag doll within five minutes well below the radar screen they were on their way back to salt lake city no one spoke everyone utterly exhausted save for the crew of the pave who now gave the craft full throttle their side gunners still alert should they be unlucky enough to give off a radar echo or two and it wasnt until they were low north of the yangtzes wide estuary that anyone least of all dennison realized robert brentwood was aboard but unable to declare himself his jaw and nose broken by dennisons vicious back kick thereafter dennison would be forever known as stomper dennison temperatures minus sixty general reported a weary harvey simmet the change in freeman was to be remembered by norton and simmet and indeed everyone in their hq for a long time and was to become part of the freeman legend weve got the sons of bitches declared freeman by god norton full attack hit em no one understood it for a minute or two several of the officers in the buzzing hq signals hut quite frankly thinking freeman had flipped his lid but later even norton conceded that he should have known that freemans attention to detail which bordered on the compulsiveobsessive was about to deal a crushing defeat against the siberian tanks well pressed one bemused captain whats it all about the temperature i guess said harvey simmet so what the hell is it asked the captain minus sixty answered simmet no christ i mean whats what happens at minus sixty the old man grows horns becomes invincible or what what the shits going on captain in the babble of the communications hut the captain hadnt been aware that freeman had overheard him yes sir sorry general i you get my goddamn humvee around here and fast youre about to get an education son yes general you coming dick asked freeman looking remarkably reassured confident now that his tank commanders would do the rest do i have any choice general no you coming along harvey i think ill sit it out back here general its gonna get a lot colder hotter harv hotter as they took off in the humvee armored cars fore and aft a tow missile launcher atop the humvees cabin norton couldnt believe the intensity of the cold with the heaters full blast there was only a fourinchdiameter halfmoon clearing in the windscreen through which they could see the rest a sheet of ice already he felt his toes were going into frostbite though he knew as long as he could at least feel them there was no immediate danger of that by god norton said freeman harvey looks like hell you watch him when we get back make sure he gets more sleep valuable man harvey as norton spoke beneath his balaclava he swore his breath was turning to ice particles before his words were out it wasnt simply a victory for freeman it was the slaughter of the entire siberian armored division and within forty minutes norton had seen why the ts and the little surprise colonel soong had known about over seventy ts with upgunned mm cannon also with laser sighting were stilled sitting ducks while the mas broke cover bursting forth like wild animals from snowladen lairs careening and wheeling and wheeling back again at over fifty miles an hour and with unerring precision belched flame and shot most of it apds armorpiercing discarding sabot the projectiles hitting the siberian tanks at over six thousand feet per second often puncturing a hole only a few centimeters across but through that hole came a molten jet of whitehot metal that spraying inside the tank created injuries and explosions unimaginable to any but the american gunners and tank crews who saw the ts and ts buck snow flying off them like white flour then engulfed in red blackstreaked flames many of the tanks still a moment before were suddenly jolted by the heat moving some forward some backward spewing sparks and lavalike flows as their ammunition stores exploded the human and matériel detritus bubbling forth from the moving carcasses of what were once five hundred of the siberians crack main battle tanks the reason long ago americans whose names were not known who had attended to the dull analytical side of war and who were driven by the demons of perfection and department of defense specifications specifications in this case insisted upon by none other than freeman himself had produced lubricants for the ma that would not freeze or more accurately lubricants in which the waxes would not separate out and like cholesterol in the blood clog the vital hydraulic arteries of the worlds best main battle tank it was a tank that thanks to american knowhow would keep running to temperatures below minus sixty degrees at which point the siberian tanks good enough in themselves simply shuddered and stopped the petroleum waxes because of more crudely refined oil thick in their blood with only the implosions of the american mm shells which killed them capable of heating them up enough to move harvey simmet forgave freeman for disturbing his peace on the can for when the temperature had fallen below fifty and showed no sign of easing up freeman knew all hed had to do was wait it was the kind of american cando knowhow that allowed johnny ferrago and the other sandhogs to dig the third tunnel under manhattan chapter fortyfour with the nanking bridge knocked out the effect was not felt in the north for another three days during which the southern arm of freemans second army readied themselves for counterattack in the vicinity of a but if it took three days for colonel soong to see the stream of ammunition and food slow to a trickle the effect of the americans having taken out the vital crossing across the yangtze was felt within hours in harbin if the american commandos could strike that deep in china from their carriers in the east china sea then chen argued to his harbin cell of the june fourth democracy movement it should not be too long before the americans would drive south from the siberianchinese border so that now would be the opportune moment for the harbin underground to strike it would be a signal and example to all the underground movements in china to rise for as he pointed out something the american commandos could not have known was the enormous symbolic power of the nanking bridge quite apart from the vital strategic importance that the bridge had held for the chinese communists its spans across the mighty yangtze joining north and south after the revolution had been touted by the communists as the joining of old enemies of two chinas into one a communist china ever after now the link between the two chinas the northerners and the southerners had been broken what do you propose chens comrades asked him the jail he said to get the siberian out asked another not particularly enthusiastic about risking his neck for any long nose to get our friend out responded chen it will be dangerous living is dangerous comrades she is our friend chen said it to save face even so he was lying they were all lying a long nose was a long nose and in their view would not stand up to torture as well as chinese friendship was not enough to move them the truth he knew was that if the public security bureau broke her if she talked die harbin chapter of the democratic movement and their own escape line through manchuria should they need it would be finished chen gave them another reason that they should act we should begin to sabotage start the fire here comrades in harbin the americans will now push south harbin is the first major city in their path of liberation and what if the americans dont attack asked a comrade if this freeman doesnt come through he will answered chen the bridge is gone and now we hear the siberians have suffered a major defeat in the north around baikal which will leave the americans free to turn all their forces south against our border and push the pla back there was a show of hands chen won the vote his plan was simple they would pretend drunkenness and call on chens brotherinlaw wong wongs a turtle said someone against this grievous insult there was no defense from chen wong was indisputably a turtle but he could help chen told them how we will ask him to show us this crazy foreigner who eats her own shit chapter fortyfive in harbin they would call it the night of the west wind for the pla guards on duty at harbin number one jail however it would be the night of the hornets for the democracy movement guerrillas swarmed all about them like a wild sea and seemed to be everywhere at once within minutes of wong having selfimportantly opened the door to show off his power and to show his brotherinlaw the foreign devil who ate her own excrement the guerrillas were upon them in a kind of fearful ferocity and the already grimy yellowbricked walls of the police station were streaked in blood harbin was shaken to its core and within an hour of the attack the pla had rallied sufficiently to be scouring the streets in an outburst of officially sanctioned panic and revenge the death knell of several guerrillas being the fact that to distinguish one another in the melee they had used cheaply dyed neck kerchiefs whose blue dye ran easily under the heat of their perspiration so that even though they had taken the kerchiefs off a stain mark was left on their necks less than half of the arrested as democracy movement terrorists and enemies of the people actually belonged to the democracy movement the others having been people both men and women unable or unwilling to account for their whereabouts to local granny committees or to the investigating police several were beheaded in public executions for no other reason than a cheaply dyed shirt had left a blue stain on their skin ling and his wife were immediately taken out and shot in the tiny exercise yard the bullets deliberately not aimed at their spinal cords so as to have them bleed to death over a number of hours their small boy was sent the next day for adoption to shanghai but with it being known that he was the offspring of enemies of the state no one would have him he was then sent to the fourteenth reform school for thought correction but if chen had predicted success in the raid on the jail then his prediction that freeman would immediately drive south couldnt have been more wrong freeman his second army now casting all its attention southward was on the verge of just such a massive counterattack on a and beyond when beijing seeing the writing on the wall sued for a ceasefire in the un on the grounds that as they told the people the enemy imperialist aggressors on a have been repelled at the border and we are satisfied the freedomloving peoples of china are not warmongers and now that a lesson has been taught to the aggressors the chinese people wish to normalize relations without chinese support on their eastern flank and with the massive defeat of their armor out of yakutsk novosibirsk quickly joined communist china in asking for peace talks washington readily agreed to a ceasefire at midnight in the southernmost part of the lake around kultuk general minskys troops only hours before exultant over having helped rout the american iii corps were defiant to the end their feeling of having been denied a victory because of yesovs failure to hold in the north was further inflamed by the news of the severing of the nanking bridge minsky was hard put and indeed did little to discipline his troops after having looted the american dead they were now withdrawing back through the taiga like a plague a company of them occupying their southernmost flank position sought to vent their anger and frustrations on anything and everything in their path one such target was the small house in the woods near kultuk that minsky had used as a firecontrol point they burned it to the ground and then moved to the next target major truets charlie company where private thomis was dug in with the others waiting for a helo evac that had been hampered by the midair collision of two black hawk choppers one of which would have taken out thomis who now stood in the bloodsoaked ice of his foxhole though injected with morphine for the pain and fully conscious thomis was unable to move his right leg because of his selfinflicted wound which the medic and truet and the others around him had quite reasonably believed had come from an enemy bullet during the earlier siberian helo attack after the first attack wave of minskys company against charlie companys foxholes and trenches near the tunnels the siberians were beaten back but charlie company was left with no more than fiftytwo men out of what had originally been a hundred several abdominal cases having priority over thomis and others in the preceasefire evacuation now under way now it was thomiss turn but the taiga a hundred yards in front began trembling snow sliding down the thickly laden branches from the reverberations of the siberians machine guns amid all this smoke flares were being fired for cover by the siberians even as evac helos arrived in an effort to take out the last of charlie company thomis had to help himself out of the foxhole brooklyn and the man from georgia both dead in foxholes nearby thomis using his m as a staff to haul himself out with his left foot but exhausted at the top lying panting like a whipped dog in the snow trying to catch his breath long enough to hobble his way to the nearest helo as the siberian company broke cover under flare light and closed for the kill a section of eight or nine of them though white figures in the white smoke nevertheless cast long dark shadows spearing toward the nearest loading helo thomis knew that one good bullet in the right place and the helo would be out of operation and from the darkness beyond the flare light he opened up at twenty yards downing two of the siberians the others diving for cover behind the wreckage of one of the earlier disabled choppers there was a sharp crack by his ear but thomis had already tossed two grenades at the downed helos carcass the first going wide blowing up snow and dirt the second exploding in a purple crash by the helo whose wreckage suddenly spewed rivers of flame two of the siberians rising afire at fifteen yards thomis couldnt have missed them if hed tried the other four or five siberians heading back to the taiga jesus someone yelled at the helo now loading its litters with the last of the wounded look at thom thomis was glimpsed in the smoke for a second changing magazines having tried to hobble toward the chopper hed found he couldnt do it the next moment he saw emory the black man moaning his dark face shiny with blood draining down his left side can you walk yelled thomis firing from the hip into a new rush of siberians from the taiga trying to get close with their wildly spraying automatic kalashnikovs he heard the whack of several bullets hitting the chopper and was filled with panic that if the chopper bought it hed be left behind get up goddamn you he yelled at emory emory was on his knees blood still dripping from him dazed unsure of what was going on go on get up goddamn it move your ass commanded thomis the black man rose and thomiss right arm wrapped itself about his shoulder emory would be his transport using the butt of the m as a walking stick they limped toward the chopper fell got up again and now the chopper was rising into swirling smoke its litters full arms and legs sticking out of it from every angle it was so crammed with bodies several siberians were charging through the smoke thomis fired again from the hip saw one man literally thrown back another go down face forward into the snow the third literally shot to pieces by thomiss last clip suddenly another man appeared on thomiss left the smoke clearing because of the downdraft of the slowly rising chopper the siberians kalashnikov aiming up at the chopper when thomis with one hop brought his m around like a baseball bat knocking the man off his feet and falling on his face butt first at this point the helo dangerously overloaded barely managed to make its turn away toward the lake and the last thing truet and the other evacuees on the chopper saw was thomis yelling something up at them fist raised defiantly the siberians had had enough and moved on to irkutsk all that later historians would note about the small action at a place called the kultuk tunnels was that americans had come under repeated siberian attacks during a lastminute evacuation nothing was mentioned in the historical account because no one knew that thomis had shot himself in the foot in the hopes of being one of the first wounded taken out but had in fact been one of the last along with emory major truet had been told at west point never to exaggerate a mans exploits when writing him up for a commendation that battleexperienced officers could smell a puff job a mile away and so he simply wrote what he saw as the truth namely that private first class john d thomis of charlie company second battalion us iii corps had despite sustaining a leg wound from the enemy and being under repeated attacks by the enemy on c company positions not only held his ground but in the best traditions of the service had thrown himself into the breach fighting off repeated attempts of the siberians who were trying to destroy the helicopter evacuating his comrades private thomis had kept firing until he ran out of ammunition at which point he used his rifle itself as a weapon in closequarter combat securing precious seconds during which the helo with his comrades aboard could take off for his valor at the kultuk tunnels private first class thomis was awarded the silver star only emory his head swathed in bandages now and some said still suffering from concussion opined shit that son of a bitch couldnt walk to the chopper thats why he was shootin where he was man otherwise hed have been the first son of a bitch on the huey bullshit they told emory thomis had the mm slug that had penetrated his foot it was siberian all right shit countered emory there was enough bullets on the ground for you to start a collection son of a bitch couldnt walk so he tried usin me as his goddamned crutch i got to be the nigger again man it made no difference the la roche tabloids were making thomis a hero the photograph on page one showed him in alaska dutch harbor the first stop on his repatriation home smiling broadly his leg in an impressive cast which seemed to reach out to you from the picture and with an enormous cigar given him by a smiling douglas freeman before thomis had left siberia it was the only smile the general had given anyone that day freeman was so angry norton thought he would selfdestruct there were only ten hours till the official ceasefire went into effect by god those bastards in washington are doing it to me again i swear to god norton if you were getting laid and hear climax those sons of bitches would tell you to stop my god dont they understand his right fist slammed into the map of manchuria badly denting the area around manzhouli and causing a red rain of chicom unit position pins to fall to the floor those ricesucking jokers in beijing have no intention of withdrawing not caring that a group of reporters who had suddenly materialized like rabbits from the warren upon word of the ceasefire were entering the hq hut freeman whipped off his reading glasses jabbing them at the line mat marked the siberianchinese border cant they read a goddamn map in washington these chinks have no intention of relinquishing the territory theyve taken from second army isnt it uh siberian soil general asked a correspondent from the london times no by god its ours we paid for it at skovorodino and baikal or have you forgotten we the americans kept the siberianchinese border intact why hadnt been for us thered be no border chinesed have moved in ages ago but general interrupted the paris match correspondent wasnt the a incident started by the siberians who were there how do you make it out to be american it was a trap but freeman saw it immediately the reporter trying to get him to say it was americans who had started the fighting given that he said the area had been won and paid for by americans its american because we lost good men on that damn mountain special forces thats why good men sir it was the stunning redhead from cbs general does this mean you have no intention of ceding a and the surrounding areas to the chinese one more question interjected norton quickly giving his warning glance to the general giving freeman a second or two to think about his career as well as the political implications of a no answer which would in effect be going directly against the president i began freeman am going to obey my orders as general schwarzkopf did norton felt the tension draining out of him it was a brilliant answer under pressure at once making it clear that he would obey the president yet it was politically obscure enough schwarzkopf having had to withhold his impulse to pursue the withdrawing iraqi army because of the presidential order and in so doing allowing saddam insane to begin rebuilding his entire army both during and after the ceasefire which was precisely what freeman was afraid the chinese would do rebuild the bridge and start shunting divisions massing them all along the manchuriansiberian border from a eastward what wasnt so brilliant of freeman what norton hadnt been able to run interference for was when freeman going full bore had used the word chinks instead of chinese jay la roche loved it on his private jet en route to dutch harbor to see lana who was playing at nurse as he derisively put it to francine he shook his head with undisguised glee at the headline his tabloids had seized chinks liars charges freeman ceasefire off to rocky start the fact that when the tabloids hit the streets in the us there were still eight hours till midnight precisely until the ceasefire would actually begin and the special mandate of the emergency powers act would be rescinded was lost amid the outcry of every minority group in america they charged that freeman protected by the emergency powers act had shown his true colors indulging in racism and bigotry with the naïveté that often coinhabits genius freeman frequently underrated the wiliness of the press he had no such prejudice against the chinese and had meant no harm said he meant no harm he recanted indeed he told the press how highly he respected the chinese as a civilization a great people by god first ones to invent gunpowder norton nearly had a stroke the moment freeman said it and had to corral the female correspondent from the la times who had heard the remark to tell her that if she used the gunpowder quote shed never again receive press accreditation anywhere in the far east theater will i need it again she challenged shrewdly well miss norton had replied completely unashamed of his outright act of censorship what do you think the chinese will do during the ceasefire go home to beijing are you saying this is a yugoslavian ceasefire she asked smiling norton gave a noncommittal shrug your phrase not mine look at the map he said casually what would you do if you were the chi norton general pardon me for interrupting miss but you can hear this too weve reports coming in from baikal that some siberian fighter aircraft havent got the message about the ceasefire theres been reports of strafing i have to go and talk with this this chinese joker at a goddamn colonel i wont go till they have a threestar commander there the bastards he looked at the reporter and thats offtherecord which part general the strafing or the threestar bit he forced a grin the threestar bit dont want people back home to think im proud what i am proud of is my boys a lie and a truth in one sentence thought the correspondent he was proud of his boys but as vain as any manchu that had sat on the peacock throne ill just report that enemy elements are still elementshell theyre migs and theyre shooting at my boys are the reports reliable general hell yes weve got sat pics of them rising from forward fields around irkutsk it was another halftruth though the general didnt realize it the siberians were still fighting but they werent strafing what they were doing was trying to shoot all the marsdenmatting forward air strips being laid down at a frantic rate by seabees flown in under freemans orders from khabarovsk the general was doing a little lastminute reinforcing himself indeed while he was talking to the correspondent in response to an awac report that four of yesovs mig fulcrums were flying in diamond formation over baikal a nineplane mission of bs from nayoro under his orders with midairrefueled f strikers were flying high feet above the aa missile envelope toward lake baikal sleduyte menya follow me intoned sergei marchenko in the usual calm devilmaycare voice that had become as legendary as his fulcrums yankee killer motif suddenly caught in a series of buffeting air pockets his left wing dipped and just as quickly his tetka auntie as he called his rechevaya instruktsiya or voice guidance system came on telling him to correct the yaw yes sweetheart he responded heard a bang and felt his right wing going he was in a spin the sound and sight of black smudges against the blue told him that hed been hit orange speckles of american aa could be seen erupting from the blackishgreen taiga that was spinning up at him at a frightening rate in eight gs the crushing pressure on his chest feeling like a locomotive rolling over on him marchenko involuntarily gasped for air his wing man hearing him on the intercom disorientated in the spin marchenko punched the krasnuyu knopku chpred panic button on his control column but it couldnt stop the spin he hit another series of air pockets the spin momentarily decreasing finally managing to reach down between his legs he felt the rubber loop and pulled he heard the bang of the eject rocket felt the jerk was thrown two hundred feet into the air heard another bang the small drogue chute out slowing him then the main chute opened the ejection seat dropping away from him his chute a black mushroom in the late evenings ceruleanblue the americans not shooting at him as he floated down swept westward in a fast airstream across kultuk into the siberian taiga in all marchenko had bailed out only three times but his reputation for survival fed more stories eagerly pumped up by the sleazier western tabloids that it was six times novosibirsk encouraged the lie for the defeated siberians were badly in need of heroes the fact that he had been downed by aa gunfire became quickly changed to him having been hit by some new kind of stealth missile the americans were developing or possibly by one of the new mach needlepointed aa starstreak missiles marchenkos photo the bruises to his face caused by the ejection carefully masked by makeup appeared on page one of novosibirsks official united siberian next to his old mig what will you do now asked a reporter get another plane fight again marchenko had answered it was understood by the novosibirsk reporters to be a joking quickwitted response quickwitted it might have been but it was no joke marchenko meant what he said fully expecting to be called on once again for shirer later that night the sight of the long stick of bombs falling away into the blue and the trails of silent orange explosions blossoming rapidly in the greenblack taiga should have been more rewarding than it was but while gunner murphy was chatting away excitedly on the intercom about how there wouldnt be any motherfucker airfields left for the mothers to fly out of so accurate had been the nineplane load of over pounds of fivehundredpound contact bombs and cratering munitions frank shirer felt guilty that he couldnt join in murphys excitement no matter that in the closing hours the bs had rendered the siberians three most important airstrips beyond irkutsk useless for shirer the news of marchenkos downing by an aa battery was a bitter disappointment for his determination to get back to flying real flying had once again been thwarted chapter fortysix from his forward hq at nizhneangarsk freeman insisted that before he would go to a all prisoners must be exchanged this list included the commando smythe whom or so it was claimed by the democracy movement the pla had cut down from the pier five railing as soon as theyd seen robert brentwood rescuing the other prisoner all other prisoners would be exchanged responded general cheng on the phone but not the man smythe he is a spy this told freeman smythe was alive and that the underground information was correct that the pla fearing his rescue had got him off the bridge only a moment or so before the explosion i insist he be returned said freeman this is not possible retorted an implacable cheng he is ill then we will release all siberian prisoners but not pla prisoners as you wish said cheng i told you norton freeman said after the phone hookup those communists bastards dont give a shit about their own people maybe so general but should we press the point they wont kill smythe now that weve made a public issue of it besides our contacts with the chinese underground report that beijing wants too much info from him to let him die reports are theyll feed him up first a show trial freeman proffered possibly smythell have to hold up a sign saying how it was us who began the war i suppose he wont opined freeman hes sasdelta i hope he will itd be easier on him i agree can you try to get a message to him via the chinese underground to say whatever the hell they want him to say nobody outside chinall believe a public confession you know that let him confess and well get him out on a fiftytoone trade the general shook his head with the frustration he knew hed have to live with god dick id hoped to wrap things up tighter wanted to beat the bastards so bad theyd never if the underground movement rises up general maybe you can freemans head whipped around how do you mean general taiwan has the best air force and navy in asia theyve never given up the mainland as their home its through their agents we have contact with the manchurian underground if people inside rise up like they did before the beijing massacre taiwan could go in if they thought there was enough internal support how about external support probed freeman his blue eyes as intense as winter cold norton gave one of his noncommittal shrugs but freeman knew that what it really meant was im not going to say it freeman was plainly excited dick whos their head honcho taiwan political or military dont fart around dick admiral lin kuang we train him norton nodded annapolis cum laude dick i want you to invite admiral kuang to tokyo hq incognito well do lunch everything top of the line american yes general you have anything in mind yes i want that man back hes a brave man dick and good brave men dont belong in chinese jails yes sir but i mean the menu for admiral kuang what oh yes well lets see soup for starters clam chowder boston cream not manhattan main course prime rib american prime rib dick range fed none of that damn chemicalfeed crap yes sir said norton taking notes the mention of prime rib making him hope hed be at the table with freeman and kuang he asked the general about dessert freeman looked up into the cold blackness and even though it looked like winter he could smell feel that spring was stirring what was that dick what kind of dessert will we offer freeman turned to him you havent been listening to me colonel norton looked at him nonplussed the general moved closer toward him his face no more than six inches from nortons china dick thats the dessert china norton felt himself taking a deep breath the general ice encrusting the stars on his helmet looked southward across the vast taiga this is a wankers a yugoslav ceasefire dick those bastards in beijing are pinning the logistical tail back on their dragon well if it starts breathing fire again im going to give it something to roar about ill chop the son of a bitch off at the neck you still got that wolf dung in storage norton looked about nervously for any sign of reporters around the generals quonset hut its frozen arch dripping in the darkness as springs thaw crept upon them norton saw a covey as the general called photojoumalists waiting for them by the headquarters they would probably want some answers about chengs refusal to release smythe and now it was suspected several mias air crew lost along the amur sometimes as now norton was convinced that the photojoumalists and others were less interested in a news story or a picture of freeman next to his wall charts than they were in the headquarters coffee said to be the best brewed in the entire second army proof of his theory came as they entered the hq with the reporters not a question being answered before everyone had their mug of steaming brew freeman was still agitated following his conversation with cheng and norton knew hed probably have to run interference for any of the dumber questions asked by any of the neophytes among the group before the correspondents were upon them freeman instructed norton to make sure they had lots of wolf dung ready in the event of a breakdown in the ceasefire yes sir i will general asked the redheaded cbs beauty have you any plans to run for public office hell no im not that old there was the usual smatter of polite laughter bsides my opinion of politicians next question cut in norton pointing to abc general its rumored you sent a message to the president that this is a yugoslav ceasefire yugoslavia no longer exists said freeman very adroit thought norton general it was a cbc woman with a frenchcanadian accent sir is it true that a siberian woman is to be granted the medal of freedom it is thats no secret her name is alexsandra malof shes done a magnificent job for us magnificent shes in hospital in khabarovsk at the moment but we intend to recognize her soon as shes well enough norton thought it a nice point the general made its international implications would rebound against cheng hed have to be a lot more careful about how he looked after his prisoners particularly american prisoners whats wrong with her general it was a stunning estonian blond photojournalist who had already driven several junior aides gaga ms malof replied freeman is suffering from acute malnutrition visual impairment and severe gastric disorders due to her imprisonment by the chinese communists norton smiled approvingly cheng would now definitely be on the spot no way would they kill smythe by the time they put him on the stand hed probably look overweight the press conference lasted another ten minutes and then freeman took time off for coffee the young blonde from estonia handing him a cup it is very nice of you general to agree to the film opportunity you are a great hero in tallin she could see the general didnt understand tallin is the capital of yes yes i know that said freeman scrambling quickly to recover good manners yes of course i realize tallin norton came to the rescue which was just as well for though he had omitted to inform the general it was he who had okayed the estonian request for a short picture opportunity with the general estonian press wanted to do a uh little profile on you general you know the kind of thing no freeman did not know the kind of thing never had known the kind of thing the general public were interested in pictures of where you ate your favorite colors your favorite food damn wonder they didnt want to see you take a piss but the blonde was smiling and having taken off her parka her figure poured into a white angora wool body suit momentarily caused a pause in all radio traffic in freemans tent very well freeman conceded where do you want me to stand we were hoping general that we might get one or two pictures of your planning table planning table uh i think the lady means where you figure out tactics and yes yes i know said freeman neither wanting to offend the blond goddess nor appear in any way inept well i do most of my planning here at the large wall map and in my room now if you like we could have a picture here but im afraid the background board will have to go past the censor before i can let you no no said the blonde sweetly of course i understand general nothing classified perhaps just a shot or two of your sleeping quarters would that be all right yes certainly right this way said freeman another blonde this one a photographer bringing up the rear the communications duty officer walked over to norton think the old man can handle that he asked norton nudging him oh i think so the generals christ you all right colonel suddenly norton had remembered the press question weeks ago about the rumors of a possible omon attack he put down the coffee cup and ran quickly between the canyon of radio and communications equipment he knocked on the generals door there was no answer he tried the handle the door was locked general he shouted inside freeman turned when he heard the knock so did the women one reached behind her and freeman saw the glint of what looked like a long syringe the other one was already coming for him as she lunged he swung out of the way now the other woman coming for him freeman didnt have time for the sig sauer ninemillimeter barely making the remington by his bed in time he swung it in the general direction of the door and fired twice outside norton heard the roar of the gun a heavy thud then another scrabbling noise freeman his hair mussed looked down at them nothing much was left of the photographers midriff but the bone of her spinal column as she slithered in the bloody ooze that had been her stomach the other blonde the prettier of the two literally spouting blood dead the second after the darts from the remington load had hit her each dart wound now a tiny fountain of blood general freeman running his fingers through his hair putting the shotgun on the bed pointing it away from the door stepped over the two bodies told them outside he was all right then opened the door for a moment no one spoke several men quickly exiting to be sick outside jesus said the normally restrained norton not yet realizing that a splinter from the door had grazed his eye bandage and caused a trickle of blood down his temple what in hell happened freeman walked back to the bed and reloaded the remington he was wheyfaced but steady as a rock as he looked back down on the two omons i guess its what you call equal opportunity he said wryly it was a remark though said in the near heat of the moment that all but ended his career la roches tabloids went wild freeman jokes about dead women christwomen freeman raged bitches were omontrained theyd kill their mother and no qualms about it i know norton counseled as understandingly as he could but i think for a while general youd better let me handle all press releases and i do mean all back home every editorial writer was calling for freeman to be disciplined it was a half hour before midnight when jay la roches private jet approached anchorage la roche not caring that his lawyers and others were looking indeed hoping they were told francine to take her bra off that he wanted a bit of tit for good luck this brought on gales of laughter from his hangerson francine trying to make the best of it knowing she had little choice unless she wanted to end up getting another beating of the kind hed handed out to his first wife obliged somewhat dreamyeyed but effusive nevertheless from what he called a hand and nose jobthe nose referring to the snort of cocaine that now had him in its high la roche and his entourage were met at anchorage airport by two welldressed men who asked if they could speak to mr la roche alone he refused saying grandly that anything they had to say to him they could say to his friends fine said one of them the other quickly slipping on the handcuffs while the first arrested jason la roche for treason specifically for knowingly trading with the enemy of the united states in a time of war there was near pandemonium as la roche began screaming at the fbi men and telling his lawyers to pull their finger out and get fucking moving why why you havent even read him his rights one of the lawyers whined and i dont have to reported the fbi agent emergency powers act youre out of luck mister by this time the fbi having alerted anchorage airport earlier several security officers were quickly on hand to help them board jay la roche on the next alaska airlines flight from anchorage to seattle where he would be arraigned before a grand jury in brooklyn police were called to a domestic dispute a man suspected of beating his wife the couples two kids were being looked after by the neighbor whod phoned they got the woman out but the man wouldnt budge and his wife a mrs lenore ferrago said that something had snapped in her husband since the war is there a gun in the house the swat team captain asked yes an old pistol but she said she didnt think hed use it when they went through the door they saw him at the fridge the door open and told him to put his hands up and not to move he banged the door shut turned toward them and shoved his hand inside his jacket they felled him with two shots there was no gun on him its like he wanted to go said one of the cops why the swat captain shrugged who knows wars over you think everythings gonna quiet down and then all of a sudden boom in a ceremony set for march alexsandra malof was to be presented with the medal of freedom general douglas freeman not for the first time in his career was recalled to washington for consultation it was rumored that he would lose his command before he left khabarovsk he instructed colonel norton on his behalf and in the interests of the longstanding friendship between the united states of american and her allies on taiwan to invite admiral kuang to have lunch with the general in tokyo where the general would break his journey en route to washington while this meeting was taking place in tokyo in khabarovsk a naked man with a small red flag trailing from his rectum streaked through freemans hq ten minutes later it was rumored that aussie lewis was taking bets two to one on that despite his wiredup broken jaw robert brentwood would be eating solid food within six weeks the bet was taken by choir williams and salvini but there was a great argument over what exactly constituted solid later that afternoon in khabarovsk along the bank of the amur two children watched a soldier who without any formal introduction whatsoever walked up to one of the members of the polar bear club and said olga the big woman turned da names lewis aussie lewis pleased to meet ya oh you like green horses
