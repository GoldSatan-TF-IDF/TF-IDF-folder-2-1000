death in old norse valkyrja means chooser of the slain prologue i mecklenburg sisters she thought are reflections of each other ute sat and watched herself in younger reflection margarethe margarethe looked weary and sad it hurt ute to see her like that when they had been small it had been as if the energy had been divided unequally between them margarethe had always been the livelier cleverer prettier sister it also hurt ute to see her sister in a place like this do you remember said margarethe gazing at the bluetinged window glass when we were little do you remember we went to the beach and looked out across the schaalsee and you said that one day we would sail away across it to the other part of germany or to denmark or sweden and you told me that it wasnt allowed do you remember how angry i got yes margarethe i remember can i tell you a secret ute of course you can margarethe thats what sisters are for just like when we were little we always told each other secrets back then at night with the lights out when it was safe to whisper and mamma and papa couldnt hear us you tell me your secret now they sat at a table near the window which looked out over the gardens it was a bright sunny day and the flower beds were in full bloom but the view was tinged slightly cobalt blue by the thick glass of the window it must be because its special glass thought ute the kind you cant break at least it was better than looking through bars margarethe eyed the other patients visitors and staff suspiciously she shut them out again confining her universe to herself her sister and the bluetinged view she leaned forward conspiratorially to speak to ute in that moment she became again the pretty little girl she had once been the very pretty girl she had once been its a terrible secret we all have those said ute and rested her hand on her sisters it will take me a long time to tell you lots of visits ive not told anyone but i have to tell someone now will you come back to see me and hear my story of course i will ute smiled sadly you remember when they took mamma and papa away do you remember how we were split up and sent to different state care homes you know i do how could i forget but lets not talk about such things now they sent me to a special place ute margarethes voice was lowered now to a breathy whisper they said i was different that i was special that i could do things for them that other girls couldnt they told me i could become a hero they taught me things terrible things so bad that ive never told you about them never thats why im here thats whats wrong with me all of these scary horrible things in my head she frowned as if the weight of what was in her mind pained her i wouldnt be in here now if i hadnt been taught to do such terrible things what things margarethe ill tell you ill tell you now but you have to promise me that after i tell you you will make things right for me i promise margarethe youre my sister i promise ill make things right ii hamburg january she was waiting for him she had tracked him from the moment he first came into view on erichstrasse opposite the erotic museum he was coming towards her but could not yet see her she backed into the darkness of the small cobbled square this was where it would be the square had no light other than that which leached in from the streets at either end and was shadowed further by the two nakedbranched trees that erupted from the unpaved disc of earth at its centre she was waiting for him as he approached she recognised his face she had never met him never seen him in the flesh but she recognised him his was a face from beyond the real world a face she knew from the television from the press from posters in shop windows a familiar face but familiar from a parallel universe she hesitated for a moment because of who he was there would be others attendants bodyguards she stepped back into the shadows but as he drew closer she saw that he was truly alone he hadnt seen her until he was almost upon her and she stepped out of the shadow hello she said in english i know you he stopped startled for a moment unsure then he said sure you know me everybody knows me you came here for me she held open her coat and exposed her nakedness beneath and his face broke into a grin she looped her arm around him and drew him into the shadows he placed his hands on her inside the coat her skin hot and soft in the cold winter night her breath too was hot as she put her mouth to his ear i came here for you she said i didnt come here for this he said breathless but he allowed himself to be pulled into the darkness and i didnt come for your autograph her hand slid down his belly and found him how much he asked his voice quiet but tight with excitement how much she drew back looked into his eyes and smiled why honey this is for free this will stay with you for ever and you get it for nothing she held his gaze but her hands moved fast and expertly he felt his belt being loosened his shirt being eased up the cold night on naked skin he fell to the ground the cobbles were wet and cold beneath him and he gave a small startled laugh at his own clumsiness he was slumped against the brick wall behind him his legs splayed wide why had he fallen down his legs felt as if they didnt belong to him and he stared at them wondering why they had simply given way under him then he gazed up at her she stood astride him and the fire in her eyes terrified him he vomited without warning without first feeling sick a sudden bonepenetrating chill spread through his body he looked at the vomit that covered his chest and the cobbles around him it glistened blackred in the dim light he looked up at her again as if she could explain why he had fallen why there was so much blood then he saw it the sliver of steel that glinted in her gloved hand he felt something warm and wet inside his clothes his trembling fingers found his shirt front and he tore at it buttons flying into the dark and bouncing off the cobbles his belly was split and something bulged from the wound grey and glistening and wet redstreaked in the halflight steam fumed from his rent belly and into the winter night blood surged rhythmically from the wound keeping time with the pounding of his pulse in his ears he felt cold and sleepy the woman leaned down and used the shoulder of his expensive coat to wipe his blood from the blade then with the same expert speed and precision with which she had stabbed him she went through his pockets after she took his diary wallet and cellphone she leaned towards him again and he once more felt the heat of her breath in his ear tell them who did this to you she whispered still in english still seductively tell them it was the angel who ripped you she stood up slipping the knife into her coat pocket make sure to tell them that before you die iii twentyfour years before berlinlichtenberg german democratic republic february were talking about children here we are talking about children here arent we major georg dreschers question hung in the smokeladen air everyone remained silent while a young woman in a felix dzerzhinsky watch regiment uniform came in with a tray laden with a coffee pot and cups the ministry for state security the mfs of the german democratic republic commonly and resentfully known by the population it purportedly served as the stasi occupied an entire city block in the lichtenberg district of east berlin the huge room in which major georg drescher sat was on the first floor of the main headquarters building on normannenstrasse the impressive conference room was dressed in oak panelling with a large map of germany east and west dominating one wall next to the map was a large mounted escutcheon of the ministry seal the motto of which promised that the stasi was the sword and shield of the party like an aircraft carrier in a dry dock a vast oak conference table dominated the centre of the room a small bust of lenin stood in the corner and mounted on the opposite wall portraits of general secretary erich honecker and minister of state security erich mielke glowered disapprovingly at the assembly gathered around the table this was the ministrys conference chamber a room for talking for deciding strategies and planning tactics this was where the worlds most successful secret police schemed against its enemies abroad and against its own people the stasi had other rooms rooms in this complex and just a couple of kilometres to the north at hohenschonhausen rooms where things other than talking were going on storerooms were stacked high with underwear stolen from the homes of potential dissidents names and numbers tagged to each item so that if ever the need arose the stasis specially trained tracker dogs would have a scent to follow in other rooms listening devices and special weapons were designed and constructed poisons and serums developed and tested while elsewhere countless hours of secretly taped conversations were transcribed thousands of photographs developed kilometres of clandestine film and videotape examined whole floors of the stasi headquarters were devoted to the vast archive of files on citizens of the gdr no state had ever amassed so much intelligence on its own people information collected through the stasis network of ninetyone thousand operators and three hundred thousand ordinary people who informally cooperated with the ministry for the good of the state for money or for promotion at work or simply to stay out of prison themselves one in fifty of the east german population spied on neighbours friends family members and then of course there were the other rooms the rooms with the thickly padded soundproofed walls the rooms where pain was an instrument of the state but this was a room for talking drescher knew the man who sat at the top of the table colonel ulrich adebach was in uniform as was the boyishlooking lieutenant who sat to his left smoking with an open red pack of salem cigarettes in front of him adebach was a heavyset man in his fifties greying hair brushed severely back and sporting an inadvisably walter ulbrichttype goatee his shoulder boards showed he carried the rank of colonel major georg drescher on the other hand wore a sports jacket and flannels with a poloneck sweater all of which looked of suspiciously nondomestic design and manufacture but there again as an officer of the stasis hva foreignintelligence service he enjoyed a level of contact with the west denied to almost all of his countrymen drescher didnt know the male officer sitting to the left of the colonel nor the older woman dressed in civilian clothes and adebach had made no effort to introduce them drescher guessed that the young lieutenant whose uniform collar hung loose around his thin neck was adebachs adjutant the air in the conference room was tinged blue with cigarette smoke and drescher noticed that the young adjutant lit another salem as soon as he had stubbed one out while everyone waited for the young female watch regiment officer to finish serving the coffee and leave the room drescher contemplated the lugubrious face of minister of security erich mielke as he scowled from his portrait if general secretary honecker was east germanys tiberius then mielke was its sejanus drescher suppressed a smile humour and imagination were not attributes appreciated in a stasi officer and a sense of inner silent rebellion certainly wasnt drescher concealed all these aspects of his character whenever he was in the presence of his superiors whenever he was in the presence of anyone but dreschers unique way of rebelling consisted of composing in his head caricatures that he would never commit to paper imagining his superiors naked and in humorously compromising situations the female watch regiment soldier finished serving the coffee and left the conference room what are you saying are you telling me that you have moral objections to this operation colonel ulrich adebach asked shattering dreschers mental picture of short fat joyless erich mielke naked except for a ballerinas tutu and giggling like a schoolgirl while being spanked by general secretary honecker no comrade colonel not moral practical these girls all seem very young we are talking about taking immature girls and setting them on an immutable course sending them out on dangerous and complex assignments completely isolated from any form of direct command structure drescher grinned bitterly i have three nieces of my own i know how difficult it can be to get them to tidy their rooms far less carry out hazardous missions the age range is between thirteen and sixteen years of age adebach didnt return dreschers smile and they will not be deployed in the field for several years yet maybe i should remind you major drescher that i was fighting fascists when i was exactly the same age as some of these young women no you dont have to remind me thought drescher youve told me every time youve seen the slightest chance to lever it into the conversation fifteen continued adebach i was fifteen when i fought my way through the streets of berlin with the red army drescher nodded but wondered what it had been like to kill fellow germans to stand aside while countless german women were raped by your comradesinarms or maybe not stand aside with respect comrade colonel said drescher these are young girls and we are not talking about combat the heat of battle have you read the file of course then you will know that we have very carefully selected these twelve girls they all meet a consistent set of criteria each of these young women displays athletic or sporting ability they are all of aboveaverage intelligence and they all have for one reason or another displayed a certain disconnectedness in terms of their emotions yes i saw that in the file but that disconnectedness as you put it has for the most part come about from some psychological trauma in their pasts i have to say that one could describe them as well disturbed these are problem children none of the girls is mentally disordered it was the older woman who responded this time drescher was not surprised to hear her speak german with a russian accent nor are they truly sociopathic but through experience or simply by nature they are emotionally less responsive than their peers i see said drescher but surely that on its own is hardly a qualification for what we expect of them i mean how can i put this i know we live in the ideal society of gender equality and opportunity but there is no doubt that the male well the male is more aggressive men are more inclined to violence killing comes more naturally adebach smiled wryly and rose to his feet he walked around the table and stood behind the seated woman perhaps i should introduce you he said to drescher this is major doctor ivana lubimova the major has been assigned to us by our soviet comrades i should tell you that major lubimova also served in the great patriotic war she fought with the seventieth rifle division special weapons training at buzuluk sniper asked drescher thirtythree confirmed kills said lubimova blankly and now youre an army doctor said drescher thinking of thirtythree dead germans psychiatrist and not for the army i see said drescher and he knew that the matronly russian hadnt had far to come just from karlshorst immediately to the south of lichtenberg kgb headquarters i specialise in the psychology of combat continued the russian what you have said is actually true women are much less inclined to kill in hot blood than men are the vast majority of murders around the world are committed by men and are fuelled by rage sexual jealousy or alcohol or any combination of these elements and you are also right to say male soldiers perform more aggressively in frontline combat particularly handtohand however when it comes to cold blooded killing planned premeditated homicide then the pendulum swings the other way women who kill often kill in cold blood and for motives other than rage motives that can be quite abstract that was why so many of my female comrades made such excellent snipers that is why these girls are perfect for what we have planned i dont know said drescher the killing is only a small part of it these girls women will have to exist isolated from their controls that is where you come in major drescher you have a great deal of experience in section a said adebach referring to the education unit of the stasis hva responsible for training east germanys spies you will head up a team of instructors that will train these girls in the broadest spectrum of skills the kind of skills they will need to infiltrate and maintain deep cover in the west adebach took his seat again drescher sipped his coffee and smiled rondo melange drescher was a man who enjoyed good coffee he had tasted the best around the world in copenhagen in vienna in paris in london but for drescher nothing compared with rondo it was one of the few things that the gdr manufacturing monolith had managed to get right what do you have in mind drescher said adebach nodded to his adjutant who passed a file to drescher are you familiar with the japanese term kunoichi the kunoichi was the female counterpart of the male ninja both kunoichi and ninja were trained as the ultimate assassins but there was a recognition that gender had a role to play in how they went about their tasks the kunoichi were expert in all forms of unarmed combat but they were also trained in the art of seduction they were experts on the human body both on how to make it respond erotically and on where the weak spots were how to kill swiftly and with the minimum of force and whenever necessary leaving little or no evidence of violence they were also experts at concealment disguising themselves as servants prostitutes peasants and concealing weapons or improvising them from household objects added to this the kunoichi were the ultimate poisonmasters they were trained in botany and could extemporise a deadly toxin from what they found growing around them what we are aiming to achieve major drescher is to develop our own kunoichi force and bury it deep in the fabric of western capitalism these operatives will have all the skills of the kunoichi but they will also be expert with every form of modern weapon why asked drescher i mean why specifically this type of operation why now and why are the stasi being asked to run it im sure the comrade major wont mind me saying this adebach nodded in lubimovas direction but we have by far the best success rate in penetration of western security services and organs of state of course we enjoy an advantage that none of our allies in the pact possesses we speak the same language as our main opponent adebach lit a sprachlos cigarette and drew on it slowly as to why we are launching this now major lubimova picked up adebachs thread we need new strategies to fight the west we need to use a scalpel rather than a blunt instrument as you know we have just stood down from our greatest mobilisation late last year the west took us to the very brink of fullscale nuclear war we now believe that nato did not realise how close we came to launching a preemptive defensive attack the socalled operation able archer eightythree turned out after all simply to be a nato exercise but it was the biggest deployment of western arms and forces since the end of the war the capitalists were stupid enough to make it completely accurate right down to the transmissions they sent between command structures transmissions which we intercepted added to which our monitoring revealed that british prime minister margaret thatcher was in daily encrypted contact with president reagan often several times a day what we didnt know then but do now is that this contact was about the americans invading grenada and not preparations for a major war it was simply two imperialists squabbling over who had the colonial rights to a scrap of land i can tell you major drescher said adebach that the ordinary man and woman here or in the west will never know how close we came to cataclysm the only thing that prevented allout nuclear war was the collection and analysis of intelligence by the covert intelligence services on both sides it has to be said our agents only just managed to stop the cold war turning hot we have got to find new ways of striking at the enemy without escalation to war your department has achieved great things in infiltrating the west with intelligence gatherers our experience last year has emphasised just how impractical it is to use conventional military means against each other if we have to take the fight to our enemy then we must do so on the invisible front we have several operations in planning all of which aim to use intelligence sabotage and subversion as they have never been used before this is one of them these young women will become our weapons deep inside enemy territory they may sit there in the west and never be deployed or they may be in continual use depending on the prevailing political situation the main thing is that if the need arises they can seriously impair the enemys capabilities or disrupt their plans by assassination drescher refilled his coffee cup i have to say comrade colonel that we already have the means and personnel to carry out eliminations in hostile territory were not talking about scandinavian journalists or the odd errant football star said adebach with a glance across at mielkes portrait i am talking about the ability to kill key personnel even leaders in the west and where the need arises to do so without raising suspicion for example we have a plan to infiltrate a valkyrie into one of the terrorist groups we sponsor in the west valkyries drescher suppressed a grin barely he knew of adebachs fondness for wagner is that what were going to call them isnt it all a bit well wagnerian it sounds like they could have been a special division of the nazi league of german girls that is the code name weve assigned to them said adebach sternly your job major drescher is to head the team of instructors who will train these young women twelve girls of whom only three will make final selection for deployment and these final three let me put it this way there will never have been three assassins three killing machines so perfect until then you comrade major will be father mother confessor teacher and keeper of these girls its all in there adebach nodded to the file in dreschers hands take that with you but make no copies the status of each of these young women will be that of a uc an unofficial cooperator like many of your freelance operatives at the end of the week i want the file returned all personal files on your students will be destroyed on completion of the training there is to be no surviving record of the preparation and deployment of these operatives drescher stood up very well but surely that is unnecessary no outsider is ever going to set eyes on the files of the stasi iv off the coast of jutland denmark august goran vujaic watched the blonde girl stretch languidly on the steamer chair at the stern of the yacht her limbs were long and lithe but she didnt have the skinny boyish narrowness across the hips that the other girl had vujaic liked his women to look like women he sipped his beer appreciating its chill on the hot day and it was hot vujaic hadnt expected it to be just as warm as it was he was no great lover of the northern european climate he belonged in the humid mediterranean heat of the adriatic or under the baking sun of a balkan summer but today the weather was good and he could watch the girls dive from the rear of the boat into the north sea he would have the blonde one that would be part of the deal a goodwill gesture of trade that he would get to fuck the blonde one after all that was what women were for that and being deck ornaments this little rowboat of yours must have cost you he said to knudsen running his hand over the red leather and varnished teak of the recessed deck sofa vuja i c the bosnian serb spoke to knudsen the dane in english the international language of business and of organised crime its worth about five million euros but i managed to get it cost said knudsen wryly i came to an agreement with the owner sure you dont want champagne im fine with the beer just now said vujaic glancing over his shoulder again at the girls but maybe later yes said knudsen later you can let your hair down a little huh goran after everything is taken care of vuja i c smiled he felt relaxed but not relaxed enough not to have brought zlatko along with him zlatko stood mutely behind them unsheltered from the sun and sweating menacingly into his hawaiian shirt it amused vuja i c to think that he now had a croat watching his back how times had changed knudsen a tall toughlooking dane sat with vuja i c in a plush recessed area of the deck at the stern of the motor yacht uniformed crew members stood in the shade of the awning far enough away not to hear the conversation waiting to serve lunch vuja i c breathed in deeply as if inhaling the yachts odour of wealth you know peter he said this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship and do you know why because we complement each other supply and demand what you need i can deliver this little operation of ours will become the main trading route for major drugs into scandinavia and northern germany you and i my friend are about to become very very rich or in your case richer maybe ill get a yacht like this if you can find another one going at cost vujaic grinned at the blonde girl and maybe some of the fixtures too tell me goran said knudsen are you sure youve got everything tied up at your end i mean on the distribution side i heard that you had problems with some of your competitors not any more any problems there had been were all dealt with before we first talked i told you at our first meeting that i was totally in control of the distribution network and i still am i had to arrange for a few people to retire from the business permanently unfortunately i had to be more discreet than usual so it all proved a little more expensive than expected you hired an outsider asked knudsen vuja i c didnt answer for a moment instead he sipped his beer keeping his gaze on the tall dane as if weighing up how much he could trust him vujaic knew that knudsen was rich well connected everything about him had checked out but vujaic had fought in war often in wars where he had no place to be fighting for the serb experience had taught him to divide men into two clear groups fighting men and the others just like women were divided into the ones youd fuck and old women knudsen bothered him he was late forties maybe early fifties but there was no softening about him none of the angles had been dulled by the good life but there again maybe that was just down to membership of an expensive gym you know i have a partner another partner vuja i c said at last leaning forward and lowering his voice conspiratorially this was clearly not even for zlatkos ears yes your other partner knudsen frowned i still dont like it goran i mean not knowing who this third party is but it doesnt affect you my friend my business with my other partner has nothing to do with what were doing here just like you dont know anything about them they dont know anything about you different businesses i supply your pharmaceutical needs while im a sort of recruitment consultant you could say for my other partner the serb laughed at his own injoke and anyway yours and mine is more of an equal partnership substantial as our little enterprise here is it would be peanuts to my other associate were talking about a big fish a really big fish they play a much bigger game than you or i do peter and for stakes beyond even your reach and what is their game asked knudsen not drugs if thats whats worrying you like i say i supply them with vujaic ran his hand over the closecropped bristle on his scalp while he considered the best description workers and if i knew all of it which i dont i couldnt tell you about it anyway as i was saying i needed to sort out some difficulties with competitors my other partner knows a contractor the best in the business apparently a hit man yeah or maybe a hit woman if the code name is anything to go by vuja i c leaned even closer lowered his voice more the valkyrie but what woman would be capable huh peter this socalled valkyrie is based in germany hamburg apparently he or she is supposed to be the best contract killer in the world better than the mexican asked knudsen carlos ramos last i heard hed quit the business but yes at least as good maybe better i mean i could take care of things myself god knows i took care of a lot of things back home in the nineties vuja i c cast an eye over his shoulder as if to check that zlatko could not hear him then he turned back to the dane but this little exercise needed a little more finesse if you know what i mean so this valkyrie took care of all of the loose ends made most of them look like accidents or suicide the cops are only looking into two of them really nice work tidy anyway the important thing is that you dont need to worry about the distribution side okay said knudsen if you say so goran are you ready im ready vuja i c turned and nodded to zlatko the huge croatian bodyguard laid a computer case on the deck table in front of vuja i c who took out a slim black laptop the serb tapped on the keyboard and the secure bank website opened up on the screen isnt bluetooth wonderful he grinned knudsen beckoned to the blonde girl she folded a wrap around herself came over to the men and handed knudsen a cellphone knudsen made two calls both brief my contact has taken delivery of the merchandise he said and handed the phone back to the girl vuja i c closed the laptop and the transfer of the funds has been confirmed he grinned at the blonde girl again his eyes penetrating the diaphanous wrap and following the curves of her body beneath maybe now we should celebrate now we can party you want to party honey ask the boss she said its his yacht you own everything around here vuja i c asked knudsen knudsen stood up and beckoned to the deck crew you can serve it now vuja i c didnt have time to react suddenly the calm was shattered with a dozen voices shouting at him commanding him to be still the uniformed deck crew had drawn automatic weapons from where they had been hidden on the serving trolley at the same time the deck doors flew open and heavily armed figures in black uniforms and body armour burst out onto the deck vuja i c heard zlatko being wrestled to the deck behind him there was nothing he could do instinct had moved his hand towards the beretta tucked into his waistband and concealed under his loose shirt but he checked the movement knowing it could cost him his life thats a good boy the blonde whispered into his ear in english simultaneously jabbing the barrel of her service automatic painfully into the soft stubblecovered flesh under his jaw wanted to fuck me did you goran ive got news for you you piece of shit youre the one whos fucked chapter one hamburg brickwork was unique the very fabric of the city was woven in red brick in fact the saying went that the craftsmen who had constructed buildings like these hadnt built with brick they had knitted with it martina schilmann looked up at the narrowfronted redbrick face of davidwache the most famous police station in germany davidwache stood right at the heart of the st pauli redlight district of hamburg and as well as being a fully functioning police station was a stateprotected national landmark martina had been stationed here for six of her fifteen years in the polizei hamburg then she had moved on moved up and eventually she had moved out standing here in the cold damp night air waiting for a blist british celebrity to satisfy his prurient interest in the reeperbahn she wondered why martina had been a rising star in the polizei hamburg but she had wanted more setting up her own company had been her way of getting what she wanted and now at forty she had got it money prestige success but right now looking up at the redbrick frontage of davidwache she thought back to those six years stationed there great times a great team martina pressed the earpiece of her concealed tetra radio into her ear and squeezed the ptt transmit on her lapel mike where the hell is he i dont know boss im in gerhardtstrasse lorenz martinas subordinate answered in his thick saxon accent he went into herbertstrasse and hasnt come out yet why in gods name didnt you go in with him i told you to stick close martina couldnt keep the frustration out of her voice she walked briskly around to the side of davidwache and crossed davidstrasse to the entrance of herbertstrasse she could go no further a baffle of metal walls obscured the view but allowed concealed access into the eightymetrelong street or allowed access unless you were a woman or a male under eighteen eighty metres of hamburg street was forbidden to the citys women except for the prostitutes who worked in herbertstrasse sitting illuminated behind hinged glass like joints of meat in a butchers window although the hamburg government had paid for the erection of the metal baffles at either end the prohibition against women entering was not imposed by the city but by the prostitutes themselves any woman who dared to encroach was likely to have water or beer or even urine thrown over them he said he wanted me to wait for him lorenz sounded plaintive over the radio link that he wanted to have a look on his own you know what these bloody celebrities are like they think everythings a game shit martina looked at her watch the british guy had been in herbertstrasse for twenty minutes that meant hed probably gone with one of the girls lorenz go in and see if you can find him but if hes just do it it was then that martina heard the sound of a woman screaming somewhere in the distance behind herbertstrasse jan fabel sat leaning forward on the leather armchair on the edge he still wore his raincoat and held his gloves in one hand everything about his posture spoke of imminent departure even though he had only just arrived at one time a long time ago this suburban house in hamburgborgfelde had been fabels home he had been familiar with every room every floorboard every angle it had been the focus in his life his home of course everything had changed since then the furniture the decor the tv in the corner youve got to talk to her renate sat opposite fabel her legs crossed and her arms folded across her body in the same defensive pose that he remembered her hair was not the same shade of rich auburn it had been when he had first met her when they had been married and he suspected that she now coloured it she was still a handsome woman but the creases around her mouth had deepened and given her face a faint appearance of parsimony god knows thought fabel shes got nothing to feel bitter about ill talk to her he said but i cant promise anything gabi is an intelligent girl her own person she is more than capable of making up her own mind about her future are you saying you approve of this support it ill support anything gabi chooses to do but no personally id rather she rethought her career in the end if its what she wants to do fabel shrugged resignedly but lets not get ahead of ourselves she has a long time to think it over and you know what gabis like if she thinks were pushing her shell dig her heels in its your fault said renate if you werent a policeman then it would never have occurred to her to join gabi heroworships you its easy to be the hero when youre a parttime parent and whose choice was that fabel fought back the anger surging up within him it sure as hell wasnt mine i was pushed out of her life and as i remember you did the pushing and i was pushed out of your life by that bloody job of yours right into ludiger behrenss bed as i recall said fabel and regretted it immediately renate was a petty woman it had only been in the last stages of their marriage that he had seen just how petty and she had always had the knack of reducing him to her level look this isnt getting us anywhere i think youre making too big a deal of the whole thing gabi has only started to talk about this lets just wait until she gets her abitur results and take it from there like i said its a long time before she has to make up her mind about it ill talk to her and make sure she knows what she would be getting into but i have to tell you renate that if she is determined to become a police officer then i will support her all the way renates already dark expression darkened further its not right she said its no job for a woman fabel stared slackjawed at renate i cant believe you said that you of all people renate what the hell do you mean police work is no job for a woman just goes to show all the time we were married i never had you down as a children kitchen church type mind you given your fathers history fabel knew he was about to get burned by the fire that suddenly caught light in renates green eyes and he was relieved to hear his cellphone ring just as she was about to launch something at him hi chef its anna you used to be into british pop in the seventies and eighties right i take it thats rhetorical said fabel his voice laden with warning whats going on well jake westland you know the lead singer from that group in the seventies the thing is hes on tour in germany at the moment and hes supposed to be doing an indepth interview with ndr radio tomorrow fabel sighed into the phone anna point just that he wont be turning up for the interview hes already spilled his guts in the reeperbahn and chef he said it was a woman who cut him and then she told him to let us know who she was she told him to say it was the angel shit fabel used the english word and looked across at his exwife the fire had been extinguished and she now wore the expression of hostile resignation that she had always had when work had called him away ill be right there they had taken westland across town to the emergency room at the hospital in st georg there was no point in fabel going there from what he had heard westland was in no condition for an interview instead he took the ostwest strasse into the reeperbahn hamburgs sinful mile where ropers had once woven hawsers for sailing ships giving the reeperbahn its name now strip clubs and sex shops bars and theatres neonsparkled in the icy night by the time fabel arrived at davidwache he was already in a bad mood the meeting with renate had gone as illtemperedly as expected and he had lost his mp player whenever he felt stressed he plugged it into his bmws stereo system no music more stress the press had already gathered en masse outside the davidwache station and three uniformed officers were holding them at bay in addition to the media circus outside the station there was some other separate commotion being created in davidstrasse to the side of the station young riot squad officers in their gear were struggling to load groups of resisting women into the large green police wagons some of the media had leached around into davidstrasse to take pictures of the sideshow but a fusillade of camera flashes saluted fabel as he made his way from the car to davidwaches double doors a television news camera crew had jostled its way to the front fabel recognised the reporter as sylvie achtenhagen who worked for one of the satellite channels great he thought as if the media limelight wasnt bad enough he had that bitch on his case principal detective chief commissar fabel achtenhagen emphasised his full rank for the camera can you confirm that the victim of this attack was jake westland the british singer fabel ignored her and walked on and is it true that this is the work of the socalled angel of st pauli the serial killer the polizei hamburg failed to catch in the nineteennineties then when he still did not respond are we to take it that your involvement as head of this proposed socalled super murder commission is significant are you being called in to clean up the mess the polizei hamburg made of the original investigation fabel pulled a mask of patience over his irritation and turned to the reporter the police presidiums press and information department will make a full statement in due course you should know the drill by now frau achtenhagen he turned his back on her and walked through the double doors and up the steps into davidwache police station the small reception area was crammed with personnel he could hear shouting from through the back and to the left from the custody area fabel was greeted by a bristlescalped heavyset man in his fifties and a pretty darkhaired woman wearing jeans and a biker jacket that was at least one size too big for her fabel smiled grimly at senior criminal commissar werner meyer and criminal commissar anna wolff how in gods name did achtenhagen find out about the angel claim asked fabel money talks said anna wolff that bitch isnt above bribing ambulance crew or hospital staff to get a scoop youre probably right shes all we need she practically built her career on the angel case fabel nodded in the direction of the commotion outside in davidstrasse what the hell is going on a case of perfect timing said werner a feminist group decided to pick tonight of all nights to stage a protest they invaded herbertstrasse they object to a hamburg street being closed off to women they claim its against their human rights or something theyve got a point to be honest said fabel he sighed okay what have we got the victim is jake westland fiftythree years old british national werner read from his notebook and yes he is that jake westland from what we can gather he was having a little impromptu jaunt around the reeperbahn and not to recapture the spirit of the beatles if you catch my drift funny though i would have thought it would have been the gay bars he would have been interested in him being english that is fabel responded to werners joke with an impatient face i dont know why they do it continued werner these celebrities i mean anyway westland deliberately gave his bodyguards the slip and disappeared into herbertstrasse next thing a working girl on her way into the kiez finds him with his insides turned into his outsides he tells her that his attacker told him that she was the angel then he passes out whats his condition he was still alive when they put him in the ambulance apparently the girl who found him knew a bit about first aid but my guess is that his producers are already planning a memorial greatesthits cd weve got the girl who found him through the back said anna wolff she exchanged a look with werner and her redlipsticked mouth broke into a grin and the bodyguards i thought youd like to interview them personally okay anna fabel said with a sigh whats the deal westland was being looked after by schilmann security and close personal protection martina schilmann you and she used to be close i believe martina schilmann was an excellent police officer said fabel then she must have been a better cop than she is a bodyguard said werner a uniformed superintendent joined them he was shorter than fabel and had thick dark unruly hair what i really want to know is he said sternly as he shook hands with fabel did anyone get his autograph hello carstens said fabel with a grin still cracking tasteless jokes comes with the territory carstens kaminski was in charge of the davidwache team davidwache polizei hamburgs police commissariat was the station that controlled the kiez hamburgs square kilometres of redlight district centred on the reeperbahn every weekend the normal population of ten thousand residents would swell as over two hundred thousand visitors would pass through the kiez some of whom would be drunk some of whom would be relieved of their wallets or valuables and for some their walk on the wild side would end in real disaster the uniformed officers who worked out of davidwache had to have a particular skill they had to be able to talk the kiez was an area populated by pimps hookers petty crooks and not so petty crooks visited by young men from the suburbs who often drank too much too quickly most of the situations that the davidwache officers were faced with demanded sympathy and humour and more than one reveller had been talked into going home peacefully and out of a night in the cells carstens kaminski had been born and grew up in st pauli and no one was as in tune with the rhythm and changing mood of the kiez he also had the typically downtoearth st pauli sense of humour whats the deal with the protest asked fabel its a group called muliebritas or more correctly it was organised by a feminist magazine called muliebritas explained kaminski they stormed into herbertstrasse and there was everything but allout war with the hookers god knows it would have been bad enough at the best of times but with this westland thing going on as well we asked them to disperse explaining that they were interfering with a crime scene and investigation but the concept of consensual policing seems to have been lost on them there was another burst of shouting from the custody area as if to underline his statement anyway youre not here for them by the way did you know martinas here kaminski grinned yes said fabel anna told me didnt you and she yes carstens said fabel with a sigh weve already been through that do we have a description of the woman who attacked westland all he said was she told him she was the angel and even that weve only got secondhand from the hooker who found him how do we know shes not the angel herself from what we can gather she did her best to keep westland alive until the ambulance arrived and if this really is the work of the angel then the girl who found him would be too young for the original murders anyway despite her trying to hide it behind a tough front she clearly was in shock we suggested the quack should give her a mild sedative but she told him to stick it i want to talk to her anyway and martina kaminski grinned and cast a look across at werner and anna wolff and martina what about the new cctv system weve installed in the kiez will we have got anything on that no said kaminski westlands attacker was either lucky or very clever there are no cameras on that street or anywhere near the courtyard as you know the compromise we had to make on having cameras in the kiez was that we had to be selective where we put them none in a position that could reveal the honourable citizens of our fine city nipping into a peepshow or a sex shop it means weve got a hell of a lot of black holes but ive put a call into the ops room at the presidium for the recordings from an hour before until an hour after the murder to be collected and analysed we might get something from the surrounding streets the attacker making their way to or from the scene in the meantime im flooding the streets with uniforms kaminski nodded towards the assembled officers in the lobby well question every hooker pimp and club owner in the area business isnt exactly good in the kiez these days and westland was hardly an anonymous victim something like this is bad for business maybe well get lucky thanks carstens well if you dont mind jan ill get back to briefing this lot kaminski nodded towards the uniforms he had gathered unless you want to talk them through what we should be looking for no carstens this is your patch said fabel he knew that no one knew the kiez better than kaminski fabel hung his raincoat up in the station cloakroom first of all patting his pockets lost something asked anna bloody mp player fabel made his way with werner and anna through to the rear of the station until davidwache had been an exclusively uniformbranch station to keep pace with changing times a new extension had been built onto the rear of the protected architecture of the original station it was in this newer part of the building that the detective branch was now based kaminski had put the conference room at their disposal for carrying out witness interviews fabel looked out of the window over davidstrasse and part of friedrichstrasse he could see the green riotpolice vans being driven down to the traffic lights transporting back to the police presidium those protesters whom davidwaches tiny cell block could not accommodate anna i think you should lead the questioning of this witness he said the girl who found westland i mean it sounds like she might be in a pretty bad way why me chef asked anna because im a woman i just think she might respond better to you anna had been on fabels team for five years but he still found her difficult to handle to understand anna wolff was much youngerlooking than her thirtyone years she had shortish black hair was no bigger than onesixtytwo centimetres and strove for a punky look with her dark mascara firetruckred lipstick and oversized bikers jacket and despite fabel doing his best not to notice she was very attractive but most of all anna wolff was by far the toughest most aggressive member of his team as well as the most insubordinate oh i see said anna with an expression of mock enlightenment obviously im going to be more understanding being female that is im sorry i forgot that having a dick presents an insuperable obstacle to sympathy im not being sexist anna im being practical thats all fabel sounded annoyed despite himself forget it ill talk to her myself i was just saying yes anna youre always just saying ill conduct this interview he looked at his watch it was twothirty am werner you sit in anna you can go off duty oh come on all i said ill have a team briefing at two pm tomorrow i want to see you in my office first anna be there at one said fabel anna grabbed her leather jacket from the back of the chair and stormed out you were a bit rough on her jan said werner when she was gone she goes too far werner you know that im fed up with every order being challenged or commented on and im sick of complaints coming in about anna we used to call it robust policing jan those days are gone werner long gone this is the twentyfirst century you know she has a point jan werner looked unsure of himself i mean about the malefemale thing you do tend to get anna to do the female interviews what are you saying just that well dont take this the wrong way but you do tend to treat women like theyre a different species how can you say that werner my team has always been balanced well maybe not now not since both men became quiet the name maria klee hung unsaid in the air forget it jan said werner a second too late i just think you should go easy on anna fabels reply was cut off by a uniformed officer conducting a girl in dark jeans and a navyblue quilted ski jacket into the room she clutched a woollen hat and scarf in her hands fabel guessed that she was not a street girl the hookers who worked the streets around herbertstrasse dressed in bright colours and would stand in groups holding pastelcoloured umbrellas above their heads whether it was raining or not as a sign to potential customers that they were available for business their contrived cheerfulness was so that their customers felt less sordid about the trade they plied fabel kept his smile in place but noticed how young the girl was she looked to fabel not much older than his own daughter gabi he asked her to sit and tried to do what he could to put her at ease christa eisel was pretty very pretty with shoulderlength fair hair from the plainness of her outfit and her obvious attractiveness fabel worked out that she must have been a herbertstrasse window girl who would have changed into a provocative outfit once she was at work as they talked christa kneaded the hat and scarf on her lap but there was something approaching defiance in her eyes well need to take that im afraid fabel said smiling christa looked down at the bloodstained jacket its no good to me now ive left my gloves downstairs theyre finished too she slipped the jacket off and handed it to fabel werner placed it into a large plastic forensics bag how long have you been working the area christa asked fabel six months just weekends and not every weekend i have a slot in one of the windows and i do some escort work occasionally are you supporting a habit christa sorry but i have to ask the girl looked genuinely taken aback no no of course not what do you do i mean when youre not working here im a student uni hamburg oh really thats where i went i studied history you medicine fabel stared at christa for a moment medicine then why money i want to earn extra money but this way why not again defiance glinted in christas eyes a lot of students do it for extra cash youre clearly a bright pretty girl with a lifetime of opportunity ahead of you christa i just dont understand why you would choose to do what youre doing is this what you think it means to be a woman are you disappointed that im not some exploited junkie youre right i choose to do this its my body and i can do what i want with it and anyway its relatively easy money a few hours each weekend and i make more than most people do in a month trust me it makes medical school a whole lot easier thats not the point christa god knows in this job i know what the dark side of human nature is like i just dont understand why someone like you would seek it out and immerse themselves in it believe me maybe you think you can do this for a year or two and then get on with your life you cant it will stay with you for the rest of your life every relationship you have will be coloured by it youll find it impossible to see the good in people whats it to you herr chief commissar you trying to save my soul this isnt about your moral wellbeing christa its about placing yourself in danger you study medicine surely you know the risks to your health i mean and because i study medicine i know how to look after myself listen herr fabel i dont have to justify myself to you women have been exploited by men for centuries im doing a little exploiting back despite the defiance fabel could see that christa had been badly shaken by what shed gone through in the last hour or so he didnt even know why he was getting into this with her as she had said it wasnt his business he decided to drop it its your life christa fabel sighed he looked at the notes before him listen i know this is very hard for you but i need you to try to remember if there was anything else you saw or heard that you maybe havent mentioned in your statement you saw no one come out of the courtyard i mean as you made your way in no no one its not that ive forgotten or didnt notice im sure there was no one there i use that alley if im in a hurry it cuts across from erichstrasse through the courtyard youve always got to be on your toes for creeps so i was paying attention there was no one but that doesnt make sense you must have got there moments after the attack i was if the rate of his blood loss was anything to go by but that doesnt change the fact that i saw no one come into or go out of the alley i heard that you carried out first aid i take it your medical training kicked in for what it was worth which wasnt much hell be dead by now whoever did that to him was very skilled a single cut that eviscerated him it was like the japanese suicide cut you know the seppuku straight and very deep from the amount of bleeding i reckon the abdominal aorta had been nicked they wont be able to repair it before he bleeds out fabel watched christas guileless youthful face as she spoke about a mans death her description was clinical but her voice shook as she spoke and her hands kneaded the woollen hat on her lap more vigorously what did he say to you ive already told them before id like to hear it again if you dont mind christa he was nearly unconscious when i got to him shivering all he said was it was a woman she said she was the angel he was speaking in english its funny i didnt recognise him i didnt know he was who he was until they told me all i saw was i suppose all i saw was a man dying she looked at fabel earnestly ive never seen anyone die before i guess ill have to get used to it you never do when fabel had no more questions and long after christa had no more answers he told her he would arrange for a police car to take her home she asked if she could be taken to her parents house in barmbek can they drop me at the end of the street she asked my parents they dont know anything about what i do after christa left martina schilmann came into the conference room she was wearing an expensivelooking dark blue business suit and her blonde hair was gathered up behind her head in a french plait looking at her now for the first time in three years fabel remembered why he had found her so attractive martina was carrying two mugs of coffee she placed one in front of fabel at least i remember where the canteen is she said and smiled hello jan how are you im fine he returned her smile weakly and you you sure youre okay yeah sorry just thinking about doomed youth oh god i know the happy hooker did she try to convince you that she was content in her work too kidding herself she is tough though i was the first on the scene after her she was doing a pretty good job of not going to pieces but it is depressing shes just a kid god knows i saw lots just like her when i was working this beat anyway its good to see you again how have you been fine you look prosperous business has been good martinas expression darkened until now i just cant believe that weve lost one this could be the end for me i mean thats the whole point of the bloody exercise to guard someones body whos going to want to hire us now from what ive heard martina youve built schilmann security into one of europes biggest personalprotection businesses i would think this is a storm you could weather actually i was surprised when i heard you were personally involved with westlands protection i would have thought youd be on an ethereal executive level now guiding lesser mortals from the clouds im a control freak handson too much handson if im honest we were shortstaffed this weekend as well ive got a big russian tycoon coming in next month and i had to send half my team to liaise with his regular security people god i hope ive got a big russian tycoon coming next month when he gets wind of this hell probably tell me to stick it anyway never mind that are you still involved with the beautiful dr eckhardt yep said fabel still involved pity said martina mischievously what was the story with westland asked fabel how come he gave you the slip what can i tell you the usual rockstar megalomania they pay us thousands of euros a day to keep them safe then think its all a game sometimes i think were there for the cameras more than anything status symbols or shit like that westland was an arsehole no big surprise there he spent half the tour drunk and the other half chasing nineteenyearold girls the guys in his fifties for christs sake to be honest we saw him as a relatively low risk fending off drunks persistent autograph hunters paparazzi that kind of thing anyway we did a doubleup on him me and lorenz lorenz is all bulk and no brains but hes good for visible presence if you know what i mean even if he is getting on a bit and like i said not one of natures great thinkers hes a saxon from gorlitz bless him exvolkspolizei still calls a hamburger a grilletta and probably jerks off to pictures of katja witt wearing a free german youth blouse fabel laughed youre pretty scathing for someone from the east yourself im from mecklenburg a totally different proposition from the valley of the clueless said martina with a smug grin referring to the parts of the former east germany which had not been able to pick up west german tv before the wall came down it was an affectionate jibe it was exactly in the valley of the clueless that the monday demonstrations had begun the peaceful mass protest movement that ultimately brought down the communist regime anyway continued martina we were taking westland back to the hotel vierjahrzeiten from a concert at the sporthalle arena when he pipes up that hed like to see the reeperbahn never been there heard all about it the beatles all that crap i tell him its not what its cracked up to be and anyway its not on the route to the hotel but he makes a fuss and we end up taking him on a brief guided tour i would have thought he would have been too tired after a concert said fabel yeah well he seemed pretty lively he was doing a lot of sniffing in the back of the car and i dont think he had a cold if you catch my drift no doubt itll all come out in the autopsy the funny thing was he had pissed off a few people by refusing to attend the postconcert party tells them hes too tired and then badgers us to take him to the reeperbahn anyway we do the tour thing but all westland is interested in is seeing herbertstrasse and he starts giggling like a schoolgirl so we take him of course because its herbertstrasse and because im a woman i cant go in so i drop him and lorenz at one end and go and wait at the other the davidwache end naturally westland finds it easy to bewilder lorenz and all the time i think hes with westland hes actually just standing around like an idiot waiting for him at the far end next thing i know westlands trying to repack his intestines and my business is down the tubes you say he was pretty insistent about going to herbertstrasse specifically herbertstrasse and not grosse freiheit do you think theres any chance it was prearranged that maybe he had agreed to meet someone after losing you by cutting through herbertstrasse martina furrowed her brow in thought for a moment i doubt it could be i suppose but it all seemed pretty spontaneous to me its just that it seems odd if westland was looking for a little bit of cheap excitement then why go to the bother of giving you the slip where he did i find it strange that he didnt just go with one of the window girls you say he told you he had never been to herbertstrasse before thats right so either he tore along herbertstrasse and out the other end before you got there or he cut through the side alley at number seven and out past the eroticart museum that looks pretty planned to me like he knew where he was going he probably didnt like i say i still think it was all spurofthemoment stuff martina went through the evening in detail exact times whom westland had talked to what he had talked about how the concert had gone martina became once more the police officer and without prompting gave fabel all the information he needed westland had made two calls before the concert one to his wife the second to his accountant regarding an investment or deal he was involved in he spent some time alone in his dressing room before going on stage explained martina its possible he took or made calls then on his cellphone there was no contact that im aware of after the performance other than a brief call to the woman who was organising the concert she was the one who wanted him to attend the postconcert party with hamburgs good and great i got the impression she i mean the organiser wasnt too chuffed when he cried off after all it was the whole point of the exercise to raise awareness of the charity and after all that effort he couldnt be bothered doing a simple meetandgreet afterwards he was more interested in getting to the reeperbahn well check his cellphone said fabel oh didnt you know his mobiles been swiped wallet too and he had a diary like a miniorganiser that he always had with him whoever killed him nicked that as well so it could be a robbery martina gave a bitter laugh no but it could be the killer trying to disguise it as a robbery the theft was amateur the killings the work of art they talked for a while longer professional though her report was there was nothing in what martina had to say that offered any substantial leads not much help is it martina read his mind not much but there again this whole thing could simply be what it seems a random senseless attack by the angel martina asked you dont really think shes come back after ten years who knows according to the girl who found westland the wound inflicted on him was very professional single cut one stroke since when are hookers experts on knife wounds since they started studying medicine at hamburg uni said fabel flatly if you remember the angel was a dab hand with a blade im not likely to forget said martina i was stationed here when the second last murder took place i wont forget that crime scene in a hurry we found him dead in his car in seilerstrasse minus genitalia the last one was dumped in a corner of heligengeistfeld also minus working parts thats why i dont think this is the angel no castration the fatal knife wound was in the belly not the throat and theres a gap of nearly ten years the other thing is that the angel never stole from her victims other than their love tackle that is and anyway like i said ive seen the angels work if that girl hadnt told me what westland had said i wouldnt have made the connection maybe she misheard him he was speaking in english they were interrupted by carstens kaminski the davidwache commander who stuck his head around the conferenceroom door okay jan whether the attacker was the angel or not this one is now officially all yours i just got the call from st georg westlands dead it was a dry night but bitterly cold the kind of cold you felt in your lungs when you breathed in the night air fabel took werner with him they left through the rear exit to davidwache and walked to the murder scene they headed up davidstrasse and passed the end of herbertstrasse with its redpainted metal baffles as they approached fabel saw a tall greyhaired man wearing a long dark blue overcoat slip through the baffle screens everything about the man spoke of him being welloff respectable fabel imagined the life of this stranger an unsuspecting wife at home children grandchildren probably he was maybe even a respected figure someone whom others looked up to there was something about the mans furtive sidestep into sleaze that thoroughly depressed fabel they walked along erichstrasse passing the occasional illuminated window and ignoring the tapping on the glass and beckoning gestures of the prostitutes ah werner sighed sarcastically the siren call of a twominute kneetrembler i mean would you ever consider he jerked a thumb in the direction of the last window they had passed youre joking right said fabel some men a lot of men go in for it complicationfree sex i suppose unless you consider picking up a disease a complication i hate the way the reeperbahn is painted as naughty but nice a tourist attraction the truth is its cheap and nasty and sordid granted but its here and here to stay everybody keeps telling me that said fabel but im not so sure werner when they reached the crime scene they found that there were still two uniforms on duty and a single forensic technician in a white bunny suit was still working the site fabel held up his polizei hamburg id and one of the uniforms lifted the tape is there anywhere you dont want us to walk fabel called over to the technician the technician stood up and fabel saw it was astrid bremer astrid had replaced frank grueber to become holger brauners deputy two years ago she had the hood of her forensic suit pulled up over her hair and its elasticated edge turned the oval of her face into a pretty almost childlike mask nope she said youre okay we finished processing the scene an hour ago so why are you still here asked werner astrid shrugged my mother always said i was a stubborn child i just thought we were missing something it was winding me up and were you missing something asked fabel the killer knew what she was doing said astrid but its difficult for any human being not to leave some trace somewhere of their presence i reckon she stepped back into the shadows over there by the tree we didnt quite get a footprint but the heel of her boot sank into the earth at the bottom of the tree from that we might be able to get a rough indication of her weight that started me thinking about her height theres only one hundred and fortytwo centimetres of clearance between the bottom of the tree and the first branches unless she was a midget she would have had to duck in to keep concealed without getting tangled in the branches astrid grinned and held out a plastic evidence bag the bag looked empty to fabel until he stepped out into the street and held it up against the street light a single strand said astrid its maybe not connected to the killing but given where i found it i think thats very unlikely i would say your killer is a blonde and we have her dna the altona balkon the altona balcony is a plateau of parkland elevated thirty metres above the river elbe and fringed with a benchlined boulevard the balcony affords one of the finest views of hamburg all along the elbe to the kohlbrandbrucke making it a favourite spot not just for the people of altona but for those from all over hamburg a stillhandsome man of about sixty his coat collar turned up against the cold sat on a bench at the edge of the snowdusted balkon and watched the distant activity of the ships and tugs loaders and cranes in the container harbours above him the sky was a pale winter blue and behind him the low sun sparkled gold through the naked branches of the trees it was a peaceful moment a moment in which he realised how little peace he had enjoyed over the last twenty years a woman with a dog walked past followed by three teenage boys on skateboards thundering along the rocksalted footpath their breath fuming in the cold air then peace again hello uncle georg a young woman in her thirties expensively dressed and tastefully madeup sat down beside him and kissed him on the cheek she laid her handbag and a copy of muliebritas magazine across her lap and placed a carrier bag on the bench beside her you know it wasnt all bad he said as if she had been beside him all the while back home back then i mean no uncle georg i suppose it wasnt i mean i did believe in what we stood for what we did there were things that were better then people cared for each other more we had a sense of community of society whatever dreadful things we had to do we did them for the greater good of the people of the world she rested a gloved hand on his arm i know you did whats wrong uncle and sometimes well sometimes i look at the way we live now and think we maybe had it more right than everybody says we did it wasnt what we believed in that forced us to do these things it was a war a cold war maybe but it was still a war he stopped and smiled at her im sorry my dear just an old man ranting are you sure thats all thats wrong i thought he frowned his gaze out across the elbe river its nothing it was just i got the feeling that i was being watched or followed instinct more like paranoia are you sure there wasnt more to it maybe you were being followed she asked he shook his head no ones that good i used all the old tricks and checks like i said paranoia i got you a present she said and handed him the carrier bag he looked into it and smiled rondo melange she smiled too they started making it again like you say not everything from back then was bad but i suppose they make it for a profit now everything that was done then for the good of the people is now done for a profit like us like the way weve turned what we do into a business all for money now he laughed bitterly im an entrepreneur to be honest uncle georg most of my life has been since not before almost all of my meetings have taken place since the wall came down and weve done well out of them havent we yes my child he turned to her and smiled sadly but the things i taught you and your sisters all those terrible things its our business uncle its what we do what we are he nodded did you see the media coverage of the st pauli killing yes theyre talking about it being the angel again what about the forthcoming meetings is everything going to plan yes uncle everything is going well will the hamburg one look like an accident suicide the meeting will be as the brief required what about the big one you clear on everything not a problem it will actually be easier no need to disguise it im going to use the sako trg is it okay over that distance perfect and anyway im comfortable with it and that new suppressor works well it doesnt just muffle it distorts any report and sends scanners looking in the wrong direction for the shooter but in a remote location like that it wont be an issue anyway if the intel is correct hell be alone youll have to get out quick back across the border i mean i always do uncle georg that suppressor is the last new bit of kit i can get you it increases our exposure risk every time i acquire new equipment our client sourced it for me and i dont like getting them involved ive got no control over the supply chain and we could be lumbered with traceable gear i understand do you have the details for the other meetings he handed her a data stick i cant get used to this technology i feel like im living in the future and i dont belong in it all that information stored on something so insignificant if wed had these back then wed have been able to destroy all our files before the rabble got their hands on them he sighed you never ask why do you never ask ask what why they have to die are you never curious you taught us not to be its none of my concern my job is to complete the meeting sure sometimes when im preparing watching them its like seeing into their lives and i sometimes wonder why this person has to be ended but not much i just do my job she ran her hand through his grey hair you worry too much uncle georg remember how you taught us to take every moment of pleasure we could to enjoy the time in between meetings yes i do remember do you enjoy your life i enjoy everything this life gives me ive got you to thank for that but the killing she smiled but looked over his shoulder to make sure no one was within earshot we all die i learned that from you we all die alone and many of us die in pain and fear terrifying diseases horrific injuries lingering deaths all my meetings are ended quickly and the target has little idea whats happening to them sometimes no idea not even an instant of fear or pain and for all you or i know i could be saving them from great future agony and anguish thats the way you trained me i dont feel bad about what i do you told me not to feel bad about it even though were doing it for money now the fact that were doing this for ourselves instead of for the state isnt our fault they changed the world around us we are what we are you and i just like everybody else who was cut adrift when the wall came down try not to worry so much she placed the data stick in her handbag and kissed him on the cheek again goodbye uncle georg theres one more thing he said halting her as she rose from the seat we may have to arrange another meeting not for a client oh she said weve never done a nonpaying job before this is a selfprotection thing someone is beginning to ask too many questions in the right places a policeman and hes maybe getting a little too close to home we may need to deal with it discreetly when ill let you know it may come to nothing goodbye my child goodbye uncle georg after she left he remained on the bench fists rammed into his coat pockets his collar turned up against the cold and tried to recapture that moment of peace but he couldnt fabel drove into the police presidium in hamburgalsterdorf at tenthirty am he had only managed to get five hours sleep and felt leaden and dull he spent the rest of the morning preparing for the team briefing his weariness suddenly intensified when he was intercepted in the lift by criminal director horst van heiden a word jan van heiden pressed the button for the fifth storey the topbrass floor signalling that the word was formal fabel followed van heiden into his office and sat down when van heiden sat down on the executive leather chair behind his desk he straightened his tie and adjusted a notebook and pen on his desk when the order of his bureaucratic universe was once more restored he began i just wanted to catch up with a couple of things are you okay for this conference on violence against women ive had the organiser on the phone again i think shes worried that well send someone junior it may come to that if im honest this murder last night asked van heiden i take it that was one of the things you wanted to talk to me about fabel failed to keep the weariness from his voice its all over the media said van heiden and there are some elements who blame us for not catching the angel the first time round if that is indeed who were dealing with that i dont know horst i actually think its very unlikely the modus is totally different but im digging out all the old files obviously it wasnt my case the first time around mmm van heiden again nudged the silver pen a fraction of a degree thats the thing ill be quite frank about this jan we are getting a lot of funding from the bka for you to set up this super murder commission the bka was the bundeskriminalamt the federal crime bureau its quite an accolade for the polizei hamburg to have a unit that will have a republicwide brief within legal restraints i mean van heiden continued as ive said to you before it is an opportunity for us to establish ourselves as the centre of excellence in investigating complex and multiple murders in much the same way as the institute for judicial medicine at eppendorf is seen as the centre of excellence in forensic science but fabel raised an eyebrow van heiden was beginning to sound like a commercial and he always did a commercial before he hit you with the punchline but i do not delude myself that the reputation that has won us this accolade is a collective one its yours jan youre the one everyone thinks of as germanys leading expert on complex and multiple murder cases thanks for the compliment there was a resigned scepticism in fabels smile they both knew that van heiden was getting pats on the back for fabels achievement but let me guess i inherit the angel of st pauli case that no one could solve in the nineties and if i dont get a result suddenly my reputation takes a knock something like that well for what its worth i really dont think this is the work of the angel but im not ready to go on record with that yet fabel stood up oh van heiden reached into a drawer and took out a letter there was something else weve received a request for an interview from the danish police what about fabel leaned over his desk and took the letter from him it doesnt say as you know the danish police have a liaison officer here but this has come direct from a politidirektor vestergaard one of his officers jens jespersen is flying in from copenhagen specifically to speak to you there are no other details it would appear that your reputation is becoming truly international after checking all his drawers without success to see if he had left his mp player in the office fabel had a coffee and a cheese roll at his desk before taking a few minutes to prepare himself for his meeting with anna wolff he knew it was going to be a difficult one so did anna if her expression was anything to go by when she walked into his office as always without knocking sit down anna said fabel what is this she said still standing am i getting the sack fabel sighed deeply yes anna effectively you are for the first time since he had known her anna looked truly taken aback she dropped down into the chair and gazed at fabel blankly im sorry anna im going to request that you be reassigned ive warned you more times than i can remember about your attitude what is this because of the crack i made last night not exclusively anna but ive got to tell you it didnt help i need officers who will respect the decisions i make and follow the orders i give most of all i need a team that pulls together i need people i can rely on are you saying you cant rely on me when have i ever let you down anna did what she could to restore her composure listen anna its a constant struggle trying to build and maintain an efficient murder commission team added to that i now have this added responsibility that the bka have asked me to take on over the last four years we have seen paul lindemann killed and maria klee well maria is going to need care for a long long time you dont need to tell me about paul lindemann said anna once more defiant he was my partner after all and maria was my friend and they were both my responsibility fabel paused i know you were close to them both anna but pauls death and what happened to maria have made it very clear to me that we have to tighten up our procedures we need to operate as a fully disciplined unit the discipline we need is a discipline that you seem to lack there was silence for a moment anna looked at fabel as if trying to read his face to measure what room for negotiation there might be something like resignation settled into her expression i thought you put us together as a team because we were all different because we each had something to offer i did said fabel but i need this murder commission to work cohesively no loose cannons or personal agendas oh wait a minute this is all about maria isnt it because she took off on a personal crusade you decide to crack down on on individuality im not talking about you expressing your individuality anna im talking about you totally ignoring the fact that youre part of a team fabel realised he had raised his voice he took a breath then in a measured tone said i cant have a renegade on my team anna ill bet annas expression was close to a sneer that would screw up your chances of becoming germanys crime fighter number one what is it jan are you afraid ill embarrass you this time it was anna who paused im sorry this is where i want to work if you transfer me ill quit thats your decision anna and believe me i wanted things to work out differently i wanted to move you up to become joint deputy with werner but i cant recommend you for a senior commissarship because of your attitude have you put the papers in yet asked anna for my transfer i mean not yet ive got to get this new angel case rolling the other thing is i wanted to give you the chance to put in for a transfer yourself it would look better on your cv give me to the end of this case chef then ill go quietly okay fabel hesitated for a moment im shortstaffed as it is but while youre still part of this unit i need you to rein in that independence a little after anna left fabel sat looking out of his window over the snowfrosted treetops of winterhude park the expression on annas face lingered in his mind he recalled too the eager if prickly anna he had recruited five years before it had been annas edge her drive that had convinced him she would be an asset to the team somehow somewhere during those five years he had lost his way with her but the thing that churned in his gut was that he was still not convinced he was handling it right fabels thoughts were interrupted by the phone ringing it was ulrich wagner from the bka federal crime bureau fabel liked wagner but could have done without the interruption he was keen to prepare for his team briefing after the usual chitchat wagner got down to business theres a federal republicwide alert gone out i dont know maybe youve seen it about margarethe paulus sorry i havent said fabel im up to my eyes with this st pauli murder the alleged return of the socalled angel of st pauli well in a way thats why im calling margarethe paulus was confined to the state mental hospital in mecklenburg which isnt too far away from you shes been in there for thirteen years three weeks ago she decided to discharge herself unofficially theres not been a trace of her since margarethe paulus is considered to be a highly dangerous individual before she was committed there was a spate of armed robberies all very efficiently executed and all carried out by a lone woman it was all very cool and organised each time it was a woman of completely different appearance hitting a different type of target a bank then a store then a security van but always for cash never jewellery or any other loot that would have had to be fenced and that meant no need to involve any third party so how did they get her asked fabel they didnt the mecklenburg police were never able to put together enough evidence to identify the woman far less to nail margarethe paulus but she started to think bigger look for accomplices or at least thats what we think was going on she got involved with a biker gang the story she told is that she met up with them to discuss potential cooperation but they werent interested and things turned nasty three of the gang attempted to rape her attempted ive seen the crimescene photographs jan its almost impossible to believe that a woman alone against three hardened villains could have done all that but forensics proved that she did she killed all three more than that she castrated them from what the mecklenburg forensics people could ascertain she killed two instantly and castrated them postmortem but the third the ringleader she kept him alive and conscious throughout the whole process it was his screaming that alerted people in the neighbourhood who then called the police god fabel considered what wagner had told him that fits with the original angel murders it does but they couldnt have been committed by her she was incarcerated in the state mental hospital at the time however when i saw the report on the latest killings i get your point said fabel but this time theres no castration evisceration yes but balls intact can you email me the relevant stuff on her including the most uptodate images ive already arranged it the mecklenburg police will have a record of her dna could you arrange for that to be sent too this time our killer may have left a trace of herself behind a hair not a problem said wagner so you maybe have a break this time maybe but im not counting on it fabel held his team briefing in the murder commissions incident room in addition to his now depleted core team of werner anna and annas partner henk hermann there were other detectives who had been drafted in by fabel to beef up the team thomas glasmacher was a large burly blond who at the moment was sniffing and sneezing into his handkerchief struggling as he had been for the last week to fight off a winter cold dirk hechtner was smaller and darkhaired fabel had borrowed hechtner from a police direction in hamburgharburg in their brief careers to date both glasmacher and hechtner had shown a great deal of promise as well as an ability to think unconventionally when needed neither was aware of the fact that fabel was considering recruiting them both permanently in total fabel had to find four new investigators for his unit five once anna was gone in addition he was going to push for specialists to be attached to the commission there were three photographs of jake westland on the incident board an enlargement of his passport photograph a publicity photograph and the last photograph that would ever be taken of him lying bleached of colour on a slab in eppendorfs mortuary on the other side of the board were smaller pictures of five other men and some cuttings from newspapers fabel walked over to the board and wrote four words in red marker motivated stalker angel and copycat okay youve all read through the case file as we have it so far the only direct witness to the murder was westland himself and his account only comes to us secondhand as far as i can see these four categories are the options which present best at the moment he pointed to the word motivated everything seems to point to westland being in the wrong place at the wrong time westlands actions last night after the concert seemed all to be spurofthemoment but if for a moment we assume that someone knew he would be at the back of herbertstrasse and when he would be there then we could be looking at a premeditated motivated murder westlands wallet diary and cellphone are missing so we could be looking at theft as a motive although i feel thats highly unlikely he had a few minutes alone and undisturbed in his dressing room earlier in the evening it could be that his phone and diary were taken to hide details of a planned meeting though god knows why he would prearrange to meet anyone in a sleazy kiez backstreet ive been in touch with the british police and asked them to provide us with his cellphone records in the meantime i want us to do all the usual investigations into westlands background his marriage his business affairs all the usual checks fabel jabbed a finger at the word stalker jake westland was a singer a celebrity a late seventies early eighties pinup he was also a multimillionaire he was exactly the kind of figure who attracts the wrong kind of attention from obsessives ive emailed the police in england to see if i can get any information about stalkers persistent fans threatening fan mail that kind of thing in the meantime ive been able to talk with westlands bodyguards fabel ignored werners knowing smirk and they confirm that there wasnt anything out of the ordinary that took place either before or after his concert theyve actually been with him during his whole tour and they say theres been nothing unusual or that caused them concern since he arrived in germany they are also pretty certain that westland suggested visiting the kiez as a spurofthemoment thing in short i think either of these options is unlikely and that brings us to fabel circled the word angel between nineteen ninetysix and nineteen ninetynine five men were murdered in the kiez district their ages ranged from thirtyfive to fiftyseven all the victims were repeat visitors to the reeperbahn area and all were frequent users of prostitutes every victim met his end the same way throat cut with a single lateral slice the entry wound was always on the right side of the neck straight through behind the trachea and out death would have been pretty swift and because the windpipe had been severed silent the bodies were found in different parts of the kiez more often than not in their own cars forensic evidence pointed to them being attacked from the front passenger seat of their own cars absolutely no forensic traces fingerprints dna fibre samples were ever found but maybe our killer has slipped up this time weve retrieved a single blonde hair from the scene if it really does belong to the killer its yet one more difference from the original killings the other difference is that the original killer certainly never left his or her victims alive long enough to tell us that it was the angel who killed them the last in the original series a fortynineyearold ship engineer was found in november ninetynine then nothing until now said werner so how did she get the name the angel asked dirk hechtner there was massive media interest in the case at the time as im sure everybody remembers said fabel when i turned up at davidwache last night i was greeted by sylvie achtenhagen and her camera crew as you know frau achtenhagen has become quite the celebrity herself with her own newsmagazine show on hansat but ten years ago no one had heard of sylvie achtenhagen at that time she was a young and very ambitious new reporter for one of the public broadcasters she built her reputation on her coverage of the murders and she ended up getting to do an hourlong special on the case i have to admit she handled the whole thing very cleverly even if she was way off with her conclusions basically achtenhagen gave the whole thing a feminist twist her take on it was that almost exactly one hundred years after jack the ripper a female ripper was doing pretty much the same thing in hamburg weve all heard the saying that hamburg is the most easterly suburb of london anyway achtenhagen exaggerated the similarities between the two cities she also drew parallels between the cases both involved the use of a surgically sharp blade mutilation of the bodies and the removal of trophies in the case of jack the ripper those trophies were sometimes the genitals in the case of the angel they were exclusively the genitals both series of murders took place in redlight districts whitechapel in london the kiez in hamburg and of course both series of murders seemed to be within the context of prostitute and client the angel was is definitely a prostitute asked werner it looks likely or pretending to be one anyway sylvie achtenhagen turned this idea on its head there was a hint that while jack the ripper represented the ageold repression and abuse of women the angel represented their liberation total crap of course but it captured the imagination it came close to making the angel a feminist icon achtenhagen managed to imply very subtly mind that it was the victims who were the aggressors and sylvie achtenhagens documentary was the first to describe the killer as the angel asked anna achtenhagen planned to make a name for herself with her hourlong tv special she succeeded but she also made a name for the killer the angel of st pauli caught the publics imagination and it stuck fabel threw the marker down onto the conference table what i resented about what achtenhagen did is that it cemented the idea of a female avenging angel stalking the streets of hamburg looking for male victims while that is maybe the case the truth is we have only one witness account of one of the victims being seen in the company of a youngish blonde prostitute shortly before the supposed time of death apart from that for all we know the killer could have been a man and the precision and method of the throat cut could suggest a military or even specialforces background but achtenhagen succeeded in closing the publics eyes to anything other than an iconic female vigilante i dont know werner winced the castration thing to kill another guy is one thing but to slice off his todger my moneys on it having been a woman all right settle down fabel said to suppress the laughter that broke out like i said i think its more likely that the angel was a prostitute from what ive gleaned from the original case files the angel was suspected to be an aileen wuornostype serial killer a woman abused as a child who turned to prostitution and carrying out revenge killings against clients but whether male or female and whatever her motives the socalled angel was very very careful not to leave forensic evidence or to give any clue to his or her identity and that makes me very doubtful about the angel disclosing her identity to westland as an announcement that she is rising from the ashes which brings me to what i think is our most likely prospect fabel slapped his hand onto the board next to the word copycat the angel of st pauli exists as a concept if perhaps not as a reality a powerful concept that has maybe caught more than the general publics imagination i think its entirely possible that westlands murder is the work of the angel by inspiration rather than execution there are fundamental differences between his murder and the original killings the killer didnt carry out a postmortem castration or take a trophy that could simply be because she was disturbed said werner christa eisel found westland still alive and bleeding out fast if she hadnt applied pressure he wouldnt have made it to the ambulance maybe the killer heard christa coming maybe so but a panicked escape doesnt fit with the fact that no one was seen leaving the scene carstens kaminskis davidwache team have spoken to almost every girl working the kiez that night and bear in mind that most of them sit watching the streets from their windows normally any unknown woman passing through the street would stand out the problem we have is that it was an exceptional night in the kiez given this nearriot feminist protest but prior to the protesters invasion of herbertstrasse no one noticed a woman who didnt belong wandering around also christa eisel swears no one passed her coming out of the square but lets say the killer was disturbed it still doesnt alter the fact that she eviscerated westland instead of cutting his throat whats more westland was on foot where all of the original victims were in their cars and lets remember we are nearly a full decade on from the last angel murder there are however specific similarities particularly the expert use of a blade for the moment my money stays on this being the work of a copycat fabel slipped a large printout from the folder on his desk he stuck it up on the incident board a woman of about thirty stared blankly out from the photograph she was wearing no makeup and her blonde hair had been brushed back severely from her face the image had the bleached stark lighting of an official photograph this is margarethe paulus explained fabel ive just been sent her details by the bka three nights ago she escaped from a secure mental hospital in mecklenburgvorpommern i havent had a lot of time to go through all the details but the main thing you should know is that she is a highly dangerous individual she killed and castrated three men in nineteen ninetyfour and would have been a prime suspect for the original angel killings had she not already been locked up and we have to bear in mind that her murders were spree rather than serial she is familiar with hamburg apparently and was brought up in zarrentin in northwest mecklenburg although it was in the former east its only seventy kilometres from hamburg its highly unlikely given that she only escaped three days ago that shes involved with these latest killings but we have to keep an open mind she would certainly be a candidate for a copycat killer at the very least we need to be on the lookout for her how did she manage to escape walked out of the main gate apparently she had complained of feeling unwell and an orderly and a nurse were escorting her to see a doctor she broke the male orderlys arm before knocking him out then stole the nurses uniform electronic door key and identity card before locking her in a storage room bound and gagged its clear that paulus is a highly organised type somehow she had managed to collect makeup and hair dye over god knows how long so that she could make herself look like this nurse so she had targeted the nurse rather than just grabbing an opportunity to escape asked dirk hechtner probably months in advance fabel spent the rest of the briefing going through what they had in the way of statements and the initial forensic evidence he then allocated investigative tasks to each team member after he had wound the meeting up werner loitered until the others were gone lets have it werner said fabel gathering up his papers whats on your mind anna told me about your chat my god it didnt take her long to find a shoulder to cry on its not like that jan i asked her how it had gone shes in shock i think so am i truth be told you think im making a mistake fabel asked i think you would have handled it differently if anna had been a man to be frank jan not that again werner i dont let gender influence how i deal with my officers well whatever the reason i think you should give anna another chance shes put her neck on the line more than once for the sake of catching a killer but dont you see thats the point anna has put her neck on the line she nearly got herself killed twice doing exactly that this isnt the wild west werner i mean i thought you would understand if anything its you thats kept me from screwing up because you always make sure we follow procedure there have been times when anna has all but rendered evidence inadmissible because she hasnt followed the state prosecutors guidelines werner sighed and rubbed a shovel of a hand over the grey stubble on his scalp fabel always thought werner looked like a retired boxer or hardened sailor his broken nose picked up early in his career as a street policeman his hamburg lowgerman way of speaking combined with his faintly scruffy way of dressing and his powerful build made him look like someone who was probably inclined to use muscle rather than brain but no one had the eye for detail that werner had a tiny discrepancy in someones statement some event that didnt quite fit into the chronology of a crime a forgotten scrap of evidence that changed the whole picture these were the things that werner caught when everyone else including fabel had missed them the truth was that fabel relied heavily on werners counsel and it troubled him that his friend thought he was making a mistake over anna listen said werner i know youve been looking for a replacement for maria klee to partner me with team me up with anna in the meantime you could put henk together with dirk for a while i think anna and i could work well together a good balance give it a go for a month or two then if you still think she should go fair enough have you talked to her about this idea of yours fabel asked suspiciously no i promise its just that shes desperate to stay in the commission jan and anna really would be a loss to the team another loss shes a good officer jan she just needs to be brought into line let me have a crack at it okay let me think about it said fabel hard day i thought you were asleep said fabel to the shadow in the bed i was i asked if youd had a hard day the usual murder mayhem paperwork you the usual i heard you have another celebrity murder on your hands are you sure youre not doing them yourself just to advance your career our career i can see im going to have to bring you into this one said fabel thats the deal ill keep killing them to keep us both in work he slid between the sheets they were cool and clean on his skin by the way have you seen my mp player lying around no youve already asked me how did it go with renate fabel sighed how does it ever go with renate she was as bitter as hell as always i dont know how the hell she has managed to turn the whole situation around so that shes the injured party it was behrens who dumped her not me its a woman thing susanne still had her back to him if you cant find the man to blame find a man to blame i hold you responsible for hans zimmerman not choosing me as his partner for our kindergarten parade i knew there was something said fabel anyway gabi is thinking about joining the police renate blames me and wants me to talk her out of it will you no not talk her out of it give her an informed picture yes talk her out of it no well talk about it tomorrow susannes voice was thick with sleep but fabel slid close to her put his arms around her cupped her breast in his hand id like to make up for the kindergarten parade he said jespersen had been relieved that the seat next to him on the plane was unoccupied jespersen liked to use travel time to sort things out in his head to review to do a bit of broader thinking the scandinavian airlines flight to hamburgs fuhlsbuttel airport from copenhagen had only taken a little over fifty minutes but during that time jens jespersen had been able to study the information he had obtained through europol on erster kriminalhauptkommissar jan fabel most of the information related to the consultative role fabel was adopting for cases outside the polizei hamburgs jurisdiction he was being touted by europol as a major expert in complex murder investigations the goto guy as the americans would call him jespersen didnt like americans much he liked germans less as the seatbelt lights came on and jespersen put the file back in his case he reluctantly admitted to himself that the german was probably the best person to talk to talk to about what it suddenly struck jespersen that he had come a long way to meet with the german and he didnt really have that much to discuss all he had was a remark made by a drug trafficker during a sting operation a couple of potentially connected events that may be nothing more than so many coincidences and a legend a vague and most likely exaggerated spookstory from the dark ages of the cold war after touchdown at hamburg fuhlsbuttel jespersen called the politigard headquarters in copenhagen and was put through to his office he spoke to harald tolstrup his deputy tolstrup confirmed that jespersen was booked into a hotel on the alter wall in hamburgs city centre tolstrup also said that jespersens boss politidirektor vestergaard wanted to speak with him as soon as possible and hadnt sounded happy after jespersen hung up from his call to the politigard he phoned the hamburg police presidium and asked in english to speak to jan fabel he was told that fabel was in a meeting jespersen gave his cellphone number and asked that fabel call him back after jespersen checked into the hotel he took a walk around the city centre it was cold but bright and he looked up at the pale blue of the sky it was the same sky as in copenhagen as in stockholm or oslo hamburgs light was a nordic light and jespersen found it strange to be in a foreign country amongst people he disliked and yet to see the same sky the same light the same architecture the same faces in the street he knew that the illusion would have been dispelled if he had travelled even a little further south but here in hamburg and totally despite himself jespersen felt at home he walked along grosse bleichen and found himself in front of an impressive redbrick building which announced itself with a plaque as the hanseviertel jespersen went in partly motivated by curiosity he had come across the word hanseviertel once before when he had visited bergen in norway bergen had been part of the hanseatic league and there had been a part of the city where german traders had settled in the middle ages called tyskebryggen the german wharf bergens own hanseviertel this hanseviertel in hamburg however was something completely different behind the red brick lay connecting avenues and galleries of shops all now covered over by glass it looked like the ideal place to get some lunch and while he was at it he would pick up a small gift for his twelveyearold niece everywhere he went he would find some small soft toy for mette his younger brothers daughter she was beginning to pretend she was too old for such nonsense but he could tell she liked it he found a small shop in the arcade selling gifts that were a little more upmarket and unusual than the usual tourist stuff he bought a small stuffed bear for mette it was dressed in a blue jacket with hamburg embroidered on the back and was wearing a prinz heinrich fishermans hat jespersen found a pleasantlooking cafe and ordered a light lunch he sat eating slowly and watching germans go by germans jens jespersen had been a police officer for twentythree years his father had been a police officer before him and his grandfather before him it was a tradition he was immensely proud of and in that tradition lay the roots of his dislike of germans but now was not the time to think of such things a female voice asked him something in german jespersen looked up the woman was in her thirties with light blonde hair pale skin over high cheekbones and bright blue eyes im sorry he said in english may i sit here she repeated in english he nodded moving his coat to allow her to sit she was about to say something when jespersens cellphone rang he answered it without excusing himself herr jespersen this is principal chief commissar fabel polizei hamburg murder commission i got your message im sorry i couldnt get back to you earlier but i was kind of tied up with something weve just had a major case kick off im sure you know the drill anyway i believe you would like to arrange a meeting jespersen whose english was excellent was surprised to hear the german speak in perfect and to jespersens ears unaccented english yes herr fabel i have a few things to check out so ill be in hamburg for a few days but id like to talk to you as soon as possible would you be able to see me tomorrow tomorrow might be difficult like i say weve just launched a major inquiry give me a moment there was a short silence how about fourthirty at the presidium ill be there said jespersen i hope you dont mind me asking herr jespersen but when you say you have a few things to check out does that mean you are conducting part of an investigation here in hamburg i see what youre getting at jespersen managed to get just the right element of irritation into his voice if i were conducting an investigation i would have gone through the appropriate channels no mr fabel your toes are not being trodden on ill see you tomorrow at fourthirty he snapped his cellphone shut bloody germans was there one who wasnt a born bureaucrat are you english the woman sitting next to him asked after he had pocketed his phone no he smiled wearily not really trying to conceal his disappointment at having to make small talk im danish no im half danish she said fluently and enthusiastically in his native tongue but with a heavy german accent my mother is from faborg you know on fyn but i was brought up here my father is from hamburg you dont say jespersen said the woman was clearly delighted at the happenstance that she should sit next to a dane jespersen despaired at it he liked to have time to think things through but there again she was an attractive woman are you here on holiday she asked no business said jespersen he looked at the young woman more closely she certainly had the colouring of a dane something about her reminded him of karin her almost white blonde hair had been gathered up by a band but protested in a torrent of kinks and curls jespersen smiled this time not wearily she really was very attractive carstens kaminski called fabel at his office in the presidium first thing weve got someone you should talk to he explained its probably nothing but i think you should hear what he has to say in custody no a witness of sorts ill come over said fabel no its okay ill send him over to the presidium hell be there in twenty minutes even after all of these years after all of the things he had seen fabel still found it difficult to understand why some people got involved in the things they did despite his experience fabel still sometimes found himself fooled by peoples appearances jurgen mann who now sat opposite fabel in the interview room did not look like someone who should have inside information on hookers mann was thirtyfive years old tall and slim dressed trendily but tastefully in a grey jacket and trousers and a black sweater he had a wide strong jaw forested with the kind of designer stubble that actually took a lot of maintenance to look so casual like the greyhaired man fabel had seen ducking into herbertstrasse the fact that someone so outwardly normal so unexpected could be a regular user of street prostitutes depressed him because of the sensitivity of the interview fabel conducted it alone what is it you do asked fabel for a living i mean im a designer packaging signage that kind of thing that would explain the stubble thought fabel are you married yes i dont see children fabel cut mann off one an eightyearold girl and you visit the reeperbahn regularly now and again listen do you want to hear what ive got to say or not mann asked defiantly i need to know how you came by such information i need to know about you how often is now and again once every couple of weeks or so id say sometimes more sometimes less and is it always street prostitutes you use yes fabel regarded the young man he thought of his wife and eightyearold daughter and this prostitute you told herr kaminski about do you use her frequently no it was just the once and i didnt get to well there was no contact have you seen her before no that was the first time and she approached me just sort of came out of the shadows and asked if i wanted to go with her she told me how much and it was cheaper than usual so i said yes then what happened like i told them at davidwache she led me into this courtyard it looked like she planned that we do it there but i said i wanted to go to her room it was then that she pulled the knife she had me cornered and said that if i didnt hand over my wallet she would cut me up the same way as she had sliced up that english singer you believed her if you had seen her eyes i knew if i didnt do what she said and maybe even if i did she would have a go at me with the knife what kind of knife was it i dont know a bloody big one maybe a filleting knife or something like a butcher knife but thinner and you gave her your wallet yes i threw it to her and when she caught it i shoved her as hard as i could and ran for it and this happened last night yes i knew what she was talking about because i saw this thing on the news about the angel being back yet you still went to the kiez and wandered into an empty courtyard with a prostitute i suppose i did anyway it cost me my wallet so why did you wait until this morning to go to davidwache and tell them about the robbery i was going to leave it notify my credit card companies that id lost my wallet and have the cards stopped and forget all about it but then i thought about the fact that she said she was the angel i thought i ought to let you know very publicspirited of you listen i didnt have to what did this prostitute look like she was older than the usual girls thirties maybe older she had blonde hair looked dyed she was quite tall about oneseventyfive slim she was attractive but looked i dont know hardened i suppose you could say she was wearing a dark coat and black leather boots okay ill need you to go and talk to one of our police artists here we need to get a good picture of her then id like you to go through some mugshots for us on the off chance that you might recognise someone we already know about i need to get back to work fine said fabel ill send someone over to your home this evening to go through them with you i take it your wife knows about all of this okay said mann ill do it here fabel got up to leave the room theres one other thing said mann what her eyes if you had seen her eyes they were so full of hate and anger thats why i ran i knew that if i hadnt she would have killed me for sure she was the angel i know she was the angel carstens kaminski was in the murder commission when fabel returned kaminski was halfsitting on the edge of anna wolffs desk smiling and chatting he was small and dark and had something about him that was relaxed and confident a charmer fabel heard that he had been quite the ladies man at one time if the smile on annas face was anything to go by he probably still was come on through fabel said to kaminski and led him into his office pretty girl said kaminski with a lazy grin i heard shes looking for a transfer id sure like to accommodate her fabel stared at kaminski incredulously my god it doesnt take long for word to get around does it what did you think of manns story asked kaminski nice office youve got by the way he craned his neck can you see the winterhude planetarium from here manns a creep said fabel but i have no doubt that he believes hes had a real brush with death or that he truly believes it was the angel who mugged him but you dont think it was me neither said kaminski but the way she approached him suggests to me that she was keeping out of sight of the other girls that and the way she was dressed makes me think she wasnt a regular working girl and she lured him into an isolated courtyard she may not be the original angel but she certainly fits with the killer the other night thats what i thought hopefully mann will be able to give us a good enough artists impression or pick her out from the mugs having said that like you say i dont think shes a regular in the kiez your guys pick anything else up we talked to all the window girls in herbertstrasse that night two of them remember seeing a man they thought was jake westland he came in the gerhardtstrasse end and made his way straight along the street without looking right or left and out onto davidstrasse that sounds planned said fabel i dont know jan said kaminski fiddling with the desk calendar on fabels desk it could simply be that he was trying to give martina schilmann and her guy the slip just acting on an impulse if manns hooker is our killer she certainly didnt arrange to meet him no but maybe he had arranged to meet someone else and simply ran into the killer its just that it seems so purposeful i suppose the way he rushed along herbertstrasse and out the other end knowing he had only minutes before martina would start looking for him coming out onto davidstrasse but whatever westlands intentions i reckon weve got an angel copycat on our hands i also reckon jurgen mann is probably very lucky that he wasnt her second victim brace yourself carstens said fabel my thinking is that were just at the start of a whole new series of killings he looked at his watch fourfifty nothing irritated fabel more than people being late he was the first to admit that he was too obsessive about punctuality ever since he had been a boy the idea of being too late for something had tied knots in fabels gut it was one of those things like his inability to get drunk to push himself that one carefree drink too far that characterised him that made jan fabel who he was but this time as he sat at his desk fuming fabel felt justified in his irritation he had impressed on jespersen that he was in the middle of launching a major murder inquiry to be twenty minutes late was more than a lack of courtesy it was unprofessional fabel picked up his phone and called the number hed been given for jespersens cellphone it rang for a while and then switched to voicemail fabel left a message for jespersen to call him as soon as possible fabels desk phone rang almost instantly he hung up and he answered expecting it to be jespersen it wasnt hi chef said anna wolff ive got something youve got to see where are you im up in butenfeld butenfeld was police shorthand for the morgue at the institute for judicial medicine which was based on the eppendorf street of that name youre really going to want to see this fabel looked at his watch and thought about the danes infuriating lack of punctuality okay ill come right up how long has the apartment been vacant ute cranz turned and smiled at the younger woman they had spent half an hour viewing the attic apartment and the young female estate agent had done her best to project a maturity and experience that she was clearly years from possessing she was dressed in a mannish dark blue trouser suit why was it thought ute that so many women in business think that to compete with men they have to dress like them its only just become available for rental we havent even advertised it in fact we were surprised when you enquired about it how did you know it was vacant ive been looking for a flat in this area i heard that the previous tenant was moving out i see said the estate agent although she didnt sound entirely convinced you were right to move quickly properties of this quality in altona dont tend to hang around weve just completed a full renovation of an apartment building around the corner in schillerstrasse we had the apartments filled before we had finished the work how much ute cranz walked across the lounge to the window her high heels clicking on the hardwood floor well this is nearly two hundred square metres and it has a balcony with views out across to palmaille the monthly rent is two thousand nine hundred euros excluding utilities thats pretty standard for this area ute looked out of the window at the street below she saw a man approach the front door of the apartment building he had greywhite hair but had broad shoulders and moved like a younger man he was dressed in what she would have described as an englishstyle heavy tweed jacket and corded trousers is this one of the neighbours she asked the estate agent who came across to the window and looked down yes yes it is she said thats herr gerdes he has the apartment above a very quiet neighbour as are the rest of the people in the building a nice class of resident as it were ill take it ute turned back to the agent and smiled but id like to see the kitchen again what have you got asked fabel anna had been waiting for him at the reception of the eppendorf mortuary well from the look of it a middleaged man and a heart attack said anna as she led him into the mortuarys body store fabel stopped in the hall a heart attack so whats that got to do with us not what said anna who the victim was found dead in his hotel bedroom this morning on the face of it the cause of death doesnt seem suspicious all the signs are that it was a heart attack but hell be given the full treatment of course but the victim is a jens jespersen a danish national shit said fabel the danish police officer i was supposed to be meeting with him he looked at his watch half an hour ago well you better not keep him waiting any longer said anna with a grin a mortuary attendant wheeled a trolley into the centre of the morgue and removed the covering sheet the man on the trolley was tall his shortcropped hair was blond and looked a sickly yellow against the grey pallor of his skin his lips had a bluish tinge the danish passport anna handed fabel told him that jens jespersen was fiftyfour years old but the man on the trolley had the physique of a much younger man and fabel guessed he was looking at someone who had been serious about keeping fit he doesnt look like the usual heartattack candidate said anna as if shed been reading his mind fabel took the plastic bag containing the rest of jespersens smaller personal belongings the watch was a heavyduty military type jespersens danish national police id card identified him as a chefpolitiinspektor which fabel guessed would be somewhere equivalent to his own rank there was a notebook with general reminder notes scribbled in it including the hamburg police presidium number but fabel could see that this was a personal notebook not one used for police work on one page of the notebook was the name olaf written in block capitals and double underlined he slipped the notebook back into the plastic evidence holder is this it he held up the bag and its contents thats it said anna oh except he didnt like to sleep alone anna arced an eyebrow and tossed a second evidence bag to fabel this one held a souvenir teddybear toy dressed in nautical gear with a prinz heinrich peaked cap fabel took the bag from anna and stared absently at the stuffed teddy doesnt it strike you that somethings missing he doesnt have moin moin embroidered on his little jumper anna smirked i know what you mean something is missing jespersen was here to talk to you about something yet theres no sign of his official notebook no notes of any kind no paperwork except for his travel documents and take a look at this she tossed fabel jespersens cellphone fabel had to reach quickly to catch it and he scowled at anna flipping the phone open he searched through its memory nothing no recorded incoming or outgoing calls said anna no stored numbers no registered service my guess is someones switched sim cards on him thinking that no one would think to examine his phone damn it said fabel has forensics looked at any of this no the emergencyservice doctor who came out to the hotel treated it as a heart attack obviously as a sudden death the body was sent up here and moller and his team will have a look at it ive suggested to moller that he has a good look at it what did he say you know moller top pathologist but worldleading asshole he told me not to tell him his job but you know hell give this one the full works ive also told the hotel to seal off the room and alerted holger brauner that we may need his forensics boys over there but i wanted to wait till you saw this i didnt want to overstep my authority fabel fired a warning look at anna she stared back her face empty of expression it was a trick she had anyway she continued the scene has been trodden on by god knows how many by now i dont know chef this could be innocent enough and theres no evidence of it being anything other than natural causes no anna you were right something stinks here if this isnt kosher said anna then weve got trouble if this is a deliberate killing then its been a professional job a very professional job in his office with its view out across hamburgs altstadt peter claasens frowned and thought about the questions he had just been asked he had put the receiver down but sat with his hand resting on the phone for once oblivious to the rhythmic thumping and clanging that resounded through the building he had been reworking a draft of the letter that emily had asked him to write when the phone had rung maybe it was because he had been concentrating on the letter that the journalists questions had caught him completely off guard the norwegian hadnt actually alleged anything and his questions had been carefully put yet claasens could see what he was trying to find out no one else would have drawn such a clear conclusion from the norwegians questions but they had struck a chord with claasens claasens knew better than to confirm or deny anything to a member of the press he was scrupulously discreet maybe even overcautious in his professional life if not in his private life why had the norwegian specifically asked about norivon and shipments to china it had been that specific question that had struck a nerve and claasens was worried he had let it show in his voice it had been two months ago that claasens had noticed the anomaly an inconsistency between two shipments and the legally required paperwork both shipments had been to china claasens had queried them naturally lensch his contact at norivon had sounded equally confused at first then within twentyfour hours lensch had come back to him with a reasonable explanation and the paperwork to back it up reasonable but not entirely convincing claasens punched up the account file on his computer and buzzed through for the hardfile paperwork to be brought to him it was minna who came in laid the binder on his desk and walked out again sulkily claasens cursed himself for having broken his not on my own doorstep rule he had banged minna for a month or two tired of her and had then expected everything to go back to business as usual it hadnt worked out that way minna had been a bitch ever since and he couldnt think of a way to get rid of her without making even more trouble for himself he suddenly became aware of the reverberating thudding of the workmen again peter claasenss office was on the top floor of a building in hamburgs altstadt a block to the north of willybrandtstrasse and next to the kontorhaus quarter it was a brandnew building but with a view out over the speicherstadt and sitting so close to brickbuilt icons such as the chilehaus and the sprinkenhof that it had been designed to be a modern but sympathetic interpretation of a traditional kontorhaus with a huge central atrium open to the sky claasens had moved his offices there on the scheduled completion date only to find there were dozens of things still to be finished off by the builders one of them had been the balustrade on his floor around the central atrium which had meant he had been forbidden to move staff into his offices for a further week even now there was a gap in the railings that was blocked off meaning that staff often had to walk around the entire circumference of the building to reach adjoining offices claasens snapped off the band that held the binder closed he had slipped lenschs paperwork in there along with the original documentation showing the shipment discrepancy he had tagged the relevant sections with yellow postit notes claasens looked at his watch it was five pm the rest of the staff would go and emily would phone soon just to check the coast was clear emily made everything go away all the stress all the hassle when he was with her he became someone else someone better he smiled thinking of her phoning of the cutely ungrammatical german she spoke with her sweet english accent then she would come up to his office and they would be alone but first he had to doublecheck those figures just in case the norwegian had had a point it was exactly like when you lost your keys and kept going back to where you thought you had left them claasens stared at the page as if his concentrated attention on the words and figures would restore them to what he had seen before and he had seen the error before except it wasnt there now no paperwork from lensch no yellow postit notes this was mad he flipped the thick binder over and checked inside its back cover just in case the paperwork was there of course that didnt make any sense but what hed been looking at had made even less sense he tried to shut out the sound of the workmen and focused on the file he felt he was going mad everything tallied no discrepancies what the hell was going on his cellphone rang and he knew it would be emily chapter two anna werner asked tentatively i hope you dont mind me asking but have you just farted he hit the button and the side window of the polo slid down they were parked in the kiez at the far end of silbersackstrasse facing towards the reeperbahn here the street was narrow and dark close the window grandad said anna its freezing out there id rather take my chances with the cold anyway who smelt it dealt it anna smiled innocently sometimes youre less than ladylike werner closed the window but left a small gap at the top well you make up for me you remind me of my auntie rachael except youve got less facial hair of course whats the time twenty past midnight im bored i am really really really seriously bloody bored its part of the job i thought you would be used to it by now how come im teamed up with you all of a sudden asked anna is this lord gentleman s idea of keeping me on a tight rein until he can dump me on someone else lord gentleman werner turned to her you know fabel the english commissar where the hell does all that anglophilia come from i mean hes a frisian for fucks sake his mother is scottish said werner you knew that and he went to school there for a while you know you could be more ladylike in the way you speak as well half scottish half frisian no wonder ive never seen him get a round in anyway i take it this was his idea as a matter of fact it wasnt it was mine what oh i see so now you think im the problem child of the family too anna sometimes and dont take offence but just sometimes you are the most insufferable pain in the arse i used to wonder why you always wear that heavyduty leather jacket its to stop the chafing from all those chips you carry around on your shoulders i suggested he team you up with me because i thought we could work well together to be honest im trying to keep you as part of the team i think jan really wants that too oh i know said anna with sarcastic earnestness he really showed me that by giving me the sack you know anna a little less attitude would suit you a whole lot better and youre not sacked yet so you thought we would work well together anna grinned that was before i knew about the farting look over there anna rested her hand on werners forearm and nodded towards the corner of the street a tall woman with blonde hair tied back into a ponytail wearing a long black or dark blue coat moved quickly along the street keeping to the shadows as much as possible she passed the bar on the corner and kept heading towards silbersacktwiete this looks promising there were six unmarked cars dotted around the kiez as there had been every night for the last week since westlands murder all watching over unlit courtyards or like werner and anna the occasional piece of open ground shadowy and dense with bushes and trees the woman slowed her pace looked up and down the street then disappeared into the large triangle of waste ground i think were on said anna she switched the interior light to the off position so that the car would not light up when werner got out ill head in the other direction then cut back he said getting out of the polo and easing the door closed behind him in the dark anna unholstered her sigsauer service automatic checked the magazine and pushed back the safety with her thumb werner passed the car on the far side of the street he maintained an even pace and kept his gaze straight ahead not giving away that he had seen the woman move a shadow within a shadow up ahead and off to the left he was now only thirty metres away from where the woman had concealed herself he guessed that anna was now out of the car and shadowing him on the other side crouching to keep concealed behind the other parked vehicles he kept his shoulders hunched and his hands rammed into the pockets of his thick woollen pea coat as if shunning the cold night but his hand was closed around the automatic he had stuffed into his right pocket without indicating he knew where she was werner angled his course out from the wall that would soon give way to bushes and trees and walked on the cobbled street there was no one else around if this was their woman she would make her move soon he feigned surprise when she stepped out in front of him hello she said werner heard tension almost nervousness in her voice are you looking for fun the woman was tall blonde and heavily made up at first werner thought she was in her early thirties but when he took a step closer he could see that the makeup was thick to hide skin that had seen a lot of summers that depends he said how much im not greedy she said im not supposed to be working here ill make it cheap but we have to do it in here behind the tree she began walking backwards into the shadows crimson lips smiling okay werner followed her without looking up or down the street keeping her eyes held with his in case she spotted anna moving in how much he asked again making it look as if he were reaching for his wallet while using both hands to start easing his automatic from his coat pocket well talk about that later she said and held out her hand come on i thought you girls always like your money up front said werner this was it she reached inside her coat werner drew his automatic and aimed at her face polizei hamburg put both hands on your head do it now he was aware of anna moving in behind the prostitute he didnt know how but she had managed to manoeuvre around to the back of the scruffy triangle of waste ground the hooker stared at werner confused anna grabbed her by the coat collar on your knees now the woman complied and anna snapped a set of cuffs onto one wrist pulled it down behind her back then the other werner radioed in for a custody vehicle further down silbersackstrasse a group of young men came out of a bar they were heading towards hansalbersplatz but the activity on the waste ground caught the eye of one who called the others the knot of men moved up the street craning their necks to see what was going on is everything all right said one with slurred suspicion as they drew near what the fuck ydoin to her anna held up her bronze oval criminal service disc police nothing for you to worry yourself about what the fucks going on asked one of his friends what the fucks she done nothing she said pleadingly ive done nothing im just a working girl and theyve arrested me thats not right said the first drunk shaking his head sombrely thats just not fuckin right yeah fucking pigs one of his friends contributed okay take it easy said werner he moved the handcuffed woman to place himself between her and the group of men keeping hold of her elbow he did a quick head count five they were drunk and slurry but their casual clothes looked expensive rich boys out slumming it in st pauli nevertheless werner wondered how long it would take for the uniformed unit to arrive this isnt any of your concern its just not fuckin right repeated the other they moved forward as a group please dont cause any trouble anna took a step towards them placing herself in their way or fuckin what the first man pushed his sneering face into hers or this she said calmly the drunk doubled up like a jackknife and keeled over onto the cobbles clutching the testicles anna had rammed her knee into she snapped her service automatic out at arms length and scanned the group of youths with it but at groin height next one who gives me trouble gets their dick blown off she said smiling and trust me im an expert shot no matter how fucking small the target they backed away leaving their companion to moan and roll around on the slushy cobbles at that moment a silver and blue polizei hamburg personnel carrier pulled up and three uniformed officers jumped out they took the handcuffed prostitute and placed her in the back whats the story here the uniformed commissar asked pointing to the youth dragging himself to his feet still clutching his bruised groin nothing to report said werner can you take her directly to the presidium all right you sure hes okay i think his prides been hurt said anna and smiled sweetly at werner ill get the car sylvie achtenhagen took a break from the chaos of press cuttings and files that seemed to have exploded across the polished wood floor of her living room she went to the french window and opened it stepping out onto the balcony the night air was iceknife sharp and she welcomed its bite she had been bent over the files for an hour and a half and her brain felt fogged and slow sylvies apartment was on the third floor of a block on edgarrossstrasse in hamburgeppendorf it was elegant and spacious with its own balcony and set in a pastelcoloured apartment building with a fancy art deco facade she had moved into the apartment when her career and her income had started to kick off seriously she had originally had her eye on one of the jugendstil villas on nissenstrasse one street back but they had been too expensive and they would stay too expensive if she didnt deliver the goods for the station soon hansat tv was jointly owned by the neuhansa group and andreas knabbe who ran the station knabbe was a thirtyyearold who looked about twelve and had spent so much time in the us that he seemed more american than german his management style was definitely more american than german knabbe had the habit of calling all his staff by their first names and frequently used the informal du form of address even to the older and more respected members of staff it was all meant to be shirtsleevesinformal and friendly and family atmosphere and crap like that truth was though that if knabbe thought you werent worth your salary or if you didnt fit with his business model then you were history and knabbe had often talked about sylvies success with the angel case back in the nineties increasingly he talked about her career in the past tense sylvie began to feel at the mercy of events that she was just being pulled along by the forces around her just like everybody else that was the problem she had become reactive lazy back then she hadnt waited for things to happen shed made them happen sylvie hugged herself against the cold pulling her thick woollen cardigan tight around her and went back into her living room closing the windows against the chill night she poured herself another glass of red wine and sat crosslegged on the floor letting her eyes range over the scattered material around her somewhere in there was a starting place somewhere there was some detail some forgotten remark or photograph or piece of information that would point her in the direction of this killer the angel killings in st pauli had launched her career she had put so much into the case and had reaped the rewards if she wasnt first to deliver the scoop on these latest killings they could equally easily end her career she sipped again at her wine she could be pretty certain that she would get no help from that pompous arse fabel the polizei hamburg were no great fans of her after her groundbreaking documentary on the case ten years ago cops have long memories and anyway there was something about fabel she disliked intensely and she got the idea that the feeling was mutual sylvie knew that there was only one way forward for her she had to find out who murdered jake westland before the police did she didnt have their resources but she also didnt work under the same kind of restrictions they did and she knew she was a whole lot smarter but her main advantage was that she was pretty sure the cops were looking in the wrong direction they were probably trying to establish links between the current murders and the angel killings ten years ago and this wasnt the angel these latest killings were the work of a copycat sylvie just knew it armin lensch wasnt sure what hurt most his bruised testicles or the laughing and taunting from his mates he had staggered after them as they had made their way to a pub near hansalbersplatz they had found a table and armin had squeezed into the corner sipping tentatively at his beer hoping the nausea would subside police brutality thats what it was police brutality he said in earnest and was greeted with howls of laughter no it wasnt said karl leaning in close that wasnt police brutality that was you having your ass kicked by a girl did you see the fucking size of her you got your ass kicked by a little girl she caught me unawares muttered armin no she didnt she caught you in the balls more laughter fuck you said armin shoving past them and wincing at the surge of pain in his groin fuck the lot of you he staggered out into the cold night air the nausea followed him out of the pub and collided with him he voided his gut onto the pavement a couple of passersby cursed at him fuck the lot of you he said again under his breath he would make the bastards pay who did they think they were armin and his friends all worked in the neustadtnord part of hamburg they all worked there but armin was the star he was the one who was going to the top and he would get all the help he needed now that he had found out what he had found out he started to walk back in the direction of the spielbudenplatz and reeperbahn he would get a taxi there he thought about the cop who had kneed him in the groin he wasnt going to let her get away with that here now he was just like everybody else with too much drink in them but outside the kiez in his normal life he was somebody he was connected he would make the bitch pay but the thought of her made him want to cry to be beaten up by a fucking woman for armin women were good for only one thing he had seen them at work getting promotions over him he knew how they managed that the whores he had had a lot of girlfriends but nothing that had lasted too long normally they would get out of line and armin would give them a slap and theyd get all hysterical on him fuck them fuck them all armin walked on his internal rage and the ache from his groin making him blind to all around him he stopped where the fuck was he he had thought he knew his way around the kiez well enough but he must have taken a wrong turning he took a moment to reorient himself and took the next right he saw the reeperbahn ahead of him but he was further up than spielbudenplatz still it wouldnt be difficult to find a taxi at that moment he caught sight of a beige mercedes and his hand went up an automatic reaction in germany all taxis were beige all beige cars were taxis he eased himself with a moan into the back seat eppendorf he said between his teeth are you okay asked the driver you dont look well fucking great thought armin a female taxi driver just take me to eppendorf he said the woman driver shrugged started the car and took a left into the reeperbahn it was only after she took the wrong turning at the end of the reeperbahn and he realised that they were down by the river that armin noticed that there was no meter in the front of the taxi nor was there a certificate on display with the drivers name photograph and city of hamburg licence by which time it was too late fabel felt exhausted it had been a much more gruelling experience than he had expected susanne had come along too and he had been grateful for her presence that was very worthwhile said a tall thin woman of about fifty as she approached fabel she had a name badge that informed him she was hille deicher representing muliebritas i hope you can take something useful away from our workshop fabel smiled he could never understand why business people selfhelp gurus and others insisted on calling conferences workshops no one made anything none of the people who attended these things worked with their hands it was interesting said fabel but i hope i made it clear that the polizei hamburg needs no prompting to deal with the issue of domestic violence or violence against women in general we are very he struggled for the word proactive interjected susanne helpfully quite said fabel weve been running an antiviolence programme for several years now we do i assure you have a zerotolerance attitude when it comes to violence against women or children and we have one of the most successful records in europe in dealing with the issue but i have to say that we are committed to protecting all of hamburgs citizens regardless of gender or ethnicity im afraid that crime isnt as genderblind said deicher you said yourself in your presentation that the vast majority of murders are men killing women and the vast majority of those are within the domestic environment add to that the countless assaults on women in their own homes all that is true fabel shot a pleading glance at susanne and we have as i said made it a priority area maybe thats why this woman in st pauli is committing these murders deicher smiled without warmth maybe shes motivated to redress the balance of maleonfemale violence after all i cant think of a better place for her to go about it it is a farce that there is a street in hamburg to which women are forbidden entry listen frau deicher fabel felt himself suddenly angry it isnt the police or the state that what does muliebritas mean susanne interrupted fabel directing her question and her smile at deicher it is the latin form of muliebrity you know the quality of being female it is the name of the magazine i work for and the charity we support she looked pointedly back at fabel we organise emergency accommodation for women subject to domestic violence thats an interesting name said susanne still smiling is that where the spanish mujer comes from somehow susanne managed to steer the conversation into calmer waters and after a while deicher drifted off to mingle with other delegates thanks for that said fabel when deicher was gone that woman was really beginning to wind me up i dont know why they insisted on sending me to this because youre the head of hamburgs murder commission and like it or not what frau deicher was saying is true we still live in a society where women are victimised by violence anyway i thought you did really well susanne smiled and straightened his tie as if she were about to send him off to school especially because women get you all flustered what do you mean asked fabel indignantly well you do its pretty clear you think were from a completely different planet but dont worry about it most men are the same fabel was about to respond when his cellphone buzzed he checked the call screener it was the murder commission sorry he said with a shrug as he lifted the phone to his ear probably another murder if it is said susanne even with all of these angel killings at the moment ill bet the victim is female fabel met anna and werner in the hallway outside the interview room both officers wore an expression that was less than triumphant tell me this is our killer said fabel she looked good for it jan said werner she looked really good she lured me onto waste ground and out of sight she didnt seem to know the drill for a hooker and when she reached inside her coat we took her down but her name is viola dahlke explained anna shes fortyfive and has no previous convictions shes a housewife from billstedt that doesnt mean shes not our killer did you get a knife no said anna when she reached inside her coat werner and i both thought that she was going for a knife but it turned out to be a packet of condoms condoms nothing else said anna dont ask me what a fortyfiveyearold housewife from billstedt was doing in the redlight district offering to ring werners bell all right said fabel i wont ill go and ask her myself arrest is a deprivation of choice you are removed to a place not of your choosing and your freedom to leave that place is taken from you career criminals accept arrest as a natural element of their lives even the ones who fight and struggle every centimetre to the cells for everyone else the experience of arrest is traumatic at the very least surreal fabel could tell at first glance that viola dahlke had never been in custody before there was a good chance shed never even set foot inside a police station before far less the police presidium dahlke looked startled confused afraid her face was pale behind her overdone makeup and the stark lighting of the interview room seemed to jaundice her pallor and deepen the shadows under her cheekbones her hair was the dull puttyblonde that many north german women dyed their hair when it started to lose its natural colour and pulled up into a ponytail the makeup and the hairstyle looked all wrong on her like an outfit that didnt fit right frau dahlke i take it it has been explained to you that under the terms of article onethreesix of the criminal procedure code you have the right to remain silent you also have the right to a legal representative do you understand these rights viola dahlke nodded she looked as if she was carrying the world on her shoulders and was resigned to the burden i dont want a lawyer i want to go home im sorry if ive broken the law ill pay the fine i didnt mean any harm im not really im not really one of those women frau dahlke i dont think you understand were not interested in whether you are a prostitute fulltime parttime or not at all i am principal detective chief commissar fabel of the murder commission the officers who arrested you were murder detectives murder dahlke raised eyelids heavy with mascara genuine shock her fear cranked up a ratchet what have i got to do with murder youve heard about what happened last week lets face it frau dahlke you cant have missed it its been all over the press and tv jake westland the british pop singer realisation began to dawn on dahlkes face a terrified realisation she searched fabels face for something reassurance maybe he withheld it ive got nothing to do with that her voice was tremulous i swear ive got nothing to do with that frau dahlke you are a middleaged housewife masquerading as a prostitute and you tried to lure one of my male officers into a dark corner last week less than two hundred metres from where you were arrested jake westland was lured into a dark corner and murdered by someone pretending to be a prostitute dahlke stared at fabel as if lost for words or just lost i take it you can see the seriousness of your position i didnt i wouldnt i didnt mean anyone any harm where were you between eleven pm on saturday the twentysixth and one am on sunday the twentyseventh i was at home in bed who can confirm that my husband again dahlkes expression revealed that her fear had suddenly been ratcheted up a couple of notches oh please no please dont speak to my husband frau dahlke you still dont seem to understand the seriousness of your position if we cannot establish your whereabouts for the time of the murder you will be held here for further questioning and we will carry out full forensic searches of your home if you were at home with your husband then we must have him verify the fact but i didnt do anything wrong she sobbed i didnt hurt anyone i swear do you work frau dahlke i work in the local library parttime and is your husband in employment yes hes an engineer so why do you work as a prostitute i dont i again she looked at fabel with eyes desperate for some kind of understanding then the desperation was gone her head bowed and her gaze became fixed on the table in front of her ive only done it three times she said her voice now leaden and dull once more i dont do it for the money then why why on earth would you put yourself or your health at risk she looked up again her eyes were glossy with tears that tumbled down her cheeks streaking them with mascara im ordinary ive always been ordinary dull i have a dull life with a dull husband and dull kids id never been with another man before i got married i went into the kiez one night just to look i dont know why i wanted to see what happened the type of people who go there i dont know why i did it but i went into a bar and this man i did it with him where in his car the sobs were now silent convulsions between statements i still dont understand why said fabel why would you want to do that you wouldnt understand no man would understand i did it for the excitement to be wanted desired did you get all that asked fabel when he met anna and werner in the hall they had been watching the interview on the closedcircuit video monitor in the next room yep said werner weird do you believe her theres absolutely no way she could have dumped the knife before you arrested her asked fabel none said anna she was in werners sight all the time and we searched her thoroughly immediately after she was arrested nothing and nothing dropped or dumped either fabel shook his head i give up sometimes keep her in and check out her alibi for last week with her husband and try to be i dont know diplomatic oh yeah said anna maybe i should ask him if hes ever seen catherine deneuve in belle de jour im not being funny chef but theres no diplomatic way of telling some guy that his wifes been moonlighting as a hooker and oh by the way dont feel too bad about it its not that shes struggling on what you give her for housekeeping shes doing it for the love of dick annas got a point jan said werner theres no sugaring this pill simply keep to the fact that shes a suspect in a serious crime and that you need to establish her whereabouts on the night in question leave the explaining to her okay chef fabel made his way to his office he checked his email there was an internal note from van heiden to remind him that politidirektor vestergaard the boss of the dead danish cop jespersen was flying down to see them in a couple of days van heiden helpfully provided the flights arrival time ive got nothing better to do muttered fabel he really wanted to talk to jespersens boss but he had thought given that he was up to his neck in a major murder inquiry that van heiden could at least have arranged the pickup he looked at his watch two am hed go home catch four or five hours sleep and head back into the presidium he yawned he was really getting too old for this he thought of viola dahlke and the fact that she would be lying wide awake and afraid considering every thread as the fabric of her life unravelled what the hell had she thought she was doing she had been right he didnt understand just as he hadnt understood why so many of the people he had encountered in his career had done the things they had done human sexuality was a perplexing thing a lot of the murders he had investigated had had bizarre sexual elements to them and fabel had been forced to navigate some dark and stormy seas over the years sometimes it was as if women remained an unknown continent for him he took his english tweed jacket from the back of his chair and unhooked his raincoat from the rack as he made for the door he almost expected the phone to ring it did it was strange given the very nature of his job that the one thing that fabel had never fully come to terms with was the sudden extinction of life he had heard that astronauts once they are truly in space look back at the earth and tend to become in that instant either entirely atheistic or totally convinced of the existence of a god no middle ground whether in reality it was as absolute as that fabel could understand the experience he had a similar feeling every time he looked at the dead a corpse has no humanity it doesnt look like someone sleeping it becomes nothing more than a humanlike object an empty shell and in fabels case most of the dead he looked upon had been forcibly evicted from that shell where some would have seen the vessel abandoned by the departing soul fabel saw only emptiness the final shutting down of an interdependence of biological systems the ending of a universe seen from a nevertoberepeated viewpoint however armin lensch had seen the world he wasnt seeing it now his body lay on a scrubby patch of grass and rubble down near the shore of the river elbe close to hafenstrasse a few empty beer bottles and the wheel of some longdiscarded childs toy served as his pillow and the grass on which he lay was framed by broken red bricks from whatever dock building had stood there at one time the rain had turned to sleet then to snow so the technicians had erected a white forensics tent to protect the crime scene and had illuminated it with lights on telescopic stands like westland lensch had been sliced across the belly and his viscera spilling sideways from the mouthlike gape of the wound glistened in the harsh light of the arc lamps the forensic team had erected a nauseating stench from his slicedopen abdomen lingered in the air of the forensics tent a man almost completely concealed in white hooded coveralls blue latex gloves and a surgical mask came over to fabel hello jan holger brauner the forensics chief slipped the mask from his face and smiled its a nippy one tonight fabel returned the smile brauner was almost invariably cheerful despite the nature of his work or maybe because of it hi holger whats the story from my estimation were talking about a male twentynine years old oneseventynine centimetres tall whitecollar job finance sector blood group o rhesus negative suffers from a nut allergy and lives in eppendorf very impressive sherlock said fabel you found his wallet didnt you no of course not i established it all with dna and the arcane skills of the forensic wizard do you never watch csi brauner grinned and held up a plastic evidence bag containing a black leather wallet and a state identity card its all in there he said all his credit cards and cash too as far as i can see cellphone as well robbery doesnt seem to have been the motive leave the detective work to us lab rat said fabel with a grin someone entered the tent behind him and he turned to see anna and werner it had been werner who had called fabel werner rolled his eyes as he and anna stepped back into the enclosed scene of crime fabel read his meaning annas makeup was thrown out in stark contrast to the pallor of her skin it was the same effect he had seen on viola dahlke in annas case it was armin lenschs mutilated belly which she worked so hard not to look at that was the cause of her lack of colour tough little annas achilles heel and another reason for her to consider a transfer you all right fabel asked im fine said anna defensively but she still avoided looking at lensch so weve got number two looks like were at the start of another series i need you two to get on to finding out when he was last seen who he was with werner what is it fabel noticed werner leaning close to the body staring at the dead mans face intently anna come here and look yeah very funny no anna i mean it look at him isnt he the guy from earlier when we were arresting dahlke anna moved closer holding the back of her hand to her nose shit youre right okay said fabel lets have it just a coincidence chef said anna i think its a coincidence remember we told you there was a bit of trouble when we arrested dahlke the drunks i remember he was the ringleader said werner fabel looked down at lensch the dead mans lips gaped slightly as if to speak and his eyes were still half open as if a camera had caught him midblink his hair was cut short and had been styled with some form of gel the shirt looked as if it had been expensive but the lower half was now sodden with blood lenschs trousers were unfastened and his fly half unzipped the slice across his belly again spoke of a single purposeful stroke whoever had killed him had known what they were doing had done this before so why wasnt he arrested asked fabel did he go quietly he moaned a bit said anna and fabel caught werner firing a look at her dont tell me anna fabel said exasperated listen chef things were starting to turn ugly we were waiting for backup and sonny boy here started to give us gyp it is regulations that if someone acts aggressively and theyve been warned to stay one and a half metres away if they step closer we can knock them to the ground is that what happened did you give him a formal warning we told him to back off said werner it was this guy who was stirring it up anna acted properly jan did you draw your firearm yes said anna so why havent you submitted a report did you strike him well yes kind of a sigh i kneed him in the groin marvellous bloody marvellous anna you realise youre going to have to make a full report to that effect any swelling you caused will probably be noted in the autopsy for christs sake anna and you werner i thought youd have the sense to keep her on a short chain a short what anna glowered at fabel okay anna leave it said werner jan when this guy here started to kick up we thought there was a good chance we had the angel in custody or at least jake westlands murderer and like anna said we were outnumbered i think you should let this one go oh you do do you fabel sighed anna make sure you have a complete report on my desk tomorrow he looked at the id brauner had handed him in the polythene evidence bag armin lensch did you see where he went after you had dealt with him he followed on after his mates said anna they went in the direction of hansalbersplatz then i suggest you get enlargements of this he tossed her the evidence bag with lenschs identity card and start going around the bars to see if you can find where he was and when werner check out next of kin speaking of which have you seen dahlkes husband not yet we were on our way when we got this shout okay leave anna to get started on the bars ill arrange a uniform to chaperone her and you head out to get the story from dahlkes husband okay jan said werner but its a bit redundant now isnt it i mean she cant have done this guy shes been in custody since we last saw him alive we still need to confirm her alibi for westland fabel made his way down the steep embankment to st pauli hafenstrasse where his car was parked next to the silver and blue police cruisers he felt tired and irritated and for a moment he nearly headed off in the direction of the city centre and poseldorf where he had had his attic flat for five years instead he turned west towards altona his new home his shared home hamburg is a city where gentility and prurience rub shoulders uncomfortably the deliberate vulgarity of st pauli sits directly next to the restrained gentility of one of the grander parts of altona back in the days when altona was danish st pauli was the marshy nomansland between it and german hamburg both altona and hamburg were resolutely lutheran catholics seeking freedom to worship had to find it outside the boundaries of both cities hence the street called grosse freiheit the great freedom but st pauli had also become a dumping ground a place known in the late middle ages for its unsavoury inhabitants its poorhouses and its pestilence hospitals yet as fabel headed along breitestrasse it took only a couple of minutes for the crude glamour of st pauli to give way to the wide treelined boulevard of palmaille with its grand villas on either side it had started to snow and the naked branches of the trees sparkled in the lamplight fabel suddenly had an idea he pulled over to the kerb and reached down between his legs and under the drivers seat his fingertips brushed against something small and metallic got you you little swine after a little scrabbling he retrieved his mp player and put it into the plastic tray behind the handbrake he replaced his seat belt pulled out into the road and resumed his journey as he did so his smile faded at the next junction he made a left into behnstrasse then another left into struenseestrasse left again and he was back on palmaille it was still there fabel had first noticed it as he had driven off after finding his mp player headlights about sixty metres behind him pulling out maybe thirty seconds after he had the last three manoeuvres had made no sense and the car behind had followed what bothered fabel was that he had only just picked up on it whoever was following him knew what they were doing god knew how long they had been on his tail at least from the murder scene and maybe before that fabel was not far from the apartment he shared with susanne but he was not going to drive there he had no idea who was on his tail or how dangerous they were he swung across palmaille and headed straight on towards neumuhlen and ovelgonne as he drove he flipped open his cellphone principal chief commissar fabel here he said to the operations room officer who answered his call im in altona on palmaille heading west ive just passed the fishing museum wheres your nearest traffic camera theres one at the junction with maxbrauerallee im in a dark blue bmw series old shape theres very little on the road but theres a car behind me when i turn north into maxbrauerallee could you get his index number and check it out yes chief commissar do you need assistance i could send an area car its probably nothing but if theres one available send it to the maxbrauerallee call me back on this number when you have a make on the car fabel turned into maxbrauerallee at the intersection as he drove north he checked that his tail was still there the white baroque edifice of altona city hall slid by on his left and as he passed the road end at platzderrepublik he saw the silver and blue police cruiser waiting at the junction his cellphone rang chief commissar fabel presidium ops room here we got the index plate the car behind you is a mercedes clk cabriolet registered to a sylvie achtenhagen edgarrossstrasse altona isnt that yes it is thanks tell the patrol car to pull her over fabel drew into the kerb once he had seen in his rearview mirror that the mercedes had been pulled over he got out and approached achtenhagen who was out of her car and remonstrating with the two uniformed officers thanks ill take it from here he said to the uniforms this looks like harassment said achtenhagen in halfhearted indignation pulling over members of the press for no good reason other than that is the fact that im embarrassing you by pointing out your incompetence to the public are you quite finished asked fabel with a sigh i want to know why you were following me i wasnt i live in altona cut the crap frau achtenhagen its nearly threethirty in the morning and i have a home to go to you trailed me in a complete circle youve been on my tail since i left the murder scene theres been another murder asked achtenhagen her shock was about as genuine as her earlier indignation fabel folded his arms across his body signalling his impatience for achtenhagen to stop the pretence okay she sighed but ive got every right to drive where i want and follow who i want you and your department have been less than helpful i decided i would keep tabs on you it sure as hell paid dividends tonight who was the victim fabel remained silent listen herr fabel you and i havent got off to a good start we havent got off to any kind of start its not my job to deal with the media i told you that and lets face it frau achtenhagen satellite television isnt exactly the home of indepth quality news analysis ive heard your theories about how broadcasters should make the news not just report it all you want is sensationalism gory details and a cartooncharacter villain to scare the public with i deal in the real world we can be of help to each other said achtenhagen no we cant or at least you cant help me this isnt one of your cheap saturdaynight dramas catching and convicting a murderer means using professional policing and forensic skills plus modern technology and collating legally obtained evidence its not about some satellitetv nancy drew putting it all together for us thats not what im talking about achtenhagens voice was raised now whatever you think of what i do there are things i can find out that you cant people i can talk to who would run a mile rather than speak to a cop i know all about carstens kaminski manofthepeople boss of davidwache you think he has his finger on the reeperbahn pulse he doesnt know the half of whats going on hes still a cop people dont like cops people like the television they like me they talk to me as i told you listen achtenhagen cut him off im not saying that i can deliver the killer im not even saying that i can offer hard evidence but theres a chance a real chance that i can point you in the right direction thats very publicspirited of you fabel made no attempt to suppress his sneer youll come to us before you spout your theories on hansat i suppose as a matter of fact i will on one condition and that is if i deliver something which leads you to the killer then you give me an exclusive on the arrest five no ten hours before you release the details to the rest of the press even if i were remotely interested in such an offer im not in a position to agree to it our press department has got really good relationships with the local media it wouldnt have for long if we cut them out of breaking news your press people would get over it and youd have your killer achtenhagen tugged at the collar of her coat listen its freezing here my apartment isnt far why dont i make you a coffee and we can talk about it in comfort im going home frau achtenhagen said fabel his voice suddenly cold and hard well at least think about what ive said goodnight frau achtenhagen fabel got into his car he watched achtenhagen in his rearview mirror until she had driven off he sat for a moment his mind going over his exchange with the television journalist before he put the bmw in gear and headed towards othmarschen fabel parked outside the psychiatric centre of the university clinic hamburgeppendorf and with a nod to the security man on the desk headed up the stairs to the first floor he knocked on the door displaying the nameplate dr eckhardt forensic psychology hello stranger the woman behind the desk was in her late thirties with dense dark hair gathered up in a french plait she spoke in a soft bavarian accent fabel smiled hi i hope i didnt wake you when i came in last night you know me said susanne when im out im out when did you get in about four i had a liein this morning though he yawned loudly it didnt do you much good you wont be working late tonight will you not if i can help it said fabel anyway i cant stop you were on my way i called in to give you this he dropped a heavy buff file on susannes desk i couldnt email it all this to do with the angel case the angel copycat case if my instincts are right could you have a look through it ill raise the appropriate paperwork to cover your time fabel made for the door but checked himself frowning do you want to know something strange about last night i mean what sylvie achtenhagen you know the tv presenter and reporter the one on hansat well she was following me i had a silverandblue pull her over she started to offer me help on this case nonsense i know but the strange thing is he stopped midsentence laughed and shook his head no i must have been too tired no go on well she was really trying to persuade me to help her get the scoop on the angel case i could have sworn she was offering to have sex with me youre kidding no she said i should come to her place so we could discuss it in comfort she must be really desperate for a story susanne arched an eyebrow thanks for that but yes i rather think she is god knows she did more harm than good with the original angel case its almost as if she has to find out who the killer is susanne leaned back in her chair rattling a pencil between perfect porcelainwhite teeth as i remember sylvie achtenhagen is a rather attractive woman her charms are completely wasted on me then said fabel cant stand the woman on your way where asked susanne what fabel frowned you said i was on your way oh ive got to pick up this danish cop from the airport he looked at his watch shit id better go have a look at that when you get a chance and ill talk to you later standing in the arrivals hall of hamburgfuhlsbuttel airport and holding up a clipboard with the name vestergaard on it in large block capitals written with a felttip marker fabel felt faintly ridiculous he stood alongside others doing exactly the same thing some with names others with company logos all the others however were professional drivers sent to pick up business travellers flying into hamburg fabel could simply have sent a patrol car with a uniformed officer to pick up the danish cop but he had thought it more diplomatic to collect him himself there seemed to be a protocol an etiquette to these things that fabel always seemed to get wrong he had decided it was best for him to make a personal appearance it appeared that vestergaard was a highranking officer and after all one of his men had died while in hamburg but standing there with his clipboard fabel felt less like a diplomat more like a chauffeur and a lot like an idiot the arrivals board announced the landing of the copenhagen flight and after a few minutes a wave of business suits swelled through the arrivals gate fabel played the game of scanning the emerging figures making a bet with himself that he would be able pick out vestergaard before he made himself known to fabel he was momentarily distracted by a very attractive blonde woman wearing an expensive suit and a deep blue coat she caught his eye for a moment and he looked away partly in embarrassment at having been caught watching her and partly in annoyance that he had been distracted from his challenge then he saw him a tall lightblond man of about fifty whose business suit did nothing to disguise the bulk of his shoulders or take the edge off his tough look he had cop written all over him and fabel imagined that jespersen in life had looked a little like that the man nodded in fabels direction and headed his way fabel smiled and was about to offer his hand when the man walked straight past him and handed his bags to the chauffeur who had been standing next to fabel holding up a board with the ibm logo on it to add insult to the injury fabels deductive powers had suffered the dane proceeded to give instructions to the driver in a broad bavarian accent i guess i wasnt what you were expecting a female voice said in english fabel turned in the direction of the voice the attractive young woman he had noticed earlier was now standing directly in front of him she arched an eyebrow politidirektor vestergaard he asked feebly yes im karin vestergaard im sorry i know its so confusing she sighed and rolled her eyes i got promoted because im so damned good at making coffee and they sent me here because all the men were too busy solving really complicated cases fabel gave a halflaugh at the joke then let his smile die when he saw the cold glint in vestergaards iceblue eyes not a good start my car is parked outside he said weakly it wasnt a cosy journey after fabel asked karin vestergaard how her flight had been and what the weather was like in copenhagen he struggled to make smalltalk as they walked to his parked bmw politidirektor vestergaard was obviously not the smalltalk type they drove in silence down the alsterkrugchausee towards the city centre we have an election coming up in a few months he said eventually with artificial cheer for principal mayor effectively thats prime minister for the state of hamburg anyway one of the candidates is actually a dane well shes a germandane you know from the danishspeaking minority in schleswigholstein karin vestergaard turned to fabel and gave him a weak smile of uninterested indulgence there was something about her face that troubled him but he couldnt work out what it was they passed the sign informing them that they were entering the city quarter of eppendorf isnt this where your institute for judicial medicine is based she asked yes said fabel indeed it is you know hamburg no i checked before i came down is that where jens is thats where the morgue is yes id like to see jens now you want to go now i thought id take you to your hotel first before going into the presidium i know that i dont understand karin vestergaard interrupted him her voice cold and hard i dont see the problem if were passing through eppendorf i want to see jenss body can we go or not fabel shrugged and turned off into geschwisterschollstrasse the university clinic hamburgeppendorf was a huge complex of buildings almost like a small town in itself sitting between geschwisterschollstrasse to the north and martinistrasse to the south the university clinic even had its own park to the south of martinistrasse and as fabel passed along its northern boundary towards butenfeld huge cranes towered above the complex the hospital here is a teaching one explained fabel theyre building a new campus its all going to be very hightech if vestergaard was impressed she hid it well instead she stared grimly ahead as if her mind was already ahead of them and in the morgue with her dead colleague fabel found a parking space outside the institute for judicial medicine and led vestergaard in through the glass double doors to the waiting area it took fabel a couple of minutes to arrange a viewing of jespersens body during which time vestergaard sat impassively in the reception area we can go in now he explained and she followed him into the morgue fabel didnt know what to expect in the mortuary despite having shared the journey from the airport with her the danish policewoman remained a complete stranger to him he didnt know anything about her professional relationship with jespersen or what kind of personal relationship they might have had fabel watched her face when the sheet was pulled back from jespersens body again he found himself distracted by her appearance there really was something about the way she looked that perplexed him then he realised what it was her features were perfect her face possessed an absolute symmetry and every feature was in classic proportion the effect was strange it gave her beauty true archetypal beauty but it was also a forgettable beauty fabel watched the bland beauty of karin vestergaards face as her subordinates dead body was revealed to her there was a flicker of something in the expression and then it was gone in the same instant but fabel had recognised it anger she was angry with jespersen for having died im very sorry said fabel had you worked together long when is the autopsy scheduled tomorrow said fabel two pm vestergaard leaned forward and examined jespersens face more closely then she pulled the sheet completely clear of his body what are you looking for asked fabel no longer hiding his irritation with her uncommunicativeness wholl be doing the autopsy herr doctor moller hes our chief pathologist hes really tell him to look for puncture wounds needle marks particularly in hidden areas under hair skin folds around the anus look said fabel i think this has gone on long do you believe this is a natural death vestergaard turned to him more cold fire in her eyes fabel sighed it looks very much like a heart attack do you believe this was a natural death she repeated no or at least i have my doubts it was anna wolff one of my officers who brought me into this she thinks theres something fishy going on too vestergaard straightened up but continued to gaze at the face of her dead colleague after a moment she turned to fabel again we need to talk fabel took vestergaard to her hotel on the alter wall somehow it didnt surprise him that she had booked into the same hotel where jespersen had died it didnt surprise him but he thought it illadvised he arranged for coffee to be served in a quiet seating area off the bar while vestergaard took her bags to her room i thought wed have a coffee and then head up to the police presidium and talk about jespersen lets talk here she said theres no one around neutral territory then we can head up to the presidium neutral territory said fabel were supposed to be cooperating i didnt think that colleagues needed neutral territory just an expression said vestergaard sipping her coffee and leaving a trace of pink on the rim of the cup maybe its just that my english isnt as good as yours i notice you dont speak english with a german accent i learned it when i was young he said annoyed at the distraction technique he knew what she was doing and she knew he knew they were both police officers both interrogators i am halfscottish i grew up bilingual i see another sip its unusual to hear a german speak without an accent in denmark we subtitle all englishlanguage films and tv you dub them germans dont have the true exposure to the language we do like a cultural condom thats why we danes and the dutch speak better english with less of an accent i mean but i noticed your lack of accent when you picked me up at the airport it would have made things easier for jens you didnt meet him you say we spoke on the phone once fabel laughed without warmth is this an interrogation frau vestergaard if so id remind you that i am the police officer here and if there is anything suspicious about jespersens death then it is my case not yours this is my jurisdiction jens didnt like germans she said still cool cold did you know that no fabel sighed any particular reason the usual the war like me jens was very proud to be a danish police officer its a noble heritage to have do you know one of our proudest moments i imagine youre going to tell me during the war unlike the police in other occupied countries the danish police wouldnt collaborate they barely cooperated basically they just tried to get on with the job they were supposed to do being policemen then when you germans told them they had to guard installations against attack by the danish resistance they told you to shove it so do you know what happened fabel shrugged you sent them to buchenwald concentration camp listen frau vestergaard i didnt send anyone to concentration camps i wasnt alive then and even if i had been i wouldnt have been a nazi fabel was annoyed that he had let his irritation show she was deliberately baiting him really she said as if vaguely surprised anyway dozens of danish police officers died in buchenwald it was only after they were transferred and their status changed to that of prisoners of war that the death rate slowed down but they still wouldnt do what you i mean the germans i mean the nazis sorry i get confused who it was who was supposed to have violated denmark wanted them to do and thats why jespersen hated germans to be frank i get the feeling you share his prejudice jens was from a long family tradition of police service his grandfather was a policeman during the war and his father who was only twentyone back then was also a police officer they were both transported to buchenwald jenss grandfather was one of the ones who died his father barely survived i see i understand but whats your point that jens would not have set foot in germany unless he had a damned good reason to do so and you dont know why he was here i have an idea but thats all jens was for the first time since he had met her vestergaard looked lost for the right word jens could be difficult he had a tendency to go off and do his own thing follow a hunch theres nothing wrong in following a hunch no not if you keep your colleagues your superior informed of where you are and what you are doing but we got an official request from you yourself to assist jespersen you knew he was coming here he told me some of what he had going on but not all things were difficult with jens he was oldschool and i started out under his command he found it difficult to accept that he was now accountable to me added to which he had a habit of going off on his own little crusades vestergaard must have picked up on the subtle change in fabels expression it looks like ive struck a chord she said long story said fabel i have i had an officer who did the same thing it cost her her sanity i see well i think jespersens last crusade might have cost him his life have you heard of the sirius patrol fabel shook his head the sirius patrol is a specialforces unit of the danish navy it is responsible for patrolling the extreme northeast of greenland just in case our russian friends ever come to call these guys are the toughest youre likely to come across they cover nearly twenty thousand kilometres of coastline travelling mainly by dogsled in temperatures that can hit minus thirty and of course in winter they do it all in perpetual night jespersen a twoyear tour after that when he joined the danish national police he was accepted for the politiets aktionsstyrke or aks its our police special forces a national swat team used for major incidents drug busts et cetera i take it you can see where im going with this that jespersen was a tough son of a bitch that and the fact that he was extremely fit he kept himself in the same kind of shape hed been in as a sirius soldier not a heartattack candidate not a normal heartattack candidate lets say of course its possible and it would be the most straightforward of explanations but i just dont see it unless the autopsy reveals some congenital cardiac weakness vestergaard drained her cup and shook her head when fabel went to refill it too much coffee makes me nervy fabel tried to picture a nervy karin vestergaard but it was beyond his powers of imagination so whats all this about looking for puncture wounds do you have some kind of idea whos behind jespersens death all i have chief commissar is a bundle of unconnected facts and i suspect thats all jens had but he somehow saw a bigger picture i am willing to share everything i know but i expect a little quid pro quo i was assured of your full cooperation by herr van heiden i would appreciate it if that cooperation extended to keeping me fully informed of your progress i suspect that this case extends across our common border maybe beyond and if my if our suspicions are right then we are talking about the assassination in hamburg of a senior danish police officer no small matter fabel looked at vestergaard for a moment she had freshened up her makeup when she had gone up to her room a different shade it had changed her look subtly maybe having perfectly regular features allowed you to alter your look more easily than other people despite her beauty fabel imagined that karin vestergaard could even make herself look plain and uninteresting i take it youre staying in hamburg for some time ive left my booking open maybe we should think about a different hotel this was the murder scene if jespersens death was murder then it might help to be close to it vestergaards expression still gave nothing away of the emotions that might be behind it as you wish said fabel but im going to assign an officer to you just to keep an eye on things thats not necessary said vestergaard i told you that jens jespersen had once been my superior rather than the other way around well that was when we were both in the politiets aktionsstyrke trust me mr fabel im more than capable of looking after myself so was jespersen said fabel it was comforting to be back in norway in oslo in this light strange but comforting the clouds had dispersed from the sky and the everoptimistic oslo cafe owners had placed aluminium tables and chairs and the occasional strategically placed patio heater outside on the streets birta henningsen sat at a pavement cafe drinking her coffee and watching from behind her sunglasses the iceblue oslotrikken tramcars passing up and down the street under a matching iceblue sky lightly streaked with wisps of white cloud the february sun that shone on oslo did so brightly if without any real warmth but that suited birta perfectly she belonged in this climate in this light this clean cool air in this environment birta had of course spent time in the mediterranean and other beautiful parts of the world mainly through her work but there she had always felt conspicuous foreign and birta did not like to feel conspicuous it was here in the north that she felt at home birta had eaten a light meal and now the coffee restored some of her energy it had been a long drive from stockholm seven hours and the day before she had driven all the way from copenhagen crossing the oresund bridge she would drive back to stockholm afterwards she found her thoughts drifting to the meeting arranged for later in the day it was an important one one of the most important of her career she had prepared well for it she found that she performed better was less nervous if she had concluded all her research and preparation well in advance and simply relaxed immediately before there was a mother with two children three tables away birta watched them the mother would have been roughly the same age shared birtas colouring and was dressed in typical oslo chic expensive but restrained and warm but unlike birta there was something not entirely contained about the young mother a vague sense of chaos birta recognised it as the consequence of motherhood that a substantial fraction of the womans life was no longer hers to control and birta wondered what that must feel like she turned back to watch the trams and the passersby she had never had children she had never divided herself and she never would she had chosen career and herself above all else and now she sat under the pale norwegian sky watching the trams pass and glancing over at the woman and her two children and felt a vague ache in her chest this was futile sentimental wandering she was annoyed with her own selfindulgence since shed arrived like the trip to holmenkollen birta had not planned to visit holmenkollen but she had felt the need as soon as she had approached oslo she had driven overnight and had approached the city along the mosseveien highway that ran along the shore as the day had broken painfully beautiful in deep red and purpleblue silk over the oslofjord she had parked in a municipal car park on the outskirts of the city and had taken the tbane train to holmenkollen and mingled with the handful of offseason tourists at the ski centre like the tourists she had looked out over the city from the top of the ski jump but it had been the circuit around the centre the one used for the biathlon that she had come to see one more time it had been a pointless exercise and so unlike her and now she sat in the centre of oslo surrendering to pangs of jealousy as she watched a woman fuss over her children this was not what she was here for she was in oslo on business not to sightsee or for indulgent selfreflection she paid in cash for her coffee and left without another glance at the woman and her children the sun was already low and the long nordic winter night would come soon it would be dark time for her meeting okay said fabel its a deal we share information but i have to say that for the moment its going to be very much a oneway trade youre the one with the background info all ive got at the moment is something that looks like a death from natural causes like i told you said vestergaard jens jespersen was my commanding officer when we were both in the politiets aktionsstyrke i learned a hell of a lot from him during that time i dont think id be where i am today if it hadnt been for him fabel watched vestergaard closely for signs of thaw in the ice maiden if they were there they were too small for him to detect she spoke of jespersen with respect even a hint of affection but there was no warmth in her voice there was a major drugs bust six years ago we set up an elaborate sting or more correctly jens set up an elaborate sting and we landed goran vuja i c you know the bosnian serb warlord turned drug smuggler i remember said fabel its funny how people like vuja i c start off with some kind of ethnic or political agenda and then embrace the criminal free market with enthusiasm he was a bad bastard from all accounts hes dead isnt he ill get to that but yes he died four years ago vuja i c was as slimy as he was a vicious piece of work he had been a member of a bosnian serb police unit and was directly involved in some of the atrocities that went on during the bosnian war he was never tried at the hague not enough evidence but the bastard was there at the massacres and the rape camps anyway jens jespersen set up a sting and we took vuja i c down a few months before we had managed to trip up a danish businessman called peter knudsen who had been dabbling in drug exporting jens did a deal with him and knudsen collaborated with us in setting up vuja i c we used knudsens yacht and jens played the part of knudsen we staged three meetings on the yacht and one in copenhagen vuja i c went along with it all the last meeting on the yacht was where the money changed hands electronically it was a very expensive op for us to put on but it seemed very successful so how come vuja i c went free asked fabel unfortunately jens hadnt dotted all the is or crossed all the ts and vuja i c s legal team started to argue entrapment it wouldnt have got him off but his legal team managed to get him bailed between hearings his passport was impounded though and he was restricted from travelling outside denmark it was all a bit of a mess and to be frank it wasnt just that my career overtook jenss it was the fact that his came to a standstill he was blamed for leaving open a potential loophole through which goran vuja i c could walk free anyway it was when vuja i c was on bail pending trial that someone decided to relieve the state of the burden of court proceedings we found him in tivoli gardens just sitting in the rain on a bench someone had used a small thin file or knife to stab him in the heart it was a truly professional job there was hardly any blood and it took us ages to find the entry wound beneath his sternum i guess you make a lot of enemies in his line of business and some strange partners said vestergaard she paused while a waiter came in and took their cups away you see that was the start of jenss obsession with the valkyrie the valkyrie vestergaard held up her hand as if to slow fabel down we had set up this luxury yacht for the sting fitted it out with bugs and hidden cameras to record the whole operation one of the things we got on tape was vuja i c talking about the third partner in the deal a sleeping partner who had financed the whole drug deal and was looking for the lions share of the profit it was this anonymous third partner we had really wanted to uncover so you think it was this partner that had vuja i c killed almost definitely vuja i c was nothing if he wasnt a negotiator all through his questioning he had kept shtum about the identity of the moneyman he knew that if his defence of entrapment didnt work he could do a deal by giving up the name of his backer but anyway if we go back to the conversation we recorded on the boat vuja i c had mentioned that the moneyman had a contract killer who was the best in the business vuja i c claimed that this contract killer had cleaned up the competition for him at the behest of this sleeping partner he also claimed this killer went by the name of the valkyrie that she was a woman and he claimed that if the circumstances called for it this killer was an expert at making the deaths look like accidents or natural causes oh and by the way the crooked businessman we used to set vuja i c up also died prematurely so thats why you want our pathologist to check closely for puncture marks or anything unusual exactly but vuja i c had more to say about the valkyrie and this is where it gets really interesting for you he claimed that she was based here in hamburg fabel leaned back in the leather sofa and gazed out across the empty lounge and through the vast plateglass windows to the alsterfleet beyond you believe this jens did but like i said he didnt share information the way he should have and from what ive seen of your report his laptop and notebooks have disappeared as well i thought he was travelling surprisingly light and we were pretty sure his cellphone was wiped but we didnt know for sure that stuff had been taken ill get someone to start questioning the staff vestergaard shook her head no point his stuff wasnt filched by immigrant cleaners whoever murdered jens took them if he was murdered but from what you say if his death is foul play then everything would seem to point to this valkyrie said fabel he found his thoughts wandering as head of the hamburg murder commission it was no small thing for fabel to be told that an internationally active contract killer was based in his city it would be a natural assumption of course you do know that this valkyrie may not even exist and if he or she does then its by no means certain that he or she is based in hamburg it could simply be that communication is channelled through here somehow jespersen wasnt killed by a communication channel said fabel what else have you got i checked what i could of jenss paperwork in copenhagen also his internet history et cetera he had piles and i mean piles of research material on the former east german police and security apparatus he had detailed lists of former officers of the volkspolizei as i think you called it and of course masses of stuff on the stasi and you think that this is connected somehow with this supposed hamburg hit woman i dont know maybe theres no connection but jens was very focused on this investigation officially he was looking for vuja i c s killer but his attitude towards the case was bordering on the obsessive anyway there were a few names of former stasi people i mean which he seemed to take a very special interest in one above all others a major georg drescher seemed to be the main focus of his attentions interestingly from what i can see drescher simply vanished into thin air as soon as the wall came down drescher worked for the hva department of the stasi the espionage wing my guess is that as soon as drescher sensed the wind changing direction in eightynine he used his stasi resources to set up under a new identity maybe even here in west germany but why jens was so interested in drescher i dont know for sure having read through the notes i reckon that drescher would appear to have been a major figure in the recruitment and training of agents for deployment in the west so you think this valkyrie is an exstasi agent it would make sense fabel frowned he did the arithmetic and somehow the idea of a now middleaged woman carrying out such efficient assassinations didnt add up lets not get ahead of ourselves well see what the autopsy reveals and then explore all possibilities anything else a few other names notes on vuja i c s contacts that kind of thing a couple of strange things as well youve heard of gennady frolov the russian oligarch thats the one personal wealth valued at twelve and a half billion jens had made a whole lot of notes about him just general stuff and not a dossier vuja i c s moneyman i doubt it said vestergaard i did a bit of digging and compared with most of the other oligarchs frolov is snow white but it is all a bit odd as well as frolov jens had tons of information and corporate literature on vantage north the ship designers and builders in flensburg they designed and built frolovs luxury yacht the snow queen and youre sure that frolov couldnt be the moneyman behind vuja i c it doesnt make sense the supply of narcotics to scandinavia and northern germany is a multimilliondollar business but thats still peanuts to the likes of frolov the risk of conviction would vastly outweigh any benefit fabel leaned back for a moment and rubbed his chin as he thought who is olaf olaf in jespersens notebook he wrote the name olaf do you know who that could be vestergaard frowned i know a hell of a lot of olafs and so did jens but i cant think of anyone in particular was there anything else in jespersens notes that could be useful no not really karin vestergaard reached into her attache case and pulled out a file but maybe youll see some relevance in something ive missed ive got a copy of everything in here fabel reached out to take the file from vestergaard but she held it firm for a moment ive shared all i have mr fabel i take it you intend to live up to your part of the bargain i told you i would give you my fullest cooperation the irritation was evident in fabels tone i will keep you informed of everything as it happens then im sure well get along fine said vestergaard with a smile devoid of warmth and let go of the file chapter three after birta picked up the hire car from the municipal car park and drove out of oslo she tossed the ticket out of the window as she cleared the city limits when she returned the car there would be no evidence that she had ever been in oslo or even in norway she had programmed several false destinations around stockholm into the cars satnav system the sum of which would account for the kilometres accrued on the odometer throughout her trip she had observed every speed limit every traffic regulation and because she hadnt stopped over in a hotel and had paid for all fuel with cash there was no evidence that she had crossed the border birta switched on the music system and wolfgang haffner filled the car the german jazz and the norwegian winter landscape fitted together perfectly and she eased back into her seat but she found she couldnt stop thinking back to the cafe and the woman with her children birtas clients place was to the north of drobak set deep into the forest on the shore of a small lake she knew he worked from home and this had been the ideal location for a meeting she had even identified the ideal window in his schedule she parked in a car park in drobak she had established in her reconnaissance that it was unmetered and not overlooked by cctv cameras she changed in the back of the car pulling on three layers of thick woollen socks partly to keep out the cold but mainly to allow the heavy oversized mens boots she then put on to fit her carrying out a meeting in snow was a blessing and a curse at the same time she would leave the tracks she wanted where she wanted but shed have to take care not to leave unintentional signs of her passing birta slipped into her dark parka and tucked her blonde hair under the black woollen beanie hat making sure every strand was secure and out of sight she put on her rucksack and slung the rifle case by its strap over one shoulder then made her way on foot from the car park and out through the back of the town keeping out of sight of the houses it took her half an hour to reach where the forest opened up around the lake at the north end the lights of a house reflected on the water three rooms were illuminated but she knew he would be alone his wife and children were visiting family in frederikstad and wouldnt be back until lunchtime tomorrow he was staying at home to pack and prepare for his trip to china in two days time birta made her way through the trees and around to where the long drive swept round to the front of the house the drive had been cleared the snow pushed into metrehigh banks on either side birta edged along backwards sweeping her footprints away as she moved until she found a thinner stretch of piled snow she jumped over it and onto the drive from here on there would be no tracks to find before moving closer to the house she unslung the rifle from her shoulder unrolled the canvas sheet and laid out the parts for assembly what the hell are you doing a male voice came from behind her everything happened in one movement she stood turned unfastened the sheath and arced the knife up and into his chest under his sternum she thrust it with calculated extra force to penetrate the mans heavy parka and the layers beneath the man didnt react he would not have seen the knife its nonreflective black polycarbide surface and the speed of her strike making it invisible in the dark still in the same continuous movement birta twisted the knife the mans eyes and mouth gaped at her as if in outrage or confusion then he sank to his knees birta stood to one side and let him tilt forward and crash onto his face she turned him over and established two facts within a second he was dead he was not her client the dead man was in his late forties it was difficult to tell through the layers of clothes but he looked heavyset she opened up his parka and felt the warmth of a body that would no longer generate its own temperature she checked him for a weapon none not a bodyguard or cop he had been carrying a large snow shovel and birta guessed he must have been some kind of handyman why hadnt he come up in her reconnaissance she cursed to herself and wiped the blade of her knife clean on the shoulder of his coat at the same time scanning the length of the driveway and the forest on its fringes she resheathed the knife unzipped her parka and unholstered her silenced automatic no sign of anyone else scanning the forest and the snowbank edge of the drive birta chose a spot and dragged the dead man across to it through the snow and into the woods back on the drive she picked up the unattached telescopic sight and used it to study the big bright squares of window on the house she knew where the clients study was and that he should be there working until about nine the blinds had been left open and she could see the whole study no client she checked the other illuminated rooms nothing this was not good birta felt a vague panic in her chest and used her will to force it from her as shed been taught to do when you were afraid when you became stressed that was when things went wrong that was when you slipped up with the meeting that was when people noticed you as you made your departure calm stay calm birta again checked the driveway nothing she stood motionless holding her breath absorbing the sounds of the night and the forest she cursed again she was going to have to close the forensic distance it was a simple rule the greater the forensic distance the less the chance of detection and interception the longrange sniper rifle was the perfect example the bullet which might have endured the trauma of passing through wood or glass then flesh and bone before becoming impacted into brick or deformed by stone was the only forensic link between you and the dead client you had a forensic distance from point and moment of death meaning you had a greater chance of getting away unseen but if she couldnt see the client she couldnt use the rifle he could of course simply be in the kitchen making himself a sandwich but the fact that she had had to take care of a secondary meant she didnt have the luxury of time if she hadnt been discovered by the handyman then she would have sat it out maybe an hour maybe more waiting for the client to reappear she would have to get close maybe even go into the house and that meant she was no longer forensically distant from the meeting birta repacked the rifle in its case again unholstered her handgun and made her way towards the house anna wolff had spent three nights retracing the drunken footsteps of armin lensch she had also spent the time thinking about the situation she had got herself into she had been involved in seventeen murder cases since fabel had selected her for his team seventeen different killings for motives as banal as drunken rage or sexual jealousy and a few like these latest ones had been for motives so twisted and abstract that she knew that no matter how long she served in the murder commission she would never get the measure of the minds behind them fabel did though it was in itself a creepy thought that he understood these people maybe he was right after all maybe she wasnt suited to being a murder commission officer anna still couldnt wrap her mind around the fact that the guy shed kneed in the groin was now dead for some abstract reason she couldnt understand she felt she had contributed to his death maybe it wasnt that abstract from what she could gather from his friends they had teased him about his encounter with her and he had gone off on his own into the night and then someone had murdered him the final element in a sequence of events that she could have been said to have set in motion it was too close for comfort where do you want to go now commissar theo asked her she turned to him theo wangler was the davidwache uniform who had been assigned to accompany her as she did the rounds of the bars and clubs and the uniform hung well on him wangler was two metres tall and obviously worked out weights anna reckoned he had a broad strong jaw and when he had taken his hat off to brush back his hair with his fingers she had noticed it was thick dark and wavy people as goodlooking as he was were usually assholes she had decided in that instant of first meeting that she disliked him but would not rule out a bit of a tumble with him as it turned out her first impressions had been wrong wangler was a quiet type almost shy but as they had gone from one bar to the other she had seen he had a quiet assertiveness about him that kept the unruly in their place yet was unaggressive enough for him to be able to talk reason into all but the most drunk or the most cophating it was she realised an ideal temperament for a police officer a temperament she knew she didnt possess anna decided to dislike wangler all over again the reeperbahn was long and wide and straight ideal for weaving the reep as rope was called in low german from which the former ropewalk street had got its name by day it looked dreary and tawdry by night it became one of the most illuminated streets in germany but as they made their way along the reeperbahn there was something about its tenthirty neon sparkle that was deeply depressing a forced manic jollity anna and wangler had visited one sleazy bar after another getting nothing from the bar staff they had done most of their talking to the security men on the doors of the clubs and bars most of whom like the bartenders and hostesses greeted wangler with a warm handshake or at least a nod of acknowledgement ive worked here for four years explained wangler as they made their way along the sinful mile passing a sex shop with a window full of improbably proportioned sex aids you get to know people do you like working this beat asked anna its okay people have the wrong idea about the kiez an old idea i suppose even superintendent kaminski he was on the beat here in the old days and i sometimes think hes of the opinion that its all going to the dogs because the brothels are shutting up shop and the trendy bars musical theatres and luxury flats are moving in theres even an advertising agency setting up its offices here thats all good isnt it well theres the other side to it the reeperbahn used to sell cheap sex now it sells cheap booze the kiez has become infected with the british disease binge drinking particularly in the clubs its changed the kind of street crime we deal with less thievery more violence isnt the ban working anna referred to the recent injunction against the carrying of any weapons in the reeperbahn and the kiez a designated weaponfree zone had been set up with yellow signs standing at the perimeter a little but your angel seems to be contravening it anna laughed they broke off their conversation as they came to the doorway of another club two bullnecked neanderthals stood with their hands folded in front of them in the traditional stance of security staff why do they always stand like that anna asked wangler you know as if theyre protecting their balls maybe theyve heard about you wangler laughed you know about that everybody knows about that wangler turned to the first doorman hi heiner hi theo the huge doorman spoke with a remarkably soft voice a little highpitched hows it going the usual listen heiner this is criminal commissar wolff of the murder commission shed like to ask you a couple of questions she can ask me anything any time the doorman smiled at anna his mate joined in but anna reckoned it was a reflex action the other doorman did not look sufficiently evolved to be capable of independent thought anna returned the smile with a weary one of her own she handed the doorman a photograph of armin lensch i dont suppose youve seen this guy asked anna the doorman glanced at the photograph he shrugged colossal shoulders and handed it back to anna then he checked himself wait a minute let me see it again anna handed the photograph back to him yeah yeah i seen him i seen him on friday no saturday night over there he pointed across the wide roadway i seen him get into a taxi you remember everyone you see getting into a taxi asked anna no but i remember this guy because i didnt think it was a taxi or a taxi on duty anyway it looked dodgy what do you mean well it was the right model a merc eclass and it was the right colour ivorybeige but it didnt have a roof sign the reason i paid attention was cause i noticed the car came up from behind him i dont think he realised it wasnt a taxi youve got to watch for shit like that you know pervs pretending to be taxi drivers and picking up girls and stuff or drunken guys being picked up and rolled for their cash it dont happen much because nobodys got a car the same colour as a taxi and you would identify this man as the one who got into the taxi or fake taxi anna tapped the photograph yeah he was in here earlier in the night with a bunch of other guys mouthy little prick i recognised him when i saw him over the road you said you watch out for guys being rolled why didnt you report seeing him get into the car or do something to stop it asked wangler it could have been a genuine taxi whether it was or not i didnt think at the time that he was in danger why asked anna well heiner the neanderthal shrugged his massive shoulders i reckoned he was safe with it being a woman driver and all birta drew close to the house keeping to the edge of the shields of yellow light cast out onto the snow by the uncurtained windows it was she reflected something you would never think about drawing your blinds or curtains when you lived in a place like this the forest was your shutter against the world no one else to see you she could see no one in the lit rooms she scanned the blank dark windows too nothing she made her way around the side of the house there was a door halfway along locked she went around to the back keeping tight against the wall there was another door at the back she turned the handle and was rewarded with the door easing open it led into the kitchen of the house a large pineclad room with expensivelooking fittings and a clutch of unmatched leather and upholstered chairs in one corner the large fridge was bedecked with childrens drawings scribbled notes fridge magnets birta eased the door closed behind her and stood perfectly still diverting all of her attention to any sounds from inside the house nothing shit maybe he wasnt here that would normally not be a problem she could replan reschedule but birta had left her mark on this location there was a middleaged man with a ripped heart lying out in the woods she edged out into the hall still no sounds of life birta made her way along towards the study she was about halfway along checking every room as she passed when the door to the left immediately ahead opened and the sound of a refilling toilet cistern filled the hall the client stepped out into the hall and gave a start when he saw birta standing there she snapped the pistol up and aimed at his head ive been expecting you he said and smiled falteringly me birta said well not you specifically but someone like you he looked past her along the hall i suppose i expected it to be a man im not a man said birta no point in looking behind me she thought your handyman is not coming no nasty surprise for me no reprieve for you i can see that listen you dont have to the client didnt finish the sentence birtas bullet hit him in the centre of his forehead and he toppled backward his body rigid like a felled tree she walked over to where he lay birta knew he was already dead there were sounds from his body postmortem sounds his pale trousers were stained with urine and she thought she could smell excreta violent death she knew was seldom clean or odourless dark red almost black blood oozed from a nostril and his left ear nevertheless she crouched down at his feet aimed along his fallen body at the underside of his jaw and fired a second shot the clients head twitched as if he was shaking his head in protest but birta knew it was the lowvelocity hollowpoint doing its work inside the confines of his skull destroying his brain she stood up and marked in her head where she was in the hall and how she had got there measuring the forensic distance meeting concluded she drove back through the night there were flurries of snow but the highways had been cleared she settled back into the comfort of the drivers seat and switched on her music making sure she was relaxed but not so much that she would make a mistake that would draw attention to her she again crossed the swedish border on a road without a customs point and headed towards stockholm birta returned the car to stockholmbromma airport the next morning and then made her way to the airport car park where her danishregistered car was parked as she did so birta hennigsen who had existed as an identity for only a little more than thirtysix hours began to fade from being fabel headed into the police presidium early driving through winterhude just as the sun was coming up the sky was clear and the lying snow had been crisped by the overnight frost fabel loved it when it was like this since he was a boy he had been a winter person when he arrived at his office he checked the internal email and found there was a reminder from van heiden about the conference on violence against women another reminder fabel typed in a brief response explaining he needed a meeting with van heiden urgently he also left messages for anna and werner that he wanted to see them as soon as they came in fabel opened his desk drawer and took out the sketch pad laid it on his desktop and flipped it open he stared at the empty clean expanse of white paper and sighed it always started this way fabel had used these sketch pads for fifteen years of murder investigations singles multiples serials no one except fabel ever saw these pads for fabel this was a completely different exercise from the plotting of an investigation on an incident board this exercise had nothing to do with a team effort it was the externalisation of his thought processes these clean pages would fill with names times places all connected by a web of lines alongside them would be phrases press cuttings quotes from statements and ideas foul dark ideas fabel remembered how once when investigating a serialmurder case he had come across the notebook of the killer obsessively neat but tangled threads connecting words underlined scored out circled triple questionmarked it had chilled fabel to the bone to see how similar the insane methodology of the killer was to his own fabel took a marker and at the top of the page wrote in block capitals the name angel followed by three question marks then he noted on opposite sides of the page the names of the two st pauli victims then referring to the case files and his notebook be began plotting out the key elements of the case but as he did so another case kept shouldering itself into his way that of the dead danish policeman he tried to shake it clear of his mind it wasnt even a case yet although moller the forensic pathologist at butenfeld had grudgingly promised that the autopsy results would be available about lunchtime he thought back to karin vestergaard and remembered that she had been beautiful yet somehow he could not picture her face his reflections were interrupted by the arrival of anna wolff and werner meyer in his office he closed over the sketch pad and put it back into his desk drawer asking anna and werner to sit as he did so okay he said where are we i went to see viola dahlkes husband said werner that was tough nice guy ordinary family had no idea his wife had a secret life i take it you didnt enlighten him about the nature of that life werner frowned give me some credit but she sure has a lot of explaining to do anyway her husband confirms that she was at home the night westland was killed i take it we can let her go a spousal alibi isnt enough in itself said fabel but we dont have enough to go for an extension of detention and anyway im convinced both st pauli killings are the work of the same person and we know for a fact that viola dahlke did not commit the second one ive checked all the taxi drivers working st pauli the night lensch was killed three of whom were women none of them picked him up or remember him at a rank or trying to flag a taxi so it looks like it was our woman almost like she was targeting lensch or someone like him said fabel but that doesnt make sense said anna her choice of victims so far has been pretty diverse westland was a celebrity a foreigner and in his fifties lensch was a nobody a german national and in his early thirties the only thing that i can see they shared was that they were both male and they both happened to be in the kiez maybe thats all she needed but the whole thing with the taxi is odd no one has a car that colour especially an eclass merc unless theyre in the taxi business this is a highly organised killer why go to all of that trouble and then pick a victim at random fabel sighed what about cctv anything not so far ive got that rather hunky uniform from davidwache going through it why asked fabel shouldnt you do that yourself listen im not dodging out of anything its just that wangler has been on that beat for four years he knows every inch of it including where each camera is that mercedes must have been picked up somewhere on the way in or out if anyone can find it and find it quickly then its wangler okay okay fabel held up his hands defensively did you check out jurgen mann he asked referring to the witness who had approached carstens kaminski yep said anna he checks out one conviction for cannabis possession nothing else hes a dying breed apparently what do you mean according to wangler your new best chum interrupted werner i wish anna sighed anyway according to wangler there are fewer and fewer creeps like mann in the kiez these days with all the cctv in the reeperbahn even if it is supposed to be strategically sited no one wants to be seen going into or coming out of a brothel these days its all call girls online escort agencies that kind of stuff wangler says that compared to the past street girls are struggling for custom these days added to which there is a steady supply of trafficked women being brought into the unregulated prostitution business elsewhere in the city against their will for the most part said fabel maybe so but when youre a sleazeball paying for sex said anna youre not the kind of person who cares if your chicken is freerange or battery if you know what i mean anyway there are fewer punters on the street nowadays the kiez is full of the armin lensches of this world getting pissed and getting into trouble for what its worth i think mann was on the level i think he genuinely believes he came face to face with the angel but again weve got no cctv to back up his claim okay fabel paused and leaned back in his chair listen we have a guest a colleague from denmark ive asked her to come into the presidium this afternoon id like you to talk to her anna you too werner a pr job asked anna of course i will after all we all know that im a natural diplomat thats not why im asking you to talk to her anna her name is karin vestergaard and shes a senior officer in the danish national police more senior in rank than me is this to do with the dane who died from a heart attack asked werner anna exchanged a knowing glance with fabel supposed to have died from a heart attack she said politidirektor vestergaard has exactly the same kind of suspicions that you did anna and she has some evidence to base them on id like you to talk to her because you picked up on the jespersen death so it was murder asked werner well know by lunchtime hopefully if moller does his job moller may be a wanker said werner but hes one of the best pathologists ive ever worked with well frau vestergaard was able to point us in a couple of specific directions listen i dont want to get into it all now but theres all kinds of serious stuff going on in jespersens background and if the autopsy comes back with anything suspicious then jespersens death becomes an active case if he was murdered then its a major investigation with all kinds of implications the main thing is anna it was your catch a good catch so whats she like asked werner this danish cop i mean wear your gloves when you shake hands with her said fabel otherwise youll get frostbite youre from the telly the old woman smiled as she asked the question and sylvie achtenhagen wished that she hadnt her ruined teeth looked as if they needed the attention of an archaeologist rather than a dentist is that what you said youre from the telly thats right hansat sylvie smiled sweetly the way shed learned to smile when she wanted information from someone she cast her gaze beyond the brokenfenceedged square of waste ground they were down by the harbour on the southern edge of st pauli across the elbe vast machines were hoisting containers from an armada of freight ships the cold air rang with the rhythmic beeping of reversing cranes never heard of it dont have a telly the old woman made a sweeping gesture with her arm as sweeping a gesture as her countless layers of clothing would allow taking in the broken paving the smear of scrubby grass the discarded bottles a used condom i find it would ruin the ambience ive built up here she chuckled at her own joke so you doin sommat about the kiez about them murders this is where they found the last fella yknow something like that and yes i know the latest victim was found here thats why i came to talk to you is this your usual spot coppersve asked me bout it already they got a bee up their arses bout this un is this your usual spot sylvie repeated the question be patient smile offer money listen i can pay for information only if its good information though is this your usual spot this is my abode the old woman announced grandly how much that all depends do you sleep in a hostel sometimes when its too cold sometimes i sleep here there are better places than this surely i mean the state social office would help find you a place oh i know another brokentoothed chuckle they offered me a villa in blankenese but i said it was too downmarket for someone of my breeding sylvie shrugged okay you said the police talked to you what did they want to know they asked me if i saw anything the other night when that fella was killed i said i didnt it was too cold so i dossed down in the red cross hostel but i was here drinking until about eleven but didnt see nothing then they asked me if i seen a taxi in the area driven by a woman a taxi yeah they said it might notve had a sign on it though did they say why they were looking for a taxi yeah the police always tell me them kind of things discuss cases im like a special consultant listen you can get smart or you can get money not both the downandout shrugged her padded shoulders just jokin no they didnt say why anything else they showed me this picture i suppose it was the guy what got killed i never seen him before and i told them so did they give you a name for the dead man no they did say he was about thirty and not too tall anyone else doss down around here no its too far out for them i sleep here cause im a woman it aint safe elsewhere sylvie looked at the woman she looked eighty but might only have been forty a couple of years older than her she wondered how a woman could end up in a situation like that she imagined that the tramp had seen all kinds experienced all kinds of horrors sylvie handed the tramp a fiftyeuro note thanks the tramp looked delighted with her bounty suddenly eager listen you come by tomorrow ill ask some of the others if theyve seen something that would be good sylvie smiled you do that sylvie drove back into the reeperbahn and parked near the taxi rank at spielbudenplatz unlike the female downandout the drivers waiting for fares or taking a break at the snack stand knew exactly who sylvie was they were keen to help especially when she hinted that if she got anything worthwhile shed return with a camera crew to get their statements on tape the fact was however that they had nothing much to offer although one or two had been very open about what the police had said to them from the scraps she had gathered sylvie was able to piece together that the guy who had been murdered had been picked up by an ivorybeige mercedes eclass but the police thought that it had probably been a fake taxi that kind of planning she thought to herself was bordering on the professional the drivers told her that they were all now looking out for the phoney cab and driver while she was at spielbudenplatz sylvie thought it was worthwhile calling into davidwache when she asked the uniformed female officer behind the counter if she could speak to herr kaminski she was told he was unavailable all day sylvie tried to wheedle some information from the desk officer but got nowhere when she got back to her car her cellphone rang it was ivonne her assistant calling to tell her that the police had released an identity for the latest victim armin lensch twentynine had worked for the neuhansa group god thats a bit close to home said sylvie the neuhansa group was the company owned by gina bronsted the hamburg senator who was running for first mayor through neuhansa gina bronsted had a finger in every pie in hamburg worth having your finger in one of those pies was hansat tv sylvies employer the rumour was that bronsted had financed andreas knabbes startup of hansat yep said ivonne apparently lensch worked for a subsidiary norivon its neuhansas environmental technologies division now thats interesting sylvie sat in the car staring out through the windscreen but seeing nothing instead her mind raced through a dozen possible connections as well as being a successful politician gina bronsted was a millionairess several times over she was running for the office of hamburgs principal mayor basically on the platform that she could run the city like a business having an employee of one of her companies linked to these murders even as a victim was not the kind of publicity she would want ivonne get me everything you can on the neuhansa group and gina bronsted get me a few names inside the company and find out if the dead guy was of any importance in the group have whatever you can lay your hands on emailed to my personal address or couriered over to my flat tonight ill be back home from about eight im on it by the way herr knabbe has been looking for you sylvie smiled to herself ivonne was a great assistant more importantly she hated their mutual boss as much as sylvie did ivonnes little rebellion was to reject his americanised informality and never address or refer to him as andreas what did you tell him she asked that you were following up a hot lead i also told him that the battery on your cellphone was low and youd temporarily switched it off and i couldnt reach you ivonne youre a star so they tell me oh there was another call for you some guy phoned saying he had to talk to you urgently but he wouldnt leave a name he said he would call back he sounded a bit creepy if you ask me sylvie told ivonne to let knabbe know shed be back in the office first thing tomorrow morning and not to worry about the anonymous caller probably some crank she hung up pulled out into the traffic on the reeperbahn and headed back into the city fabel got a phone call from renate just as he was about to go up with anna and werner to the presidiums fifth floor to meet with van heiden have you spoken to gabi yet renate asked without preliminaries not yet you know i havent why are you phoning me at work to ask me something you already know the answer to im seeing gabi on thursday ill talk to her then you could have phoned her this isnt something i want to discuss with her over the phone i choose the right time and place you should try it renate anyway gabis choice of career is hardly pressing she hasnt even sat her abitur yet trouble asked werner when fabel came off the phone anna and werner had been standing awkwardly during the exchange the worst kind renate gabi is thinking about a career in the police im a bad influence according to renate i wouldnt have wanted one of my daughters doing this job said werner oh yeah so what if you had a son asked anna you know i dont have a son so i dont know its got nothing to do with gender politics anna fabel took a deep breath ready then lets go and walk amongst the exalted they stood waiting outside van heidens office for five minutes but they werent invited in instead van heiden emerged from his office putting on his suit jacket as he did so follow me as he spoke van heiden cast a disapproving eye over annas jeans and tshirt hamburgs police presidium had been built in the form of a giant police star the symbol of police forces throughout germany the entire presidium was built around a central circular atrium open to the sky all office suites including the murder commission radiated out as the arms of the star from its circular hallways fabel werner and anna followed van heiden along the sweep of the fifthfloor corridor until they came to doors of the presidial department this was where hugo steinbach hamburgs police president and his deputies had their offices police president steinbach has asked to be involved in this meeting explained van heiden he paused for a moment and turned to fabel listen jan i dont like being caught on the back foot what have you told herr steinbach nothing said fabel i thought you van heiden shook his head looks like were both on the back foot i suppose wed better find out when they arrived at the presidial department they werent directed to steinbachs office but were told to go straight into the conference room when they entered fabel was surprised to see karin vestergaard sitting at the conference table next to hugo steinbach the police president stood up and shook hands with van heiden and then with fabel steinbach was the opposite of van heiden in many ways van heiden could be nothing other than a policeman and somehow managed to wear his smartly tailored hugo boss suits as if they were uniforms in complete contrast hugo steinbach was softly spoken and had an avuncular easygoing appearance to look at hamburgs police president one would have taken him for a schoolteacher or some rural family doctor the truth was steinbach was highly unusual for an officer of his rank in germany he had not entered the police at senior level but had started out as a uniformed beat polizeimeister and had worked his way up through every rank fabel knew that part of that journey had involved being head of the polizei berlins murder squad fabel respected steinbach as an officer but he also liked him as a person i know you wanted to talk to criminal director van heiden about what frau vestergaard discussed with you yesterday but i thought we should all have a chat about it if you dont mind jan hello frau vestergaard said fabel in english i thought we were meeting later to discuss this i had hoped to brief herr van heiden as herr steinbach has suggested im afraid events have moved on a little from then said vestergaard without a hint of apology new information has come to light and i felt it would be appropriate to discuss it with mr steinbach why dont we all sit down said steinbach in a clear attempt to ease the tension between fabel and vestergaard and perhaps you should update herr van heiden on what this is all about once they were seated fabel outlined vestergaards theory about the hamburgbased contract killer and jespersens death not being natural vestergaard sat silently throughout fabels commentary in german her expression as impossible to read as it had been the day before how sure are we that this socalled valkyrie is based in hamburg asked steinbach when fabel was finished with the greatest respect to frau vestergaard and her deceased colleague there is absolutely no proof that the valkyrie even exists fabel looked again at the danish policewoman there was no sign that she understood what he was saying in german but there again he thought she wouldnt show it even if she did to be frank herr president i feel that our foreign colleague here is not being as communicative as she might be you think theres more to this asked steinbach i dont know in fact there may be less to her story than meets the eye and i have to be honest with this supposed resurrection of the angel of st pauli i can well do without some wildgoose chase but well get the autopsy report on jespersen this afternoon i see said steinbach what do you think horst i think we cant afford to ignore the possibility there are those in the international security community who feel we dropped the ball in not nailing the socalled hamburg cell before they launched the attack on the world trade center it could be embarrassing if we were seen to have had advance warning of this assassin operating from hamburg and then for something to happen a political assassination abroad for example van heiden turned to fabel sorry jan i understand youre under pressure with this angel case but we have to treat this seriously i agree especially if the autopsy throws up something vestergaard cleared her throat im sorry fabel said in english then to the others maybe we should all speak in english from now on for frau vestergaards sake natural said van heiden in heavily accented english we will of course you bet the look vestergaard fired at fabel eloquently communicated an itoldyouso reminder of their conversation about the difference between how danes and germans spoke english i think frau vestergaard has something you should hear said police president steinbach please frau vestergaard my office in copenhagen has been in touch with me she said they in turn were notified by the norwegian national criminal investigation department of an incident in drobak near oslo this incident which involved the murder of two men took place yesterday evening vestergaard paused while she took her notebook from her bag jorgen halvorsen is was a leading investigative journalist for newspapers and magazines throughout scandinavia she said referring to the notebook he was a norwegian by birth but worked in copenhagen for a great many years he moved back to norway about five years ago for the sake of his health you could say he made some heavyweight enemies in denmark and sweden you see halvorsen had two specific areas of interest areas that were not always mutually exclusive the extreme right in europe and corporate and political corruption he was assassinated yesterday evening in his home in drobak his family were away overnight so the timing suggests surveillance of the house also halvorsen was planning a trip abroad the far east where exactly in the far east and for what reason we dont know but it suggests the killer knew halvorsens schedule and everything points to a timed planned killing except that halvorsens gardener obviously happened along at the wrong moment he was the other victim single knife wound to the heart and you think this is the work of the alleged hamburg valkyrie asked fabel it could be vestergaard shrugged it was a highly professional job the other thing is that the norwegian police had been keeping an onoff eye on halvorsens house why asked fabel about two weeks ago someone broke in and stole halvorsens laptop and selective files including backups of his computer data and this is where it gets creepy halvorsen being a securityminded man also backed up to an online source someone used his access code and passwords to wipe that too again the work of real professionals what was it that he was working on asked van heiden we dont have details yet you see the norwegian national police isnt the only agency with an interest in halvorsen pst the norwegian security agency and okokrim the economic and environmental crime bureau were very much interested in what halvorsen was into they had both been cooperating with halvorsen basically because they knew he would turn over what he found to them your norwegian colleagues seem to have been very open with you said van heiden thats the way it is in scandinavia vestergaard shrugged the nordic police agreement has been in force since nineteen sixtysix and was expanded in two thousand and one we enjoy much more freedom to cooperate without formality across our borders anyway organised crime rightwing extremism that kind of thing it all tends to spread wider than one constituent country so do we know what halvorsen was working on asked fabel without his files or backups no over the years halvorsen has exposed quite a few major figures powerful figures he had learned to play his cards very close to his chest but we do have a few theories one is that it may have had something to do with the trafficking of women norway as you probably know is currently the chair of interpols working party against trafficking in women and its possible that halvorsen was tying a story in to coincide a couple of my colleagues believe that he might have been about to expose a major environmental crime by some corporation or other or maybe by a government were compiling a list of the information he asked for from okokrim one thing we are pretty certain about is that whatever it was he was investigating it involves denmark he made several trips to copenhagen he seems to have had a particular interest in the oresund region we do know he did research at copenhagen university on the region as a politicoeconomic identity im sorry interrupted steinbach with a frown maybe my english the oresund region is partly in denmark partly in sweden explained vestergaard speaking more slowly its where the new bridge between denmark and sweden is historically that part of sweden was danish same way we used to own schleswigholstein why was halvorsen interested in this region particularly asked van heiden no idea its maybe not significant in itself halvorsen was known to have an interest in euroregions you know groupings within the new eu that tend not to conform to national boundaries the part of sweden that is included in the oresund region is open to a lot of social and linguistic debate the majority of linguists say the scanians speak in an east danish dialect while others maintain it is a south swedish dialect the point is there is a sense of europe dividing into selfidentified units rather than traditional national units you could argue for example that hamburg has more in common with denmark in terms of identity and culture than it does with bavaria i dont see a big story for halvorsen in whether a bunch of swedes speak with a danish or a swedish accent said fabel nor do i said vestergaard dismissively and his visits to copenhagen and visits to the region may have nothing to do with his death but remember halvorsens special interest was neofascism scanian identity isnt just about being danish or swedish there are several extremeright groups who want autonomy for the region and to expel all muslims to sweden vestergaard was interrupted by the ringing of the phone steinbach answered it its for you he said to fabel holding out the receiver fabel moller here im about to send the autopsy results on jespersen to your office but i thought youd want the main points i appreciate that herr doctor i take it our suspicions were justified just like your less than charming danish colleague suggested by the way do you know she got in touch with me directly and started to harangue me telling me what i should be looking for no i didnt said fabel firing a look across the conference table at vestergaard my apologies well anyway continued moller turns out she was right i found a hypodermic puncture wound what looks to me like a deliberately concealed hypodermic puncture wound in his groin i would have missed it if i hadnt been looking for it specifically so what was injected well have to wait for the full toxicology report but on a hunch i tested a blood sample myself i was looking for and found signs of hyperkalaemia which is elevated potassium levels whatever was injected pumped up the level of potassium in his system that would cause hyperkalaemia which in turn would cause arrhythmia and ultimately cardiac arrest it could be a number of agents that caused this or a combination of agents but ive included tox screens for potassium chloride and suxamethonium chloride well we can stop speculating said fabel after he had hung up the phone it looks like we are now cooperating on a murder enquiry frau vestergaard ute cranz examined herself in the mirror it was like looking at a stranger she was tall and slim beneath the expensive clothes her body was lithe and sleek she had spent a great many hours working on her body making it strong supple graceful but she felt disconnected from it dislocated from the person who stared back at her cold and blankly from the glass as a little girl ute like her sister had excelled as a gymnast she could have gone far international competition but her parents had not approved of what they saw as the abuse of her body enjoy your sport for what it is her father had once told her but dont let them abuse your body damage your health for the sake of a falsehood she hadnt understood then but she did now she had seen what they had done to her sister margarethe had told her what they had done each visiting time a little more a new horror they had stolen margarethes life what they had done to her was like rape no it was worse they had destroyed her taken away her humanity then when it became clear to them that she wasnt up to what they wanted they cast her away ute turned from the mirror and crossed the lounge to the window that looked down onto the street no sign yet she looked at her watch a few more minutes crossing back to the mirror she applied a little more makeup and pushed at her hair with her hands she had planned her costume carefully it was dressy without looking too much for this time of afternoon on a wednesday and it was exactly at this time of afternoon on a wednesday that herr gerdes came home he lived in the topfloor apartment the one with the roof terrace ute had established that herr gerdes lived alone although she had no idea if he was divorced a widower or a confirmed bachelor he really was a quiet neighbour the only sound she had ever heard issuing from his apartment was the music he listened to brahms and some bruch she thought and she had only heard that occasionally when making her way up to her own apartment ute laid her hand on the brass snib eased the door open and listened after a moment she heard the outer door downstairs slam shut and the sound of footsteps on the stairs she stepped out onto the landing just as herr gerdes reached it oh hello frau cranz he said and smiled he was wearing a chunky poloneck jumper under an expensivelooking tweed coat he carried pale pigskin gloves in one hand its a cold one today are you going out im glad i caught you herr gerdes she said formally and ignoring his question as you know ive not long moved into the apartment and i have a problem with the lease i wondered if you could explain it to me well he said frowning i would love to but at the moment oh no not right now she gestured an apology i wouldnt impose on you at such short notice i was thinking well i wondered if you would join me for a meal on saturday evening there was a short silence and she rushed to fill it you see i dont get the chance to cook for anyone any more and ive got these fillets he silenced her by taking a step towards her his smile broadening frau cranz i would be delighted it had been a tiring day partly because he had had to spend so much of it with karin vestergaard fabel would never have imagined that spending time with a beautiful woman could be so tedious she was beautiful wasnt she he still found that if he were out of her presence for any length of time her face was almost impossible to recall and fabel was good at remembering faces after all he had made a career of it he phoned susanne from his office before he left explaining that he had felt obliged to volunteer to pick up vestergaard at eight and take her for a meal please please come along he pleaded this woman is incredibly hard work and i need your support i couldnt possibly burden the taxpayer youll be putting this all on expenses i take it youre involved in the st pauli investigation its a legitimate expense vestergaard would be interested in how you work with the commission ill even pay myself god she must be hard work im booking a table at the fish restaurant in neumuhlen your favourite i dont think did i tell you that this particular nordic ice maiden is also particularly beautiful and therell just be the two of us if you dont come okay ill come and protect your honour pick me up at the apartment fabel was aware that he had become an object of envy every man in the restaurant turned in their direction as he susanne and karin vestergaard entered the truth was he got a kick out of being seen in the company of two such beautiful women seeing them together fabel was struck by how different they were susannes hair was raven black her eyes a rich hazel and her skin even in the middle of a hamburg winter had a hint of summer gold to it in complete contrast karin vestergaards hair was almost ashblonde her complexion light and her eyes a striking pale blue the southern celt and the viking maiden again karin vestergaard had done something different with her makeup and it had totally changed her look softened it susanne and vestergaard chatted warmly as they sat at the table by the window the restaurant deliberately kept its lighting subdued to allow diners to watch the silent ballet of vast container ships and other vessels drift past the huge picture windows that looked out over the elbe it was odd for fabel to hear susanne talk in english he had only heard her say a few words in the language during their whole relationship he noticed that even though susanne could speak it well her bavarian accent was even more noticeable in this second language susanne and karin vestergaard had hit it off as soon as theyd met and fabel had felt a vague confusion at the way vestergaards personality seemed to have changed totally not for the first time he felt completely lost when faced with the complexity of the female mind he had seen this kind of thing before women interacting with each other in a completely different way than they did with him he had seen it before but had never understood it sitting there it was as if he had been allowed admission to an exclusive club only to find out he had been handed a limited day pass so youve been stuck with jan for most of the day said susanne you must need a drink she beckoned the waiter over and they ordered a bottle of white wine hes not so bad said vestergaard she smiled at fabel and he realised it was the first time she had done so just takes a bit of getting used to tell me about it susanne arched an eyebrow and grinned knowingly how do you like hamburg i like it fine vestergaard said its odd but it doesnt feel that foreign like its a little bit danish you said yourself earlier today said fabel when you were talking about euroregions that hamburg had a nordic element well where were sitting right now is in altona altona was a city in its own right until the nineteenthirties when it became part of hamburg under the greater hamburg act all of this was danish soil for more than two hundred years and hamburg itself was jammed right up against the danish border for most of its history god dont get him started susanne said to vestergaard everything turns into a bloody history lesson i know what you mean karin im from the south bavaria when i first came to hamburg i felt it was very scandinavian although theyre always banging on here about how english they all are by the way do you know what jans nickname is oh not that old chestnut said fabel some people call me der englishe kommissar because im halfbritish scottish actually susanne laughed no not that i bet you dont even know this one lord gentleman who calls me that fabel looked accusingly at susanne see she said to vestergaard now hes all offended do you know he buys all his stuff in the english shops in hamburg i used to think harris tweed was a romantic novelist until i met this one vestergaard laughed actually its funny she said to fabel when i first met you i thought you looked like a dane but so do a lot of people here aha fabel pointed his fork in her direction youve got it all wrong i get my blond hair from the scottish side of the family i thought they were all redhaired with big bushy beards and drunk half the time thats only the women said fabel ill tell your mother you said that susanne smiled how did you two get together asked vestergaard if you dont mind me asking was it through work we worked together on a case about four years ago he pursued me more relentlessly than he did the killer as i remember you didnt try very hard to escape fabel grinned and took a sip of his wine doesnt work get in the way i mean having a personal and a professional relationship asked vestergaard we try not to let it said fabel we used to have this rule that we didnt talk shop outside work we still pretty much keep to that but of course there are times when you cant help it the other thing is that susanne is only involved in a small percentage of the cases i investigate ones like this killer weve got on the loose in st pauli i think thats what went wrong with jens and me vestergaard stared blankly at the table as she spoke you and jespersen fabel put his wine glass down you were involved oh god im sorry i had no idea she smiled weakly we split up about four years ago like i said jens found it difficult to accept that my career had overtaken his everyone knows that denmark is a very liberal country along with sweden and finland we score the highest in the world for gender equality but statistics dont take the danish character into account jens was a jutlander and a very oldfashioned dane sometimes i think it just stung too much that i was a woman promoted over him didnt that make working together awkward asked susanne i mean after the split we were in separate divisions for a while it was only last year that we started working together again and yes it was difficult but that had more to do with the way jens went about his job and his general attitude to authority jespersen seems to have been a little like maria klee fabel explained to susanne maria klee vestergaard raised her eyebrows the officer i told you about said fabel the one who had a complete breakdown after going off on a personal crusade there was a silence for a moment only broken when the waiter arrived with their orders im sorry said vestergaard ive killed the mood somewhat she raised her glass and forced a smile no more shop talk agreed agreed said susanne the conversation slowly found its way back to shallower waters and the inconsequentialities that people who dont know each other that well tend to discuss but as they chatted fabel watched karin vestergaard he thought back to the anger she had shown when she saw jespersens body at the mortuary anger directed at her dead colleague her dead exlover he was beginning to understand the danish detective a little better so why did it give him a bad feeling there were things fabel enjoyed about his job and there were things he hated leading a murder commission was a management task bureaucratic and demanding a certain meticulousness fabel was not a natural bureaucrat nor naturally meticulous or at least not when it came to paperwork he had started the day off by getting werner into his office werners heavy build and toughlooking appearance seemed at odds with what fabel often thought of as a watchmakers mind within over the years fabel had learned to rely on werners attention to detail and whenever he was thinking about allocating tasks to the team he called on his deputys counsel fabel had asked for and got extra resources to investigate the st pauli killings while running an inquiry into jespersens death technically fabel was supposed to manage the inquiries in parallel assigning a team to run each while he directed them remotely oversight or overview or whatever the hell they liked to call it fabel didnt like working that way he believed a senior investigating officer should do just that investigate but the polizei hamburg as sylvie achtenhagen was wont to point out any time someone aimed a tv camera at her had screwed up the original angel investigation it was his job to make sure that there was a cross on every t a dot above every i put me and anna on the st pauli case said werner taking clumsy care not to use the word angel and spark his boss off fabel was famous for despising the cartooncharacter tags that the media liked to attach to multiple killers and team up dirk hechtner and henk hermann on this danish thing at least weve got enough other bodies drafted in for once we seem covered its amazing what the wrong kind of publicity can do for you added fabel grimly cynicism doesnt suit you chef said werner weve all come to love you for your shining wit and cheery disposition speaking of your overwhelming respect for me do i have a nickname around here asked fabel werner shrugged do you know said fabel that some people have apparently been calling me lord gentleman making a big joke about me being halfbritish probably more to do with your wardrobe said werner who moved on quickly news to me by the time werner had left they had worked out a comprehensive investigative plan for both inquiries the st pauli inquiry was already well under way but the jespersen case was still amorphous ideas and conjecture rather than any kind of evidence another blank page in fabels sketchbook on the st pauli killings fabel had decided he would look into jake westland the file told fabel that westland was british born presumably illegitimately because he had been put up for adoption immediately after his birth and had been brought up by middleclass adoptive parents in hampshire studied music in london first band formed second went solo two gold discs one platinum married three times four children by two of those marriages fabel knew he needed to get beyond the naked facts but the last thing he needed right now was to have to make a trip to england to talk to westlands family and friends hopefully if she was not too distressed he would get a chance to talk to the pop singers wife in a few days when she came over to claim the body in addition to the formally acquired information in the file fabel did an internet search for westland on his office computer putting together the pieces fabel started to build a picture of a man he did not like westland was by all accounts arrogant opinionated and egocentric no surprises there to be a successful performer you needed an ego that could fill a stadium but the truth was that westland was no longer filling stadiums his promoters had scaled down the size of the venues he played in a strategy which ensured that he could still claim the odd ticket sellout with the information fabel found he could mentally plot a bell curve of fame for the british singer reaching its peak in the mid s after that his popularity if not his wealth had gone into rapid decline jake westland was clearly fast becoming yesterdays man until he left the stage permanently and spectacularly in a kiez back alley westland had been struggling to make any headlines there had been an abortive attempt at acting but the press had been derisive the only time he returned to public attention was when his sordid sex life excited the british tabloids his decreasing publicity clout did not however prevent him from pontificating on a range of social issues to anyone who would listen fabel scanned through the background material that anna had gathered on the event at the sporthalle the charity benefiting from the concert was called the sabine charity declaring war on war rape looking through annas report fabel saw that the charity was devoted to assisting the victims of military or genocidal rape from bosnia to rwanda the concert organiser was a woman called petra meissner the name rang a bell with fabel he flicked back through his internet search history and found a photograph of westland with petra meissner which had appeared in one of the british tabloids meissner was an attractive woman in her mid forties with dark hair cut short the photograph was innocent enough westland and meissner were together to attend an event in aid of meissners charity in berlin but the english headline demanded whos the hunney jake and of course the text went on to make much of the fact that westlands escort was a german woman lots of tasteless jokes about the war the usual brainless stuff fabel loved all things british except their press and the fact that as a nation the british seemed permanently stuck in the past there was little else of note about westland that fabel could see other than the englishmans obvious business acumen he might have been a mediocre singer and an even worse actor but he had been an astute investor westlands back catalogue of music and his more recent cds assured him a reasonable income from his established fan base but the real income had come from his portfolio of investments and from what fabel read it appeared that it wasnt his accountants or advisers who had guided this success but westland himself who seemed to have an eye for the upandcoming business concept or the unusual opportunity that other investors would be wary of it had been snowing again and although the roads were clear the pavements around the city were whiteblanketed fabel drove through the city and through the elbe tunnel into hamburgharburg the sabine charity had its offices in an older building on the corner of two busy harburg streets there was a certain artdeco grandness about the building but this had been diminished by copious graffiti on the walls the charitys offices comprised a handful of rooms on the ground floor fabel had phoned ahead to make an appointment but when he walked into the offices he could find no defined reception area for some reason he had expected this informality there were four women and two men working at various desks most of whom were engaged in phone conversations when fabel entered a tall handsome woman with short dark hair whom he recognised from her photographs as petra meissner stood up and came over to him i got your message herr chief commissar she extended her hand and smiled without warmth thought fabel its a bit chaotic here theres a cafe around the corner would you mind not at all said fabel and stood aside to allow her to show him the way i take it this is about jakes death said meissner ive been expecting somebody to get in touch especially after that awful woman from the television was here let me guess sylvie achtenhagen your paths have crossed you could say that frau achtenhagen can be persistent well her persistence did her no good with me the hardening of meissners expression suggested to fabel that she was not a woman to cross i sent her packing the whole thing with the way jake died its tragic and sordid im afraid the charity can do without that kind of publicity im sure his wife and children could do without it too of course meissner stirred her latte macchiato and licked the froth from her spoon how well did you know herr westland meissner gave a cynical laugh i didnt think you really asked questions like that i thought that was only in the movies if you are trying to ask me if i was having or ever had an intimate relationship with jake then why dont you just ask me outright okay did you no despite what the gutter press in britain alleged jake wasnt interested in me that way and i can assure you that jake westland was definitely not my type i take it you have found out a bit about him naturally then youll know that most people thought he was a phoney arrogant asshole well most people were right but ill tell you this he was totally committed to the sabine charity there was nothing phoney about that so why your charity in particular that i dont know and i didnt ask the sabine charity isnt like others were not involved in famine relief or disaster support in the conventional sense these are issues that people can talk about feel good about supporting theres something about the work we do the things we talk about that takes people to a place they dont want to go but some people have a good reason to go there im sure there was a very good reason for jake to be so committed to the sabine charity maybe it was just genuine outrage maybe he encountered a victim of war rape whatever the reason it was not something i felt i could question i was grateful for the support jake westland was as highprofile as weve managed so far did you see him on the night of the charity concert of course we had a preevent reception with a few citystate and national political types the federal government sent the minister for women and the hamburg senate sent mieke brun the senator for city development and environment schleswigholstein sent along a couple of representatives too and gina bronsted whos running for principal mayor she was there as well to be honest she rather monopolised jake must have been a fan that was it unfortunately yes we had planned an informal afterconcert party but jake said he was too tired and not feeling too well he just wanted to get back to his hotel and sleep as it turned out that was clearly a lot of crap we went ahead with the party anyway it worked out okay actually without the star to distract them i was able to collar a few of the politicians not bronsted though she left straight after the concert too okay fabel paused for a moment what is it your charity does asked fabel i mean i know what its about but what specifically does it do we have three goals our first priority is to identify conflicts and regions where rape is currently being used systematically as a weapon of war we then campaign for international action to protect women in those zones we lobby politicians here in germany and throughout the eu sometimes beyond and where possible we put people on the ground in the trouble spots isnt that risky it can be very but we have a team of volunteers doctors nurses and psychologists who are very committed to the task herr fabel when you encounter the victims of war rape you never forget it you become very motivated anyway our second objective is to raise awareness of war rape as a crime against humanity generally and historically thirdly we provide evidence to back up the arrest and prosecution of commanders and individual soldiers involved in rape campaigns we have to be very careful with this because as i said we often have people on the ground in these zones and we dont want to put them in added danger the military and paramilitary groups behind these atrocities wouldnt think twice about shooting a potential future witness against them but we have contributed to successful prosecutions against war rapists in bosnia somalia and rwanda and you get all your support from here in germany we are an international charity with registered offices in a number of eu nations but yes we are headquartered here and our funds come predominantly from german donations a disproportionate amount given its economic woes comes from the former east germany that makes sense when you think about it i suppose it does said fabel at the end of the second world war more than a million maybe as many as two million east german women had been raped by the invading soviet troops many of them repeatedly in some towns and villages every female between the ages of ten and eighty had been raped often in front of their families since the wall had come down it had become well known that the soviet war memorial in east berlin had been known for decades as the tomb of the unknown rapist its possible to argue that the former east germany was a child of rape said meissner while it existed the gdr was a nation haunted by the violation of its women i know what i am talking about i was born in dresden both my mother and grandmother were victims my mother was twelve at the time so there you have it herr fabel my reason for fighting against war rape i see there was an awkward silence fabel found he didnt know what to say to meissner about her violated mother and grandmother just as he would have struggled to respond to jespersen if they had met and he had told fabel firsthand about the fate of his father and grandfather have you ever heard of a bosnian called vuja i c fabel said eventually and scrabbled in his pocket for his notebook to check the first name goran vuja i c meissner beat him to it of course i have he was lucky to slime his way out of prosecution the dodgiest defence of alibi ive ever come across vuja i c was a particularly sadistic son of a bitch and son of a bitch is right he led a paramilitary gang who called themselves psoglav it means doghead in serbian but its got some deep cultural meaning amongst bosnian serbs apparently in any different context in a peacetime european city the crimes he committed would have him condemned as a sex criminal and paedophile but for some reason in a war situation some men behave in a way they maybe wouldnt otherwise believe themselves capable not all men no not all perhaps but in a military context it seems there is a new set of values a different morality war rape is an act of cultural humiliation and sometimes as in bosnia of genocide a deliberate attempt to destroy the enemys genetic pool by forcing pregnancy and birth on the female population in bosnia it was so clearly a military strategy that the un declared it a crime against humanity but there is research that suggests that there is another side to it that participation in mass rape is a bonding mechanism for men within a military community there was evidence not hard evidence more rumour and hearsay that vuja i c used it in exactly that way thats what made him worse vuja i c rationalised it and used it as a tool but like i said we never got to prove it in a court of law well he might have wriggled his way out of prosecution but somebody certainly caught up with him in copenhagen i know it was too quick a death from what i read about it anyway whats vuja i c got to do with jake nothing said fabel and smiled nothing at all in fact it was just that his name came up in connection with something else i knew hed been involved in the bosnian war and had been implicated in the rape camps unfortunately the case on vuja i c is closed like i said a quick death with a knife in the heart is no just punishment for all the crimes he committed although i do understand why it was done actually it was probably unconnected more to do with rivalry between organisedcrime bosses fabel drained his cup and stood up thanks for your time frau meissner if anything else comes to you that you think is relevant even if you dont think its that important please give me a ring he handed her his polizei hamburg business card with the murder commission number on it meissner smiled ill do that hamburg was a lowrise city with the exception of the fernsehturm tv tower the five spires of its protestant churches the single catholic cathedral and the rathaus had been allowed to retain their dominance of the citycentre skyline over the years the city planners had ensured that almost nothing in the heart of the city exceeded the height of the established kontorhaus buildings there had however been the occasional glaring slipup and the odd monolithic hotel glowered over hamburg from the fringe of the city centre but unlike frankfurt or london there would be no attempt to ape an american skyline there was to be no canary wharf for hamburg instead architects met the creative challenge of developing striking buildings that sat well with the character and history of the city the hansat building was not one of them sitting in the neustadt quarter of the city the satellite tv stations gleaming glass and steel headquarters was the type of restrained corporate tower one found in hamburg this building had had its skyscraper ambitions cut short literally sylvie achtenhagens office was on the third of ten floors she had just returned to her office after filming her piece for that nights show when the door opened and andreas knabbe walked in without knocking how are you knabbe asked in his usual manner that suggested he did not really give a damn how the hell she or anyone else was he sat down on the edge of her desk what can i do for you herr knabbe sylvie smiled with the same level of sincerity ive just seen the piece youve done for tonight the womantrafficking stuff and and it was very good very knabbe made a show of struggling for the right word searching for it somewhere on her office ceiling very worthy but you know what to be honest it was well depressing im sorry sylvies smile had become a rictus grin youre probably right that i underplayed the comedy element of fourteenyearold east european and asian girls being sold into sex slavery quite sylvie achtenhagens irony passed cleanly over knabbes expensively barbered head i just think it isnt our kind of thing i think stories like that have more of a natural home on ard or zdf what we need is something with a bit of zing to it you know like this angel thing in st pauli now that really was yes i know youve already made it clear you think that was my shining hour i am following that up you know its just i have to get other stuff out as well maybe sylvie and this is just an idea but maybe we should let someone else have a run with this particular ball sylvie achtenhagen stood up so suddenly that knabbe was taken aback she leaned forward her face close to his forcing him off the edge of her desk dont you dare take that story from me i told you ive been working on it and im making progress when that story breaks itll be me who breaks it big time and if you put anyone else near it ill quit and take it to another broadcaster am i clear on that andreas knabbe stared at her for a moment shocked alarmed by something he had seen in her face theres no need to get heated he said at last i was just thinking what would be best whats best is for me to finish the job i started she was calm again but something smouldered after the flash fire i guarantee you it will be a killer of a story okay knabbe said some of his composure restored but if this story doesnt break it will i promise you that there was an awkward silence for a moment anyway speaking of the angel case theres something you can perhaps help me with sylvie said eventually oh knabbes voice was laden with suspicion what your business partner the lovely frau bronsted or more specifically her corporation the neuhansa group what about it well the latest victim of the st pauli killer the angel well yes for the moment lets say it is the same killer as before this latest victim of the angel worked for a company called norivon environmental apparently its a subsidiary of the neuhansa group what do you want me to do the suspicion hadnt left knabbes tone fix up an appointment for me with the ceo of norivon and maybe even with gina bronsted but dont say its about lenschs murder theyll probably work that out for themselves i dont know if frau bronsted will give you an interview and i dont know if i like where youre going with this the neuhansa group is my main business partner sylvie and whether you like it or not were in the business of television trust me andreas im not after a scoop on neuhansa or gina bronsted i just need some background information and trust me when i break this story for you it will be big very big okay ill see what i can do after knabbe had left sylvie sat and stared out of her office window not seeing the city that lay dark under a slate sky the phone ringing interrupted her equally gloomy thoughts the call was on her direct number and had not come through reception hello frau achtenhagen it was a mans voice and it broke off to cough excuse me i believe you are looking into the killings in st pauli yes who is this if you dont mind id rather not give my name not at the moment anyway more coughing you know something about the killings sylvie achtenhagen tried to keep the irritation and the boredom out of her voice there was always someone confessing to the angel killings or who knew someone who knew somebody who had said something suspicious cranks who were receiving messages through their fillings from the spirit world or who were convinced their husbandslashbossslashpet was the perpetrator yes i know a lot about the killings i know a lot about a lot of things and what i know is something you will be willing to pay for yes yes ive heard that all before no trust me frau achtenhagen i have something you have to see something really big now i definitely have heard that all before and it always ends in disappointment can we cut the crap and you tell me exactly what it is that youre trying to sell me something that you wont want me to sell to anyone else thats for sure you see i have a pretty good idea who is behind those killings in st pauli the angel now frau achtenhagen we both know its not the angel not the original angel anyway i have a pretty good idea who killed those two men last month and it certainly wasnt the original angel but that does bring me to my second point the most important one and i know you will pay big time to stop me selling it elsewhere i know the identity of the original angel i know her name where she lives what she does i even know why she killed all those men in the nineties really and how do you know that sylvie achtenhagen scrabbled through the shooting schedules and report notes on her desk until she found a pad and pencil it used to be my job to know things about people i worked for the ministry for state security in the german democratic republic youre exstasi why the hell should i pay some exstasi scum for information about murders in hamburg because im a forwardthinking kind of guy always have been i was based in the ministrys headquarters in berlinlichtenberg i was there right up until the fifteenth of january nineteen ninety there was a mob outside the gates ready to burst in and everyone was busy shredding files when the shredders couldnt cope they started to rip them up by hand it was futile so many files too many is there a point to this herr listen what is your name if you want me to pay you for your story then i need to know your name no you dont im not naive you people pay anonymous sources all the time and we both know that you wont be paying me through the usual channels however if it makes you feel better about it you can call me siegfried it has a nice wagnerian ring to it doesnt it he started to laugh but his laughter fractured into a crackling bubbling bout of coughing thats more than a cold or flu thought sylvie just listen to what i have to say he continued breathlessly when his coughing had subsided like i said when everyone else was shredding i was thinking ahead i took a file it doesnt look like much theres not a lot of information in it other than a list of names of people on a training programme a very special training programme and the file also named the top three students the ones who made the grade fascinating though this all is said sylvie what the hell has any of it got to do with the angel killings everything one of these names is the name of the original angel and it is my guess that the current st pauli killer is one of the others this is a file that i know you must have and i will sell you the file he paused for two hundred and fifty thousand euros sylvie laughed loudly you have got to be joking no story is worth that to the station and certainly not some file on stasi snoops that i still dont see having any relevance to these murders this is old news no one is interested in the stasi and the hva any more there was silence on the other end of the line hello said achtenhagen if you thought i was joking or if you thought this was all nonsense then you would have hung up by now but you didnt because you know that its the truth i want two hundred and fifty thousand euros if i dont get it i will pass this information on to another broadcaster or the press and the police you built your career on the angel killings frau achtenhagen are you really going to let someone else take that all away from you i will call back in a couple of days in the meantime ill give you something on account check your email the phone went dead sylvie achtenhagen hung up the phone and stared at it as if it would give up some answers on her desktop computer she opened up her office email there were several messages for her but all of them were either internal or workrelated none was from an anonymous source she waited ten minutes and tried again still nothing the idea struck her that perhaps he had sent it to her personal email account but she dismissed the thought almost immediately only a few friends and colleagues had her private email address but there was no harm in checking it was there a message from siegfried there were ways of tracing emails sourcing isp addresses but sylvie knew that if siegfried was an exstasi operative then he would have covered his tracks the free account could have been set up anywhere and the email sent from a cybercafe or wifi hotspot achtenhagen opened it there was no message just a single name georg drescher she saw there was an attachment and she opened it three colour photographs scanned in side by side no names each photo was a headandshoulders shot of a different girl aged achtenhagen guessed between fifteen and twenty the photographs were formal shots for a state id card or passport the hairstyle of one indicated they were of twentyodd years vintage two of the girls were blonde the third a brunette although she had striking blue eyes there was something disturbing about their faces a frightening void it went beyond the usual lack of personality projected from an officialpass portrait the eyes were dead emotionless particularly the girl in the middle as sylvie stared at her image something twisted at her gut siegfried had told her that one of these girls was the angel of st pauli and as her eyes passed from one blank face to the next she knew that he had told her the truth emily would be here soon then everything in his life would start to make sense again peter claasens had never understood women he had never really tried simply because it seemed like too much work he had been married for fifteen years and had three children two of them daughters but the female world remained a dark continent for claasens his wife in particular was still a mystery to him she had turned from the pretty quiet unassuming girl he had unintentionally got pregnant to a shrew who nagged him about every evening he spent away from the family home whether it was business or otherwise claasens had to admit if grudgingly that his wife had some grounds for her behaviour throughout his fifteen years of marriage he had been consistently unfaithful he had taken great pride however in being discreet tactful if his wife had suspicions then that was what they had remained he had never been careless enough to furnish her with substantiating evidence but there again his looks were grounds enough for suspicion the concept of looks had always puzzled claasens why were some people more appealing to look at than others more desirable claasens was a bright man a very bright man he had a sharp intellect and was a natural businessman a commercial predator yet people found it difficult to see past his appearance in the workplace men either resented him or wanted to be seen with him female colleagues were either awkward around him or flirtatious and when he didnt respond to the flirting they became resentful too but he had responded often it was true of course that his appearance had been helpful he had supplemented his income while an accountancy student by working as a photographic model he had been offered every job hed ever been interviewed for and of course even if he hadnt made a lot of money he had become involved with a trendy set from blankenese and blankenese girls usually had money to burn peter claasens had learned that fortune truly favours the fair but his looks had also insulated him from real emotion isolated him and now he stood on the top floor of the nearly complete scanmedia building and contemplated a career of seduction and adultery he looked out over hamburgs darkening skyline and thought about all of the women he had been with when he should have been with his wife and at that moment he felt genuinely completely remorseful the reason he stood and contemplated all of the women he had known and felt sympathy for his wife was that all of that was now behind him something unexpected had happened to peter claasens he had at fortytwo fallen in love from the start it had not been like his other affairs emily had not responded to his usual set of manoeuvres and tricks she had not fallen into bed with him she had talked to him she had listened to him it was as if emily was blind to how he looked and this gift allowed her to truly see him and now claasens found the periods in between seeing her were like being forced to hold your breath until your lungs screamed for air emily was english with firered hair and green eyes she spoke german fluently but with the sweetest accent and she had clearly never recognised the importance of gender or grammatical case in the language emily was also delightfully uncoordinated and clumsy he had literally bumped into her outside his offices she had fallen badly and he had helped her to her feet insisting that she come into his office for a seat emily had smiled sweetly and said it was her fault and she was fine had gathered up her stuff and hurried on claasens had just been about to go back into his office when an impulse had prompted him to run after her he had insisted that the least he could do was buy her a coffee she had accepted it had begun that had been two months ago in that short time this dizzy english redhead had turned his world upside down she had resisted becoming involved with a married man but he had insisted his marriage had been in terminal decline for some years when she had announced that she was going back to england claasens had told her he couldnt live without her that he would leave his wife and they could set up home together here in hamburg yet emily had insisted that no one should be hurt more than necessary he should tell his wife that he had to leave that their marriage had run its course but not mention that he was involved with anyone else it would be better for his wife for the kids it would be better for emily and claasens she had even asked to see the letter he intended to send his wife and had made changes just so that no one was hurt more than they had to be emily was a good person she was much much better than he was and when she was around him he became someone better someone he could like now he stood at the top of one of the biggest building projects in hamburg outside the hafencity and contemplated the past he was putting behind him hello peter he turned to see her there the dark woollen overcoat and the beret she wore emphasised the red in her hair and the green in her eyes hello emily he smiled and leaned forward to kiss her but she put her gloved fingertips to his mouth have you brought it she asked yes ive brought it and i changed it just as you asked its so like you to worry about other people ive made no mention that im involved with anybody i made the other changes you suggested too i still think it would have been better if i told her face to face a letter i just dont know may i see he handed her the letter and she read through it as emily had suggested claasens told his wife that he could not go on with the way things were that work had added to the stress that he was so sorry for the hurt he knew his actions would cause her and the children perfect said emily folding the letter with her gloved fingers she leaned against the metal railing that had temporarily been put up for safety reasons while the top floor of the building was completed claasens grabbed her elbow and pulled her back you have to be careful emily he said paternally this really is a beautiful building she said looking down ten floors into the central atrium its meant to be a modern interpretation of an old hamburg kontorhaus you know the redbrick jobs with a huge atrium or courtyard in the middle such a strange name she said in her accented german what does it mean kontorhaus it goes back to the days of the hanseatic league there would be a kontorhaus in almost every hanseatic city in europe hamburg bremen rostock danzig st petersburg there was even a kontor in london bremen and hamburg are the only cities that are still officially hanseatic cities and this building is meant to be like those old hanseatic kontor buildings emily leaned and looked over the railing again yes said claasens distracted emily stand back from the railing this safety railing is just temporary he smiled at her pushing back a strand of red hair and tucking it behind her ear and you know you can be a little accidentprone were not even supposed to be here how high are we she asked leaning further over the railing claasens eased her back gently i dont know four hundred metres id say thats a lot of forensic distance she said absently what did you say emily she stood up and turned to him i said its a lot of forensic distance it was one of the first things i learned to place as much forensic distance between myself and the point and moment of death claasens frowned in confusion he didnt understand what emily was saying and he couldnt understand why her german grammar and accent were now perfect her gloved hand sliced up like a blade and smashed into the side of his neck just below his jawline and behind his ear the blow somehow made the world dimmer and he felt his legs weaken beneath him claasens could not work out what was happening but moved to grab her she dodged him moving with a speed and precision he thought her incapable of the edge of her hand hit him again on exactly the same spot and this time his legs folded emily stepped to one side and expertly used claasenss own momentum to propel him over the safety railing he didnt even scream on the way down she leaned over the railing and looked into the vast well of the atrium claasens lay broken on the flagstones nine storeys below a crimson halo around his head it looked to emily as if he had landed on his handsome face emily took the letter he had handed her the letter she had guided him to write and threw it over the edge allowing it to flutter down onto the atrium floor chapter four he had only had a brief telephone conversation with her but fabel could tell that sarah westlands grief had started to bite she had been very businesslike and composed but there had been an edginess like a tight cord pulled through her voice grief however had not seemed to diminish her need for luxury fabel had arranged to meet her in her hotel one of hamburgs most exclusive with a view out over the inner alster sarah westland had a suite on the top floor and when he knocked on the door he was surprised it was martina schilmann who answered hello handsome she said with a wicked smile she stepped out into the hotel corridor and drew the door closed behind her you cant keep away can you youre minding sarah westland yes theres always the risk of the press pestering her yes but but we screwed up with her husband yes i know but it was she who arranged for us to provide security for his german tour i got in touch with her and told her how sorry i was she was great about it she told me that the polizei hamburg had explained that westland had deliberately given us the slip and she seems to have accepted that there was nothing we could do thanks for that obviously im providing her security for free i also told her that we wouldnt be submitting a bill for her husbands cover to be honest its a bit of damage limitation how is she shes tough but it has got to her obviously i dont think she and westland were soulmates or anything like that and i get the impression she has no illusions about his fidelity but they obviously had some kind of closeness in their own way maybe thats what having kids together does thanks martina if you dont mind id like to talk to her alone not a problem ill tell her youre here it was more like a grand venetian apartment than a hamburg hotel room and fabels first impression was of vivaldi colliding with bang and olufsen a mix of lavish baroque decoration and grand luxurious furniture with hitech electronics it was the international vernacular of fivestar luxury there was something about it that fabel found appealing and repellent at the same time a gut reaction against ostentation a northern european lutheran gut reaction jake westlands widow was a woman of careworn beauty fabel could see that at one time she must have been astounding but time had frayed the edges of her looks and he guessed her recent bereavement had unravelled them a little more she was sitting on the sofa under the huge windows that looked out across the water of the inner alster to ballindamm on the far side sarah westland was dressed very expensively but with what fabel perceived as a vague lack of style when she spoke to acknowledge his greeting he detected some kind of british regional accent but he couldnt work out quite where from english was the only language in europe that had social accents as well as regional ones and at one time fabel had had a knack of pinning down an englishmans origin and social class from his accent but he had been away from the country and the culture for so long that he had lost much of his skill sarah westland however seemed confused when fabel introduced himself youre english she asked frowning no im german but halfscottish i was brought up bilingual and spent a lot of time in britain when i was a kid i really am so sorry for your loss mrs westland are you the question seemed genuine i mean in your line of work i would imagine that you are used to death and to talking to the people left behind you never get used to it said fabel and i am genuinely sorry when can i take jake i mean his body home weve arranged the release papers sorry it took so long im afraid we can be a little bureaucratic i take it youve arranged carriage day after tomorrow from hamburg airport mrs westland can i ask you a few questions about your husband i imagined you would want to she eased back in her chair as if settling down for a longer conversation than she had anticipated if it helps find who killed jake then of course i want to help has there been any trouble with persistent fans stalkers that kind of thing just the usual nothing sinister a few oddballs but thats it if youre asking if some mad stalker did this to jake then id have to say its not anyone we know about presumably it was a german who killed him theres nobody i know of from here whos been pestering jake or anything no other disputes or grudges that you know of nothing that would lead someone to do that to jake sarah westland paused her eyes glazed a little you spoke to him on the phone the night of the concert did he say anything unusual anything that had happened or anyone he had met that caused him concern no we just talked about the concert the kids a few of the things we had to get organised after he got back sarah westlands answer was straightforward but there was a hint of something in her expression fabel decided to come back to the call later what do you know about the charity mr westland was supporting the sabine charity jake was involved in a lot of charities mr fabel i helped him with the management of his donations et cetera they covered a wide range of problems but there were three that were especially close to his heart a charity in the uk for the victims of sexual assault one that provided counselling to the children of raped women in bosnia and of course he worked very closely with the sabine organisers here in hamburg petra meissner asked fabel sarah westland looked at him with a weary expression yes petra meissner they worked together very closely so closely that the press back home started to speculate about the relationship which i guess is why you threw her name in i am not naive mr fabel i am only too aware that there were other women that jake had affairs but they were she sought the right word insignificant for all of his reputation as a ladies man jake never really understood women he never really understood me that meant that his relationships with women were pretty uncomplicated he categorised women and petra meissner fell into the businessonly category jake would never muck about with someone who was involved in something so important to him and it was important he was here for the sabine charity and nothing else his whole german tour was organised to fund that one event in hamburg why was that i mean why was it so important to mr westland do you have laws here about adopted children having the right to know their biological origin yes fabel frowned confused by the sudden change of tack yes we do adopted children have that right in law in britain its different you only get that right when you reach adulthood when youre sixteen did you know that jake was adopted yes i did he had a very close relationship with his adoptive parents particularly with his mother jake felt that it would somehow be an insult to them to go looking for his biological parents so he didnt not until they were dead his mother died three years ago and jake suddenly devoted three months of his life to finding his biological mother but when he did he was told that she didnt want to see him she was a woman in her seventies living in manchester welsh background sarah westland gave a small laugh jake was amazed to find out that he was halfwelsh he had always considered himself a hundred per cent english anyway despite her making it clear she wanted nothing to do with him jake persisted she wouldnt speak to him on the telephone and she never replied to any of his letters jake told me that he understood that he knew in the early nineteenfifties illegitimacy carried a great stigma but he was desperate to meet her so he just walked up to her house and knocked on the door what happened she spat on him this middleclass smartly dressed seventyyearold widow spat on him then she slammed the door in his face i remember he told me how he stood there in this meticulously neat suburban front garden with spit on his face it really upset him he hired a private investigator when the detective got back to him jake was devastated you see he had built up this little scenario in his head that he had been conceived through an act of forbidden love in a cruel and unforgiving time he was right about the time being cruel and unforgiving it turned out that he had been conceived by an act of rape his biological mother had been attacked in a park by a stranger she had been a teenager at the time the police never got the man and lets face it at that time the rape victim was as much a suspect as the rapist and because abortion was not an option back then she had had to go through with the pregnancy and give jake up as soon as he was born he never got to speak to his biological mother never and thats why he was so supportive of antirape charities jake never got over it to start with the idea that he had been totally and irreconcilably rejected by his mother burned him up then the more he thought about it the more he became obsessed with the idea that at least half of his dna was that of some pervert rapist he realised that she had spat on him because she hadnt seen her son standing there but the son of the pervert who raped her jake started to identify with all of these unwanted kids in bosnia who were the products of rape and with rape victims jake seemed to feel connected to them i always felt he identified each victim with his biological mother i see it was something the press never managed to get hold of not that there was as much press interest as there used to be they were interrupted by a knock on the door martina schilmann opened the door from outside and admitted a uniformed waitress who placed a tray with a coffee pot and cups on the low table what about your husbands investments asked fabel when the waitress had left he poured a cup of coffee for sarah westland and one for himself he seemed to do well out of them and he had some here i believe yes he had quite a few particularly here in hamburg jake was funny that way he could see things in people or places that others couldnt i guess thats why his investments were all so successful so why particularly hamburg sarah westland gave a halflaugh being in the music business hamburg was kind of like mecca to jake the beatles and all that but i remember hed been over here on business a sort of reconnaissance trip i suppose he said that hamburg was the place to put your money he said that hamburgers do you call them hamburgers he said that you were all natural entrepreneurs and business people he kept going on about the something league the hanseatic league yeah he said that you still had all that trading nous in you it was all about the far east he said china and india he said that hamburg was going to be the big european trading partner with the east is it true what he said about hamburg people pretty much fabel smiled theres a joke that the average german businessman would sell his mother but a hamburg politician would throw in free delivery mmm sarah westland did not seem to get the joke there again it wasnt really a time for humour would it be possible for you to get details of your husbands business dealings asked fabel could you send them over to me at the police presidium or i can arrange to have them picked up i can get someone to do that but a lot of the information will have to be sent from england it will probably take a day or two thank you for your time mrs westland fabel stood up she walked him to the door and shook his hand is there something else she asked reading his expression its just something about the night mr westland died when i asked you if there was anything unusual about the phone conversation you had with him you said there wasnt but you didnt look too sure there wasnt anything unusual she replied or at least not in what he said what we talked about its just that he seemed distracted distant i asked him what was wrong and he said he was tired that would fit with him turning down the afterconcert party jake may not have understood me but i understood him he was never too tired for a bash i knew jakes moods but this one i couldnt place it bothered me theres one more thing said sarah westland as fabel made for the door i know what people think what the newspapers are saying about why jake was in the reeperbahn and how he met his death jake was no angel and like i told you i had no illusions about his fidelity but theres one thing im certain about jake did not go to that place for sex he went there for a reason to meet someone im convinced of it am i being deported asked vestergaard with a cold smile when fabel pulled up at the taxi rank outside the main terminal building of hamburgfuhlsbuttel airport a uniformed federal police officer walked purposefully over to the car but fabel stopped him in his tracks by holding his bronze oval criminal police disc up to the glass of his window no this is all about arrival karin not departure said fabel i want us to retrace jespersens steps as much as we can with the information weve got youre a dane like jespersen and youre new to hamburg ive brought you along to point out the things i might miss okay jespersen arrives as hes walking through the arrivals hall he makes two calls one to his deputy fabel snapped his fingers impatient at his own forgetfulness harald tolstrup vestergaard helped him out harald tolstrup who tells him that his hotel is booked harald also told jens that i wanted to speak to him as soon as possible why was that simple i wanted to know what the hell he was up to and to make sure he kept me up to date on his movements i knew he wouldnt but i had to try to keep him on some kind of leash okay so then he phones me at the presidium but im in a meeting so he leaves his number he comes out of the terminal and takes a taxi into the city weve not been able to trace the driver who took him but given the flight arrival time and the time he checked into the hotel its pretty safe to say he travelled directly to the hotel without stops fabel started the engine again and pulled out he drove back down towards the city imagine youre in a taxi youre jespersen you have the scrap of a rumour about a hit woman based in hamburg that vuja i c let slip six years ago you have the name of a german detective in your notebook me you also have other bits of information at hand like the name olaf but at the moment we can only guess about their relevance theres bits and pieces about the east german stasi and in particular one officer what was his name drescher and jens had been looking into gennady frolov the russian okay so youve arrived in hamburg what do you do now well i know where im going im checked into the hotel and ive given the address to the taxi driver yes said fabel emphatically you do know where youre going but youve only just confirmed it with tolstrup on the phone so whoever kills me later that night doesnt know yet where i am staying exactly he was followed someone followed him from the airport fabel hit the button on his handsfree phone it was werner meyer who answered werner i want you to get someone to contact the chief of security at fuhlsbuttel see if you can get the cctv footage of the taxi rank outside arrivals from about half an hour before until half an hour after jens jespersen arrived use the phone log to check when he tried to get me at the murder commission thatll pinpoint when he left the airport building okay chef said werner what are we looking for jespersen getting into the taxi and leaving i want the number of the taxi so we can trace the driver but more specifically i want any trace of someone taking off after him im on it chef what do i tell the nordic ice maiden if she turns up looking for you shes sitting right next to me idiot said fabel and youre on speakerphone just count yourself lucky that she cant speak german at the other end of the connection werner laughed it doesnt matter what language i talk women never understand me ill get the footage organised when will you be back give me a couple of hours or so sometime after lunch fabel turned to vestergaard to see if there was any hint that she had picked up on werners jibe there wasnt okay back to jespersen where are you going now vestergaard frowned somewhere i could get information on the stasi wrong city berlin would have been his best bet for that the federal commission that deals with stasi files and information is based there it has offices elsewhere but all of them are in east germany did he have any plans to travel further not that i know of that doesnt mean he didnt intend to take time to go to berlin theres a highspeed rail link from hamburg he could have got there and back in a day fabel drove on into the city and pulled up outside vestergaards hotel on alter wall okay he said jespersen stayed here too he checks into the hotel and goes out why to kill time to see the city maybe or to meet someone we dont know about its possible or he may have simply been looking for somewhere to get lunch he was very regular in his eating habits so lets say he goes for lunch places to eat within walking distance from here fabel thought it over then shook his head central hamburg could be any of a hundred places if there were only some way of narrowing it down is it that important to know where he ate i think it might be weve established that he was probably followed from the airport hes tried to speak to me but failed my guess is that whoever was after him wanted him shut up before he could contact me whatever he was putting together as soon as he started to frame it up and discuss it with others then too many people know about it for them to control it they follow him here and tail him to where he was eating its there that they make contact somehow they get someone to gain his trust a woman maybe our socalled valkyrie but surely if hes investigating a female professional killer remember he doesnt know that they know about him some attractive woman bumps into him and starts a conversation and he doesnt suspect a thing jens wasnt really the chatty type vestergaard gave a bitter laugh particularly in germany but remember were talking about real experts prepared briefed there will have been something to hook him and perhaps she appeared to be nongerman danish even just to get him off his guard but we dont know where he went for lunch fabel looked as if he had just got a small static shock the toy what toy we found a toy one of these hamburg souvenir teddy bears it was in his hotel room with the rest of his stuff fabel shook his head impatiently hold on a minute he hit the button on his car phone and again got through to the murder commission he asked to speak to anna wolff anna im going to ask you to do something and its going to sound trivial believe me its not do you remember that teddy bear found at the jespersen scene it should be in the evidence locker it should said anna but its not its on my desk ive named him captain cutie for gods sake anna thats evidence you cant just fabel drew a breath forget it just read the manufacturers label and get in touch with them i want to know who they distribute to in hamburg make it within a threekilometre radius of jespersens hotel like i say anna this is urgent and important i think i can manage it said anna flatly fabel hung up and turned to vestergaard if we locate the outlet then they might have security cameras or they might be in a mall with cctv and that means we may be able to get a look at jespersens killer sylvie achtenhagen decided not to drive to berlin instead she caught the sbahn from altona into hamburgs main railway station and then took advantage of the gleaming new highspeed train that connected germanys two biggest cities it took just over an hour and a half to get to berlin the weather had stayed bright and cold and sylvie watched the flat north german landscape slide by occasionally going through the notes she had made much like the train she had just travelled on berlins main railway station was a statement a promise about the future only two years old the station was now a major berlin landmark a weaving of metal and glass on a monumental scale it said very clearly to the world that this was after all the very heart of a new europe sylvie made her way through the main concourse and out to the taxi stand where to love asked the driver in a thick berlin accent the birthler office off to see your file are you love the birthler office or bstu was shorthand for the headquarters of an organisation whose name needed to be abbreviated the federal commission for preserving the records of the ministry for state security of the german democratic republic its abbreviated form took its name from the serving federal commissioner marianne birthler it took only fifteen minutes to get to the birthler office and after waiting a further ten sylvie was greeted by a gauntlooking man in his early fifties who introduced himself as max wengert wengert explained that he worked for the department that dealt with media requests for access to files sylvie as a familiar face from television was used to people reacting differently towards her than perhaps they would normally there was something about wengerts broad smile as he greeted her that suggested smiling was not something he did often in that greeting she recognised someone she could probably manipulate to divulge more information than he should its so kind of you to take the time to help me with this herr wengert sylvie smiled sweetly as he guided her into an interview room personally as it were i have to admit to being something of a fan of yours he smiled again and exposed tobaccostained teeth sylvie imagined him sitting alone in some tiny berlin flat watching her on tv she embellished the image a little too much and felt a shudder of revulsion but she hid it well were you able to find out anything about the name i gave you georg drescher she asked wengert pulled the chair out from the table in the interview room inviting sylvie to sit his long grey face took on a conspiratorial expression actually frau achtenhagen its quite a coincidence you are the second person to enquire about that name this week really who was the other enquiry from was it another broadcaster or a newspaper neither wengert looked unsure for a moment well i suppose it does no harm to tell you no it wasnt actually a media enquiry it came from the police the polizei hamburg i see said sylvie did they say why they were interested in drescher no they didnt i couldnt help them and im afraid i cant help you we do know from other files referring to him that he did exist but major georg drescher does not have a personal file that we can trace nor can we find any other file of a significant nature with reference to him or his activities all the mentions we have of him are in minor files where he is sometimes literally merely a footnote isnt that well odd far from it frau achtenhagen the stasi had masses of files millions every report from an unofficial collaborator was written up indexed and filed take the personal files on individuals there are six million of them out of a total population of what sixteen million that means theres a lot of inconsequential stuff in there but the important stuff the big secrets a lot of that was shredded or removed towards the end of eightynine beginning of ninety the stasi saw the writing on the wall if youll pardon the pun added to which there were thousands of civilrights protesters outside waiting to get in to tear the place apart and get their hands on the files which they did on the fifteenth of january i would imagine it must have been mayhem in stasi headquarters in the days and hours before the protesters got in when they did they stopped the destruction of the files but a lot of the more incriminating material had already been shredded we recovered nearly seventeen thousand sacks containing nearly fifty million shredded pages and were still trying to put them together but thats not the whole story in amongst those civilrights protesters who broke in were members of the american cia who helped themselves to some of the most sensitive information they wanted to get their hands on lists of agents working in the west and i would also guess that in amongst the protesters there were more than a few stasi agents and informers trying to get to their files before anyone else and you think thats what happened to dreschers files asked sylvie that hes managed to wipe his existence from the records maybe but not necessarily we are still trying to put the shredded and handtorn files back together it was only last year that we developed a computersoftware system that can reassemble the pages digitally and speed the whole process up even with that its going to take us until but you can be very sure that there will be some nasty surprises along the way a lot of former stasi agents and informers wont be sleeping too easily in their beds ill tell you that maybe dreschers files are somewhere in there waiting to be put together if theyre here at all sylvie let out a long breath in disappointment there is something else wengert leaned forward lowering his voice you know that the bstu is going to be absorbed into the state records office its because of the hans hugo klein investigation it showed the level to which the bstu has been infiltrated by exstasi people who could be working inside here to hide or destroy the files were supposed to be protecting and reconstructing so maybe drescher has a friend in here wengert shrugged who knows sorry i cant be of more help what about the other names i gave you well unless it is related to your personal file if you have one here or unless it is demonstrably in the public interest im not supposed to release that kind of information herr wengert sylvie smiled at the official and watched him melt men were so easy to manipulate would i be right in saying that you were one of the civilrights activists who stormed the lichtenberg bastille wengert beamed with pride yes i was then you are clearly a man who stands up for what is right who cares about the truth and youve said yourself this place is probably lousy with exstasi scum how can we get to the truth if we play by the rules and they dont i promise you that the people on the list i sent you are not the ones i want to expose i just want to talk to them thats all but they may lead me to drescher and he is someone we should care about i am not asking for you to compromise your ethics herr wengert im asking you to stand by them wengert stared at sylvie an inner struggle obviously going on behind his dull eyes he stood up decisively wait here a moment please he said and left the room fabel had left vestergaard at her hotel to freshen up he had promised her that he would let her know as soon as they ascertained where jespersen had eaten lunch or if they had uncovered any sightings of a tail from the airport he felt he was making progress but the idea that it could all be a wildgoose chase continued to haunt him he was on his way back into the office when anna phoned ive had a call she said from a brightasabutton alleagerashell commissar based down at commissariat twelve in klingberg shes keen to speak to you i said you would ring her back but seeing as youre in the area whats it about a suicide it looks straightforward and he left a note took a dive and landed on his face from what she said this guy really does have eyes in the back of his head anna fabel injected a warning tone into his voice anyway shes got in touch because she thinks somethings a bit off about the whole thing she admits her feeling is groundless but she wanted to talk to you about it she asked for me particularly i think shes after my job her timings impeccable fabel let the jibe pass is she on duty now yep i thought id let you know because of this valkyrie thing you know any death that there could be any doubt about whats her name iris schmale im guessing all that schoolgirl exuberance will make her easy to recognise police commissariat klingberg was less well known than davidwache but architecturally it was probably even more impressive one of hamburgs most famous landmarks was the chilehaus in the citys kontorhaus quarter the chilehaus as almost every hamburg tour guide would tell visitors was designed to resemble the sharpedged prow of a ship the klingberg police station had been built in into the flank of the chilehaus complex it was in itself a magnificent piece of brickwork fabel suppressed a grin when criminal commissar iris schmale greeted him in the main office she was exactly as anna had imagined her young freshfaced and bubbling with enthusiasm she had rebellious vibrant red hair tied back into a long ponytail and her pale complexion was clustered with freckles it gave her a girlish look i believe you have a suicide that smells fishy said fabel i do herr principal chief commissar the dead mans name was peter claasens he owned and ran a shipping agency on the edge of the kontorhaus quarter from what i can see he had everything going for him wife kids highly successful business lots of people with families and successful businesses commit suicide every day said fabel and i believe the deceased left a note exactly said schmale fabel failed to suppress a grin at her vehemence thats exactly it theres something about the suicide note thats she frowned as she sought the right word ambiguous do you have it here she handed him a sheet of paper this is a photocopy the note was found several metres from the body no blood on it the only fingerprints were those of the deceased fabel began reading the note out loud dear marianne he raised an eyebrow at schmale wife dear marianne i am sorry i have to do this and i know that right at this moment you are angry with me but i need you to understand that there is no other way forward for me to go it is tough to leave you and the kids behind but it is better for me to go i have made sure you will all be provided for and i dont want you to think ill of me for making the only decision i could make this is my decision and i want you to know that no one else played a part in it im sorry i wont be around every day to see the kids grow up but i just couldnt go on the way things were i know you understand goodbye peter fabel handed the sheet back to schmale have you spoken to the wife of course i know that bereaved families often find the idea of suicide difficult to accept but marianne claasens just simply refuses to believe that he committed suicide and she doesnt strike me as a woman overwhelmed by the shock of it all shes not in denial she really is certain that her husband did not kill himself and that note what about it well it could mean anything i tried to imagine it out of context that it hadnt been found at the scene of a suicide and to me it reads more like someone whos leaving his wife not killing himself i want you to know that no one else played a part in it how could anyone else play a part in his suicide that sounds to me like he was about to clear off with someone else and wanted to keep her name out of it fabel thought about what schmale had said and as he did so she watched him urgently like the accused waiting for the judges verdict that was good thinking he said and smiled about viewing the note in a neutral context but if this isnt suicide then its murder and if as you suspect he was about to leave his wife that makes her the prime suspect have you checked her out yes herr principal chief commissar she was nowhere near claasenss office and she has a dozen witnesses to prove it she was at some function at the st georg hospital shes a consultant there oncologist and claasens as i said he was a shipping agent he had his own business arranging exportimport traffic for major hamburgbased concerns he specialised in the far east any suspicious involvements not in his business dealings he seems to have been one of hamburgs most respected businessmen and he had political ambitions too apparently was thinking about running for the hamburg senate thats the other thing suicides dont tend to plan their futures you said there was nothing suspicious in his business dealings was there something in his private life from what i can gather claasens was a bit of a ladies man another reason why i would read a different interpretation into that note let me see it again fabel read through it once more okay i think you may have something ill put a team on the case to work with you fabel left the klingberg commissariat and iris schmale standing grinning as if shed won the lottery she was a smart kid that was for sure but on the face of it there was nothing to suggest that there was any more to claasenss death than what it seemed to be a burntout exec taking a dive from his office building but walking back to his car as the winter sky glowered down on the kontorhaus quarter fabel knew the feeling in his gut was the same nagging that iris schmale had felt a policemans instinct it was getting dark already he checked his watch and knowing she would be home from school he decided to phone gabi whats up dad fabels daughter habitually used the english term it wouldnt have sounded right for her to call him anything else you free for a coffee what now i could meet you at about six we could get something to eat thats if your mother doesnt mind shes working late ill leave a note usual place in the arkaden usual place see you then fabel sat in the cafe looking out towards the alster it was too dark now to see the swans gliding across its winter shield of dark water instead his own reflection stared back at him he thought he looked tired and older the grey had started to insinuate itself into the blond of his hair and the wrinkles were deepening around his eyes he sat and sipped the tea he had ordered and waited for gabi to arrive a huddle of young women barely more than girls sat two tables away students from the look of them there were five of them and they laughed and joked in the careless way that only the young seem able to fabel found himself envious of an as yet unjaded unmuted enthusiasm for life that he had felt himself once his phone rang it was anna wolff the teddy bear that jespersen bought she said it was bought from a shop in the hanseviertel ive spoken to them but the name jespersen doesnt ring any bells but that doesnt really mean anything they have so many customers passing through a lot of them tourists and foreigners one thing we do know though is that he paid cash theres no record of him using his credit card maybe he got it somewhere else said fabel nope the store had them on special order picked the jumper design themselves this is the only place that sells them the hanseviertel fabel muttered what jespersen probably had lunch in the hanseviertel check which restaurants and cafes have cctv and get the tapes for lunchtime that day yes chef sighed anna fabel let it go anything on the tapes from the reeperbahn have we got a picture of the fake taxi yet not yet well chase them up for gods sake its the only lead weve got after he hung up fabel turned back to the window to watch for gabi arriving and only looked in the girls direction when they started to leave it was the last girl he noticed their eyes met and recognition registered in hers she was wearing a grungy black jacket and was hatless her fair hair gathered roughly into a ponytail fabel smiled faintly at her knowing he should know her but unable to place her she looked away in that swift but casual manner as if she hadnt seen him that every policeman recognises as an effort not to be noticed it was only after the girls had disappeared around the corner into poststrasse that fabel realised the girl was christa eisel the young prostitute who had found jake westland dying behind herbertstrasse there was something about the realisation that depressed fabel it was as if he had been unable to recognise her because he had seen her in an appropriate context she had been where she should be with friends of her own age talking and laughing about life he wondered how many of her friends knew about her other life maybe that was it maybe everybody has a double life another face for another context whats up pops fabel was taken aback as gabi who had spoken in english dropped into the seat opposite him he leaned over and kissed his daughter and then smiling let his hand rest for a moment on her cheek you okay dad there was concern in gabis voice im fine sweetheart he said its just that its good to see you its always good to see you have i ever told you how proud i am of the way youre turning out all the time dad is this you softening me up for the big lecture the waitress came over and they placed their order your mother told you what i wanted to talk to you about he asked after the waitress had gone kind of or what she wants you to talk to me about gabi pushed at a small deposit of spilt salt pushing it into a pile she wants you to talk me out of a police career well i thought you knew me better than that fabel said indignantly and your mother should too and one thing i know for sure is that i could never talk you into or out of anything sorry dad but i do want to discuss it with you if its what you really want then im with you all the way but i do want you to know what youre getting into the truth is but dont tell mum this that ive not made up my mind im just thinking about it thats all what i want to do is study law and jurisprudence first maybe criminology then see thats a good plan gabi keep your options open how would you feel if i joined the police gabi looked at fabel earnestly and for a moment he remembered the serious little face she had always put on when she had been little if concentrating like i said gabi its your decision thats not what im asking im asking what you would think for a moment fabel sat and stared past gabi and in the direction that christa eisel had taken a girl just a few years older than his daughter i think there are worse paths to take much worse but i wont pretend i wouldnt worry about you the danger there is physical danger thats true but theres psychological danger too some of the things you see some of the people you deal with its a whole new dimension of life that you wouldnt come across normally you deal with it not as well as i should if im totally honest thats why i nearly chucked it all in last year but you see dad i didnt know that you have never spoken to me about your work im sorry maybe i should have but the truth is most of police work is boring or depressing take my job its one of the top jobs you can have in the police and because of all of the stuff you read and see on the tv youd think it was exciting and glamorous believe me its not ninetynine per cent more than ninetynine per cent of the murders i deal with are committed by people of low iq fuelled by drink or drugs in seedy or squalid surroundings the truth is that murder is vulgar the vast majority of crime is there are very few criminal masterminds or genius serial killers out there most of the time you end up with someone sitting across the table from you who is in many ways just another victim of their own crime they sit there probably only just sobered up confused and wondering how the hell they ended up in the position theyre in but not always surely no not always then you get the sociopaths the rapists the drug dealers the career criminals who have killed or maimed purely for personal gratification or gain but again gabi its not the way you see it on the tv these are the dregs of society i think i have a more sophisticated perspective than you seem to think dad i live in the real world i dont get my ideas from the tv fair enough fabel smiled at his daughter i know youre a bright kid but its important that you know just what it is youre getting yourself into its a job that gets to you no matter how hard or tough you think you are something somewhere along the way will get to you are you talking about me or are you talking about maria klee i know what happened to her is that what youre worried about tell me dad and i want you to be totally honest would you be having this talk with me if i were your son and not your daughter yes absolutely that has nothing to do with it this is all to do with who you are not what gender you are some people are cut out for the job others arent do you think i am gabi asked with more than a touch of defiance at that moment fabel saw a hint of renates fieriness in his daughters eyes i dont know said fabel i really mean that even after all these years i sometimes doubt that i am i just want you to keep as open a mind as you can about your future he paused for a moment unsure whether to commit his next thought to words ive never said anything bad about your mother you know that dont you i know i also know that you had good reason to but never did gabi said her expression sad im not going to start now gabi but i do want you not to let her sway you from whatever course you pick for yourself me neither its up to you and i know that your mother can be a little bitter gabi finished the thought for him the truth is it didnt take her long to realise the mistake she had made ludiger never did match up to you for her despite all of his charm he turned out to be a creep i never did get the story about why they broke up im guessing it was another woman gabi didnt answer right away didnt you know dad he knocked her about hit her not often and not so badly that it would show but once is too often fabel gazed at gabi i had no idea his expression suddenly darkened he never laid a hand on you did he if he did gabi held her hand up take it easy dad no he didnt trust me he would only have got to try it once the bastard fabel shook his head in disbelief i mean renate i would never have imagined her as a battered wife now given everything youve just been telling me about police work i think thats a pretty naive thing for a policeman to say you should know that you can never tell a victim of domestic violence by their appearance you say it didnt happen that often i think it followed the usual pattern he started to get violent more for less provocation i think mum took the attitude that she had made her own bed so shed have to lie in it but eventually she decided to throw him out did you ever see him hit her oh no he was very careful about that i didnt know about it until mum told me after it was all over she told me then that she wished shed never split up with you that when you and she were married it would never have crossed her mind that you could hit her shit said fabel i had no idea well maybe you can understand a little better now why shes always on your case the waitress returned with their meal as they ate they fell into a more general conversation about school friends how things were going at home fabel always enjoyed his daughters company and he was glad to move on to lighter topics but all the time he thought about his exwife renate how strongwilled and independentspirited she had always been and how degrading it must have been for her to have been assaulted by behrens in her own house the thought darkened his mood and he found himself also thinking about the brief look that he had exchanged with strongwilled independentspirited christa eisel and every time he thought of her it gave him a bad feeling ute cranz looked at her watch before casting one final glance over the carefully arranged table robert gerdes would arrive in the next few minutes everything was ready the table set each course of the meal scheduled for readiness at exactly the right time and the kitchen everything in the kitchen was prepared she walked across to the fulllength mirror in the hall by the door her deep auburn hair was gathered up her lipstick and makeup were perfectly done she was wearing a simple but expensive deep green dress that had a sharkskin lustre to it for a moment she worried that it made her look reptilian then laughed at her own insecurity the dresss colour and sheen simply complemented and highlighted the rich copper tones in her hair she smoothed the dress over her hips and thighs she looked great if ute needed confirmation she got it when gerdes arrived exactly on time frau cranz he said when she opened the door to admit him you look radiant his eyes scanned her figure before settling on her face his eyes were smiling knowing i brought these he held up a large manila envelope these are the details of the lease im sure yours are the same taking the envelope and placing it on the hall table she picked up the glass she had left waiting there for his arrival she smiled and handed it to him a little prosecco i thought it would be nice are you not joining me i will in a minute she said parting her red lips to expose perfect teeth would you mind making yourself at home ive just a few things to finish in the kitchen not at all he said with a gracious bow ute thought gerdes had an almost aristocratic look he was wearing a blazer a crisp white collar and a blue tie with fine red stripes through it there was something about him that made him look as though he belonged in a different era a past time she extended her arm in the direction of the dining table indicating he should sit excused herself once more and walked through to the kitchen she closed the door behind her from where he was sitting gerdes would not have been able to see into the kitchen when she opened the door she had planned it that way she stood and took a moment to think through all she had to do then she cast an eye around the kitchen just to make sure yes everything was ready ute stood listening to the soup simmering on the hob and the low whirr of the ovens fan while all around her the floor the work surfaces even the walls to shoulder height were covered in thick blue plastic sheeting to catch any splashes of his blood fabel could tell there was something on susannes mind as soon as he came through the door of their apartment he had become attuned to her moods since they had been together he knew when something was troubling her but like most men he was capable only of reading the big signs and not the small print how did your talk with gabi go susanne smiled but still looked preoccupied fine you know gabi shes a smart kid smart enough to make up her own mind about things fabel kissed susanne whats up he asked ive been through the files you gave me on the westland and lensch murders there was an impatient energy in the way susanne spoke okay fabel followed susanne through to the lounge and they sat on the sofa the files spread out in front of them on the coffee table what about your rule of not talking shop at home i thought it was our rule anyway ill let it go this once theres something not right here there is no pattern in terms of victim profile or chronology but we havent had enough victims for any true pattern to emerge you did with the original murders in the nineties but this time i dont know she frowned as she flicked through the notes youre putting your money on a copycat right yes at least for the moment okay lets say it is a copycat said susanne what kind of killer or killers are we looking at god knows youre almost as much an expert in the psychology of multiple murderers as i am so you know that there are four broad groups that female serial killers fall into yep fabel said leaning back in the sofa and placing his hands behind his head angels of death black widows revenge killers and insanity killers right said susanne she got up went through to the kitchen and came back with a chilled bottle of wine and two glasses she poured them both a glass very nice he said sipping the wine you cant beat a nice crisp chardonnay and a chat about dismembered bodies do you want to hear this or not susanne said impatiently okay the four groups and youre trying to pick where our girl belongs trying is right take the angels of death women who are usually nurses or other medical professionals who kill the vulnerable and usually for profit or because they feel they are doing the victim a favour when all the time theyre really getting off on the power trip of having life or death in their hands shes not one of them agreed fabel took another sip of his wine then there are black widows black widows in turn fall into two categories the profitmotivated and the sexual predator or psychosexually motivated their victims tend to be known to them intimate they kill their sexual partners or men they pick up im sleeping on the couch tonight fabel grinned then wiped the grin from his face in response to susannes frown okay maybe our girl falls into that category she does make sexual overtures and plays the part of a prostitute but she doesnt gain from the killings financially she did take westlands phone diary and wallet susanne shook her head thats not the kind of score a black widow kills for and i dont see her deriving a sexual benefit from the killings unless she orgasms because of the act of killing the violence itself but that would be extremely rare in a female killer wouldnt it asked fabel yep said susanne its very common in male serialkilling behaviour but extremely rare in female killers but not totally unknown youve heard of irma grese the bitch of belsen said fabel frowning yes of course ive heard of her grese had only turned twentythree when she was hanged for crimes against humanity meaning that she began committing those crimes from the age of about nineteen or twenty she was a small plain not too bright and totally unexceptional girl who came from a basically antinazi family yet she developed a taste a hunger for exceptional cruelty both psychological and physical she had a whip woven out of cellophane which would cut prisoners as she whipped them she shot and beat prisoners to death and it was clear she derived gratification from it everything points to her being a sexual sadist as a psychological case she serves as a warning about how female sexual drive can be channelled into political or religious hysteria the thing about grese was that she was an absolutely fanatical member of the league of german girls she was obsessed with it these girls were indoctrinated with nazi ideology at their most impressionable age and at a key stage in their sexual development almost all of the female guards in concentration camps were recruited from the ranks of the league and greses sexual maturation coincided with her being in a position of power where she could physically abuse prisoners it was an exceptional context and an exceptional point in history and greses sexual sadism was exceptional fabel concluded the thought with both sets of murders i find the violence the expert violence totally atypical of what i would expect this is behaviour that would normally take a long long time to mature so you think it could be the same killer fabel was confused she was younger than many of the women he had been with of late younger and more attractive he had a naturally suspicious nature and found himself wondering why she had made the running it was not unusual though he told himself younger women were known to go for more mature men particularly those they felt were intellectually or economically superior hypergamy they called it he laughed at the thought do you have family herr gerdes ute cranz asked as she came in to serve the soup not of my own he smiled i have three nieces of whom i am very fond what about you frau cranz do you have family no she smiled sadly just my late husband i do have a sister but she became very ill shes in hospital permanently oh i am sorry to hear that said gerdes please call me ute may i offer you more wine then you must call me robert yes please arent you going to join me yet perhaps later i very seldom drink robert i find it muddles me even a little but please i want you to enjoy some gerdes took a long sip it really is very good gerdes sat and ate and drank and listened to ute cranz she had that strange ability that women seemed to have to talk a lot but say nothing but he smiled and nodded and said the right things at the right time she certainly was an attractive woman she had large dark eyes and her chestnut hair was cut short she had an appealing figure too slim but with a hint of voluptuousness through the sheen of her dress yet there was something about her that troubled him he was certain they had met somewhere before have you lived in hamburg all your life she asked long enough for me to consider myself a native hamburger he said taking another sip of his wine what about you ute oh no i moved here from the east mecklenburg a town called zarrentin its small but very pretty its on a lake the schaalsee before the wall came down it was right on the border with the west we had an ugly border checkpoint and fences and stuff but thats long gone now if you dont mind my asking how long has it been since herr cranz passed on asked gerdes he was annoyed that his voice sounded at least to him a little slurry yet the wine seemed to have had no other effect on him if you dont mind me saying you seem tragically young to be a widow three years nearly four she refilled his glass she served a typical hamburg eel soup followed by duck breasts in a spicy orange sauce and a strawberrymousse dessert it was he had to admit a wellcooked meal afterwards she served coffee and asbach brandy and asked him to sit on the sofa when he stood up his legs felt wobbly and he had to steady himself on the edge of the table what was wrong with him he hadnt had that much to drink ute cranz noticed his stumble but passed no comment it was embarrassing none the less he sat on the sofa and sipped his asbach she came back from the kitchen and sat next to him on the sofa gerdes smiled weakly im afraid i dont feel very well the words came to his lips with difficulty he felt numb and for some reason afraid he decided to stop drinking the asbach and tried to set the glass down on the arm of the sofa but it slipped and smashed on the floor im sorry he tried to say but the words came out as a low incoherent moan its all right ute said clearly interpreting his meaning but remaining totally unperturbed by his condition its not your fault its because of the metaxalone gerdes tried to articulate a question but this time he couldnt even manage a moan i had to think it through very carefully i wanted to immobilise you without there being too much of a sedative or analgesic effect the great thing about metaxalone is that its effectiveness is vastly increased when its digested gerdes tried to move but he felt as if his arms and legs were made of lead oh and theres some succinylcholine in there as well she said as if suddenly recalling an ingredient for a cake recipe you know suxamethonium chloride ill be injecting you with some more of that later gerdes felt a scream rise from deep within but it failed to break the surface he felt his head begin to flop backwards she eased it onto the cushioned back of the sofa of course you are very familiar with suxamethonium chloride she continued it is a highly effective deepmuscle relaxant and is an excellent assassins tool you can make it look like someone has died from natural causes heart failure unless of course some diligent pathologist picks up on hyperkalaemia but dont worry the dosage youve absorbed wont stop your heart its much more effective intravenously but the great thing about suxamethonium chloride is that its colourless odourless and soluble in water and alcohol youve ingested quite an amount of it along with the metaxalone over the evening robert oh do you mind if i stop this silly nonsense and call you by your real name georg oh yes i know who you are major drescher i know all about you ute disappeared for a moment into the kitchen and returned with a metal tray that had a disposable hypodermic on it he wanted to scream to fight to grab her and squeeze the life out of her but he couldnt he was completely immobilised he found that he could still blink but that was all a great terror surged through him it was claustrophobia a panic caused by the realisation that he was trapped within his own body ute jabbed the hypodermic carelessly and roughly into his forearm he felt the needle jab painfully into his skin he felt it but he didnt even flinch yes i know major drescher that was a little taste of whats to come the succinylcholine isnt anaesthetic and is only analgesic in muscle tissue i promise that you will feel absolutely everything i do to you they use it in many states in the us as part of lethalinjection execution highly controversial theres a theory that god knows how many condemned prisoners have died in absolute agony because the anaesthetic part of the injection hasnt worked but because they have been completely immobilised by the succinylcholine there is no outward sign that they are in the most terrible pain like being burned at the stake but from the inside out but like i say you know all about it dont you thats what you taught your girls isnt it is that what you meant when you told me that you had three nieces how did she know his real name was drescher he had painstakingly covered up his traces only a professional a top professional could have uncovered them who was she where had he met her before dreschers mind raced and his heart pounded the thing that frightened him most was that ute kept disappearing from his field of view incapable of moving his head he could not follow her movements with his eyes his head was tilted back and he could only see what was immediately before him ute reappeared for an instant he saw a flash of something that looked like a thick roll of heavyduty blue plastic she bent down and was lost from view but he guessed that she was unrolling the plastic on the floor in front of the sofa she moved around behind him tucked her arms under his armpits and pulled him off the sofa he rolled off the edge and his face slammed painfully onto the plasticcovered hardwood floor his nose was pressed hard against the floor and he heard his breath hiss and bubble through his bleeding nose she turned his head sideways his cheek against the plastic he was facing the sofa and could see an earring that ute cranz obviously had dropped and it had rolled out of sight he thought how surreal it would be that that would be one of the last things he would see a forgotten earring under a sofa he guessed she would find it soon when she was cleaning up after killing him she rolled him onto his back and slid him across the living room and through into the kitchen drescher might not have been able to see the whole room but he now had a pretty good idea of what was about to happen to him almost everything in the kitchen that he could see had been covered in the same blue plastic to protect it from the splashes of blood and other body fluids there would be no mess afterwards and while it was happening to him there would be no screams no cries of agony to alert the neighbours all dreschers screaming would echo only in the confines of his own skull ute leaned over him and pushed her face into his i wouldnt have been a good student for you would i major drescher there is no forensic distance here is there but you see i dont care i dont care about being caught you will be all over me drescher your blood your sweat your fear i am going to let it cover me but first comrade major were going to have a little slide show okay said fabel pouring susanne another glass of wine weve ruled out that were dealing with an angel of deathmercy or a black widow so that leaves us with her being a revenge killer or simply insane insanity is out serial killers tend to have identity disorders but only a tiny percentage are clinically insane and within serial killing there are the two personality types higher iq and organised or lower iq and disorganised this killer is highly organised that suggests to me that shes smart and shes not mad fabel set his glass back on the table revenge the original angel killings in the nineties had revenge all over them in its most abstract form i mean the castration thing was a rather unsubtle way of declaring that she was emasculating abusers revenge killers are most often women who kill a series of individuals because they perceive those individuals to have victimised them in the past this could be real victimisation revenge for earlier abuse or it can be that revenge is exacted on a type of person who is targeted by association but there was no connection between any of the victims their paths never crossed and they were picked at random no they werent they were targeted jan because they were users of prostitutes just like the victims of aileen wuornos in the usa around the same time wuornos had been abused as a child and then as a prostitute she projected her experience on every man who used prostitutes and saw them as potential abusers she killed them in revenge for what she had gone through at the hands of men like them but that only fits with the first series of murders in the nineties theres no symbolic castration this time round exactly susanne said emphatically castration was the signature for each murder a fundamental element if youre dealing with a copycat why has she dropped this central motif i know what you mean said fabel thats been bothering me the answer ive come up with is that its too messy and takes up too much time but if she is the original angel or if shes a true copycat she would feel i dont know unfulfilled if she didnt emulate the ritual of the original killings okay said fabel so what youre saying is that we had a revenge killer the first time round and now weve got someone pretending to be a copycat theres something else that bothers me women are in the main less violent than men agreed agreed that is reflected across all aspects of behaviour including ironically serial killers less than fifteen per cent of all violent crime is committed by women and only one in six serial killers is a woman of those the vast majority use nonviolent means poisoning more than anything else and if they do use violence then it tends to be smothering or strangulation wuornos of course used a gun but the point is they dont tend to slash stab or bludgeon victims to death which male serial killers do both the murders in the late nineties and the recent killings are extremely violent and bloody and also highly efficient said fabel the efficiency fits the pattern the violence doesnt i had a call from ulrich wagner the guy at the bka whos helping me coordinate the settingup of the super murder commission thing he told me that a woman has escaped from the secure state mental hospital in mecklenburg ive listed her officially as a possible for these murders her escape and her activities before being committed were those of a highly organised killer on top of which she belongs to the fourth group of female serials shes insane and that means all bets are off oh by the way she castrated three victims that makes her a fit for the first series of murders not this exactly and she was confined to the hospital for the whole duration of the first series i can see why she may be a front runner but theres still something about the violence of these attacks that doesnt fit with a female serial so what are you saying that were looking for a man dressed as a woman no jan said susanne im not saying this isnt a woman but has it never occurred to you that we might not be dealing with a serial killer at all as a matter of fact it has said fabel he contemplated his wine swirling it in the glass this doesnt make any sense i know but bear with me you know jens jespersens death of course thats the whole reason why karin vestergaard is here isnt it quite well i have this feeling that his death is in some way connected with all this but theres no similarity surely ive been a policeman for a long time susanne and one thing that ive learned to be suspicious about is coincidences wherever i see a coincidence there tends to be a connection and i find it one hell of a huge coincidence that jespersen was down here looking for a female killer and we just happen to have one running around st pauli but were talking about two completely different types of killer are we said fabel karin vestergaard said that before she and jespersen busted goran vuja i c six years ago he talked about this contract killer called the valkyrie he said she had been very effective at taking out her targets she made some look like accidents others like suicides or natural causes what if jake westland and armin lensch werent victims of the angel of st pauli or the angel part two what they were victims of a contract killer then why all the symbolism why did she tell westland she was the angel think about it thats exactly what she did she told him to tell us she injured him to exactly the right degree for him to deliver his message before he died it doesnt sound like an amateur does it so you think weve got someone hiding in plain sight i think its a possibility the angel is maybe really the valkyrie she wants us to believe she is killing at random susanne was lost in thought for a moment there is something else thats been bothering me she said eventually and it confuses things even more as you know one other thing that differentiates male and female serial killers is the duration of their activities male serials on average are active for less than five years sometimes for only a matter of months female serial killers are active over a much longer period ten fifteen years longer maybe it doesnt fit with the first spate of killings youre saying those killings are suspect too yes but im not suggesting its the same killer yet another massive difference between male and female serial killers is the motive of the four kinds we discussed the profit motive is by far the most common so if youre right and these recent killings are the work of a professional contract killer whether shes a serial killer or not is simply a matter of semantics turning the showertap selector to cold she let the chill water run over skin that protested by bristling into goose bumps sylvie achtenhagen stood in the shower arms braced against the wall palms flat against the wet porcelain tiles her body was firm and youthful and she knew it would remain so for some time to come but at thirtynine she was also aware that time was slowly and insidiously turning up the pressure on her where would she be in ten years time by then she would be competing with younger women she would always be looking over her shoulder watching for someone taking away everything that she had worked so hard to build someone like her someone who would make the news to find it when she could no longer bear the cold and she felt fully alert sylvie switched off the shower wrapped the hotel bathrobe around her went through to her hotel bedroom and twisted the top off a gin from the minibar she was staying in one of the older berlin hotels it had a worn and weary grandness and the rooms had the old double doors the inner door opening into the room the outer opening into the hall the windows too were the old robust type it all gave the hotel a feeling of belonging to an earlier age and of being more than a little institutional after adding tonic to the gin sylvie flopped down onto the vast bed and started to go through the information she had got from wengert the starstruck clerk at the bstu commission for stasi files once she had eliminated the people who had died in the intervening period she was left with a list of a dozen names all connected in some way to drescher but as wengert had said the connections could be coincidental drescher or someone else with an interest had made sure the main files were not to be found yet sylvie knew that somewhere among these dozen names was the lead she was looking for and just maybe one of them was siegfried the exstasi scum who had sent her the photographs and dreschers name she took out her notebook and transferred the four most likely names to it she had addresses for two a partial address for another and just a town for the fourth she would see how easy it would be to track them down the easier they were to find the less likely it would be that they were siegfried she had just taken out her baedeker to check some of the addresses when her cellphone rang hi its ivonne ive got more information on norivon the company the latest st pauli victim worked for anything interesting not really it couldnt be more boring in fact norivon is an environmental wastemanagement company they help companies comply with federal and eu regulations regarding waste they make it go away basically but i got some new info through the contact i have in neuhansa she said that armin lensch the guy who got wasted was a gradeone arsehole and universally despised ambitious bastard apparently and didnt mind treading on toes to get ahead he was responsible for dealing with companies within the neuhansa group and had a reputation as an asskisser when it came to management anything else oh yes this is the good bit his little excursion into the reeperbahn was a regular occurrence he would go in with a bunch of others from work none of whom could stand him by the way and get completely pissed and even more obnoxious than usual anyway the night he was killed he had a runin with the law two plainclothes cops were arresting a woman in silbersacktwiete and lensch started to get lippy so one of the cops kneed him in the balls a woman cop who were they arresting that i dont know but they were murder commission what did the female cop look like shortish pretty dark hair that i dont know either anna wolff said sylvie more to herself than to ivonne sorry it doesnt matter good work ivonne ive got some names and partial addresses for you can you see if you can locate them and get as much info as possible sure said ivonne sylvie ran through the information wengert had given her were looking for a male stasi officer probably administrative staff stationed at the lichtenberg headquarters okay said ivonne there was something else i meant to tell you nope its gone phone back if you remember sylvie hung up and was tidying the file on the bed when her cellphone rang again that was quick said sylvie you remembered what it was i hope youre settled into your hotel sylvie as soon as she heard the breathless voice she knew it was siegfried what makes you think im in a hotel she asked now youre just being stupid and youre not a stupid woman still on the trail of the big story i suppose you think that you have my name now that you can track me down and get what you want without paying oh yes i know all about your chat with herr wengert you stasi scum really still have your tentacles everywhere dont you there is no stasi any more sylvie and i resent being called scum we did what we did because we believed in it we believed in equality and freedom from poverty and exploitation and because of that were now compared with the nazis so yes some of us work together for selfprotection he had a sudden fit of coughing anyway im not interested in justifying myself to you especially to you have you got my money do you think i can just conjure up quarter of a million euros based on three photographs and the name of somebody who doesnt exist who doesnt seem to exist drescher and these girls were involved in an operation so secret and so ambitious that every effort was made to keep it hidden even from some of the command structure inside the mfs anyway i thought id give you a little more on account simply to prove that i really do have the information i say i have take a look under your pillow sylvie reached under the pillows sliding her arm along until her hand found something it was a large brown envelope how did you now sylvie the husky voice interrupted her dont be so naive we were trained to get in and out of private spaces without detection ill be in touch the line went dead sylvie checked her phone to try to retrieve the number but it had been withheld she opened the envelope inside was a magazine and four sheets of copy paper examining the magazine first sylvie saw it was called muliebritas and from what she could see was some kind of feminist title she flicked through it quickly to see if there was anything stuffed into it or if siegfried had made any markings on the pages nothing she would have to take time later to study it carefully in the meantime the only thing that was of interest to her was that muliebritas was published by bronsted publishing part of the neuhansa group she turned her attention to the four sheets of paper three of them each had one of the images that siegfried had sent her in the email except this time there was a name beneath each face margarethe paulus liane kayser anke wollner the fourth sheet again had the name georg drescher but this time it too was accompanied by an image a man of about forty to fortyfive he had a strong handsome face with deep furrows in his cheeks and creases at his eyes as if his had been a face accustomed to smiling his amiable countenance was at odds with the uniform lapel flashes that indicated he was an officer of the mfs unlike the other photographs his picture was in black and white and it was difficult to tell whether his hair was blond or greying given that twenty years had elapsed since anyone had worn a stasi uniform sylvie tried to age him in her mind she looked at the pictures of the young women again they were all pretty but gazed blankly and emotionlessly at the camera sylvie was again drawn to the girl with the so terribly empty eyes liane kayser her name was liane kayser ute cranz dragged drescher further into the kitchen he saw her hover over him a scalpel in her hand he felt sick and suddenly thought what a relief it would be to throw up he guessed the muscle relaxant had eliminated his gag reflex and he would die choking on his own vomit without coughing without a struggle at least it would be better than whatever ute cranz had planned for him she pulled at his clothes and he saw the scalpel slice downwards but he didnt feel its contact she was cutting through his clothes tugging the remnants clear of his body he was naked now and felt cold probably more from fear than from the temperature of her apartment she lifted up the plastic sheeting and slid something behind his head and shoulders so that he was in a semisitting position she sat a bed table across his leaden legs and placed a large laptop computer on it the screen facing him and almost completely filling his field of vision she hit a key and the screen filled with a photograph lurid colours blood everywhere a womans body lay naked the head and face hidden from view jammed between a goresodden bed and a bloodstreaked wall this is what men do to women look at this do you see ute pressed the key again another scene this time a dead woman lay semiclothed in some bushes a ligature around her neck do you see another sceneofcrime photograph do you see she clicked on a command and the screen automatically switched from one scene to the next sickening images of murder rape violent pornographic images of women being abused female faces twisted in fear this is what men do to women what men have always done to women men like you ute let the images run for a few more seconds then she closed the lid and lifted the computer and tray away then she squatted beside drescher and whispered into his ear women are forced to live in fear all over the world every day real fear real fear like the fear youre feeling right now i know you are afraid drescher i know youre very afraid but still youre asking yourself why why is she doing this she held a photograph up for him to see do you know who that is its my sister margarethe shes dead she killed herself when you had finished with her she went mad and they locked her up then she killed herself the staff at the hospital she was in thought they had taken every precaution to prevent her committing suicide but when youve been trained to kill others to kill in so many ways then its easy for you to kill yourself you dont need much in the way of means or opportunity drescher stared at the photograph and listened because there was nothing else he could do except stare and listen the face in the photograph he knew it he remembered it and what terrified him was that ute cranz didnt seem to realise whose face without the makeup without the change of hair colour it really was and all the time his heart pounded within the cage of his locked body ive hunted you for fourteen years fourteen years of preparing for this moment i promised my sister promised margarethe that i would make it right well i will and i will take my time enjoy every moment do you remember when you taught your girls about blood supply how you could use it to quicken or delay death remember how you told them about execution by saw in the middle ages the victim was hung upside down and sawn in half from the groin to the neck because they were hanging upside down the brain stayed supplied with blood and the victim was conscious through the whole thing she stood up and kicked away whatever had been supporting his head and neck his head thudded against the floor and pain stabbed through it she stood astride his body now and looked down at him you drove my sister insane you drove her to her death i am going to drive you mad you are going to die but before you die you will be in so much pain that you will lose your mind he looked up at her and thought how beautiful she was how terribly beautiful chapter five it had been a long time since fabel had had a dream like it he had been plagued by nightmares throughout his life as a murder detective the dead would visit him in the night the victims whose murders he had not been able to solve would glare accusingly at him holding their wounds out for him to see the dreams had been one of the reasons he had seriously a year and a half before considered leaving the police for good then after hed made his decision to stay on in the murder commission the dreams had stopped but this dream was different from the others he stood at the centre of a vast yard enclosed by barbedwire fences and with a row of low wooden huts at one distant end he didnt need a sign or a motto above the gates to know where he was he was german the symbolism was burned deep into his consciousness there was no one else in the yard there were no sounds from the huts some dust was stirred from the brushed earth by a soundless wind he turned slowly a full degrees she was there standing in front of him you are looking for me asked irma grese she was young only nineteen or twenty short and stocky dressed in a shapeless grey dress she wore the jackboots he had read she habitually wore when tormenting prisoners she had hard broad almost masculine features and a thinlipped mouth turned down at the corners her blonde hair was brushed back from a face that seemed to be half forehead no said fabel distracted by the rope burn on her throat and neck im not looking for you im looking for someone like you if she is like me said grese then someone made her like me do you understand that the broad brow furrowed it was clearly important to her that he understood someone made her like me i understand he said grese looked fabel up and down are you frightened of me no im not frightened of you i despise you he said i hate everything about you and everything you did i loathe you most of all because you make me glad they hanged you no you are frightened of me deep down all men are frightened of women you fear me because you fear all women you are afraid that something like me burns deep inside every woman thats not true said fabel your gender has nothing to do with it you and all the others like you were freaks ordinary dull nobodies but freaks you were waiting for someone to open your cages and let your freakishness escape we come out of our cages for you jan dont we for a moment fabel thought he was looking at christa eisel then viola dahlke the housewife they had arrested in st pauli but she became irma grese again weve been your life for twenty years suddenly without moving without taking a step grese was nearer her face close to his looking up at him she screamed shrill and inhuman her eyes wild and her dark eyebrows arching on the too big forehead under the blonde hair she was at the one time terrifying and comical her right arm shot up above them and fabel saw the cellophane whip flash in the pale sunlight he woke up fabel turned to make sure susanne was still asleep he didnt want her to know he had had another bad dream it had been so long since the last susanne was his lover and as such she had begged him to leave the police to make the dreams stop but she was also a psychologist and her concern had always been professionally informed it wasnt the dreams themselves that worried her she had explained it was the hidden turmoil that had caused them renate had never worried about the dreams renate had never really worried about him he got up went through to the kitchen and made himself a cup of tea it still took him a while to find things in the new apartment in his head especially in the small hours of the morning he was still living in his poseldorf flat the phone rang looking at his watch fabel saw it was fiveforty in the morning this had better be good he said into the phone it is it was glasmacher one of the murder commission team im just around the corner from you in altona weve got her chef weve got the angel the apartment block had been sealed off and barriers set up in the street fifty metres on either side of the entrance but the media throng had yet to materialise there hadnt been time for word to get out it only took fabel ten minutes to get to the scene from his own flat and he parked at the barrier showing his id to the uniformed officers guarding the location a tall palecomplexioned blond man of about thirty wearing a brown leather jacket and a muffler at his throat stood waiting for fabel at the entrance to the apartment block he sniffed as fabel approached and fabel noticed his nose was tinted redpink you should be in bed thomas fabel said i wish i had called in sick if i hadnt been on call i wouldnt have seen this glasmacher indicated the apartment building with a nod of his head bad oh yeah one of the worst ive seen the victims been tortured for hours by the way ive called in a few extra bodies dirk hechtners on his way over too you said weve got the angel the mo has similarities to both the recent killings and the older ones whatever this womans mission was its clearly over when she was finished she dialled and said shed killed this guy and she wanted to come in whos the vic glasmacher pulled his notebook out of the pocket of his leather jacket and with it a bundle of used paper tissues sorry chef robert gerdes sixtythree a retired teacher from flensburg in schleswigholstein hes been living in hamburg for fifteen years his apartment is the penthouse and he was murdered in the flat below rented by the woman who claims to have done it fabel looked up at the apartment building the penthouse you say his schoolteachers pension went a long way whats the womans name ute cranz shes just moved in apparently ive got a uniformed unit to take her into the presidium there was the sound of approaching sirens and two unmarked cars pulled up at the barrier behind fabels bmw fabel made a frantic gesture with his hand across his throat and the sirens were killed anna wolff and werner meyer emerged from one car while dirk hechtner and henk hermann got out of the other for gods sake said fabel as they approached weve got no press here yet lets keep this as lowkey as blocking a street off in the middle of the night can be sorry chef said anna to be honest it was one of the main attractions of the job for me if i dont get to toot my siren id just as well be a taxi driver no one would take your cab with all that farting muttered werner listen dick und doof said fabel unsmiling when youve quite finished the comedy act id like to go in and view the locus sorry chef said anna as unrepentantly as she could manage theres something else you should know said glasmacher the perpetrator was making wild claims about the victim shes clearly as mad as a hatter she said he was living under a false name and an invented backstory and that he was really one of the stasis top people she claims he ruined her sisters life stasi fabel felt as if someone had passed a faint electric current through his spine she said he was exstasi did she say what his real name was again glasmacher checked his notebook yeah she said he was an hva major called georg drescher someone turned up the current in fabels spine anna werner you come with me he said determinedly thomas you get back to the presidium and write up your report then get off home and rest up im going to need you fit over the next few days dirk henk i want you to phone politidirektor karin vestergaard and tell her youre on your way to her hotel to pick her up and bring her into the presidium no wait bring her here as fabel moved towards the door glasmacher placed his gloved hand on fabels arm to check him brace yourself chef i mean it about this one when you see what shes done to this guy holger brauner asked fabel and his team to wait a few minutes before entering the scene he also insisted that instead of just the usual overshoes and latex gloves they should all don full forensic suits and masks theres a lot of body fluids in there he explained weve got a lot of processing to do i know you are all experienced murder detectives and so on but i have to request that if you think youre going to throw up you get out of the flat as soon as possible that bad asked fabel its that bad jan said brauner fabel couldnt help noticing how stylish and spacious the apartment was the lounge and dining room were openplan with a large sliding window that opened out onto a small terrace the furniture was expensivelooking and fabel guessed this had been a furnished let one of brauners bunnysuited team was taking photographs of the dining table it had been set for two and there were still used plates and wine glasses on it a numbered tent card sat on the floor beside the sofa next to where a brandy glass had shattered spilling its contents on the polished beechwood fabel took glasmachers advice and braced himself emotionally as he and the others entered the kitchen he found that he could not tear his eyes away from it it was as if his brain was trying to make sense of what it was he was looking at or more as if his brain was trying to deny what he was looking at had been human it lay on heavyduty blue plastic sheeting over the kitchen worktop the head had been propped up and the round white orbs of the lidless eyes stared at fabel the sheeting extended across the floor and sheets of it had been ducttaped to the wall there were splashes of blood everywhere but around the body and on the floor immediately next to the worktop the blood was mopsmeared she had cleaned up as she had worked behind him fabel could hear anna breathing heavily through her forensic mask werner muttered something obscene holger brauner eased past the statues of anna and werner and stood next to fabel ive never seen anything like it jan he said she has an amazing knowledge of human anatomy see the tourniquets around the upper thighs she used those to restrict blood flow while she worked on the legs and as you can see from the exposed bone she has cut through muscle tissue while avoiding the femoral artery similarly she used a surgical clamp on his groin to stop him bleeding out from the castration fabel heard annas heavy breathing turn to gasps and she rushed out of the kitchen there is absolutely no doubt whatsoever about premeditation jan said brauner she laid everything out in advance sheeted up the room immobilised the victim somehow she even had a saline solution for his eyes once she had removed his eyelids its obvious it was important to her that he saw her working on him poor bastard how long do you think it would have taken him to die the truth i honestly dont know herr doctor moller will be able to give you an indication after the autopsy but my guess is that he was maybe alive for up to an hour of this abuse how much of that he was conscious for is anyones guess brauner pointed to a metal tray next to the body thats full of broken phials from the smell id say they were capsules of ammonia carbonate she obviously broke them under his nose to rouse him when he passed out from the pain anna came back into the kitchen keeping her head down and not looking up from the floor dirk and henk are back chef theyve got the dane with them okay fabel placed an arm around her shoulder and turned her away from the body he looked into her face above the surgical mask and framed by the elasticated hood of the forensics suit she was very pale her eyes redrimmed are you all right anna as you know not my strong point but hey never mind youll have me issuing parking tickets soon thats enough anna said fabel but without anger he could see she was in a state you head back to the commission and go through what thomas has got before he heads home werner you go with her im going to have a look upstairs at the victims apartment on the way out of the apartment fabel dumped his forensic suit and mask at the door but he retained the gloves and overshoes he had just gone out onto the landing when he saw karin vestergaard coming up the stairwell with dirk hechtner and henk hermann your colleagues told me this might have something to do with jenss death she said without preliminaries fabel saw the grim determination on her face and was reminded that jespersen had been more than a colleague to her truth is i dont know yet karin the killer called it in herself and weve got her down at the presidium she definitely could be our st pauli killer but the thing that is most interesting is the tale shes been spinning weve got a male victim sixtythree years old a retired teacher from flensburg called robert gerdes but and wait for this the woman who tortured and killed him says that he is really a former highranking stasi officer and that his name is georg drescher for a moment vestergaard looked stunned can i see this victim trust me its best not to she really did a number on him and anyway youd have to get all suited up i sent for you because im going to have a look through the victims apartment he lived upstairs i thought you might like to help maybe youll pick up on something relevant to jespersen fabel turned to hechtner and hermann i want you two to go through the killers apartment everything except the murder scene in the kitchen bag everything he turned back to vestergaard after were through upstairs id like you to listen in on my questioning of the suspect lead on said vestergaard grimly the penthouse had been finished to the same quality and in the same style as the apartment below it was slightly larger and better use had been made of the space available but the main difference was the furnishings like its downstairs neighbour the flat was ultramodern and bright but much of the furniture was traditional some looked like genuine antiques fabel thought of the man who had occupied this space and somehow couldnt connect it with the mass of bloody tissue lying on the kitchen counter downstairs hes got some nice furniture said vestergaard in an unusually conversational tone walnut most of it some maple ive seen this kind of stuff before its hungarian art deco a lot of it made in the nineteenthirties some of the other pieces are french fabel looked at her questioningly hobby she said and he nodded they walked slowly through the apartment there was a lounge a study a bedroom and an openplan kitchen and dining room they stopped for a moment in the study no sign of a struggle said fabel it doesnt look like he even had company recently the whole party must have taken place downstairs but ill have holgers forensics boys give the place a thorough goingover vestergaard picked up a sketch pad that had been lying on the desk fabel noticed that it was the same brand and size as the ones he used for laying out his thoughts during an investigation vestergaard flipped through it and gave a couple of small laughs in response to fabels questioning look she turned the open pad towards him whatever else he did said vestergaard he had a talent for caricatures thats meant to be your illustrious chancellor angela merkel isnt it yes youre right he wasnt half bad fabel grinned i know frau merkel is keen to promote good international relationships but i really dont think she would do that with monsieur sarkozy and i dont think hes really quite that small i have to say he had expensive tastes vestergaard put the drawing pad back down and examined a deco bronze on the desk a stylised eagle perched on a walnut base for a retired school teacher from flensburg exactly what i was thinking said fabel i think we should start here in the study you take the desk ill go through the filing cabinets and the bookshelves threequarters of an hour later they had examined every piece of correspondence every bill the victims notebook and his desk diary either he had a very limited social life or a very secret one said vestergaard even with official and household correspondence theres nothing here other than the barest minimum of paperwork no personal computer this is either a life only half lived or a cover and from the look of the furniture and the quality of the selection in his wine rack he was not a man of an ascetic disposition fabel wandered through to the lounge and looked around so major drescher this is where you hid yourself he turned back to vestergaard i got on to the federal commissioners office in berlin to dig up his files nothing only the odd mention here and there he did a good job of hiding himself and i thought wed never find him now hes dropped right into our laps hes still hiding from us jan said vestergaard looking around the study before heading back to the presidium fabel asked holger brauner if his team could seal off the penthouse apartment and give it a good goingover once they were finished with the primary locus as he and karin vestergaard headed out of the apartment building and towards his bmw fabel noticed that the street had a completely different look to it in the daylight even the winter daylight he took a few deep breaths of the cold air over the years fabel had found that after visiting a murder scene there was one aspect one image that haunted you for weeks afterwards this time every time he closed his eyes it was the lidless stare of dreschers corpse you okay asked vestergaard yeah im fine fabel sighed just another day in the meat factory when they arrived at the presidium fabel fetched coffee for them both and they sat in his office drinking it we should take a break before questioning cranz said fabel its going to be a long haul there was a knock on the door and werner came in something about his face told fabel that relaxation time was over this is all seriously messed up jan he said not bothering to switch to english for vestergaards sake what is the woman weve got in custody rented the apartment under the name of ute cranz but she claims her real name is ute paulus and that she is the sister of margarethe paulus hold on said fabel the weariness swept from his expression the woman who escaped from the secure hospital in mecklenburg the very same so ute paulus has taken up her sisters trade of knackering male victims it would certainly explain why margarethe has been able to stay out of sight if she has had outside help ah well thats where it all gets very complicated werner gave a wry smile and rubbed the stubble on his scalp ive been in touch with the state hospital in mecklenburg and i spoke to the chief psychiatrist there whos responsible for margarethe pauluss case its a dr kopke according to kopke there is no ute paulus no sister just margarethe werner placed a printout of a file photograph on fabels desk that is margarethe paulus taken a year before her escape ive had a look at the woman in custody the hair colour is different but apart from that if shes a sister she would have to be a twin shit fabel turned to vestergaard and explained everything that werner had just said what else did kopke say he asked turning back to werner two things first he needs to talk to you urgently he needs to know the identity of the victim and how he died dr kopke says that he might have information that will be indispensable to us he would also like to talk to any criminal psychiatrist or psychologist who sits in on or monitors the interview which he strongly recommends we do and the second that we use maximum security when dealing with margarethe paulus he said that she is probably the most dangerous individual that he has ever dealt with on the way down to the interview room karin vestergaard took a call on her cellphone after a brief exchange in danish she paused to make a few notes in her notebook fabel waited for her that was my office in copenhagen she said as they continued along the corridor the ncid in norway have been doing some more digging into jorgen halvorsens affairs they have found a contact he had here in hamburg we can talk about it after youve interviewed this woman do you think shes the one who killed jens i dont know there seems to be a hell of a lot of coincidences going on and she fits perfectly as someone we should be looking at for all these killings if it werent for the simple fact that we know absolutely for certain that she was locked up in an asylum theres no way she can be either our angel or our valkyrie but she was out when jens was killed said vestergaard true shes well worth a look for it ill establish her whereabouts at the time if i can fabel stopped their progress along the corridor by turning to her listen karin this will just be our initial interview to establish basics it wont take long id like us to talk the whole thing through afterwards theres another couple of deaths that have cropped up that are not strictly speaking being treated as murder i just think theres so much going on that theres a chance well miss something the woman who waited for them in the interview room looked nothing like a killer professional or serial the forensics department had taken all her clothes for examination and she was now dressed in a shapeless disposable white overall she was of slim build and was fabel couldnt help noticing very attractive she looked up at him with empty disinterest as he entered as if she had no stake in what was happening and his presence had nothing to do with her fabel recognised her from the photograph sent from the mecklenburg hospital he went into the interview without vestergaard leaving her to join werner and anna in the adjoining room from where they could watch the interview on the monitor fabel nodded to the uniformed officer who had been watching over the prisoner sat down opposite paulus laid his papers out on the metal desk and informed her of her rights i want you to understand something margarethe he said i will be interviewing you again later with another officer and we will have a psychologist in the room as well as a lawyer to represent your interests we can talk about things in more detail then in the meantime i want you to simply confirm your name for me i am ute paulus you called me margarethe i am not margarethe paulus she is my sister but thats simply not true margarethe there is no ute paulus you have no sister its a matter of record she laughed coldly records are falsified all the time in the east peoples records were changed or falsified all of the time i am not margarethe i am ute who is this fabel asked and slid a copy of the hospital photograph across the table to her that is margarethe that is you listen theres no point in denying it we have samples of your fingerprints and they match those of this patient he jabbed a forefinger at the picture on the table margarethe paulus thirtyeight years old born in zarrentin northwest mecklenburg you have no sister no brother and both your parents are dead this is you and you were committed to the mecklenburg state secure hospital in may nineteen ninetyfour paulus said nothing fabel drew a long breath why did you do what you did to robert gerdes his name wasnt gerdes there was no anger in her voice there was nothing in her voice or in her eyes as she spoke his name was georg drescher and he was a major in the stasi why did you do what you did to him i thought you said we would only talk about this later she said she placed her hands on the metal surface her fingers were long and slim he noticed how clean her fingernails were and then remembered that brauners forensics team would have scraped beneath them for trace evidence fabel found it difficult to imagine those fingers committing the horrors he had witnessed in her flat i want to go back she said go back where to the apartment to the hospital how can you go back to the hospital if youre not a patient there asked fabel he pointed again to the photograph this is the patient margarethe is the patient you say youre not margarethe thats where i see my sister where i talk to her i visit her now i can visit her all the time fabel sighed and gathered up the papers i think we really should wait until later i want to go back now she repeated but there was no insistence in her voice to the hospital im afraid you wont be going back for some time youre going to have to stay with us for a while fabel stood up i want to go back to the hospital margarethe stood up too fabel held his hand out to stop her you have to remain sitting margarethe stay here the officer will take you back to your cell margarethes hand seized fabels wrist and he was amazed at the strength in the slender fingers he moved his other hand to free himself but was stunned by the blow she delivered to his forehead with the heel of her free hand he heard the uniformed officer rush forward margarethe grabbed fabel by the hair and rammed his face into the metal table as she used him for leverage and swung a high kick at the other policemans head fabel heard the uniformed cop slam into the interviewroom wall and gasp for breath he felt her fingers probe under his arm to find his service sigsauer automatic but the antisnatch holster resisted her tugging he thrust his weight against her and she fell onto the floor despite the adrenalin surging through his system he noticed how gracefully she fell rolled and sprang back to her feet the other cop was pulling himself to his feet and he launched himself from the wall at her it was a clumsy move and she dodged him easily slashing him across the throat with the flat of her hand fabel made to draw his weapon and she leaped across the table at him hitting him at chest height with her knee his head slammed painfully against the wall and he heard his automatic clatter on the floor the door next to him suddenly burst open and werner anna and two uniformed officers rushed into the room get my gun yelled fabel he pulled himself to his feet in time to see margarethe slam a fist into werners face anna wolff got behind her and wrapped an arm around her throat in a tight grip margarethe slammed her elbow into annas ribs but anna didnt let go instead she let herself drop her weight pulling margarethe to the floor werner and the other officers threw themselves onto her and after a few seconds of desperate struggling margarethe was handcuffed yours i believe fabel looked up to see karin vestergaard staring down on him his service automatic in her extended hand thanks said fabel and allowed her to help him up that went well i thought he felt something trickle down his forehead and when he gingerly reached up to touch it his fingertips were wet with blood werner anna and the others hoisted margarethe to her feet she looked directly at fabel and the look chilled him there was no rage no hatred just the same emptiness in the eyes that he had noticed when hed first entered the interview room it was as if the intense violence that had just exploded there had simply never happened get her back to her cell said fabel and keep her restrained the uniforms ushered margarethe who didnt even seem to be breathing hard from the room anna and werner stayed behind there was a trickle of blood from werners nostril you should get that looked at said vestergaard nodding towards fabels head i think i should said fabel taking the folded handkerchief that vestergaard handed him and holding it to his head you did well anna she took some taking down a womans touch i thought it looked like you and grandad here needed help anna grinned knowingly at werner what with you having your asses kicked by a girl hows the uniform asked fabel hell be fine said werner dabbing the bleeding nostril with the back of his hand hes going to have one hell of a sore throat thats for sure get him to the hospital said fabel any blow to the airway can be very dangerous and she knew what she was doing he leaned against the interviewroom wall and drew a deep breath shit she knew what she was doing i gather thats what dr kopke the chief doctor from the mecklenburg state hospital wanted to tell you he was on the phone again when you were in there with psychogirl ill phone him said fabel but first could someone get me some codeine and a plaster for my head where have you got her now the voice on the other end of the connection sounded genuinely anxious safely back in her cell herr doctor said fabel where she can do no harm i wouldnt count on it said kopke he had a deep voice a little scratchy fabel heard a metallic click and a crackle over the connection a cigarette being lit a medical man should know better thought fabel i really did want to warn you before you tried to interview her i didnt get the message fabel started to say but kopke cut him off shes killed again yes a male victim and she castrated him what was his name kopkes tone was more demand than question i cant was the victim called georg drescher or did margarethe claim he was georg drescher i cant confirm or deny the identity of the victim you should know that look herr principal commissar you and i can play games and more people can die or we can be straight with each other and maybe save a few lives what will it be what is it you have to tell me dr kopke first of all you need to make sure that margarethe is confined with maximum security there was the sound of a blownout breath and fabel imagined the cigarette smoke billowing around the unseen psychiatrist you should have her watched by no fewer than two ideally three guards secondly do what you can to make your demands sound like requests she will respond with maximum hostility to any suggestion that you are commanding her to follow your will and trust me herr chief commissar that hostility will be very professionally directed ive already got the picture said fabel involuntarily touching the gauze taped to his forehead ah again there was the sound of a cigarette being drawn upon followed by a hasty exhalation i thought you might i also need you to get a court order over to me as soon as possible so that i can legally transfer the records of margarethe pauluss treatment to you i have tapes and video of my sessions with her and trust me you will want to hear all of them in the meantime said fabel how about a little unofficial summary margarethe paulus was a child of the gdr said kopke her parents from what i could gather were bohemian freethinker types who fell foul of the authorities they ended up in prison and both died of cancer before reunification margarethe was taken into care by the state its what she says happened to her afterwards that should interest you before i go any further i have to tell you a little about her medical history when she was still in the care of the state orphanage she started to have severe headaches she would have been about eight at the time margarethe was admitted to hospital and it was suspected that she was suffering from a brain tumour the operation revealed a growth in her brain which was subsequently declared benign but the nature of the tumour is in some doubt it was a reasonably large teratoma that could have been interpreted as fetus in fetu im sorry fabel sounded more irritated than apologetic youre going to have to explain a teratoma is a tumour that is composed of all kinds of tissue there can be hair teeth eye tissue in it sometimes it can have limbs a hand or a foot for example in rare examples a child is born with what appears to be a twin inside it fetus in fetu medical opinion is divided on whether these are actual foetuses that have formed within their twin instead of alongside it or if they are simply a more complex form of teratoma whatever they are they are incapable of independent life what was removed from margarethes brain had the appearance of a rudimentary foetus somehow maybe later after reading up on the subject she decided that she had had a sister living inside her and she still believes that we learned to handle margarethe and with appropriate medication and management she was able to live amongst the general hospital population ill come back to why the medication and handling were so important although i think youve experienced the reason firsthand anyway margarethe would sit over by the window for hours on end talking to no one except her own reflection her sister fabel sighed thats what we established in therapy yes but this is where i get to the most important bit the tumour that was removed was benign but it was large when you take something like that out of someones brain things change the chemistry changes intracranial pressure alters and parts of the brain that have been constricted are relieved and have room to expand particularly if the patient is a child in margarethes case her personality changed she had been a normal emotional child of average ability after the operation she became distant remote but her academic and sporting ability improved radically and that brings me back to the claims she has made which were you have to remember that here in the east our postwar experience was very different there are things that went on here that you couldnt imagine that we still have problems accepting but what margarethe told us was so incredible so fantastic that we put it down to schizoid paranoia but then as time went on i began to have doubts i mean some patients have the most detailed and elaborate paranoias but this was just too elaborate part of my job is to try to expose the falsehood of a paranoid delusion to find a crack and use logic to lever it open so that the patient themselves with the aid of the right medication can see their fantasy for what it is but there were no cracks in margarethes story none i did a little research too at the federal commission for stasi files i discovered that many of the names she had given me were indeed real former stasi people but she had first given me this information at a time when the files were still being collated and reassembled so if she was telling the truth it still didnt change the fact that she was very seriously disturbed or that she had murdered someone the other thing was that there was this massive rage and hunger for revenge burning deep inside her and most of it was directed at georg drescher you see herr fabel margarethe claims she was one of three young women selected by the stasi and trained by major georg drescher trained as what assassins she claimed that she and her friends were trained to use a whole variety of methods to take human life as well as concealment espionage techniques even how to seduce their victims she said they were given code names they were called the valkyries walking into the murder commission incident room fabel felt like he was an unprepared act walking into the spotlight centre stage there were always times like this during an investigation a development a breakthrough or another murder when suddenly there was an electric tension in the air and the entire team looked on him expectantly the truth was his head hurt he was tired and felt sick and he was struggling to deal with the enormity of what he had just heard from margarethes psychiatrist anna handed him a coffee and a couple of codeine you realise the mistake you made she said in a low voice im sure youre about to tell me fabel flipped the tablets from his palm into his mouth and washed them down with toohot coffee you made a sexist judgement said anna and dont go off on one im not saying youre a sexist but what happened in there happened because you treated her differently because she was a female you saw what she did to that guy in her apartment if she had been a male suspect she would have been handcuffed to the restraint on the table ill bear it in mind in the future fabel said and turned his attention to the rest of the room youve all heard that we have had a breakthrough well i dont know how much of a breakthrough weve had another man is dead tortured and killed as an act of revenge it may well be that margarethe paulus is also responsible for the murders in the st pauli district as well as that of the danish detective jens jespersen fabel took another sip of coffee and sat on the corner of the desk nearest the front we retrieved a single blonde hair from the westland murder scene which we had good reason to believe belonged to the killer i have to tell you before we go any further that we dont have a dna match with the woman we have in custody that doesnt mean it wasnt her said werner it could equally prove that the hair didnt belong to the killer could be said fabel he was distracted by the arrival of dirk hechtner and henk hermann i didnt expect to see you back so quickly said fabel i told you to bag all the suspects stuff we did said hechtner there wasnt much to bag she had three changes of clothes one dressy one businessy one casual weve handed what looks like a surgical kit over to forensics from what we could see she had taken the tools she needed from the kit through to the kitchen what else did you find asked fabel four thousand euros in cash said henk hermann a gun what kind of gun asked fabel nothing that ive seen before said henk hermann it looked a bit like an old ppk but it was clearly not that old and it had made in croatia stamped on the side so we ran it through the computer apparently its henk referred to his notebook a php mv it was developed by the croatians in the early nineties during the independence war apparently amongst gun freaks its a bit of a collectors item a rarity there was also this really weird gloveknife thing really odd it was a leather strap that fastened around your hand and wrist with a hidden metal plate that fitted in your palm and a short curved blade that stuck out of the bottom were guessing it was some kind of weapon rather than a tool where is it now asked fabel we gave it to forensics for testing said dirk hechtner if that blade has been used as a weapon then ill bet a weeks pay well get blood out of the leather bit good said fabel anything else a makeup kit said dirk it had several shades of hair dye different types of makeup not ordinary womens cosmetics it was stuff you could use to alter your appearance other stuff too it took us a while to work out what some of it was for cheek prosthetics to change the shape of her face that kind of thing we also found a folder with paperwork to support her identity as ute cranz wait a minute anna said margarethe paulus was an escaped loony on the run from a mental hospital where shed spent the last fifteen years where the hell did she get all these resources now that said fabel is a very good point its pretty obvious that she had outside help very professional outside help lets go back to what weve found out the victim is a robert gerdes except he probably isnt it looks pretty certain that he was major georg drescher a former major in the hva wing of the east german stasi what we know so far is that drescher was the control for three highly trained female agents specifically trained as assassins it kind of looks like drescher embraced the freemarket economy with relish and set up his own little murder incorporated right here in the free and hanseatic city it is perfectly safe to assume that margarethe paulus while she may be a former protegee of drescher was not one of his active hit women mainly because as anna pointed out she was locked up in a mecklenburg secure hospital he took a deep breath what we have here is the suggestion that there is a female contract killer one of the worlds most successful operating out of hamburg and shes called supposedly the valkyrie now we have an exstasi officer killed by one of the three women he was supposed to have trained and these female political assassins also went by the name valkyrie maybe drescher was the outside help for arguments sake lets accept he has one or both of the other valkyries operating under his command but lets say business is too good and hes turning work away maybe he wanted to expand the business and add another of his former protegees to his staff isnt that unlikely asked werner think about it what youre talking about is a highly skilled and disciplined operation you wouldnt take on a nutcase maybe he thought she wasnt a nutcase when she was under his command that he could control her that he provided a context for her to function in oh yeah snorted anna thatll be it every woman needs a man to complete her after all then before fabel could respond i think youre way off chef he couldnt have misjudged her that much look what she did to him but look at the resources she had at her disposal within weeks of escaping from the hospital if drescher didnt do it who set her up with everything she needed asked fabel when no one responded he moved on what else have we got i chased up theo wangler said anna and ive got a still from the reeperbahn cctv of the fake taxi said anna im afraid it doesnt help much theyve done everything they could to enhance it but its worth nothing the merc had false plates and you cant see the face of the driver clearly enough for identification you couldnt even really say whether it was a man or a woman at the wheel but weve had more luck with the hanseviertel you were right jens jespersen had lunch there there are no cameras in the basement restaurant itself but we picked up this anna handed fabel a print of an image taken from the cctv jespersen was standing next to the glass elevator in the central atrium near the restaurant next to him was a woman with a mass of chaotic blonde hair her face was partly turned from the camera and detail in the enlarged image was fuzzy but it was clear enough to establish that jespersen and the woman were engaging each other in conversation you get more than this he asked anna nope a few shots of her back thats all they went their separate ways he went out onto neuer wall and she headed out onto poststrasse but that doesnt mean they didnt arrange to meet later weve been able to work out a height for her though from the securitycamera shots roughly one seventythree or four centimetres tall give or take heels get someone down to the restaurant to done it interrupted anna ive got someone to take a photograph of jespersen and a copy of that she nodded towards the cctv image and talk to all of the staff who were on duty at the time so far nothing okay said fabel were going back to dreschers apartment this time were going to take it apart if these valkyries are real and we remove margarethe paulus from the equation that leaves two more out there and one of them or maybe both were working for drescher now they are rudderless it would appear weve had as many as two highly trained professional killers under our noses for years now they are out there on their own and maybe desperate its not an idea im too comfortable with what is it werner fabel had noticed his deputys thoughtful expression what are we putting out to the press about the murder he asked there werent any outside the place when i left whats your point asked fabel if gerdes is this major drescher then he was a spy by training and by inclination so so im betting that if he was running a contractkiller business then he would have run his assassins as a spy cell strictly needtoknow basis they will have had a close bond but ill bet that they never came anywhere near his apartment i get it said anna suddenly animated so a murder in that apartment block or street wont really mean anything to the valkyrie unless the name gerdes or drescher is associated with it exactly said werner ill bet she doesnt even know the name gerdes he turned to fabel what if we lose the story or disguise it as something else for a while that means the valkyrie wont know hes dead then if we can work out the mechanism for contacting her or them if there are two we can nail them fabel rubbed his chin thoughtfully and was reminded by the stubble rasping under his fingertips that he hadnt had a chance to shave before rushing out to the drescher murder scene and that was how he saw it now the drescher murder scene its an idea he said sylvie achtenhagen wasnt outside the flat so that would suggest that no one is making the connection yet ill talk to the press department see if they can fudge for a while okay werner lets run with the idea the first thing we have to do is find out how drescher contacted the valkyrie lets take his place apart ive never seen you on the telly said the old woman as she set the tray with coffee and baked biscuits on the table its a satellite station sylvie smiled as she took the cup handed to her the coffee had a caramelly aftertaste rondo melange i see you dont have satellite our station covers most of the north you really should have satellite dont you watch a lot of tv oh yes i have the tv on all day company you see and i would love to have satellite but i cant afford it the old woman sat down who is it you said you were looking for sylvie estimated that the woman wasnt really that old maybe seventy but like many women of that age she had given up she was slightly overweight and saggy and her pale skin looked rough with a reddened eczematous disc to the right of her chin you worked for the mfs back then in the old days frau schneeg sylvie asked oh yes frau schneeg raised her hands and emptied her expression of anything that could be interpreted as guile but i wasnt anything to do with all that kind of thing you know the snooping and stuff i was just a filing clerk i understand that frau schneeg sylvie smiled naturally but you were involved in the personnel records department yes pensions staff allowances exactly i was wondering if you could tell me if you knew any of these people sylvie laid the sheet out on the table next to the embroidered doilies and the coffee and biscuits i really dont want to get involved you know what i mean people here dont know i worked in the ministry i moved here to halberstadt after the wall came down i have a niece here i understand frau schneeg sylvie replaced her smile with a concerned frown but i promise no one will know i just want to find some of these people and no one need ever know where i got the information thats if you can help me at all im looking for people who worked with either colonel adebach or major drescher i dont know my station would be most grateful if you could help said sylvie im sure we could fix you up with a satellite box and dish and a few subscriptions for a moment frau schneeg looked at sylvie intently then said let me have a look at your list they sat in the living room of dreschers apartment each of them wearing the same empty expression of dull frustration weve been here before karin vestergaard said to fabel there must be something here fabel sighed were not looking in the right places said werner were not devious enough thats what comes of growing up in a democracy fabel snapped his fingers werner youre brilliant you are absolutely right we dont know where to look or how to look taking out his wallet he retrieved the business card martina schilmann had given him he flipped it over to where she had handwritten her mobile number and keyed it into his cellphone martina its jan fabel hi jan what can i do for you lorenz your saxon chum you said he was exvolkspolizei yes what of it did he serve after the wall came down in one of the new forces no martina sounded suspicious what is this all about why didnt he continue his police career jan she said with a sigh i can see where youre going with this let me save time the answer is yes he was linked with the stasi thats why he couldnt get into one of the new forces why do you want to know i have an apartment here thats refusing to give up its secrets the occupier was exstasi i need to know where to look there was a silence at the other end of the connection give me the address martina said at last ill bring him over myself it took martina schilmann half an hour to arrive fabel had cleared the uniforms from the street to attract as little attention as possible in the digital age of cellphones that could take photographs and video it never took long before someone was on to the television or newspapers the city was no longer asleep and a heavy police presence in the street would be fully exposed to view fabel had instructed the uniformed cops downstairs to conduct schilmann and lorenz duhring directly up to the penthouse apartment fabel guessed that martina had been taking a day off she was dressed in jeans a heavy sweater and a thighlength leather coat her blonde hair had been tied back in a ponytail and her face was naked of makeup it made her look younger more natural and fabel couldnt help remembering why he had been attracted to martina in the first place it was as if she had read his thoughts and she smiled shyly lorenz lumbered into the background tall thickset and dark this is politidirektor karin vestergaard of the danish national police explained fabel in english we are cooperating on this case the two women shook hands a little coldly thought fabel the dynamics of female relationships remained a mystery to him im afraid lorenz doesnt speak english said martina poor chump got stuck with russian at school fabel turned to vestergaard lorenz was a policeman in the former gdr in the volkspolizei he wasnt allowed to become a member of the new postchange police forces because only members of the volkspolizei who were free of any connection to the stasi were allowed to continue as policemen hes exstasi he was one of their little helpers lets say said martina and he received training from them which is what jan was counting on by the way jan for your information i didnt know what lorenz had been involved in i guessed hed been a stasi unofficial but lets face it its a skills set thats very useful in my line of work i asked him on the way over here if he had taken part in house searches and he told me he had frau schilmann told me that an exstasi officer lived here lorenz piped up in german thats right said fabel a major in the hva hva lorenz rubbed his heavy chin with forefinger and thumb those boys knew what they were doing when it came to hiding stuff youre sure he has something here i think its more likely that he would keep anything sensitive in a different location could be said fabel but my moneys on him operating from here he would feel reasonably safe here i suppose said lorenz i mean its not like in the gdr he probably thought this flat would never be searched he cast his eye across the books on shelves it makes things quicker if i dont tidy up behind me is that a problem do what you have to do said fabel it took lorenz less than half an hour like i thought he said in his saxon baritone when he came back through to the living room he felt secure here you were right about him using this as an operational base so i reckoned there was no point in shifting heavy furniture bookcases et cetera he would want to conceal his stuff but have reasonably easy access to it you learned that from the stasi asked martina journalists and writers we were taught that they had to keep manuscripts typewriters that kind of thing handy serious dissidents and foreign agents they were a different kettle of fish thats why i thought this guy might be difficult if he was hva but this couldnt have been more straightforward lorenz led them through to the study he lifted up the decostyle bronze bird and gave the wooden base a twist a compartment was exposed in which sat a small steel tool almost like a nail twisted into a flattened hook lorenz took the hook and leant down beneath the desk what looked to fabel like a small chip in a floorboard was actually a perfect fit for the hook lorenz inserted the hook gave it a halftwist and lifted a square of floorboard the whole operation took less than fifteen seconds its nothing more than having a secret drawer said lorenz it was secure enough but easy and quick to get to i havent touched anything in there fabel snapped on a pair of latex gloves and knelt down to examine the contents theres a black laptop computer in here along with its power supply also a bunch of data sticks nothing else no notebooks or files just this he eased out a copy of a magazine that had been folded lengthwise dont tell me he hid porn in there snorted werner werner go down to the flat below and ask holger brauner or astrid bremer to come up with a few large evidence bags fabel unfolded the magazine he showed vestergaard and martina schilmann the title now i could be wrong he said but i dont really see drescher as your typical feminist muliebritas vestergaard said aloud its a feminist title explained fabel the title is latin its where the english word muliebrity comes from the female equivalent of virility theres a subtle difference from femininity we would translate it as fraulichkeit in german i suppose you have a danish word for it kvindelighed said vestergaard fabel stared at the magazine i tell you what else this is a prime example of synchronicity the night jake westland was murdered there was a massive feminist protest in herbertstrasse that contributed to the confusion and it was organised by muliebritas werner reappeared with some evidence bags fabel slipped the magazine into one and handed it to vestergaard easing the computer and its power connector out of the recess in the floor he placed them in a tagged evidence bag putting the data sticks in a separate one he turned to vestergaard and martina well get this stuff down to tech division and see if they can get into the computer im guessing its encrypted but the tech guys will be able to get through it god knows how many paedophiles weve nicked because they thought theyd locked up their porn safe and sound a paedophile is one thing said astrid bremer who had appeared behind them a professional spy is another that is what weve got here isnt it i think so astrid said fabel but from a predigital age this was maybe one area he wasnt too hot on how are you getting on downstairs itll take a while days maybe but holger said he could spare me if you need something special up here anything said fabel weve got one killer in custody but theres another one maybe even two on the loose and shes connected to the victim drescher i need anything that can point us in the right direction do you think shes been in this apartment no probably not but if theres a trace of anybody other than the vic having been in here i want to know about it also if you come across anything unusual let me know but can you start with this fabel handed astrid the copy of muliebritas this doesnt belong here it could have been handled by the person were looking for either that or its the mechanism he used to contact her i need it checked before we start going through it with a cryptologist ill get right onto it said astrid and she smiled broadly at fabel the first thing fabel did when he got back to the presidium was to phone criminal director van heiden to approve the overtime for his team and the extra officers he would need to draft in van heiden gave him the authority immediately and without question which surprised fabel a little he had become used to his superior being grudging about any extra expenses on an investigation as if he personally had to finance them but there again this case had started off as three jespersens death the angel killings in st pauli and dreschers torture and murder it was all getting too messy too political and the media were focusing on it complication was something van heiden had difficulty dealing with fabel guessed that his superior was under pressure to clear it all up as quickly as possible are you convinced all of these crimes are connected asked van heiden pretty convinced said fabel he gestured to karin vestergaard who had just come into his office to sit down its safe to assume that this gdr hit squad called the valkyries has been operating for profit from here in hamburg drescher ran it and hes been killed by one of his former trainees he didnt recognise her asked van heiden i get the impression she was a reject probably because of her mentalhealth problems and it was a long time ago she probably just dropped off his radar and out of his memory okay said van heiden keep me informed so i can keep others informed of course fabel hung up and turned his attention to vestergaard again he noticed that she had done something with her makeup that had subtly changed her look and once more fabel was struck by how attractive her face was yet how forgettable maybe it was something that margarethe paulus shared with her maybe the appearance of the valkyries had been a criterion attractive but forgettable maybe that was why drescher had not recognised his killer you said youve been given new information from the norwegian investigators of halvorsens murder fabel asked her the norwegian national police have been in touch with me through my office vestergaard leaned forward and placed a note on fabels desk this man ralf sparwald is someone jorgen halvorsen seems to have had contact with its believed that halvorsen visited hamburg to talk to him who is he fabel examined the name and address written on the note hes a doctor of some kind his name was flagged up when the norwegian police got a warrant to access halvorsens email account they could only get what is still in his inbox uncollected there was an outofoffice reply from this guys email address the norwegians knew i was in hamburg and that there was a possible connection here so they sent this on to me fabel checked his watch most of the day had been spent at the drescher crime scene or in briefings it was now sixthirty pm okay so you think i should speak to sparwald itll have to be tomorrow now no i think we should speak to sparwald if thats okay with you fabel shrugged i dont mind you coming along to observe but please dont forget whose inquiry this is somehow i dont think youll let me forget said vestergaard and smiled the address vestergaard had given fabel for sparwald was to the north of the city in poppenbuttel in the wandsbeck district wandsbeck had once been part of schleswigholstein and had only been incorporated into hamburg at the same time as altona and even now sitting on the shores of the alster river poppenbuttel still felt more like a country village than a suburb as soon as fabel and vestergaard arrived it was clear that the address they had been given was sparwalds place of work rather than residence skk biotech was located in an unobtrusive lowlevel building set in an expanse of welllaidout garden and fringed with winterbare trees five smallish flags flew from poles set next to each other unstyle in the garden the skk biotech logo fluttered in the cold breeze next to the flags of the eu germany and fabel noticed the whiteonred nordic cross of denmark there was another flag beside it they must have known you were coming fabel said to vestergaard with a nod to the danish flag he looked at the flag next to it it was a nonnational pennant a white field with a small flared red cross on it the small dumpy receptionist took a while to come to the desk from an office behind from her reaction skk biotech was not accustomed to visitors particularly ones without an appointment fabel held up his police identity card we need to speak to herr sparwald if hes available herr doctor sparwald corrected the receptionist she looked from fabel to vestergaard and back she had the nervousness and vague expression of groundless guilt of someone unaccustomed to dealing with the police im afraid hes not here hes on leave another two weeks i see fabel considered his options for a moment what is it you do here i work in the admin department deal with correspondence and answer the phones fabel laughed im sorry thats not what i meant i meant what does skk biotech do exactly oh the fleshy cheeks of the small receptionist coloured we work for medical research companies herr doctor luttig could tell you more shall i fetch him if thats not too much trouble said fabel fabel and vestergaard exchanged a smile when the receptionist left she returned with a tall thin and lugubriously sombre man in his late forties he was dressed in a white lab coat but to fabels mind he had the look of a lutheran preacher from some remote frisian island im thomas luttig i believe you are looking for my colleague ralf sparwald is there a problem again fabel held up his id im principal chief commissar jan fabel of the polizei hamburg murder commission this is politidirektor karin vestergaard of the danish national police murder luttigs grave expression became somehow graver whats this got to do fabel held up his hand please dont concern yourself nothing at all directly were just helping out our norwegian colleagues with a few inquiries i believe dr sparwald is on leave yes he wont be back for let me see hes been away a week so he wont be back for another two and a half weeks said luttig thats a long holiday said fabel yes it is i suppose it had to be china you see i suppose if you travel that far youve got to make it worth your while although i really could do with him here dr sparwald is my deputy you see as well as being the most senior analyst fabel began to translate into english for vestergaard what luttig had said i studied at cambridge amongst other places luttig interrupted him its quite in order for me to speak in english if that makes things easier thank you said vestergaard and smiled you couldnt arrange cover for him a trip to china takes a lot of arranging you must have had a fair bit of advance warning thats the thing i didnt ralf sort of sprung this on me out of the blue hes like that he is a very committed environmentalist thats why he works here the group we do work for is heavily involved in environmental cleanup but even with warning it would be practically impossible to find someone to fill in for him or at least anyone with a remotely similar set of skills can you explain what it is you do here basically were an analysis laboratory said luttig were a wholly owned subsidiary of an environmental and biotechnical group we do all of their analytical work toxicology everything from soil samples to human tissue we specialise in evaluating environmental impacts and identifying pollutionrelated health risks i see said fabel do you know what part of china dr sparwald is visiting im sorry i dont is he travelling alone do you know asked vestergaard again im not really sure he said something about a norwegian friend fabel and vestergaard exchanged a look didnt you say you were helping the norwegian police luttig frowned is ralf in some danger no no said fabel not at all its just that he may have information that could be useful to us this norwegian do you know his name no ralf just mentioned he might be travelling with a norwegian friend are you sure ralfs not in danger the chinese authorities dont always take kindly to foreign environmentalists do you have dr sparwalds cellphone number asked vestergaard we could perhaps reach him on that certainly said luttig ill get it for you you said you are a wholly owned subsidiary of a group said fabel would that be the neuhansa group thats right fabel handed luttig one of his polizei hamburg visiting cards if you hear from dr sparwald id be grateful if you could tell him i would like to speak to him as a matter of urgency and if you come across anything that you think would be of interest to us please give me a call of course luttig turned back to vestergaard ill get you ralfs number and home address how did you know that skk biotech was owned by the neuhansa group vestergaard asked fabel as they walked back to the car that he thrust his chin in the direction of the pennant flying beside the other flags the small red cross in german we call that a tatzenkreuz you know the flared cross you see on german military vehicles well the one on that flag is less flared and its red on a white background its a hanseatic cross im guessing its some kind of corporate logo that and the danish flag made me think of gina bronsted the owner of the neuhansa group is it significant not significant coincidental the most recent victim of the st pauli angel also worked for a neuhansa group company but thats not unusual so do a lot of people funny things coincidences said vestergaard i tend not to believe in them as they were about to get back into his car she handed fabel the note luttig had given her with sparwalds home address on it nor do i said fabel when they got back from skk biotech fabel found a thick legal envelope on his desk he had just picked it up when werner came in karin vestergaard diplomatically excused herself and left the two men alone shes becoming your shadow said werner doesnt it get on your nerves as a matter of fact it doesnt i would be every bit as handson if you got yourself killed in copenhagen and i went up to find out what happened what can i say werner grinned im touched he nodded towards the envelope that arrived half an hour ago and i just left it on your desk its the details of westlands investments correspondence that sort of thing westlands widow sent them over like you asked thanks ill look at it later anything else new yes there is as a matter of fact werner swung open the door and called through to dirk hechtner who came in carrying an evidence bag which he placed on fabels desk the bag contained a curved blade attached to a leather device that looked halfway between a wriststrap and a glove things have just got even more interesting said dirk hechtner this is one of the things we found in margarethe pauluss apartment we did get positive traces of blood from the leather unfortunately they were too small and too degraded to get a match however we did manage to get a sample of dried blood from around the base of the blade or at least astrid bremer did but we still werent able to get a match a match with whom asked fabel theres no sign that this was used in dreschers murder no not drescher i did some digging tried to find out what the hell this thing is i got a name for it its called a srbosjek i thought this might be the weapon used to kill goran vuja i c in copenhagen you know the serbian gangster vuja i c fabel frowned what made you make the connection to vuja i c hechtner nodded towards the object in the evidence bag this is a particularly horrible device with only one purpose to murder it was designed for the usta e the fascists who ran croatia during the second world war the usta e believed in an ethnically cleansed croatia free of serbs gypsies jews they set up their own concentration camp jasenovac where they murdered a million or more they were very handson about it all they clubbed stabbed or hacked their victims to death all of which was very labourintensive so they came up with the srbosjek it was used to cut throats with maximum speed and minimum effort thats why i made the connection with vuja i c srbosjek is croat for serb cutter it struck me that maybe someone was being poetic more like theyre trying to tell us something fabel picked up the evidence bag the srbosjek was an ugly viciouslooking thing even if you didnt know its history but this definitely wasnt the weapon used to kill vuja i c his throat wasnt cut the blade used to kill him was more like a thin stiletto or a needle file pushed into the heart from under the sternum but good work dirk you may be on to something fabel met susanne in the presidium canteen for lunch she had spent an hour on the phone with kopke the mecklenburg state hospital chief psychiatrist karin vestergaard had phoned fabel and explained that she needed to catch up on a few things with her office there had been something about her manner on the phone that made him feel that she was not being entirely straightforward with him but he dismissed the thought vestergaard knew that if she withheld anything from fabel he would shut her out of the investigation into jespersens death you look tired said fabel as they picked up their trays and inched along in a queue of blue uniforms susanne had a large thick leatherbound notebook tucked under her arm fabel could see postit notes sprouting like foliage from its edges and he noticed that she had jammed various other folded sheets between its pages ive had a lot to take in she said wearily you say youve spoken with kopke ive had that pleasure said fabel with a wry smile i dont think ive been talked at like that since i was a firstyear student said susanne she broke off to place her order with the canteen assistant hes not the most patient of people is he in fact for a psychiatrist he doesnt seem much of a people person if you mean hes an arsehole said fabel then i would agree with your professional assessment i thought you southerners were direct and outspoken im acclimatising another year or two up here and ill be locking up all that emotion deep inside till it rots away at me just like the rest of you anyway arsehole or not i had to take a hell of a lot of notes while i spoke to him he was well prepared and he thinks we should be too before we talk to margarethe paulus again he has a point said fabel how is the head asked susanne its fine it really wasnt too bad its my pride thats taken the bruising what because you were beaten up by a woman they found a place over by the window and reasonably distant from the majority of occupied tables because i mishandled the whole situation what have you got susanne dropped her notebook with a thud onto the canteen table she looped a stray lock of raven hair behind her ear slipped on her glasses and started to flick through her notes shes a psychopath thats for sure but whatever else has been going on shes not a serial killer kopke insists that she could not be responsible for any of the other killings thats not right she had escaped from the hospital before jake westland and armin lensch were killed and jespersen too she could well have committed those murders the only thing shes in the clear for is the original angel killings no no thats not what kopke means margarethe may well have been available to commit those other murders but kopke is certain that she was focused exclusively on killing drescher she would have no compunction about killing others but she saw herself as being on a mission the only other people she would have murdered would have been anyone who stood in the way of her killing drescher maybe she found out that jespersen was on dreschers trail said fabel between mouthfuls isnt that pretty unlikely anyway let me summarise what kopke told me margarethe paulus is a psychopath but its difficult to decide whether shes a primary or a secondary psychopath primaries tend to be born that way or are genetically predisposed to psychopathy whereas secondaries are made that way by experience environment or as the result of drug abuse et cetera margarethe clearly went through a neurological trauma as part of her childhood brain surgery maybe her psychopathy is iatrogenic the adverse side effect of medical intervention but its hard to tell psychopathy only really begins to manifest itself in adolescence were all egocentric as kids it goes with the territory but whereas we mature and get an idea of ourselves as social beings psychopaths dont the scary thing is that theres a good chance that one in every hundred of the population are psychopaths youre kidding no joke and a lot more are borderline weve all known someone who is totally egomaniacal the husband who dumps his wife of twenty years along with his kids without a second thought or the business boss who sacks loyal workers without a twinge of conscience a lot of people we consider selfcentred arseholes are often psychopathic they have a piece of their makeup missing the majority of psychopaths in society manage to fit in and never become involved in criminal or overtly antisocial behaviour susanne took a sip of her coffee you know we were talking about irma grese the bitch of belsen well maybe thats a perfect example of someone who could have gone through life and had a perfectly normal existence thats the danger jan that when someone like hitler comes along he can tap into that one per cent of the population when you have a core of people who are incapable of feeling guilt or remorse and who possess absolutely no capacity for pity or compassion or empathy for other human beings you can persuade them to do almost anything and margarethe is one of those people not quite theres nothing borderline with margarethe kopke says shes a true sociopath and quite unusually shes suffering from a dissocial personality disorder rather than an antisocial personality disorder whats the difference asked fabel mainly that she can function or seem to function more normally dissocial sociopaths dont get into trouble to the same degree delinquency criminal behaviour that kind of thing as the antisocial type and theyre better at disguising their behaviour she wont have sought out opportunities to act antisocially but she will act without pity to get or do whatever she wants the main thing is she has absolutely zero empathy for other human beings she is simply incapable of simulation imagining that other people have feelings or even the same kind of consciousness as she does ideal for a professional assassin said fabel not really as youve experienced yourself the typical individual with full dissocial personality disorder has an extremely low violence threshold so does an antisocial for that matter if everything she has claimed about the stasi training is true and bear in mind all sociopaths are inventive compulsive liars then her trainers would no doubt have identified her instability and dropped her from the programme another trait of the disorder unfortunately for drescher is the tendency to pin the blame or responsibility for their failures on others combine that with a tendency towards obsession and youve got the ultimate stalker from hell kopke believes that in margarethes case theres comorbidity with another personality or even a schizoaffective disorder or maybe its to do with the neurological damage done in childhood something that makes her even more focused and obsessive her belief that her sister exists and the way she allows the sister to speak and act through her isnt psychopathic its psychotic delusional in margarethe we have something extra going on in the mix sociopathy with a twist fabel looked through the window out across the treetops the sky was heavy and grey do you think the other socalled valkyries will be similar sociopaths i mean susanne shrugged to take human life for money doesnt show a lot of empathy for others but sociopaths are egomaniacal narcissistic and extremely impulsive im guessing that these women who were trained as professional assassins had a high degree of selfdiscipline and were willing to subordinate their will to that of others but that doesnt make them any less dangerous the opposite in fact i dont want you sitting in on the interview susanne said fabel you can watch from the other room through the cctv thats no good jan i need to be able to observe her closely and i want to be able to ask her questions surely you will have her restrained this time okay but if she kicks off again you leave right away ill have extra bodies in there with us susannes perfect porcelain smile had a hint of wickedness about it i dont know jan youre going to have to learn to deal with your fear of women or im going to end up a permanent chaperone fabel susanne and anna wolff were seated in the interview room before margarethe paulus was brought in karin vestergaard werner and others from the murder commission team were in the connecting room watching on closedcircuit tv when margarethe was brought in by two uniformed officers her wrists braceleted in speedcuffs her strong attractive face was as impassive as it had been before sit down margarethe fabel indicated the floorfixed chair one of the officers unfastened her speedcuffs only to use them again to fix her right hand to the metal securing loop on the table a tall woman of about forty took the seat next to margarethe she was lina mueller the stateappointed attorney this is frau doctor eckhardt said fabel gesturing towards susanne from the institute for judicial medicine she is a criminal psychologist and she has spoken to dr kopke who of course you know frau doctor eckhardt will have some questions for you you will have already spoken to frau mueller who is here to represent your interests i dont need a lawyer said margarethe again it was a simple statement of fact made without resentment or anger we feel you should have one present said anna its your right margarethe didnt respond in voice or expression what is your name asked fabel i am margarethe paulus but you told herr fabel earlier that you were ute paulus said anna you are confusing me with my sister said margarethe ute is my sisters name where is your sister right now asked susanne margarethe gazed at the small reinforcedglass window my sister is resting she is waiting for me where is she waiting asked susanne margarethe remained silent inanimate margarethe said fabel changing tack there are a number of killings that have taken place in hamburg since you escaped from the hospital i would like to ask you what you know about them do you understand i have an iq of one hundred and forty said margarethe dr kopke has probably already told you that there is not a question you are capable of asking that i would be incapable of understanding okay margarethe im impressed if its important to you that i am impressed lets start with the most recent murder robert gerdes you know by now that robert gerdes was not his real name it was georg drescher and it wasnt murder it was an execution i told your colleagues when i phoned that i had executed drescher so it was you who tortured and killed him it wasnt your sister asked susanne we both did ute tracked him down and found him she kept her promise she promised me she would make it all right for me and she did but when we killed him we acted together we were one why the torture asked susanne all that terrible pain what did he do to you to have deserved that margarethe sat mute fabel repeated susannes question but it was as if margarethe could not hear him fabel had years of experience of silences in interviews he had learned to read them interpret them sometimes a suspects refusal to speak said more than their answers this was different it wasnt a silence it was a complete shutting down of all responses he knew then with absolute certainty that margarethe would answer only those questions that suited her he just hoped that he would get enough from her to start putting what had happened into some kind of understandable context a week ago fabel broke the silence a young man called armin lensch was murdered in the kiez district of hamburg his belly was sliced open with a blade what can you tell me about that i can tell you nothing about it it had nothing to do with me i didnt kill him margarethes frighteningly blank expression suggested a complete lack of guile of emotion of anything fabel placed the srbosjek still cased in a clear plastic evidence bag on the table he kept a firm hold on the bag just outside her reach did you use this on armin lensch is this what you sliced open his belly with ive never seen that before margarethe said looking at the weapon without interest and i wouldnt use that for slicing open a gut thats for cutting throats if you havent seen that before said fabel leaning forward then how do you know how its used ive never seen your car but if i did i would know how to drive it and i know that that is called a graviso knife or a srbosjek it was used by croat usta e its very simple but highly effective but its not an assassins weapon particularly this is for killing large numbers of people although i have to say that used expertly it would silence and kill a single meeting efficiently meeting asked susanne thats what we call them said margarethe a meeting is when the agent and the target encounter each other and the mission is executed we call them meetings because there should be no engagement with the target prior to execution making the meeting the first and final encounter we also call the target a meeting fabel placed a second evidence bag on the table it contained the automatic that dirk and henk had found is this yours he asked ive never seen it before she said it was retrieved from your apartment again there is a croatian connection i know its a croatian php mv automatic its about eighteen years old it was a model developed in a rush for use in the independence war okay said fabel once again im impressed by your encyclopaedic knowledge of weapons and assassination techniques but your knowledge of this weapon could come simply from the fact that it is yours that you had it ready to use if your drugging of drescher didnt work out as planned again an empty stare margarethe was attractive her features perfectly proportioned but there was still something about the way she looked at him that reminded fabel of the photographs he had seen of irma grese the same void in the eyes and expression he had no way of knowing if margarethe was lying to him after nearly twenty years as an investigator of murders of conducting interviews like this he found himself lost in a strange country completely without any recognisable landmarks who are we asked susanne filling the silence you said we call the target a meeting my sisters and i the valkyries how many valkyries were there asked anna wolff margarethe stared at her for a moment still expressionless before answering only three of us were selected for final training but you didnt finish your final training said fabel did you i was selected along with the other two out of dozens of girls who in turn were the best of the best only three of us were chosen to be valkyries it was drescher who dropped me from the programme is that why you killed him is that why you kept him alive to suffer first margarethe gave a small smile it was the first time fabel had seen her smile and it did not reach her cold empty eyes she shook her head i didnt kill him because he dropped me i killed him because he chose me because he selected me for this kind of life in the first place my head she winced as if some terrible migraine was cutting through her the things in my head he put them there and i cant get them out what things asked susanne ive already shown you they were all there for you to see in the flat i didnt think i was being ambiguous there was a flicker of impatience in margarethes expression on anyone else it would have gone unnoticed but it flashed across the empty canvas of her face he taught me how to kill that more than anything him and the others all the different ways to kill how to shatter someones nose and drive the bone fragments into their brain or cut off the blood to the brain with an embrace and kill without the meeting knowing what was happening how to seduce a man or a woman and fuck them in a way that they become completely obsessed with you how to cut yourself off from your own body so that you can do anything with anyone how to follow someone without them knowing to hunt and trap them and kill them in an instant they told us we could learn from everything no matter how bad it was we could benefit from it every war every crime had a lesson to be learned she nodded to where fabel had shown her the forensicbagged knife thats where i learned about the srbosjek and more so much more and the thing was the totally mad thing was that they tried to teach you that you could switch off from it all and have a normal life in between the meetings fabel paused for a moment leaning back in his chair as if creating a punctuation mark in the interview i have to say i am most impressed with your organisational abilities planning arranging the apartment below dreschers very impressive but theres no way absolutely no way you could have organised that yourself in the time available since your escape from mecklenburg who is helping you margarethe another hollow stare and silence okay sighed fabel jens jespersen politiinspektor jens jespersen of the danish national police someone picked him up in a restaurant in the hanseviertel and persuaded him to meet with her later then when they were in bed together she killed him with an injection of suxamethonium chloride exactly the means you used to immobilise georg drescher youve just described to us the way major drescher and his stasi colleagues trained you in concealment disguise and seduction techniques those sound to me exactly the kind of skills used to get drescher into a vulnerable position and kill him i suppose you are going to tell me that you dont know anything about that i dont i dont believe you fabel fixed margarethe with a penetrating stare that failed to penetrate i dont care whether you believe me or not i have a colleague of jespersens in the other room watching this interview his superior officer she is here because politiinspektor jespersen was here to try to find georg drescher he was also following up rumours that a female contract killer going by the name the valkyrie was operating out of hamburg that is a hell of a lot of coincidences margarethe no comment no shrug no expression he was here to find the man you were hunting in turn he was hunting a killer called the valkyrie and he was killed with the same drug you used on drescher you killed jens jespersen didnt you he got in the way of your mission a secondary target or what would you call it an unplanned meeting margarethe ignored fabel and turned to susanne you are a criminal psychologist ive already told you that and you have spoken with dr kopke yes so you think i am a psychopath i believe you have dissocial personality disorder yes but i think you have something else going on as well youre not just psychopathic youre psychotic delusional really said margarethe then you know that i will be kept in an institution probably for the rest of my life i dont think you can ever be reintegrated into society no or cured of your problems maybe the psychosis with drug therapy but no you will be confined for the rest of your life although i disagree with your diagnosis frau doctor eckhardt i agree with your vision of my future i will never be at liberty and if i am a psychopath then i have absolutely no sense of accountability or responsibility and punishment is meaningless to me so could you explain to herr fabel that there is absolutely no point in me lying to him about which murders i did or did not commit there are other reasons for lying said fabel to protect others maybe you werent working alone perhaps you decided to have a class reunion with your fellow exvalkyries that would explain all the money and resources you have at your disposal maybe it was one of your sisters who killed jespersen maybe it was said margarethe but i know nothing about it and even if i did i owe them no loyalty they left me behind only my sister stayed by me promised to make it right there thought fabel there i saw something for the first time in the interview he saw an opening hardly a crack but something that could be worked at pried open yes margarethe he said sympathetically they did leave you behind betrayed you they went on to become true valkyries while you were thrown aside and rejected after all that horror all that pain all those horrible horrible things they put into your head is that the real reason you tortured and killed drescher to achieve some kind of fulfilment do you have any idea of the kind of money they will have made out of their meetings oh yes when the wall came down drescher and his girls embraced capitalism with real enthusiasm they have been killing for private enterprise as a private enterprise she said margarethe what she not they georg drescher had a favourite he works with only one woman the other valkyrie has no part of it she has another life there was a short electric pause fabel felt his pulse pick up a beat he was aware that anna and susanne were staying very still and quiet names margarethe he said what are their names the woman drescher worked with the professional killer what is she called we were friends said margarethe now there was emotion not much just a hint of wistfulness as much as we could be friends all three of us were loners part of what they needed from us but in our own way we were friends they left you behind margarethe you owe them nothing you dont have to tell me that you dont need to manage me i will tell you what i want to tell you not what you think you can make me tell you she paused it was a rule that we didnt know each others names they were very strict about that we knew each other as one two and three i was two fabel felt the hope slip from him he sighed we got on well said margarethe we were supervised most of the time watched and monitored our sleeping quarters were kept separate but we were trained together for most things did the other girls tell you anything that gave a clue to their true identities asked fabel they thought they could control us completely make us like machines but they couldnt margarethe smiled not a fake smile not something she had been trained to use at appropriate moments her smile and it terrified fabel liane kayser anke wollner it was our rebellion our way of keeping a little of ourselves outside their control we told each other our real names fabel kept his gaze on margarethe but to his left he heard anna wolff scribbling the names into her notebook before rushing out of the interview room there was something else we knew that we would be sent to different places that we maybe wouldnt see each other again so we worked out a plan a place we would meet where fabel tried to keep his tone dispassionate you have to remember we were all living in the east we didnt know then that the wall would come down we didnt know that one or more of us might be sent into the west into deep cover so we picked somewhere we all knew halberstadt in saxonyanhalt margarethe nodded one of the girls liane came from halberstadt she said that if we needed each other we would meet at the cathedral in halberstadt how would you know to come two newspapers one in the gdr one in west germany we would run an announcement it would be a quote from njals saga the heavens are stained with the blood of men as the valkyries sing their song if we saw the announcement we would know to meet up in halberstadt at eight am on the first monday of the month following the announcement fabel leaned forward so if we ran this announcement in the appropriate newspapers we could bring the other two valkyries to halberstadt margarethe shook her head it was compromised they caught us talking about it we were stupid we were being trained by the stasi and didnt think that they would have bugged us so you dont think the others would respond to the announcement asked fabel no and we didnt arrange another code after that we were separated we didnt see each other again and youve had no contact since then with any of the other valkyries none you said drescher had a favourite this is the woman you think hes been operating with which one margarethe who was his favourite liane kayser or anke wollner anke wollner liane well liane was different she didnt respond as well to discipline she wanted things her own way it was anke who was dreschers little protegee anna wolff came back into the room and retook her place she responded to fabels inquiring look with a sharp shake of her head ill ask you again fabel turned back to margarethe if it wasnt one of the other valkyries who set you up with everything you needed to kill drescher the blank mask fell again was it someone else from the stasi maybe someone who worked with drescher and saw him as a threat nothing does the name thomas maas mean anything to you ulrich adebach fabel ran through the other names he had obtained from the bstu federal commissioners office it was clear that they had come to a dead end it was almost as if margarethe had realised that she had opened up too much and was now shutting down no thought fabel she was too much in control for that any information she had given had been released in a controlled manner fabel terminated the interview and margarethe was taken back to her cell under heavy guard fabel ordered that she be placed in a videosurveillance cell so nothing on these names fabel asked anna as soon as they were in the corridor nothing but thats hardly surprising chef if these girls were chosen by the stasi especially if they were orphans or from broken homes then i would guess that the first thing the stasi would do would be to wipe all trace of their real identities from the public record an easy thing to do if youre in charge of that selfsame public record i want you to get back on to the bstu federal commissioners office in berlin fabel leaned against the wall give them these names and see what comes up the stasi thought they were invulnerable maybe they thought any mention of the girls real identities within the context of a stasi hq file was relatively safe its a very very long shot chef said anna at the moment its the best weve got they were joined by karin vestergaard and werner meyer who had been watching the interview from the next room well fabel asked vestergaard i dont know she sighed its difficult to read expression and body language over a cctv link there was none to read believe me theres a very big chunk of humanity missing from margarethe paulus but you heard what she said about jespersens death she claims she had nothing to do with it and she has a point when she says she has nothing to gain by lying about it thats the thing said vestergaard i tend to believe her so do i said fabel so where does that leave us well said anna weve got a professional assassination in norway jorgen halvorsen and the death of jens jespersen in hamburg its pretty safe to assume that they are directly linked then weve got the murders in the kiez the brit westland and armin lensch said werner the socalled return of the angel of st pauli they must be connected and the murder of georg drescher said anna whether margarethe was involved in the jespersen and halvorsen killings or not there is a connection so effectively we have three sets of murders that have a common link and that link is this stasi conspiracy to place valkyrie assassins in the west theres maybe one more said fabel peter claasens the suicide that maybe isnt a suicide in the kontorhaus quarter maybe the link lies there he turned to karin vestergaard and i think maybe you and i should take another look at this environmental analyst sparwald who has had some kind of contact with halvorsen ive been thinking about that said vestergaard if they were both supposed to be travelling to china and halvorsen didnt make it then whos to say that sparwald did fabel straightened up from leaning on the wall do you still have the address karin vestergaard held out the note that sparwalds boss had given her lets go said fabel fabel rang sparwalds cellphone number from his car number unavailable he said to vestergaard as he snapped his phone shut thats not surprising if hes in a remote part of china like you say if thats where he is said fabel he looked at the note luttig sparwalds boss had given them but i hope to god he is if sparwald really was due to make this trip with a norwegian travelling companion and that travelling companion was halvorsen sparwald didnt live far from his work but if you were someone who appreciated the environment poppenbuttel was not a bad choice of place to live even in winter with its branches bare and its tones muted nature still made her presence felt here sparwald lived in a small house near the banks of the alster set tight into a mass of trees the house was constructed out of wood but most of the southfacing side of the house was made up of windows over which shutters had been pulled it reminds me of a lot of the houses we have in denmark said vestergaard she pointed to a large area of the garden that had been dug up there were spiralled coils of pipe lying on the muddy exposed undersoil look hes been installing a geothermal energy converter its not finished now thats a very odd project to leave halfdone when youre about to go off to china for a month or so she nodded up towards the roof and these solar panels are new it doesnt look to me like theyre connected sparwald was obviously in the middle of a pretty major homeimprovement project fabel rang the front doorbell and knocked on the door for good measure as he expected there was no answer he turned to vestergaard im going to have a look around the back see if you can find a window where the blinds havent been drawn fabel made his way around the side of the building again there were signs of work in progress building materials propped against the side of the house tools left out fabel tried the back door it was locked jan he heard vestergaard call from the other side of the house he ran around slipping on the mud churned up by sparwalds excavation for the heat pump take a look at this said vestergaard theres a space between the blind and the edge of the window he peered through but could see nothing he took a small torch from his pocket and shone the beam through you see it said vestergaard i see it said fabel for a moment he tried to convince himself it was just a shoe but he knew that what he saw just visible from behind the sofa was a foot he called the presidium from his cellphone and told them to send a blueandsilver from police commissariat at poppenbuttel and could you alert the forensics department it would appear we have a murder scene here this is different said vestergaard without a hint of irony it had taken less than two minutes for the first uniformed unit to arrive and for the door of sparwalds home to be shattered with a ram the first thing that had struck them on entering the house was the smell the real stench of death they found sparwalds body in the lounge his foot projecting beyond the edge of the sofa as they had seen through the window this was horror of a different kind from that they had experienced at the drescher scene and fabel understood exactly what vestergaard had meant by her comment the smell was because sparwald had lain undiscovered for days maybe weeks but the method of his death had been much cleaner than dreschers without symbolism or ritual without passion fabel and vestergaard had put on forensic overshoes and latex gloves before entering the house and instructed the uniformed officers to do the same clutching a handkerchief to his mouth and nose fabel bent down and examined sparwald who lay staring up at the ceiling the skin on his face pale and blotchy there was a bullet hole in the middle of his forehead and another under his jawline this had been the professional efficient extermination of a life you realise this is exactly the same mo as the halvorsen killing vestergaard too held the back of her hand to her nose to diminish the smell of death but fabel noticed that otherwise she seemed untouched by the scene her brow was slightly furrowed but it was the concentration of a professional analysing the facts she was presented with yes said fabel im guessing hes been killed with a lowvelocity hollowpoint the valkyrie said vestergaard but quietly as if to herself poppenbuttel police station was part of polizei hamburg division east and could not have been more different from davidwache or klingberg police commissariat was situated on wentzelplatz next to the sbahn station the commissariat was an imposing brandnew construction composed of solid modernist blocks angles curves and sweeps there was fabel thought something almost intimidating about the severity of the building and he found himself thinking just how much more approachable davidwache must seem to the public fabel had assembled the resources he needed there bringing in holger brauner and his forensics team plus anna werner henk and dirk the poppenbuttel uniformed branch had kept on the onduty shift after its replacement came on doubling the number of officers available fabel had also made a call to van heiden whose disapproving tone all but suggested that he held fabel personally responsible for another murder being discovered but again there had been no reluctance to comply with fabels request for more officers the first people fabel spoke to were the forensics team brauner had rolled up in a convoy of vans carrying twelve specialists and all the technical support they needed to carry out a thorough processing of the scene if you dont mind brauner said to fabel id like astrid to go in alone to start with she has a knack of getting trace from older scenes its up to you holger said fabel its your thing not mine but she must be good normally you would be all over a scene like this like a rash trust me jan she is one of the best ive worked with fabel held a cramped briefing in the commissariats main conference room his strategy was simple to get every door knocked on every memory jogged every detail noted at the same time he hoped against hope that the forensic survey of the murder scene would reveal something that would point them in the direction of the valkyrie he and vestergaard plotted out when the assassin had been in oslo and an estimate from astrid bremers initial observations of when sparwald had died from that fabel worked out a rough schedule for the killer and put a team on to looking at flights trains ferries it was a long shot particularly as they were dealing with someone who clearly did not leave traces or make mistakes ever fabel got home about ten and told susanne what his day had yielded you look bushed she said have you eaten i grabbed something at poppenbuttel he sighed we spent hours trying to trace her steps i dont know susanne this killer the thing with margarethe paulus sometimes i think its all beyond me for the first time in years i feel totally lost with a case susanne smiled and pushed back a lock of hair that had fallen over fabels brow do you want me to tell you what i think of course i do i always want your opinion you know that im not talking about my professional opinion i mean my personal opinion okay men are always trying to work out the secret of being a success with women youre always asking each other that the answer is that the man who is most successful with women is the man who has no secret the man who doesnt treat them as if theyre from another planet are you trying to improve my courting skills no jan you did all right in that department but this case because youre dealing with women with a female serial killer andor a professional female assassin you think you have no frame of reference the truth is there are differences in the offending behaviours of each gender but you are basically thinking about this all the wrong way because youre thinking about it in a different way just do what you do jan forget the gender and focus on the crimes fabel thought about what susanne had said you might be right he said come on she said lets go to bed you need a good nights sleep things will look different in the morning it took a while for fabel to drift off and when he did fragments of dreams punctuated his sleep vague fragments irma grese margarethe paulus and another woman whose face he could not make out youre looking for me he broke off another coughing fit and muffled sounds indicating he had covered the mouthpiece with his hand when he came back on the line his voice sounded harder more determined as if annoyed at his own weakness i know youve been looking for me of course ive been looking for you said sylvie achtenhagen what did you expect have you got more information for me youve seen all you need to see you dont need to look for me you dont need to find me said siegfried i want us to meet face to face asked sylvie as she spoke she looked out of the hotel window it was a transit hotel one of the ones just off the autobahn and she watched the rainfudged dark shapes of cars and lorries drift silently along the ribbon of motorway in the near distance face to face he said have you got my money you know the answer to that already you know its not that simple everything in life is as simple as you choose to make it decisions about life and death are the most straightforward a decision about whether you want someone else to get this scoop is a simple one listen said sylvie we can sort something out of course we can i want something from you and i know you will give it to me like i said its simple after siegfried hung up sylvie remained at the window for a moment still watching silent cars in the distance she was closing in on him she knew that he knew she was looking for him because she had obviously been looking in the right places sylvie went across to the bed and laid out the sheets with the names she had narrowed it down to they were all over the east of germany and one was back in hamburg one of these was siegfried she was sure of it sylvie rose early the next morning and drove the fifty kilometres to dresden there she met with a retired accounts clerk called berger berger like frau schneeg had sought to hide his past as a stasi officer by moving from his home town to dresden nonetheless word berger explained had a habit of getting around you were on ulrich adebachs staff is that right herr berger sylvie looked around his apartment clean but small and cheaply furnished depressing you say theres something in this for me berger asked he was a small man in his sixties his hair still dark his face narrow and pinched i can pay you something said sylvie if the information is useful and no one will know about my involvement my helping you no one knows im here herr berger and no one will find out i promise you anything you tell me will stay between us yes i was on adebachs staff he was an old bastard how long six and a half years from nineteen seventyseven until eightyfour then i was transferred voluntarily no i ended up in another department going through tapes of bugged conversations that kind of thing why were you transferred adebach got a new adjutant a mean bastard called helmut kittel he had it in for me while you were on adebachs staff did you ever come across a major georg drescher he was hva or special operations i think he might even have been section a i have reason to believe he worked on a project called operation valkyrie berger thought hard sylvie could see he was making a big effort to earn his money no i cant say i ever came across him at the department never heard of any operation valkyrie either it involved the training of young women for special operations again berger looked gloomily thoughtful then his expression lightened wait a minute there was something i remember adebach requested some files that had been couriered in to be brought through to him the courier had asked for kittel hed obviously been told to deliver them into his hands so that he could in turn take them in to adebach but kittel was on a meal break so i took the files through adebach was on the phone and he told me to wait he checked through the files and then waved me away but i do remember the files had photographs of young women in them teenagers really they also had an hva stamp on them when kittel came back from his meal break he went crazy not long after that i was transferred what did kittel look like a miserable streak of piss he was about one metre ninety tall and as skinny as a rake probably because of all of the cigarettes he smoked a real chainsmoker how old was he thirty maybe said berger with an expression of distaste looked younger he was the real boy wonder of the department so he was involved with whatever project was in the files i dont know if involved is the right word he was a gofer a filer and papershuffler but he would have had sight of a lot of the files that crossed adebachs desk sylvie sat quietly for a moment looking around without taking in the meagre dull apartment was that useful for you asked berger expectantly oh yes said sylvie i think herr kittel and i have already crossed paths id watch him if i were you i heard he went on to bigger things investigations rooting out undesirable elements he developed a nasty reputation its all right siegfried and i understand each other only too well said sylvie ignoring bergers confused expression it was a bright morning again there was a welcome freshness in the air and fabel woke to find himself in a more optimistic mood karin vestergaard was already at the presidium when he arrived and he waited patiently while she made various phone calls in danish sorry about that she said i got my office to see if they could find out anything about gina bronsted and neuhansa from a danish perspective it would appear that bronsted has almost as many business interests in copenhagen as she does here in hamburg added to which she has companies across all the scandinavian countries nothing dodgy asked fabel not that we know about she seems to be very active in environmental management and technologies she helps other corporations become greener its a big business now ive arranged a meeting with her this afternoon said fabel believe me it wasnt easy but this morning we dont have far to travel fabel was as good as his word the hamburg state police academy on braamkamp was less than a kilometre distant from the police presidium it was here that officers were shaped for command and developments in policing analysed developed and passed on to the citys officers it was a building fabel was only too familiar with when he arrived the main hallway was filled with betweenclasses students he found himself thinking about his daughter gabi and how her recently announced decision could lead her here too principal commissar michael lange was not an officer whom fabel had encountered before from what fabel had been able to find out lange had started off in the polizei schleswigholstein and had transferred to the polizei hamburg early in his career he was now a lecturer in the hamburg state police academy but it was langes experience early in his career that brought fabel to his door the older uniformed officer at reception directed fabel and vestergaard up to the first floor of the academy a tall lean man in a blue hamburg schutzpolizei uniform was leaning into the corridor from his office clearly watching out for fabel after having been told of his arrival by reception principal chief commissar fabel lange smiled and extended his hand as fabel approached lange was about forty but fabel felt he had the eyes of an older man but that was maybe just because he knew of langes experience call me jan said fabel this is politidirektor karin vestergaard of the danish national police could we speak in english it would save me a lot of translating sure said lange i just hope my english is good enough thanks for arranging to see me so soon said fabel its just that the case im working on has a balkan connection and anna wolff whom i believe you know suggested i should talk to you ill help if i can said lange you said on the phone you were looking into goran vuja i c s death and his background of course his death wasnt in our jurisdiction but in yours frau vestergaard vujaic s death may not have been in our jurisdiction but the murder of the danish detective who was investigating it is said fabel he was one of frau vestergaards officers we suspect that the danish officer was murdered by the same professional assassin who took out vuja i c i take it you understand that this must stay between us michael of course we suspect that this person is a contract killer based here in hamburg and that makes everything our jurisdiction lange pursed his lips meditatively youre right we do have jurisdiction under section seven of the criminal code if the perpetrator is a german national and you say no one outside the commission is aware of this what about top brass shouldnt they be told the police president has been briefed said fabel but at the moment were keeping it tight theres been another murder committed by someone else but it is related to the investigation and were trying to keep it quiet until we flush out this killer and you think there may be something in vujaic s background that could point you in the direction of more solid evidence truth is i dont know but if this valkyrie thats what this contract assassin is supposed to be codenamed if this valkyrie is based here then he or she would have a pretty good motive for taking jespersen out of the equation and vuja i c is the connection okay im glad to help if i can the jurisdiction issue may not be an issue at all but i only know about three years of vuja i c s life the three years he was active in the bosnian war and even then vuja i c was not a leading figure more a footnote in the diary of atrocity so to speak we never got enough to indict him mainly because he successfully argued a special defence of alibi he had gall ill say that he never tried to hide like most of the others but there again that actually worked in his favour flight is a judicially acceptable indicator of possible guilt so you think he was innocent like hell goran vuja i c was clever and more than a little lucky i wasnt personally involved in his case but i was able to access the files through osce lange referred to the organisation for security and cooperation in europe vuja i c had already assembled a gang around him the writing was on the wall as soon as nato got involved in the conflict and i think that vuja i c started to look at the bigger picture but vuja i c was there in the rape camps in the forests by the mass graves he was up to his elbows in it all except that he had half a dozen affidavits swearing he was lying wounded in a hospital bed in banja luka this unit or gang of his petra meissner of the sabine charity told me they called themselves the dogheads or something yep psoglav its serbian for doghead but its also a mythical creature that serbs bosnian serbs in particular used to believe in a pagan demon or werewolftype thing the psoglav unit was little more than an organisedcrime gang and thats exactly what it became after the conflict there was talk little more than a rumour mind that vuja i c and his psoglav chums got heavily involved in people trafficking after the bosnian war all kinds of bad stuff organ farming selling women into the sex trade slavelabour sweatshops that kind of thing but youd have to talk to the europol organisedcrime division about that as far as im aware vuja i c was not directly active in northern europe sorry thats not that helpful is it i appreciate it anyway said fabel one thing i would say said lange is that vuja i c was one of the most evil sons of bitches to walk the earth the stories about what he did to bosniaks croats and ethnic albanians particularly what he did to women i tell you i saw more than my fair share of beasts out there and vuja i c was right up there with the worst of them unfortunately its not always about who deserves justice most but about who you can get the evidence on vuja i c was such a cunning little bastard that we never had anything more than rumour on him its not a very policemanlike thing to say but when he got topped my first reaction was that he got what he deserved the only pity is that he didnt suffer the same way the people who fell into his hands did fabel nodded watching lange there are some things he thought even in this job that its better not to see to know at that moment he knew he was talking to someone whose dreams were even darker even more terrifying than his own thanks michael said fabel if anything else comes to mind please let me know fabel and karin vestergaard had just stepped through the revolving doors and into the bright doublestorey reception atrium of the police presidium in alsterdorf when they were stopped in their tracks by a determinedlooking anna wolff dont take your coats off she said with a grin well take your car chef ill give you directions theres someone i want you to meet the cafe anna took them to was in the sachsentor pedestrian zone in hamburgbergedorf when they arrived a young woman with a pretty but rather severe face and long dark hair was waiting for them sandra kraus sat with a huge canvas bag at her side the strap still over her shoulder and tapped the cafe table with the tips of her fingers as fabel vestergaard and anna approached almost as if she was announcing their arrival with a drum roll she didnt stand up but smiled at them fabel noticed that it was like when karin vestergaard smiled nothing of it seemed to reach the eyes ive known sandra since we were kids said anna after she had done the introductions she was the smartest student in the whole school and she is an absolutely brilliant cryptologist really said fabel with genuine interest but looking questioningly at anna he was slightly distracted as kraus drummed her fingers again on the tabletop he turned to her and found the intensity of her gaze disturbing as if she was looking at him as an object rather than a person yes really said anna with more than a hint of defiance and trust me bringing you here to meet sandra isnt a waste of time i gave her a copy of muliebritas the same issue we found in dreschers flat does she know anna shook her head you told us to keep a lid on the drescher thing and thats exactly what ive done sandra only knows that we may have a coded message in this magazine to be honest thats all shes interested in and did she find anything asked vestergaard it took her five minutes to find the message and crack the code no more are you trying to tell me that an amateur cryptologist can break a code created by one of the worlds most successful secret police and espionage agencies fabel smiled patronisingly kraus drummed her fingers on the table again took a sip of her coffee and then spoke briskly i have advantages that they didnt have i have an inbuilt ability to recognise patterns in things what you see as complexity i see as structure and ultimately simplicity theres more said anna i got all of the issues of muliebritas for the last three years drescher was using it regularly to communicate with the valkyrie sandra has decoded dozens of messages it really wasnt that difficult the person who called himself uncle georg in the announcements used a combination of polyalphabetic cyphers basically he used a vigenere square with a staggered shift of caesar cyphers basic stuff for example she took a pad and pencil out of the huge shoulder bag and wrote altonabalkonsfourthirtypmthursday on the pad fabel noticed that krauss handwriting was perfect the capital letters corresponded exactly with the lines on the pad that becomes vleylrjegkzxqwwymtsspkgthtsepjlet she continued of course a long jumble of letters like that would be very easily noticed by anyone looking at the magazine and would attract the attention of any cryptologist so he buried them in several personal ads throughout the announcements section he put in thanks notices that listed names the initials would give several of the encrypted letters in each announcement and youre absolutely positive that you have interpreted the codes correctly asked fabel like i said it was a simple enough encryption in principle but for three hundred years the vigenere cypher was considered unbreakable simply because to decode the encryption you have to know which word was used as the keyword in other words what the vertical letters are on the axis of the vigenere square and you worked it out asked fabel how i just saw it i have this knack for frequency analysis of letters and recognition of common pairings i read all the messages and i could see the patterns youre only supposed to be able to do frequency analysis with monoalphabetic cyphers not with a polyalphabetic cypher like this one where an encrypted letter can be decoded as more than one original but sandra can do it said anna with clear pride in her friends abilities tell him the keyword sandra valkyrie said kraus again drumming out the same tattoo with her fingertips on the tabletop the word used as the keyword was valkyrie as anna drove back to the presidium fabel sat in the passenger seat and went through the messages sandra kraus had decoded these are all times and places said fabel over his shoulder to vestergaard who sat in the back obviously he passed anything sensitive on in person this was just used to set up a meeting so that means we can now do exactly the same said vestergaard we can lure this valkyrie out into the open assuming she really doesnt know about dreschers death weve still got the lid tight on that but for how much longer i dont know fabel turned to anna thats an interesting friend youve got there sandra shes great she has a genius iq i guessed that much fabel said with a small laugh and shes an aspie a what did you notice her drumming her fingers all the time same rhythm same number of beats or how shes got an unnerving way of seeking eye contact with you as a matter of fact i did said fabel sandra has aspergers syndrome but she calls herself an aspie she doesnt see herself as a sufferer from a disability just different and shes cool with that she campaigns for a group that promotes neurodiversity the idea that there is more than one type of mind she calls us nts neurologically typical i thought people with aspergers have difficulty with interpersonal relationships you said shes your friend said vestergaard from the back seat a good friend said anna sandra has problems in some areas but as you could see there are compensations in others and she has taught herself coping strategies and stuff ive learned not to judge its funny sandra said that one of the stereotypes people have of aspies is that they have little or no empathy for the feelings of others thats why its often difficult to recognise a male aspie who can tell the difference from a normal man vestergaard gave a loud laugh fabel shrugged well one things for sure he said your friend sandra has probably given us our biggest break in this case so far the preliminary forensics survey of sparwalds house had as expected surrendered nothing much fabel was surprised however at just how much astrid bremer had been able to read from such meagre trace evidence she was still at poppenbuttel when she phoned him at his office in the presidium ive had the body removed and well get the autopsy report obviously but my guess is that the victim was dead before he hit the floor the killer put another bullet in him firing along the victims already supine body and causing an entry wound under his chin very professional job the last shot was probably insurance professional meticulousness there was a similar murder outside oslo said fabel exactly the same modus my guess is that the victim didnt let the killer into the house there was a book beside him on the floor no prints other than his own and its obvious he dropped it when he was shot and i found powder traces on the wall by the lounge door and on the edge of the door itself again no prints on the door handle or anywhere else that i could see im guessing that the killer opened the lounge door stepped in and fired before the victim had time to respond the killer didnt need to go any further into the room so she retraced her steps back along the hall to the front door it was a hunch but i was right there is no evidence of the door having been forced but there is some fresh scratching around the lock she picked it but nothing we can get dna from or any trace of any kind fabel failed to conceal his frustration a faint partial bootprint in the hall bearing traces of soil from the garden but that could have been anyones and made at any time and anyway its not big enough to give us a match great said fabel sorry i did my best said astrid and even over the phone fabel could tell that she meant it i went over everything three times tried all the tricks there just wasnt anything to find its not your fault holger told me that if anyone could get something you could he also said youre the best hes worked with for cold scenes thanks astrid said but whoever killed sparwald is better after hed hung up fabel made his way into the main murder commission meeting room werner anna henk and dirk were waiting for him he had also invited karin vestergaard to join them but she had phoned in to say shed be a few minutes late you know said werner if were looking for a valkyrie we couldnt go far wrong looking at the danish ice maiden shes a cold one all right shes a good cop from what i can see said fabel listen said anna while were on the subject of people we should be thinking about im not being funny but there are two women we should maybe take a long hard look at martina schilmann and petra meissner why martina fabel searched annas face for meaning shes expolizei hamburg for gods sake she was also involved with westland and was there at the scene lets face it weve only got her word that she was at the opposite end of herbertstrasse all the time she said she was and she was brought up in the gdr as was petra meissner both fall within the age range we have for the valkyrie what said fabel dismissively so now were going to suspect all women from east germany wed better bring in chancellor merkel then she was brought up in brandenburg after all fabel sarcastically put on an expression of enlightenment and she was in the free german youth seriously chef pressed anna we cant ignore the fact that two women involved with jake westland spent their youth in the gdr but martinas background will have been thoroughly checked out before she was allowed to join the polizei hamburg and i would say that petra meissners public profile is far too visible for her to operate as a professional killer maybe so said anna but if martina schilmann is the valkyrie then her backstory in the gdr would be as solid as it could be okay check it out fabel turned to hechtner dirk were you able to get any more on who olaf might be the name in jespersens notebook nope sorry chef from the little weve been able to piece together theres nothing to suggest drescher ever used olaf as a pseudonym no olafs that we can see connected to goran vuja i c jake westland or armin lensch either were still looking into any olaf that ralf sparwald might have known it could be incidental said fabel maybe nothing to it all fabel waited until vestergaard arrived and the rest of the team had assembled in the incident room okay weve got a break he said addressing the whole team thanks to anna weve cracked the code behind dreschers messages to the valkyrie all the messages have been simple timeandplace setups for meetings its an example of institutional thinking they formed their working system in a time before reunification using the methods of the cold war im guessing that drescher was uncomfortable with new technology otherwise they could have used the internet or anonymous email accounts having said that theres no evidence that they didnt use these means in addition to the magazine announcements why do it at all asked werner after all they could have simply phoned each other no one knew who drescher was and she could have had an untraceable cellphone like i said institutional thinking drescher was in the same city as the valkyrie but their entire relationship had been created to operate at long distances with the valkyrie working on her own most of the time when they set up in hamburg postreunification they kept their old way of working inflexibility i suppose as he spoke fabel noticed that astrid bremer the deputy head of the forensics team had come into the incident room and was standing at the back anyway continued fabel weve managed to get the cooperation of muliebritas magazine theyre going to hold us a space in the next issue its due out next week so weve had to work fast to get our wording right there doesnt seem to be any regular meeting place the only common element is that it seems to always be in an open space presumably so she can check it out as she approaches him but with enough people around for them to be inconspicuous as far as we can see all meetings have been in altona or hamburg city centre what about the rathausplatz in front of the city chambers asked anna we could put someone on each corner and on the ubahn entrance i suspect that would be a little too public for the valkyrie drescher always picked quieter venues people milling about but not crowds the other thing is we want to limit the risk to the public if things go pearshaped what if we used the altona balkon asked werner drescher used it once before as far as we can see the last meeting in fact what about the alsterpark next to where you used to live chef said anna on the shores of the outer alster it would be reasonably easy to secure but quite difficult for the valkyrie to spot us fabel thought for a moment that sounds good anybody have any objections there were none okay said fabel to werner lets get this encrypted and spread across three announcements the way drescher did alsterpark at fahrdamm eleventhirty wednesday that gives us a week to get it all set up in the meantime im going to do a bit of digging into goran vuja i c s history it was his untimely demise that brought jens jespersen to hamburg he turned to vestergaard and spoke in english id like you to come along with me if thats okay id also like us both to go and visit gina bronsted the neuhansa group keeps cropping up in all of this of course she said and smiled in a way so cool that it reminded him of margarethe paulus it would be my pleasure after fabel had set the team about their various tasks astrid bremer came over to him she looked young and girlish and for a moment fabel found it difficult to imagine her being an expert on death i think i have something she said from sparwalds house asked fabel hopefully no from the drescher apartment we have a fingerprint specialist who can extrapolate prints from very faint or old traces i found a packet of rondo melange the popular east german coffee i just thought it was odd that a man trying so hard to conceal his stasi past and living with a phoney west german history would have something like that in his cupboard well ive just heard back from my fingerprint guy weve got a print that doesnt belong the coffee was a gift thats what i thought said astrid and a gift from someone who knew of dreschers gdr background and that could only be one person fabel had just walked into his office to fetch his coat when his phone rang hello principal chief commissar fabel this is dr luttig thomas luttig at skk biotech i heard about ralf one of your people came round a young woman commissar wolff yes im sorry about dr sparwald i know you valued him as a colleague he was my friend as well chief commissar anyway you asked me to tell you if anything out of the ordinary came up well after i heard about ralf i spent the afternoon going through all his stuff there is something it would appear ralf was doing some work for which theres no company authorisation some kind of private project oh fabel reached into his drawer and took a notebook out what kind of private project from what i can see he has been having blood samples tested not many it looks like just three samples each from a different donor i found the samples and some paperwork it seems very strange indeed how so the tests were very specific ralf seems to have been looking for pbdes also he was doing the tests himself and wasnt keeping proper records but i did find a note relating to each of the samples the first said female twentytwo hunan province china fabel spoke as much to himself as to luttig yes but the second one isnt it says female twentytwo bitola bitola i checked it out on the internet its a city in macedonia very industrial what are these pbdes asked fabel polybrominated diphenyl ethers theyre used a lot in flameretardants and in a thousand other things theres a great deal of concern about their toxicity you said there was a third sample what was that labelled well yes its this third sample thats causing me the most concern it was labelled hunan province same as the first blood sample but its human tissue and from the tests ralf was doing im guessing its a sample of human thyroid which means it has been taken postmortem and theres something else what from what i can see of his results the level of pbdes in these samples is astronomical what does that mean asked fabel could it be fatal potentially yes like i said theyre incredibly toxic and you need a special licence to dispose of them the jury is still out on what damage they actually do but they are suspected of causing problems with the thyroid gland the endocrine system generally and even neurological damage thanks that could be useful dr luttig fabel paused by the way does the name olaf mean anything to you someone whom ralf sparwald may have known no i cant think of anyone is it important probably not said fabel he didnt like business types it didnt matter how exalted or lowly they were in their arcane corporate hierarchies they all to fabel seemed to have had some kind of personalityectomy he had recently flown to frankfurt for a meeting with the citys murder commission on the flight fabel had sat in his british tailored sports jacket surrounded by bosssuited clones and feeling like an extra in the film gattaca he had promised himself he would blow his brains out with his sigsauer before owning a blackberry fabel even found it difficult at times to hide his disdain for the type of police officers who seemed to be in the business of policing and who dressed in the same corporateclone style as their commercial counterparts but it was the business leaders at the top of the tree who wound fabel up most of all sometimes it was as if they thought themselves medieval barons in a way fabel supposed they had a point hamburg was a city and a state that had built its history and independence on a foundation of trade instead of having total control over the lives of serfs and bondsmen the hanseatic citys tycoons and magnates held employees subsidiaries suppliers and not a few of hamburgs politicians in their thrall and most of hamburgs politicians were businessmen themselves it had been fabels experience that hamburgs business leaders often felt themselves above and beyond the reach of common mortals like policemen so it didnt surprise fabel that it took his personal intervention to arrange an appointment with gina bronsted he had asked one of the presidiums administrative assistants to set up a meeting but she had got nowhere constantly being fobbed off by someone comparatively low down in the neuhansa food chain thats not a problem fabel had said when bronsteds secretarys secretarys assistant had said it was quite impossible for an appointment to be made within the next week or so i quite understand that frau bronsted is very busy ill send a marked police car to her home tonight and bring her into the presidium and dont worry ill be sure to tell her that you were so protective of her office time fabel was informed that gina bronsted would see him later that afternoon as soon as the appointment was confirmed he phoned hans gessler of the corporate crime division and asked him if he would mind coming along at such short notice will you be bringing along the little mermaid asked gessler what are you talking about fabel was genuinely confused that little danish beauty ive heard youve grown attached to if you mean politidirektor karin vestergaard then yes as a matter of fact she will be there gina bronsted is a flensburg dane and i thought it might be useful and anyway politidirektor vestergaard has a direct interest in this case count me in said gessler given the trouble that he had had in securing an appointment with gina bronsted fabel was surprised when as he was leaving the presidium he was handed a note at reception telling him that gennady frolovs office had been looking for him asking if it would be possible for fabel to talk with the russian frolov was on fabels to do list and he made a mental note to follow up the call when he got back the neuhansa group had its offices in a brandnew building in the hafencity fabel had picked up gessler and vestergaard and drove through the city from the presidium down to the shores of the elbe they crossed over the short cantilevered bridge into the speicherstadt this is amazing said vestergaard as they entered the maze of narrow cobbled streets cathedralsized redbrick warehouses and interconnecting canals the speicherstadt was a tollfree zone right up until a few years ago said gessler eagerly leaning over from the back seat i think it was two thousand and four up until then the speicherstadt was an independent free port and the worlds biggest bonded area gessler was a shortish but goodlooking man in his forties with a reputation for being a bit of a ladykiller fabel had noticed when he picked him up at the presidium that gessler was wearing a hugo boss suit and tapping something into his blackberry fabel had also noticed that gesslers eyes had lit up as soon as he had introduced him to karin vestergaard the light had failed to catch in hers theres been a lot of new building explained fabel the hanseatic trade centre in the speicherstadt itself as well as the hafencity which is all new gina bronsted has headquartered her neuhansa group in one of the biggest and newest buildings rumour has it she has a thirteenmillioneuro penthouse apartment above the shop as it were they passed through the speicherstadt and into the hafencity glass and steel were everywhere but it was obvious an effort had been made to extend something of the spirit of the old speicherstadt into the architecture of the twentyfirst century very impressive said vestergaard its not finished said gessler theres going to be an opera house to compete with sydney the elbphilharmonie concert hall how do you want to handle this jan asked vestergaard as if she hadnt heard gessler ill ask her about lensch her employee and claasens the export agent she also met westland the night he died this is all quite involved shes a flensburg dane i think i told you that already meaning shes german by nationality but danish by ethnicity and first language if im struggling maybe you can jump in also ill leave the questioning about jespersen to you fabel turned and spoke to gessler hans i smell a rat here im not saying bronsted herself is directly involved with any of these killings but neuhansa is always there in the background i dont interrogate people jan i interrogate paperwork and computer data if theres a link between neuhansa and these murders then there will be something on file somewhere something that might look innocuous but which will point us in the right direction i need to get access to their files when you introduce me it would be best not to disclose my department unless she asks specifically okay fabel swung his door open and got out followed by gessler and vestergaard he heard gessler give a low appreciative whistle and when he turned he half expected the corporate cop to be staring at karin vestergaards legs instead fabel followed his eyes to a massive sleek luxury motor yacht anchored further down the quay the yacht had the look of something equally suited for space travel as sailing a long elegant white needle with a superstructure of black glass and elongated arches a helicopter sat on the aft deck i know what that is said gessler thats the snow queen ninety metres and it came in at about a million euros a metre gennady frolovs yacht asked fabel his eyes still following the lines of the megayacht fabel was not a sailor and he had no real interest in boats but it struck him that the snow queen was one of the most graceful objects he had ever seen yep said gessler take a good look this is as close as you or i will ever get to that kind of wealth they headed into the neuhansa group building a receptionist who looked as if shed been recruited from a model agency rather than a business school asked them to wait in the vast pillared atrium they sat on one of the dozen white leather sofas each of which looked several times more expensive than the one that fabel and susanne had at home like the megayacht docked half a kilometre along the quay this was intimidation by wealth do you want to get a drink afterwards asked gessler while they waited we could deconstruct the interview sorry said fabel although he knew the true direction of gesslers invitation im meeting a friend in town and i have work to do for my office in copenhagen said vestergaard without a smile after waiting ten minutes they were conducted up to the eighth floor of the neuhansa building the office suite was populated only by a few workstations and a handful of male and female staff who looked as if theyd come from the same model agency as the downstairs receptionist another point in the making a lavish underuse of some of the most expensive floor space in hamburg fabel gessler and vestergaard were led into an inner office it was huge and plush and looked more like a trendy hotel suite than a working environment a tall slim woman in her early to mid forties stepped out from behind an impossibly huge desk indicating that they should all take a seat on the sofas arranged around a coffee table gina bronsted was what fabel would have described as a handsome woman attractive but with a jaw so strong that it hinted at the masculine her blonde hair was cut shortish but in a manner that softened the severity of her features everything about her her hair her cream jacket and skirt suit the matching shoes her simple skyblue blouse was understated and tasteful it also screamed wealth fabel realised he was looking at the flesh and blood equivalent of the luxury yacht anchored outside frau bronsted asked fabel remaining standing herr fabel she smiled and extended her hand please sit excuse me a moment she walked over to the door and said something to the woman who had shown them in ive asked svend langstrup to join us herr langstrup is in charge of all security matters as well as being one of my team of legal advisers fabel responded by introducing karin vestergaard and hans gessler as gessler had suggested fabel didnt mention that he was from the polizei hamburgs corporate crime division on hearing vestergaards name gina bronsted smiled broadly and began speaking in danish after a short exchange she turned back to fabel im sorry i dont often get a chance to speak my native language if you dont mind for frau vestergaards sake well speak in english thats not necessary said vestergaard in lightly accented german ill be able to follow whats said fabel stared at vestergaard blankly for a moment good he said he gave a small laugh and shook his head that will save a lot of time i must say herr fabel that i have a pretty good idea what it is you want to talk to me about ive already been through it all with that annoyingly persistent lady from hanssat tv sylvie achtenhagen fabel shook his head shes been here pushing her luck i reminded her that i had a controlling stake in the station she worked for shes a very arrogant individual you know you dont say said fabel without a hint of irony at that moment a tall darkhaired man of about forty walked into the room and smiled at everybody he was slim but broad across the shoulders at some point his nose had been broken and there was a faint scar on his forehead just above the eye he didnt look to fabel like a legal adviser unless lawsuits in denmark were settled in a boxing ring the man introduced himself as langstrup and sat down you take care of security for frau bronsted asked fabel amongst other things yes answered langstrup without the danish accent that fabel had expected fabel guessed he was a german dane like bronsted herself with frau bronsteds rising political profile as well as her success in business there are sometimes threats to her safety there have been threats asked vestergaard potential threats were here to discuss a number of recent deaths all of these deaths have some connection to the neuhansa group not always directly but there always seems to be a tiein gina bronsted frowned naturally if we can help we will do all we can you are standing for principal mayor frau bronsted thats public knowledge i dont see could you tell me something about your political platxform asked fabel i really dont see the relevance said langstrup indulge me said fabel to bronsted ignoring langstrup lets say im a floating voter my political platform is pretty much the same as the one my business is built on europe is unifying some day soon there will be a federal europe and its economic power will dwarf that of the united states and even emerging superpowers like china and india already europe is an economic and mercantile singularity that means that old national borders are meaningless and there is an opportunity for new transnational alliances to be built i am not a german politician i am a hamburg politician as far as business is concerned my vision is to build alliances with other northern european cities and create and share the kind of prosperity that national governments are incapable of delivering like the old hanseatic league said fabel hence the neuhansa name the hanseatic league is long dead and gone hamburg adopted the title free and hanseatic city of hamburg a century and a half after the league had ceased to be an active economic or political force but the idea lived on you still see it today all around you here if the hanseatic ideal hadnt lived on in the hamburg psyche then the speicherstadt would not have been built here and this the hafencity its another example of hamburgs independence and entrepreneurial spirit bronsted talked with force but fabel thought without genuine passion he realised he was listening to a party political broadcast well he thought he had asked for it after all ten fifteen years ago continued bronsted when the rest of europe was navelgazing about the future of the world economy hamburg saw that china and the far east as well as eastern europe offered a massive trading opportunity so we acted and built dedicated facilities to make the most of that opportunity look at whats happening just a few hundred metres from here in sandtorhafen a vast area of the hafencity devoted exclusively to trade with china do you realise that of the ten point eight million container units hamburg is expected to handle this year one out of every five of those containers will be traffic to or from china my politics are simple hamburg needs the freedom and independence to build on her successes to build alliances with other cities in scandinavia and the baltic and together to outclass every other trading location in the world all good in theory said fabel but like you said ultimately the hanseatic league failed it lasted in one form or another for nearly three hundred years herr fabel it was a superpower within europe a mercantile rather than a military superpower it had military might but it hardly ever used it war is bad for business i think thats a pretty good model for the future of europe but youre a dane said karin vestergaard a german dane admittedly but you know that unbridled capitalism just doesnt fit with the danish character yet you include copenhagen in your plans this isnt unbridled capitalism said bronsted its about generating great wealth and sharing it capitalism with social democracy and nothing could be more danish as a concept im sure you didnt come here just to discuss the politics of the neuhansa party langstrup said fabel noticed langstrup had small hard eyes could you tell me what you know about armin lensch fabel asked bronsted the young man who worked in your export department nothing bronsted shrugged i have over a thousand employees obviously i was distressed to hear about his death and the manner of his death but i wasnt even aware of his name until i was informed that the latest victim of the angel of st pauli was an employee would you mind if we had a look at lenschs recent workload asked gessler he smiled his ladykillers charming smile it might help us help you how asked langstrup his death was clearly not connected to his work oh said fabel and how can you be so sure of that he was the victim of a random serial killer for gods sake not so random as far as i can see said fabel without diverting his attention from gina bronsted it is by no means certain that the socalled angel of st pauli was responsible for lenschs death and if you prefer we can obtain a court order to see his files that wont be necessary said bronsted and fabel thought he caught her fire a warning look at langstrup as if she was saying be seen to cooperate just let us know what you need to see we wont know until we see it said gessler so well have to look at everything really i saw gennady frolovs yacht the snow queen moored along the quay do you have business dealings with him asked fabel the yacht is there because that is the regular mooring for private vessels of that size but yes i have had dealings with herr frolov in fact i have an interest in the flensburg boatyard that designed and built the snow queen vantage north asked vestergaard yes vantage north bronsted made an insincerely impressed face youve done your homework and other than your involvement with vantage north do you have any other dealings with frolov asked fabel as a matter of fact we are in the middle of negotiations over a joint project an environmental project through your company norivon yes why the interest in herr frolov do you know peter claasens the export agent of course i do or did i heard about his suicide claasens exporting did some work with us occasionally did you ever meet him maybe once or twice official functions company events or exhibitions that kind of thing bronsted smiled politely and held fabel in her earnest danishblue gaze there it was he thought impatience annoyance just a hint of it but enough and you met jake westland the night he died before he died yes before his performance he was supposed to come to a postevent party but didnt turn up what did you talk about asked vestergaard again fabel noticed how good her newly found german was the event the charity the sabine charity that the concert was in aid of i really cant remember it was the usual meaningless chitchat did he do or say anything out of the ordinary asked fabel did he seem preoccupied or distracted no bronsted frowned and made too big a show of trying to remember no i cant say that he did okay said fabel in a way that suggested he was mentally ticking off names on a list another employee another death ralf sparwald interjected langstrup who had followed the exchange intently his small hard eyes on fabel ralf sparwald repeated fabel still focused on bronsted im afraid i didnt know him either i heard about his murder is it connected to armin lenschs so to summarise fabel ignored the question you didnt really know jake westland who died within a matter of hours of talking to you you didnt really know armin lensch who was the next victim in st pauli and who happened to work for you you didnt really know peter claasens and met him only a couple of times but he was an export agent who worked under contract to your company and fell to his death and you really didnt know ralf sparwald another of your employees who was professionally executed in his own home langstrup leaned forward on the sofa his small hard eyes smaller and harder if you have a specific accusation to make against frau bronsted i suggest you make it but if you continue with these insinuations then this interview is at an end and i think you should bear in mind the fact that frau bronsted is standing for principal mayor fabel didnt answer for a moment but watched gina bronsted who remained impassive and silent let me get this absolutely clear he said to langstrup i am investigating a series of murders and this interview only ends when i say it ends i am quite happy to make it more formal and move it to the murder commission secondly youre supposed to be in charge of neuhansas security did it never strike you as strange that so many people working for or connected to the company are meeting untimely ends it must be saving your pension fund a fortune as a matter of fact it did said langstrup weve been looking into it my people have found no link between the company and the deaths coincidence the neuhansa group has thousands of employees hundreds of contractors and subcontractors its not really that much of a stretch fabel laughed in disbelief a few years ago i hunted a serial killer who was obsessed with fairy tales i tell you herr langstrup he was more anchored in reality than you are if you believe that a neuhansa connection with every murder we are investigating is a coincidence well not every murder has a neuhansa connection what do you mean asked fabel for a moment langstrup looked caught off guard oh wait no youre right i thought the claasens death wasnt connected but of course it is i forgot he did work for us as an export agent i see said fabel exchanging a knowing look with vestergaard the chief commissar has a point bronsted said to langstrup i think we should be doing all that we can to cooperate of course langstrup smiled dryly fabel asked that hans gessler be allowed full access to the companys files bronsted offered predictable assurances that neuhansa would do all it could to aid the investigation and instructed langstrup to give gessler anything he needed one more thing frau bronsted said fabel does the name valkyrie mean anything to you he watched her face for any reaction or recognition all he got was a frown i dont understand i mean of course it does germanic mythology wagner that kind of thing and of course the plot to kill hitler no i mean in a business context does neuhansa have anything to do with anything or anyone using that name bronsted pursed her lips and shook her head i cant say that we do ill check it out if you like have you ever heard of any of these women margarethe paulus liane kayser or anke wollner cant say that any of those names ring a bell fabel could read nothing in bronsteds expression he toyed with the idea of throwing in georg dreschers name to see what kind of reaction it got but decided against it that was a lid he wanted to keep on tight for the meantime the rest of the interview was devoted to questions about details about what ralf sparwald had been working on about who else had talked with westland at the preconcert party about the overlap of function between norivon environmental technologies and skk biotech about anything that fabel thought he might be able to get some kind of reaction to after about an hour he stood up and thanked bronsted for her time once fabel gessler and vestergaard were outside on the street fabel drew a deep breath hans he said to gessler without taking his eyes off the yacht every neuhansa file every databank every transaction i want you all over that company like a rash ill speak to the powers that be and get you all the time and people you need i thought you might said gessler if theres something there to be found well find it i take it you now know who hired the valkyrie or at least hired her through drescher langstrup slipped up said fabel of course theres a murder that is not linked to the neuhansa group dreschers said vestergaard exactly and weve nailed the lid down on that one for the time being no one knows about it which means langstrup despite trying to cover it up was talking about a murder that as far as he and anyone outside the murder commission is concerned hasnt happened yet the question remains said vestergaard whether langstrup is running his own little empire or if gina bronsted herself is behind these killings i dont know said gessler langstrup looks as if he knows how to handle himself and he looks like hes had more than one runin with someone else who can handle themselves but he just doesnt strike me as the brains of the outfit me neither said fabel it was nearly the end of the working day fabel dropped gessler off to pick up his car at the presidium made a quick call to gennady frolovs office and fixed up an appointment in two days time after doing a quick check with the commission that nothing had come up while they had been out fabel drove karin vestergaard back to her hotel you know what im going to ask you dont you he said reverting to english again as they drove through the city centre i have a pretty good idea you have a hell of a nerve do you know that i have extended you every professional courtesy damn it ive extended personal courtesy and hospitality too i introduced you to susanne and you sat through the entire meal allowing us to believe we needed to speak english i must say youre one hell of a fast learner you seem to have progressed from not understanding a word to being totally bloody fluent in a matter of two weeks ubung macht den meister isnt that what you say in german practice makes perfect vestergaard was smiling mischievously it totally disconcerted fabel it was the first time other than brief glimpses during their meal together with susanne that he had seen anything like a genuine unguarded expression on her face im sorry jan she continued youre right it was deceptive of me but it really is better for me to speak in english you didnt seem to be struggling back there where the hell did you learn to speak german like that i was brought up in south jutland just north of the border my father was the opposite of gina bronsted where shes a danish german he was a german dane he spoke sonderjysk dialect and german at home german was my third language after english at school well i can see youve retained a lot of it theres something else i ought to tell you she said tentatively okay lets have it it wasnt strictly true what i told you about never having been to hamburg before i worked here during my breaks at university let me guess to improve your german sorry it doesnt matter in itself karin but we had a deal how the hell am i to know what else youve kept to yourself ive been totally straight with you jan i just wasnt sure that youd be straight with me i suppose i thought that if you thought i didnt speak the language and i take it by now your minds been put at ease fabel pulled into the semicircle of cobbles in front of the hotel yes it has were on the same side jan i promise you chapter six there was no good reason to travel over to the other side of town for a drink but fabel felt the need to visit the bar that had been his local for all the time he had lived in poseldorf he wasnt entirely sure why he missed it so much he had never really spent a great deal of time there but it had been somewhere he had been known where staff and other customers acknowledged his presence with a nod or a wave it had been an anchor in his life a point of reference that had helped him keep a bearing on who jan fabel was fabel sat at the corner of the bar sipped at his jever beer and thought about women whether he liked to admit the fact or not it had been the women in his life who had determined its direction right down to the tiniest degree it was a woman who had steered him into a career as a policeman fabel had attended the carl von ossietzky university in oldenburg before studying european history at hamburg university while he had been there he had never quite managed to get involved in all of the expected student indiscretions but he had been a goodlooking kid and had had his pick of the girls one of them had been hanna dorn a fellow student and the daughter of one of fabels tutors hanna had been a pretty carefree sort of girl and they had both known fabel guessed that they were not in it for the long term they were having fun with the arrogant carelessness of youth now every time fabel thought about hannas face he concentrated hard to remember every detail it was a face that if what happened hadnt happened would have faded along with her name into the dusty indistinct archives of his memory one night after they had been going out for about two weeks hanna had been making her way back alone to her flat after being with fabel on a date he had had an assignment to finish hanna never made it home lutger voss had been a thirtyyearold hospital orderly at the st george hospital the only thing about voss that had been exceptional was his psychosis voss had intercepted hanna on her way home and abducted her the autopsy and forensic evidence had later revealed that voss had tortured and repeatedly raped hanna when her body had been found fabel as her boyfriend and the last person to see her alive had been questioned for hours by the polizei hamburg until they had become convinced of his innocence but fabel had never become as convinced of the absence of his responsibility having an assignment to complete had not seemed reason enough not to have walked her home even now more than twenty years later he often woke up in the middle of the night racked with guilt because he hadnt been there to save her lutger voss had been committed to a secure hospital three days before fabel had graduated the day after fabel had applied to join the polizei hamburg the young barman placed a fresh jever on the bar in front of fabel without him having ordered it when fabel raised his eyebrows quizzically the barman nodded in the direction of a tall lanky balding man who was approaching him youre late fabel said youre obsessive otto jensen grinned in exactly the same gormless way fabel remembered from their student days together or maybe just depressive i saw you when i came in id offer a penny for your thoughts but i dont think id get my moneys worth i was thinking about women said fabel dont worry otto kept grinning its your age its not so bad a midlife crisis is like puberty but without the acne i was thinking about hanna dorn ottos grin faded hanna what made you think of her after all of these years otto my friend theres hardly a week goes by that i dont think of her or at least what happened to her they were interrupted by the barman bringing a wheat beer for otto every time i interview a sex killer i think of voss continued fabel once the barman was gone and he felt the cloak of loud music and other voices close around them every time i read the forensic report on a rape and murder victim i think of hanna if it hadnt been for what happened to her i would never have become a policeman i wouldnt have singled out murder commission work as a career and if i hadnt read heinrich boll i wouldnt have devoted my life to books said otto thats life jan how is business asked fabel otto ran jensens buchhandlung bookstore in hamburgs elegant arkaden were clinging on i did a book launch for a sciencefiction author last week who very graciously announced that his next book would not be appearing on our shelves he is releasing it exclusively as a downloadable ebook and audio book we are he assured me finally attaining the postliterate society that many sciencefiction authors including himself had long predicted so move over i may become a copper myself otto took a large sip of his wheat beer anyway why did you suggest meeting up here its not your local any more thats why i was thinking about women said fabel gloomily do you remember when i first moved here to poseldorf when you and renate split up exactly you know otto i like to think of myself as some kind of freethinker liberated from dogma or prejudice or preconception someone who sees the world afresh from my own perspective its a pile of crap the truth is that im just as much a product of my background as anyone else just a simple parochial predictable bloody northern german lutheran when i married renate and then gabi came along i thought this is it this is my life for the rest of my life then when renate pissed off with behrens my world came apart at the seams and i ended up here in my attic flat around the corner rebuilding my life then just when i got settled here and had a real idea of where i was with everything i meet susanne and all of a sudden im living in altona and part of a couple again i know said otto with a mockingly sympathetic frown the bad beautiful woman took away your freedom how can you live without sitting on your own eating takeaway meals in front of the tv are you trying to say youre sorry you got involved with susanne no not at all what i am saying is that every step of the way theres been a woman defining the moment for me hanna gisela frohm jan i dont know where youre going with all this fabel smiled and slapped his friend on the shoulder dont look so worried otto it doesnt suit you im just i dont know its just this case im working on its all about women oh god yeah this angel of st pauli thats only part of it theres this other thing as well a female assassin probably based here in hamburg fabel caught the expression on his friends face what is it you otto made a show of being shocked you have never talked to me about a case youve been working on never im becoming indiscreet in my old age and if i cant trust you otto i dont know who the hell i can trust fabel took another sip of jever anyway at the moment everything im involved in seems to involve violent women speaking of which renate has been busting my balls as well what about gabi has expressed an interest in a police career its all my fault apparently probably is i find its best just to assume youre always in the wrong it works for me with else anyway im sure gabi has been influenced by you its not surprising that shes thinking about becoming a police officer a table became free in the corner and they took their beers across to it as fabel chatted with his friend he felt himself relax otto was one of the most clumsy and disorganised people he knew yet fabel knew that this bumbling twometretall gawky tangle of chaos had one of the sharpest minds he had ever encountered they had been friends since their first meeting and otto had the ability to puncture fabels occasional bubble of selfindulgence or selfimportance as they talked fabel became distracted there was an older man by the bar whom fabel knew he had seen before but couldnt place the man was dressed casually but everything about him reeked of wealth his white hair was immaculately groomed and he wore an expensivelooking deep blue cashmere sweater he looked out of place in the bar but fabel guessed he was here as an indulgence to his companion an exceptionally pretty woman who stood to his side and three decades behind him im guessing she went for his looks and personality otto had followed fabels gaze to the couple its called hypergamy jan the tendency for women to select partners of a higher socioeconomic level we should consider ourselves lucky that else and susanne werent too fussy theyre not a couple said fabel shes a diversion for him thats not whats bothering me its the guy im sure ive seen him somewhere before do you know him otto reached into his jacket pocket put his glasses on and leaned forward peering in the couples direction for gods sake otto fabel eased his friend back you know you said you could always become a policeman if the book trade died off forget it im guessing youd find covert surveillance difficult otto grinned call it hiding in plain sight as a matter of fact i do know him well not know him know of him thats hanskarl von birgau hes some kind of business big shot from an aristo family i cant for the life of me remember the kind of business hes in does that help not really fabel frowned i just cant remember where ive seen him before but i have somewhere maybe he doubleparked his rollsroyce and you gave him a ticket otto laughed heartily at his own joke the older man and his young consort faded from fabels thoughts when they moved through to a table at the back of the bar fabel and otto stayed in the bar for another hour or so although fabel as usual switched to alsterwasser shandies fabel suggested they get a taxi and he would drop otto off on his way back home after the warmth of the pub the night air was cold and damp the breeze had picked up into a wind which maliciously threw chilled pellets of rain in their faces fabel had called for a taxi on his cellphone and he was annoyed to see that it hadnt arrived he spotted von birgau and his youthful companion as they dashed past them from the pub lights flashed on a brandnew range rover vogue that was parked a little way down the street the man and the girl climbed in and they drove off maybe it was his daughter said otto with a wry smile a beige mercedes pulled up and fabel found himself checking its roof sign and licence number before getting in otto did most of the talking until they pulled up outside his house fabel was aware that he was tired and something was nagging away at the back of his head altona he said when the taxi driver asked him where to go after they had dropped otto off they had only travelled a few blocks when his cellphone rang fabel knew the restaurant he and susanne had eaten there once or twice over the last three years it was that kind of restaurant only the seriously rich or seriously careless with their money could afford to be regulars there it had huge picture windows that looked out across the harbour or at least it used to have huge picture windows fabel got the taxi to take him as close as it could to the restaurant the road was blocked by two huge green mowag armoured cars the word polizei emblazoned white on their angled flanks three hecklerandkocharmed mek police officers in full riot gear blocked his path fabel murder commission he showed them his id bomb looks like it chief commissar said one of the mek officers a woman it was planted in a car from what we can see is the area safe for me to go in yes chief commissar the forensics team are still in there though doing their stuff ill try and stay out of their way fabel walked down the street towards the restaurant a few of the street lights had been blown out and temporary lighting had been set up on stands to allow the police and forensic technicians to do their job the glasscovered road and pavements glittered in the arc lights as if strewn with jewels thanks for the call sepp fabel extended his hand to a tall heavily built man with a nose that looked like it had been broken more than once criminal chief commissar stephan timmermann of the polizei hamburgs antiterrorist branch shook fabels hand hi jan think nothing of it we thought it was terrorists to start with but the target was gennady frolov he has his new yacht moored in the harbour the snow queen he was in the restaurant for some kind of business meeting when his car went up and boy did it go up i remembered that memo you circulated asking for background on frolov so i thought you might be interested and gave you a shout i appreciate it sepp any fatalities unbelievably no a few injuries none too serious the restaurant had valet parking you know like the americans and they use walkietalkies to communicate from the maitre d to the carhops so that the cars or taxis are always waiting as soon as a guest exits the restaurant we reckon that by sheer chance the frequency they transmit on was the same as the remote trigger for the bomb the maitre d radios for a car and boom youve got a twoton bulletproof mercedes scattered across hamburg in bitesize pieces it must have been a big bomb said fabel the cold night air was helping him to shake off the fuzziness he still felt from his beers with otto it was said timmermann i reckon it was placed underneath the chassis the car was one of those heavy bulletproof jobs like i said and its mass actually absorbed a lot of the blast but i think that was the intention the merc was designed to withstand bullets from outside so the bomber placed the device underneath knowing that the blast energy would be concentrated in the cabin of the car its called confined detonation velocity however it still produced enough explosive brisance to shatter every window around but whoever planted this device knew there would be a limit to the shrapnelisation of the car body because it was so heavily reinforced all the injuries to bystanders are from flying glass what kind of bomb early days jan but you know well be able to put it together however if youre asking for my initial feeling it would all indicate a blast velocity of somewhere around the eightthousandmetrespersecond mark that means it wasnt tnt my moneys on militarygrade composition c or some other rdxbased explosive electrical ignition and remote radio initiation seems obvious one of the lab rats has picked up a fragment of what looks like a semiconductor very professional job except the one thing the bomber forgot to do was to build in a signal shield thats why the busboys radio set the bomb off is frolov one of the injured asked fabel no he was inside the restaurant and away from the windows one of his bodyguards was outside at the time and has had her eardrum burst martina schilmann expolizei hamburg of course you know her dont you werent you and she long time ago fabel sighed is she all right a percussive injury like that from a blast causing a burst eardrum could be nasty and it will definitely be painful but apart from that shes fine one of the carhops is in a worst state but nothing lifethreatening there either is frolov still here asked fabel yep back inside for the moment we moved him into a mowag armoured unit until we did a full sweep of the restaurant for a second bomb its an old terrorist trick set off one bomb prematurely to send a mass of people running for cover to exactly the place where theyve hidden the second bigger device but nothing were not dealing with a terrorist here fabel frowned a bomb but it doesnt fit my suspect either oh said timmermann why the bomber missed his or her target my girl doesnt miss ever the other thing is i wouldnt put a bomb down as her choice of weapon a bomb is the weapon of choice of the indiscriminate and the cowardly the terrorist at the end of the command wire or who has set the timer in advance to keep as much distance as possible between himself and potential harm without caring how many innocent people get in the way and that doesnt fit with who you had in mind no im dealing with a perfectionist a precision thinker and worker this is all too too sloppy this doesnt feel right for my girl im not too sure jan said timmermann id take issue with this not being a precision weapon the confinement of the blast and the sophistication of the explosive and the device like i said the only thing that doesnt fit with me is that the bomber didnt shield the detonator from thirdparty radio transmissions anyway said fabel i think its time i had a chat with our russki chum id do that agreed timmermann frolovs own security people are kicking up theyre all exsoviet specialforces types all theyre interested in is putting as much distance as possible between frolov and the scene then ill try not to detain him see you later sepp there was even more glass inside the restaurant than there was on the street outside fabel again had to hold up his id to an mek cop wearing a black riot suit and body armour and cradling a heckler and koch mp machine pistol the tables nearest the windows were empty and fabel noticed the strange mix of the normal and the abnormal that one always found at scenes of sudden violent crime one table had the food still in place untouched on its plates the restaurants exclusive cutlery untouched and the expensive table linen still white and crisp except for a vivid spatter of blood that had begun to spider at the edges like red ink spilled on a blotter dark droplets dotted the knockedover silver candlestick other tables had been upended either by the blast or by panicked diners rushing to seek refuge at the rear of the restaurant a man in his fifties with greying blond hair and a goatee beard sat at one of the tables at the back with a group of other men two were standing watching fabel as he approached fabel could tell from their conformation that these were not the brains of the outfit herr frolov as fabel drew near one of the bodyguards placed a restraining hand on fabels shoulder fabel looked up at the heavy and smiled im going to have you arrested if your hand is still there by the time i finish this sentence do you understand ivan the man with the goatee said something in russian to the heavy and the hand was lifted yes im herr frolov he stood up and you are fabel held up his id principal chief commissar fabel of the polizei hamburg murder commission murder but no one was frolov made a sweeping gesture with his hands that indicated the chaos in the restaurant i know more by chance than anything i have to say but my main interest in this incident is that it may be connected to some other murders and you were the target undoubtedly the russian spoke with only a slight accent and his german had the nearperfect grammar of someone who had studied the language seriously the device was placed in my car by the way you must excuse the zealousness of ivan and my other protectors as you can imagine they are rather agitated by what has happened who did it asked fabel the bomb you must have some ideas said fabel because i have so many enemies frolov smiled bitterly that would be because im a russian oligarch wouldnt it and that means of course that i cant be entirely straight scratch a russian businessman and youll expose an organised criminal isnt that right herr frolov youre doing all the talking here i didnt imply anything by my question and i know that youre not a crook ive already checked you out frolov laughed corporate crime division and organised crime both say youre clean ah but do you believe them herr fabel someone with my wealth and influence could bury a lot of embarrassing evidence under a mountain of money they have no evidence against you which doesnt mean that youre not involved with anything criminal but for what its worth ive had years of dealing with crooks and i can smell them a mile away and do i smell herr fabel frolov seemed to be trying to read something in fabels face no you dont i do not do anything that is illegal you have my word i broke the laws of the former soviet union i was a black marketeer i sold illicitly distilled vodka and dealt in prohibited luxury goods but that was the only way to do business back then my crime was to be a businessman in a society that criminalised entrepreneurship but this is not the soviet union hamburg is built on entrepreneurship i dont have to break the law to be what i am in fact i am a champion of the rule of law here like i said said fabel i believe you but you dont understand what im saying im explaining why i was targeted because you dont break the law because i scrupulously investigate every deal im potentially involved in i have any potential partner examined to the tiniest detail and if i find anything untoward i report it to the relevant authorities were you about to report something asked fabel i dont think whoever planted the bomb was sure what i was or wasnt going to discuss with olaf next week did you say olaf fabel felt something tingle on his neck the name in jespersens notebook who exactly is olaf not who what olaf is the european antifraud office olaf is an acronym of its french title office europeen de lutte antifraude of course fabel shook his head i just didnt make the connection frolov looked at fabel for a moment i take it this information has some significance for you you could say that said fabel anyway continued frolov i report anything dodgy to olaf europol eurojust or interpol i have contacts in each organisation but i have fewer and fewer opportunities to do so these days word has got out about how i operate so it tends to be only those businesses who have nothing to hide who approach me but you have something you want to talk to olaf about i arranged to send them some information and talk to them next week im guessing that this little firework display was intended to dissuade me so you think this was a warning rather than a serious attempt on your life asked fabel trust me i was not meant to die you see my death would change nothing the papers would still go to olaf with or without my presence this bomb was intended to scare me off sending the information on to olaf and from having any more discussions with them then you know whos behind it all tell me herr fabel do you have any suggestions something tells me that you might frolov smiled it was a charming smile and fabel guessed it came from the oligarchs arsenal of business weapons id rather it came from you herr frolov i have interests in every corner of europe and i was dealing with a balkanbased company my investigators came up with a connection to cigarette smuggling into the eu that in turn led us to a nongovernmental organisation which was fraudulently benefiting from eu funding while in turn funding the warehousing and distribution of contraband cigarettes smalltime stuff enough to go to all this trouble fabel indicated the shattered restaurant not in itself the smile had left frolovs face my staff includes what you would call forensic accountants and well private investigators one of the investigators died recently in a car crash he was drunk and speeding except i knew him personally a karelian called kontinen his father had died of alcoholism and kontinen was a sworn teetotaller he was also a very thorough man and a careful driver so we dug deeper kontinen had been looking into our balkan partner but had come across something much much bigger what kontinen had found out that the company in the balkans had been using a serb warlordcumgangster as a subcontractor goran vuja i c frolov stared at fabel for a moment do i sense that our paths have just crossed tell me more about vuja i c s operation said fabel first of all you need to know that kontinen had discovered that vuja i c was involved in some dirty business out there that was not connected to the company we were investigating vuja i c was as scummy as they come a drug and human trafficker who was selling women into slavery and prostitution he had been moving and warehousing the contraband cigarettes for the balkan company but he had also been subcontracting for somebody out here in the west what kind of subcontracting vuja i c ran three warehouses using women as slave labourers we tipped off the serbian authorities and vuja i c disappeared unfortunately so did the women what happened to them we dont know vuja i c moved into major drug trafficking and ended up dead in the meantime we believe he found a new location for the greenwashing operation china asked fabel our paths cross again yes western china what exactly do you mean by greenwashing one thing ive learned as a businessman is that the environment is setting the agenda these days there are a thousand and one legislative and regulatory bodies out there ready to shut you down if you breach environmental standards greenwashing is when you take action on the cheap to make it appear that youre complying green plus whitewashing equals greenwashing get it anyway one of the things you do is fake shipment manifests for sensitive waste and send it out of the regulatory zone to somewhere like an impoverished former soviet republic or china or the balkans exactly said frolov but less so the balkans nowadays democratisation and regeneration are the enemies of this kind of enterprise anyway you ship the stuff out of the regulatory zone in this case the eu and when you ship it back its been processed or it simply disappears but the point is that because its been outside the regulatory zone theres no healthandsafety or any other control on the conditions or pay of the workers so what was being greenwashed electronics mobile phones that kind of thing our investigator before he died had been in touch with a norwegian journalist who had gathered some evidence the journalist had obtained some samples from the warehouses and had got conclusive results what they were i dont know my people are still trying to trace the journalist dont bother said fabel the journalist and the analyst he sent the samples to are both dead they were getting close to proving something because the killer didnt even take the time to try and fake accidents they were both shot in the head professional executions i see frolov sighed but i know what they were testing for continued fabel polybrominated diphenyl ethers and i know where the operation was moved to hunan province in china and bitola in macedonia although i guess vuja i c had to quit macedonia too a blackuniformed mek officer came over we can move herr frolov out now chief commissar just a minute said fabel then to frolov youre their numberone target now you realise that dont you as soon as vuja i c got himself caught he had enough information to perhaps do a deal with the danish police so he was killed in copenhagen they killed your investigator then halvorsen the norwegian journalist and sparwald the analytical chemist each of them died for having part of the evidence and you have it all i guess id better keep a low profile frolov shrugged now herr fabel are you going to tell me the name of who was behind all this or shall i tell you im investigating three other murders said fabel armin lensch who worked for norivon an environmental wastemanagement company and part of the neuhansa group peter claasens a shipping agent who managed norivon traffic im guessing one or both of them tripped up over some irregularity and were killed before they got the chance to tell anyone or even work out the real significance of what they had found then there was the murder of jake westland the british rock star he was involved with this i thought that was the work of some crazed serial killer thats what you were supposed to think the truth is that westland was as careful with his investments as you are he obviously smelt a rat because of his well his ancestry i suppose youd say he would be particularly sensitive to anything that suggested the abuse of women poor bastard he was probably lured to his death thinking he was meeting someone with information so you already suspected gina bronsted asked frolov yes or at least some element within the neuhansa group trust me herr fabel look no further than bronsted you said youve developed a nose for crooks over your years as a policeman well believe me you develop the same kind of instinct when youre in business im sure you have a lot of experience with sociopaths in your line of work well so do i a certain ruthlessness a lack of empathy even a lack of conscience is positively encouraged amongst the commercially ambitious the next time you talk to gina bronsted take a long look into her eyes i promise you youll find nothing there fabel could see that frolov was sincere about what he was saying whether it was bronsted or not behind the attack it was clear that fabel had been wrong this bombing was the work of the valkyrie she had deliberately missed with the same precision with which she usually hit her target a warning timed perfectly where were you when the bomb went off he asked the russian here this was our table with things the way they are we thought it was a good idea to sit away from the window we frau schilmann an excolleague of yours shes been coordinating my security here much to the annoyance of ivan well said fabel if you dont mind well take over now consider yourself under the protection of the polizei hamburg until you leave he frowned frau schilmann suggested that you sit here yes but she went outside yes she chose the wrong moment to take a cigarette break okay said fabel with a smile lets get you somewhere safe were in a race against time fabel stood at the front of the inquiry room the screen lowered behind him the forty to fifty officers assembled were reduced to shapes edged with the light from the projector we have been keeping a murder under wraps for as long as we can drescher or gerdes as he was known lived a solitary enough life but he had neighbours knew women probably socialised with people we havent traced yet hes being missed right now and its only a matter of time before his death becomes public fabel clicked the remote the state hospital photograph of paulus came up on screen this is dreschers killer margarethe paulus dr eckhardt suggests that she is probably psychotic rather than psychopathic she is delusional but her wildest story of all happens to be true she is a valkyrie one of three highly trained and disciplined professional female assassins the names of the other two valkyries are liane kayser and anke wollner although we can be sure that neither of them have used their real name in years it looks like one of them liane kayser was either rejected in the same way margarethe was or has gone her own way under an assumed identity that leaves anke wollner who seems to be our best bet to be the valkyrie although as i say its all pretty academic these names are useless to us because the full machinery of the stasi was brought to bear on hiding them and creating new identities fabel clicked the remote and another face filled the screen this is gennady frolov hes the other reason were under pressure hes had his final warning from the valkyrie in the shape of the bomb down by the harbour now hes on borrowed time the valkyrie never misses she missed with the bomb said someone from near the back no she didnt like i said a warning another click these are the personal ads that have come out in this months issue of muliebritas we have or rather commissar wolffs friend has matched the frequency and style of all the previous ads including the telltale threeletter code that identifies each ad as a message carrier it tells the valkyrie that drescher wants to meet with her in the alsterpark next to the fahrdamm eleventhirty wednesday so if our girl has picked this message up and believes its genuinely from drescher then were in business tomorrow another click this is the alsterpark well have observers and sharpshooters on the roofs of the buildings behind the park but its a long range from that distance and we cant keep members of the public away im going to have to rely on all of you on the ground youre going to double as joggers park workers business people and well have a couple of you in uniform too the main thing is that there should be nothing to scare the valkyrie off and trust me she knows what shes looking for surely the main thing shell be looking for is drescher said anna which might be somewhat problematic not to mention smelly aha said fabel with a sense of triumph this is where our double comes in he walked over to the door opened it and called out into the corridor were ready for your closeup werner stepped into the inquiry room to cheers catcalls and laughter he was dressed in an expensive english tweed jacket that was straining at the buttons and a rollneck cashmere sweater but the real source of amusement was the greyblond wig pulled over his bristlecut scalp okay okay fabel gestured as if calming traffic settle down what youve got to remember is that shell only see him from a distance we have got to take her down fast and effectively this isnt a deranged serial killer or some hairyarsed drugs dealer settling a score i have to be honest and say that ive never dealt with a murder case like this before killing people is the valkyries trade god knows how many people shes killed but shes very very good at it now i dont expect her to come heavily armed my guess is that she wont carry a weapon routinely that way she could be caught out but remember this woman does not always need a weapon she can kill with her bare hands quickly and efficiently you could be doing more to make me feel better about this said werner with a crooked smile and thats why werner will be wearing kevlar body armour beneath his coat and jacket but ive asked that were supported by some of our specialtactics colleagues from the polizei hamburg mek unit maybe even get some help from gsg fabel paused for the collective groan im not saying that we cant handle this ourselves but im not going to lose anyone on this operation i just want us to have people there with similar training to that of our valkyrie well have a full joint briefing tomorrow morning seven am fabel clicked the remote again and gina bronsteds face came up on screen this is where it gets all political frau bronsted here is a very powerful woman with a lot of very influential friends i am also absolutely convinced that she is the person whos been commissioning the hits carried out by the valkyrie hans are you there fabel shielded his eyes against the glare of the projector and peered into the audience here jan said gessler i have arranged for all the seizure warrants youll need as soon as we take the valkyrie down you hit neuhansa with your team i need the proof that bronsted is the valkyries client fabel wound up the meeting and grabbed a coffee and sandwich in the canteen before going up to his office martina schilmann was waiting for him her hair was pulled back into a ponytail and he could see that she had a dressing in her ear she looked tired and pale and more than a little annoyed sit down martina he said with a smile how are you sore in more ways than one i got the message that you wanted to see me thats good because i wanted to see you do you realise that youve really screwed up my business what do you think you are doing telling gennady frolov that the polizei hamburg will handle his protection martina youre not that naive a serious offence was committed in the harbour last night a lot of people have been injured including you gennady frolov is the victim of an attempted murder that makes it our business not yours you should know that anyway i didnt tell him to sack you no you didnt tell him to sack me but you asked him a lot of questions about me didnt you where i was when the bomb went off why i was outside you successfully put the idea into his head that i might be involved martina stared at fabel and her scowl became a frown and then an expression of disbelief my god you really do suspect me of something i dont believe this fabel looked at the sandwich on his desk sighed and dropped it into the wastebasket its not like that martina no what is it like i dont suspect you of anything its just well you never really know someone for christs sake jan we slept together for six months this case its complicated fabel said awkwardly there are three women involved margarethe paulus liane kayser anke wollner all of them were brought up in the old gdr and they were trained as assassins and all of them were given new identities margarethe paulus is deranged and was the woman behind dreschers torture and murder liane kayser has dropped off the radar and is presumably living a normal life under an assumed name and anke wollner we believe became the valkyrie and planted the bomb last night as a warning to frolov i do not bloody believe this martinas face flushed red and her eyes glinted hard so which one do you think i am jan do you think i went outside and shattered my own eardrum by detonating the bomb at close range or do you have me down as the reincarnation of the killer whos disappeared from sight im not accusing you of anything i just wanted you to tell me what happened last night if you saw anything unusual you are a witness for gods sake i have to question you we were just about to leave said martina in a steely tone when we arrived i directed frolov and his entourage away from the windows id phoned the restaurant in advance and told them to reserve a table towards the back frolov and his business acquaintances were on to their coffees and brandies i told lorenz to stay with ivan frolovs own security guy and i went outside for a smoke the merc was parked just a little further down the street and i was telling the busboy we would need it out front when he got the message from the maitre d then boom no more merc and no more eardrum i didnt have my hands in my pockets by the way jan you can ask the busboy just in case you were wondering if i had a remote detonator stashed did you see anyone other than the busboy outside fabel ignored martinas gibe no no one within sight to set the bomb off other than the busboy oh yes and of course me martina this isnt helping frankly i dont give a shit if our protecting a potential murder victim doesnt fit in with your business plan all i want to do is to put together some kind of picture of this hit woman im asking you to think like a police officer again was there anything you saw or heard that might have been connected with the detonation martina sighed no not really except i dont think it was the radio transmission between the maitre d and the busboy that set the bomb off everything else was too professional for the detonator not to be selectively shielded fabel raised a questioning eyebrow i did a course explained martina but the other thing is that the blast was at the same time as the radio went off but not exactly not simultaneous so that fits with the bomb being a warning thats where we are with it said fabel but it still doesnt jell with me martinas earlier anger seemed to have dissipated it was all done very professionally and with great precision and that fits with this killer but thats what she is a killer sending out warnings doesnt fit mmm you could be right said fabel but like you say everything else fits maybe shes extending her service offer martina smirked moving with the times to match the needs of the market could be said fabel but if she is then thats where well nail her if she doesnt stick to what she knows best fabel was interrupted by anna wolff who came into the office without knocking she had a copy of muliebritas in her hand she tossed it onto fabels desk heres the new edition she said slamming her hand flat on the magazine our ads in it yes anna i know said fabel as if talking to an importunate child but ours isnt the only one said anna someone else is trying to communicate with the valkyrie you surround yourself with things she thought with stuff you surround yourself with things to fill the gaps at one time it had all seemed so important to have nice things like the coffee table she had had specially imported from japan or the danish hans jorgen wegnerdesigned ox chair that had cost her over six thousand euros she sat on the sofa and stared at the magazine maybe it was uncle georg who had got to her he had been so melancholic when they last had met it had disturbed her they had all called georg drescher uncle with hindsight like everything else they had done to anke liane and margarethe it had been so very carefully calculated not quite a father figure definitely not a lover an uncle an older male to whom they could turn and on whom they could always rely their trainers had tapped into adolescent female psychology to position drescher perfectly in their minds socialism didnt matter the gdr didnt matter the only thing that mattered was that they would never ever let their uncle georg down then when the world had shifted on its political axis socialism disappeared the gdr was no more even margarethe and liane by that time were no longer there margarethe was now so disturbed that she was useless as a potential agent the only thing they had achieved uncle georg had confided in anke later was to turn a seriously disturbed girl into a dangerously disturbed killing machine and liane well liane had been too perfect liane had exactly what they had been looking for a singular ruthlessness and complete disregard for others but that had also included uncle georg the stasi the state liane had learned every lesson to perfection and had been deployed in the west before they had realised their mistake liane would use the skills they had taught her exclusively to achieve her own ends that left only her anke not that she had called herself that in years she had been uncle georgs favourite after the wall had come down drescher had set up his own little enterprise sending anke out to kill people she didnt know on behalf of people she didnt know not for ideology not for state security but for cold hard cash and that had suited her fine anke had known that margarethe had been smarter and liane had been prettier but anke had had the sense to recognise a successful partnership and the partnership with uncle georg had worked out just fine but now there were hints of sentimentality creeping in with the old man and there was no room in this business for sentimentality uncle georg had kept the old cold war methods of staying in touch using the magazine for rendezvous messages there were five deadletter drops that he used throughout hamburg he had told anke that he was an old dog who had learned his last trick so long ago but anke knew the truth uncle georg used these methods to keep anke at arms length the snake charmers fear of being bitten but it was an unjustified fear uncle georg was as close to family as anke had ever known or would ever know that was not to say that she had never considered the possibility of killing him to protect her identity should he through age or for whatever other reason lose his professionalism but she knew that when the time came for them to part ways she would let him live out his retirement in peace probably she put the magazine down this made no sense at all two messages one from uncle georg and the other the other message was as wrong as it was possible to be the wrong place and the wrong time muliebritas was the signal uncle georg used to alert her that he needed to see her that he had another meeting for her to fulfil but this shouldnt be here she read it again the heavens are stained with the blood of men as the valkyries sing their song it had been their code the one they had agreed on if they ever wanted to contact each other but she had never wanted to keep in touch with the other two she had known even then that she was the only true valkyrie margarethe was mad and liane had her own agenda anke knew it couldnt be one of the other girls muliebritas had not existed back then and their plan had been compromised whoever had placed the announcement knew she would know it wasnt liane or margarethe too obvious to be a trap she looked again at the decoded message from uncle georg an appointment tomorrow she would keep it she would ask uncle georg what he made of the other message fabel and anna were on their way back from talking to gennady frolov on his yacht frolovs need for luxury equalled his desire for security so fabel had agreed to allow him to return to the yacht the compromise was the two blueandsilver police cars parked on the quay and the harbour police launch moored alongside surrounded by so much opulence fabel had found it difficult to focus on his questions they had met hans gessler from the corporate crime unit at the yacht gessler must have been more accustomed to dealing with the obscenely wealthy because he plodded through all the questions he had for the russian and his accountant a grumpy and surprisingly scruffy russian called krilof krilof had given gessler a cd containing all their files on neuhansa gina bronsted and goran vuja i c were trying to go paperless said krilof without irony or a hint of a smile on his crumpled face this is basically what were handing over to olaf its enough to bury gina bronsted for a long time fabel was heading back to the presidium when he got a call from dirk hechtner where are you chef im just passing through st georg ive got anna with me why weve just had a shout chef henk and i are taking it but its on your way well kind of a womans been strangled in an apartment in barmbeksud sounds like a little afternoon delight thats gone sour god were doing good trade these days maybe ill transfer to new york for a quieter life i take it this has nothing to do with the valkyrie case doesnt sound like it said hechtner just a good oldfashioned straightforward banal sordid murder the way they used to make em we dont even have to hunt down the killer a uniformed unit have nabbed him at the scene you want to call in ill see you there hechtner gave fabel the address in barmbek have you thought any more about my future anna spoke without turning to fabel instead staring straight ahead through the hamburg drizzle anna nows not the time if you dont mind she said id like to make it the time listen chef i dont want to beg for my job but whatever assurances you want from me im ready to make them i love this job i dont want to do anything else okay fabel drew a deep breath will you consider going on an angermanagement course youre kidding right anna you said anything it wouldnt necessarily have to be through the polizei hamburg it doesnt have to go on your permanent record but if you want to stay i insist you do it do i get a timeofthemonth allowance i do the anger management but get to go menstrualmental every four weeks this isnt a joke said fabel sorry i was winding you up ill do it thanks it was fitting weather for visiting a murder scene the sky was steelgrey and the air was clingydamp with a faint chill drizzle it turned out not to be an apartment after all but a cheap hotel with suites for rent when he pulled up outside fabel saw dirk and henk come out of the main entrance with a tall man the man had grey hair and was dressed in a long expensivelooking blue coat he was being placed handcuffed in a silver and blue police car as fabel nodded a greeting to his officers he realised he had seen the man somewhere before somewhere else where his appearance of prosperity and respectability had looked out of place his eyes met fabels briefly before a uniformed officer pressed his head down gently as he guided him into the car someone you know asked anna no said fabel ive seen him before thats all twice there were two uniformed officers at the scene an older obermeister stood at the foot of the bed while a young cop stood outside in the hall interviewing a hotel cleaner holger brauner the head of the forensics team was working with an assistant both suited up in blue coveralls and surgical gloves fabel knew the older uniformed officer a man called hanusch with twentyfive years behind him it was normal for uniform branch to team up a less experienced officer with a senior man it eased the passage of the inexperienced into the world of violence and death that was part of everyday police work unexpectedly it was the older policeman whose face had drained of colour there was a melancholic expression in the eyes that had seen so much over the years the younger officer in the hall however had had the eager electricity about him of someone high on adrenalin fabel followed the older cops gaze a pretty girl of about twenty lay on the bed her eyes stared back at the uniformed policeman bloodshot and glazed her mouth gaped slightly her lips bluish and her tongue protruding the ruptured capillaries in the skin of her neck had created delicate blue spiderweb threads fabel looked at her face and felt something lurch deep inside oh christ he said he looked back at hanusch the older uniformed cop smiled sympathetically like fabel hanusch wasnt looking at the body at this sordid scene with the eyes of a professional policeman he was looking at the broken remains of a young girl with the eyes of a father i suppose wed better inform the parents said hanusch ill get on to locating them she must have id somewhere its okay said fabel ill do it i know where they live barmbek a few blocks away fabel felt the inquisitive gazes of both anna and hanusch on him but all he said was she was going to be a doctor you know her name was christa eisel she was studying medicine at hamburg university whats up asked susanne you sound down i am just the usual ive just come from a murder scene girl of about nineteen a medical student moonlighting as a hooker some old perv strangled her my god said susanne not the girl you told me about before the one who found jake westland yes the very same i tried to tell her susanne but she wouldnt listen its not your fault jan is her death connected to the other killings no just a coincidence well not that much of a coincidence in that world thats what i tried to warn her about and i know its not my fault but i feel i dont know responsible somehow its your age jan youre at that stage in life that you start to see more and more people as sons or daughters thanks dr eckhardt thats cheered me up not only is the world going to hell but ive got one foot in the grave just about sums it up seriously though are you okay yeah im fine i just wish you werent going away tonight its only for a few days ive been promising my mother for ages will i see you before you go depends on when you get back from work but i doubt it the train leaves at seven good luck with this setup you know catching the valkyrie phone me at mums and let me know how it goes tomorrow fabel wished susanne a good trip and hung up wishing he had arranged his night out with otto for that evening instead of the night before chances were hed be working anyway with an operation like the one they were about to pull in the alsterpark there was no such thing as too much preparation fabel wandered through to the main openplan murder commission office and spoke to anna wolff has muliebritas been able to give us any more details about that other ad nope said anna theyve done their best but their records lead to a dead end somehow someone was able to hack into their database and place the ad without a trace thats the only answer its the only answer we want said anna the only other explanation is that it was someone working within muliebritas itself who placed it not impossible said fabel given that muliebritas is a neuhansaowned publication like i say were in trouble if it is an insider then theyd know about the setup tomorrow fabel made a grim face god i hope not should we call it off asked anna he thought for a moment before shaking his head decisively i dont know who placed this ad but its not the valkyrie its someone trying to establish contact weve got a week and a half before the first monday of the month which was supposed to be the prearranged meeting time if that notice appeared ive spoken to the bka federal crime office and the halberstadt police and they will help us set up surveillance for that date lets just hope we nab her tomorrow instead fabel worked late he went through all the arrangements with the team methodically then went through them again twice more before letting his officers go he sat in his office until eight pm he again went through the transcriptions of the interviews that he other officers and susanne had had with margarethe paulus the overwhelming feeling he got from reading them wasnt horror or anger or revulsion just a profound sadness the valkyrie project had been the child of another time another mindset another germany in its cold calculated ruthlessness the valkyrie project had been conceived without any thought for the girls who were selected their lives their dreams and their hopes were to be totally disregarded they were instruments of the state and nothing more in many ways the valkyrie project had been typical of every action carried out over forty years by the stasi all the girls dreams had been stifled there was something in that flicking through the interview transcripts fabel found what he was looking for a scrap of conversation in between the hard questioning principal chief commissar fabel why did they pick you and the other girls margarethe paulus we all had something they wanted or a mix of things we were all sporty we all did well at school we were all loyal to the party can i have some water interview break while water is brought for interviewee principal chief commissar fabel you said all the girls were sporty what was your sport margarethe paulus everything especially athletics but not good enough for serious competition it was different for anke though principal chief commissar fabel anke wollner why was that margarethe paulus anke and liane both had special talents liane was great at languages for example and debating but ankes talent could have got her into the olympics she was a worldclass junior skier and an excellent shot of course her speciality was the nordic biathlon but that was all stopped when she was inducted into the project fabel snatched up his desk phone when the hotel reception answered he asked to be put through to karin vestergaards room karin its jan listen im on to something of the other two valkyries anke wollner is our most likely candidate to be the one that drescher set up as his pension plan right looks that way margarethe paulus said in an interview that anke had a promising career as a worldclass athlete cut short by her induction into the valkyrie project what of it the stasi could make all of her records disappear wipe all trace of the name anke wollner off the face of the earth just as they did with the other two girls but not if she is on record outside the gdr if at any point she went with a team into another country even if it was another warsaw pact state then shell be on record maybe even a photograph its a long long shot jan replied vestergaard her name might have been on record somewhere at some time but its no use to us why do i get the feeling that thats not the only reason youre calling me the jorgen halvorsen murder it took place in drobak near oslo yes the other thing that margarethe told me was that ankes speciality was winter sport crosscountry skiing nordic biathlon nordic combined that kind of thing i still dont get imagine if you were a worldclass junior winter sportswoman growing up in the gdr late seventies early eighties what would be the biggest event the one to make the biggest impact on your consciousness the eightyfour winter olympics in sarajevo or exactly or the eightytwo nordic skiing world championships in norway and the venue was the holmenkollen ski centre in oslo like i said this is just another bit of wild speculation but what if the valkyrie is anke maybe she got a little nostalgic wanted to see the place she dreamed as a kid that she might compete in one day or simply had to kill a little time before she got down to killing halvorsen ill get on to the norwegian national police said vestergaard holmenkollen is a visitor centre and museum now maybe theyve got cctv thats what i thought thanks karin like i said its a long shot but if it gives us a face fabel called susanne on her cellphone she was already on the munich train and they chatted for a while he told her he was going to pick up something to eat on the way home and get an early night tomorrow was going to be a big day fabel ate at a caferestaurant in altona altstadt before going home he felt like taking a shower but decided to leave it until the morning he was tired and wanted to get to sleep and was worried that a shower would revive him too much and keep him awake it was about tenfifteen when he fell into a deep deep slumber he had no idea how long he had been out the boundary between sleep and wakefulness was blurred he had become vaguely aware of susanne warm and next to him he felt her breasts against his back then her mouth and tongue on his neck her hand on his flank his thigh his belly her hand was now around him caressing stroking bringing him to life his wakefulness and his arousal stirred together then his confusion susanne was away he had spoken to her on the phone he felt her tongue in his ear no not her tongue not susannes he was now suddenly fully awake he tried to spin around to see who was in the bed with him when something drew tight across his throat he couldnt breathe and his head felt suddenly light he reached up and was rewarded with a further tightening of the garrotte around his neck lie still she whispered into his ear as a lover would lie still or youll die the pressure around his throat eased yet she still held him in her other hand stroking i dont want to kill you she whispered a low breathless whisper but i will if you dont do as i tell you do you understand fabel tried to speak but the garrotte had stifled his voice he nodded his head do you know who i am he nodded again he felt the lightheadedness ease with the loosening of the ligature his mind raced and he thought about struggling fighting for his life but he knew that she would strangle him as soon as he moved i am a valkyrie her voice was soft and warm in his ear still her hand worked on him but i am not the one you are looking for do you understand that fabel was confused he moved his hand up to his throat she gave the garrotte another twist fabel felt the throb of his pulse in his neck below the ligature but not above it just pins and needles the dark world of his bedroom becoming darker redblack darker i said do you understand that he nodded i was am liane kayser i am not anke wollner anke is the one you want not me i did not work for georg drescher since the wall came down i have lived my own life i have done my own thing i am not a professional killer or at least i am not a professional killer any more and anything i might have been involved with is not your concern but i want you to understand that i still have all of the skills they taught me i could finish you right now you do understand that dont you jan fabel nodded again im going to ease the garrotte so you can talk if you do anything stupid i will tighten it again but this time all the way it has an inertia slide on it that means i can tighten it fully and walk away the ligature will be fastened tight and you wont be able to do anything to stop yourself strangling to death even i wont be able to release it if i tighten it fully do you understand once more fabel nodded feeling the ligature ease again he gasped for breath she was still touching him below stroking him take your hand off me his voice was urgent and raspy why she said you seem to be enjoying it take your hand off me now she let her hand slip away after one last long lingering stroke when you tell them when you make your report will you tell them about that about how you were hard for me about me touching you down there her hand was back on him and fabel grabbed her wrist she rewarded him by shutting off his air supply let me go she said again the ligature eased when he complied will you tell them theyll ask you if you were hard if you were enjoying it theyll ask you if you did anything to encourage me doing that if you invited me into your bed even if you didnt know who i was then theres your partner susanne will you tell her there will always be doubt people will talk behind your back there will always be a nagging doubt in the back of susannes mind she removed her hand thats what its like for women all the time every time a woman or a girl is raped or sexually assaulted thats crap the ligature made fabels voice high and tight i know the truth i dont need this halfassed demonstration ive seen so much violence against women that i know what its really like but did you enjoy it jan she kept her voice a whisper a seductive hiss in his ear did she think hed recognise her voice wondered fabel a little hand relief did you know that in victorian england society women would faint all the time it wasnt considered unusual it was put down to female hysteria it was a genuine phenomenon and do you know what it was all about fabel didnt answer she jerked on the garrotte around his throat i asked you a question no said fabel his voice a rasp sexual repression women in victorian england were not allowed to enjoy sex they were made to feel dirty if they did so the phenomenon of female hysteria became an accepted medical fact do you know how they cured it a doctor would perform a pelvic massage until the woman underwent what they called a hysterical paroxysm in other words the family doctor would offer hand relief can you believe that and all the time victorian englishmen were using prostitutes on a scale that dwarfs anything going on today we werent much better here in northern germany at least they knew a bit more about sex in the south you didnt come here to talk about victorian english or wilhelmine german sexual kinks what do you want lie on your belly do it fabel complied she forced his head sideways facing away from her if you see my face she explained ill have to kill you i came here about the notice in muliebritas what notice said fabel his cheek buried in the pillow you know what notice she twisted the ligature tight tighter than she had before when she released it fabel gasped for breath his lungs screaming for the oxygen the quote from njals saga he gasped is that what you mean did you place it no the ligature tightened again did you place it incapable of speaking fabel shook his head and again she turned his air supply back on if you didnt place it then who did i dont know fabels voice was still small and tight you said something about tomorrow what is in muliebritas that has to do with tomorrow i cant tell you i wont tell you and anyway you dont want to know its to do with anke about catching her if i tell you you become part of it all all right she said i wont interfere i want you to catch her i want this all to be over so that i can get on with my life again listen to me fabel she still whispered in his ear but this time there was nothing seductive in her tone just a hiss of menace and threat youre a policeman youve seen so much over the years youve seen so many women battered raped strangled abused so many girls and women whose last moments were spent in terror and unimaginable horror but you can imagine it cant you you have to imagine it youve looked at what other men can do to women and youve asked yourself that dark dark question am i capable of that so much pain so much fear and there have been times youve been filled with that dark dark fear what if it happened to my daughter to my partner to my mother well listen to me and remember what i tell you the valkyrie youre looking for is anke not me leave me alone dont come looking for me dont even start looking for me if you do i will target every woman close to you your lover your daughter your mother i will make them victims i will make them suffer before they die do you understand she tightened the ligature again i cant hurt them if im dead or in prison so ill make sure i get to them before you get to me if i get the slightest hint that youre on my trail ill come after them put your hands behind your head fabel did as he was told he felt something sting his neck something cold in his veins the darkness of the bedroom deepened he left the world this time wakefulness came on him like an explosion sudden complete raw fabel threw himself from the bed and slammed painfully onto the floor he leaned against the wall and pulled himself up until he was standing on shaking unsteady legs he looked around the bedroom wildly seeking out every shadow stumbling to the wall switch he flooded the room with painfully bright light she was gone he found his trousers and scrabbled through the pockets until he found the key for the secure cabinet where he kept his automatic he took the safety off and snapped back the carriage before leaving the bedroom going through the whole apartment room by room switching on the lights and sweeping each room with his gun it was only when he was sure he was alone that he went into the bathroom and surrendered to the nausea that had churned in his gut since his first moment awake whatever she had injected into him had left him with a thundering headache and a sick feeling that didnt clear even after he had vomited fabel moved over to phone the presidium but checked himself there was something he had to do first he went back into the bathroom and took a long shower holger brauner wasnt on call and it was astrid bremer who turned up a uniformed unit had been first to arrive and they had insisted on knocking up every one of fabels neighbours to find out if they had seen or heard anyone coming into the building thats totally unnecessary fabel had complained the woman who broke in here is too professional to allow herself to be seen coming or going the young uniformed commissar had smiled politely and indulgently and with total disregard for fabels rank had gone ahead and done what he felt ought to be done and he was quite right thought fabel reluctantly why on earth did you have a shower asked astrid bremer you of all people should know better than that she might have left dna traces on you whats that supposed to mean snapped fabel bremer seemed taken aback by fabels vehemence nothing just that if she had a garrotte around your neck she was pretty close to you forensic distance i mean she might have left something behind i needed to freshen up thats all the door opened and fabel nodded to werner as he came into the room i felt groggy after whatever she pumped into me i see bremer searched his expression are you okay now im fine you look shaken up jan said werner the oncall police doctor is here he wants to check you out like i said im okay raising his voice only turned up the volume of pain in fabels head okay maybe he should give me a onceover we need to find out what she injected you with said bremer the police doctor will want to do that but id like to do my own tests do you mind if i take a blood sample okay said fabel impatiently take it he rolled up his sleeve youll have to provide the doctor with a second blood sample for an hiv test standard practice for any polizei hamburg officer whos been stuck with a needle obviously its meant for accidents when searching drug users but its regulations bremer took her sample do you know which other rooms she was in apart from the bedroom i mean what are you getting at do you think i entertained her beforehand take it easy chef said werner astrids only doing her job i wasnt getting at anything herr fabel said bremer with sudden formality im sorry astrid fabel rubbed his neck its been a trying night whats the time fivetwenty said werner shit once im done with the quack you and i will have to get over to the presidium weve got to get everything set up for the sting in the alsterpark are we going ahead with that asked werner i mean i know what she told you but it would be a pretty safe bet to assume that your lady visitor was the valkyrie no werner that was liane kayser who came here last night the whole point of her visit was to let me know in no uncertain terms that she was not dreschers hit woman did she know that drescher was dead i dont know said fabel she didnt say anything to suggest she did but she definitely was sure that i would know who she was talking about when she mentioned the name drescher one things for certain shes not the valkyrie thats anke wollner liane kayser came here tonight because she has a life worth protecting she was giving nothing away well she did give one thing away if inadvertently what i have a funny feeling that she was abused as a child or a rape victim some trauma that changed her personality and made her a candidate for the valkyrie project why astrid bremer looked at fabel with a puzzled frown what gave you that idea i dont know lied fabel just a couple of things she said about how men treat women its just a feeling i get it was fabel imagined pretty much how it would be preparing a set for a movie scene everything had the semblance of normality of reality but nothing was what it seemed no one was who they were pretending to be it was odd to be there running a major operation a few hundred metres from where he used to live he knew this area so well fabel code name kaiser one was on the third floor of one of the grand villas on harvestehuder weg which looked out over the trees across the alsterpark and over the outer alster itself the polizei hamburg had been able to secure the permission of the owner a prominent hamburg businessman keen to be seen cooperating with the authorities it was the best vantage point they could find from here with the binoculars fabel could see almost everything happening within the immediate area of the fahrdamm the fahrdamm was a quay for the small red and white ferries that crisscrossed the alster hamburgs innercity lake running past the fahrdamm and along the waters edge all the way around the alster was the alsterpromenade if she came she would come along the alsterpromenade or down the treelined avenue leading from poseldorf to the fahrdamm she could park a car there fabel saw the official hamburg city works van sitting to one side of the avenue with a group of park workers standing smoking outside it the mek unit he had requested to assist them beside the ferry point was a cafebar closed at this time of day and on the other side a row of benches where people could sit and contemplate the views across the lake fabels view of the bench itself was still partly obscured even in winter by a tangle of naked tree branches a thickset figure with greying hair sat on the bench kaiser two werner fabel felt a knot in his chest werner looked too heavy for drescher the kevlar bulletproof vest was adding to his bulk what if she didnt go for it the valkyrie had been meeting with drescher like this for nearly twenty years what if she recognised the sham from a distance what if she were just to walk away realising that drescher must be either dead or in custody that her relationship with her control was compromised the thought of the valkyrie out there on her own uncontrolled and untraceable sent a chill through fabel theres a woman approaching one of the undercover officers radioed in i think she came in from milchstrasse fabel picked out the woman with his binoculars she was tall and slim but he couldnt tell her age easily and her hair was hidden by a heavy woollen hat she was carrying a shoulder bag shes heading down onto the path said the officer follow her ordered fabel werner shes going to approach from your right remember what we discussed as fabel expected and as they had arranged werner didnt reply by radio instead he opened a copy of the hamburger morgenpost and turned his back to the approaching woman resting his arm on the back of the bench as if to prop up the broadsheet newspaper shes closing in fabel said over the radio using one hand to keep the binoculars trained on her she wasnt walking quickly almost strolling herzog five close the gap between you and her i want you ready to assist kaiser two if he needs it fabel could see the officer following her further back there was a young woman in jogging gear using the railings as a bar against which to do stretching exercises anna wolff sweeping the binoculars along the path past werner he could see a man and woman dressed in smart dark coats and business wear standing having a conversation both planted police officers herzog five following the woman was a young male officer dressed casually in a blackhooded jacket he had closed the distance between him and the woman the woman stopped and leaned against the railing at the waters edge she seemed to be looking out across the alster to the distant spires that rose above the city shit said fabel in english dont stop dont stop he said under his breath willing the officer following the woman to keep walking he did he kept his step and pace unbroken and walked straight past her shes one hundred metres from the bench the officer said over the radio im going to pass kaiser two theres a bench twenty metres past him ill sit there and wait no said fabel decisively turn up the path towards milchstrasse and cut back along harvestehuder weg herzog four where are you im still in position answered anna wolff southwest corner i have the woman in sight get over there as fast as you can without drawing attention to yourself herzog six and seven stay where you are but be ready to move in he watched anna as she started jogging in the womans direction shes on the move again said anna over the radio fabel swept the binoculars along the path all units stand by the woman was now less than ten metres from werner five two she walked past him without so much as a glance in his direction do i stick with her asked anna fabel was still tracking the woman with his binoculars she greeted a man coming in the opposite direction looping her arm through his fabel watched as the couple turned off the alsterpromenade and headed off together up the avenue towards poseldorf its obviously not her shes meeting someone he felt his heart sink he knew then that she wouldnt be coming she was probably doing exactly what he was doing at that moment surveying the scene from a distance through binoculars and failing to be convinced by werners unconvincing wig and too bulky frame stay sharp fabel said into his radio shes maybe still going to show he scanned the alsterpromenade following it from the south along the waters edge and up to the fahrdamm nothing he saw werner still sitting on the bench he followed the couple walking arm in arm up the avenue and past the mek troops dressed as park workers he noticed the dark lycraclad anna jogging past them herzog four he radioed to anna loop round and take up your previous location anna didnt reply herzog four do you read me stand by over the radio he heard anna breathing hard as she ran he watched her through the binoculars she stopped jogging and leaned forward hands on her knees as if exhausted from a much longer run than her brief jog the couple arm in arm passed her anna straightened up and pressed her hands into the small of her back stretching her spine a casual gesture shewolf shewolf shewolf annas voice over the radio was so urgent and excited that fabel found himself looking at her casual figure again then the adrenalin surged into his system slowing time herzog four to kaiser one i have a visual on shewolf where where is she he shouted into the radio the couple said anna its her i cant be sure but i think shes got the guy at gunpoint i think she made kaiser two and sussed its a setup and just grabbed the guy as a decoy shit fabel cursed to himself then pressed the send button to call the mek unit wolf five it looks like we have a potential hostage situation we heard said the mek commander if it is weve got to take her before she gets out of the park and into poseldorf do we go fabel hesitated herzog four are you sure its shewolf i cant be positive kaiser one shes got a tight grip of his arm and he doesnt look happy shes pressed against him and could have a gun in his ribs wolf five to kaiser one do we go or not fabel checked anna through the binoculars she was still playing the part of a spent jogger he could see that half of the mek troops disguised as park workers had disappeared into the back of the van he followed the couple with the binoculars as they made their unhurried way out of the park if it wasnt the valkyrie he had nothing to lose if it was then she clearly knew they were on to her she would spot anyone following her into the city if fabel let her go unfollowed she might let her hostage go unharmed or not the alternative was to try to take her down in the park the chances of the hostage surviving were not good nor were the odds against one of the police team being injured or killed wolf five to kaiser one fabel could hear the impatience in the mek commanders voice i repeat do we go or not fabel lifted the radio to his mouth i didnt think youd be back today said ivonne she brought in a coffee and a pile of papers which she laid on sylvies desk how did you get on in the far east fine im close to finding who it is ive been after the person with all the answers im only back in hamburg for a few days is this the stuff yep everything you asked for all the information i could dig up on gennady frolov as well as everything i could find on the neuhansa companies you asked about and the latest copy as well as a few back numbers of the magazine you asked about the one behind the protest in the kiez the night that english pop star was murdered by the way andreas knabbe is looking for you you should answer your cellphone messages sometimes actually you should answer your cellphone sometimes ivonne made a pained face when i say herr knabbe is looking for you i mean it in an angrymobwithburningtorches way i dont think he was too happy that you werent here to cover that bomb blast down by the harbour the word is that gennady frolov was one of the diners in the restaurant frolov sylvie frowned sounds like he was probably the target what does he want knabbe i mean probably your scalp oh another thing theres been something funny going on in altona not far from where you live four days ago the street was blocked off and a pile of police were going through a couple of apartments then nothing whats the official line at the moment there isnt one theyre stalling said sylvie they wont give out misinformation so theyre trying to say nothing for as long as they can whos on the story that creep brandt is following it up ivonne wrinkled her nose in distaste you know the one who smells he couldnt find his ass with both hands far less uncover a story said sylvie anything else nope should there be its just that i was expecting a message no one called siegfried has phoned or emailed not that im aware of after ivonne had left her office sylvie began leafing through the information ivonne had compiled she was in the middle of the latest issue of muliebritas when an announcement caught her eye an extract from njals saga the heavens are stained with the blood of men as the valkyries sing their song now that she thought to herself is one hell of a coincidence he was hesitating she could sense it she knew it would be fabel head of the murder commission who would have oversight of the operation she cursed her stupidity after all these years after all the coded messages and rendezvous with uncle georg she had simply not considered that it would be a setup she should have thought it through especially that other announcement in the wrong place i have a wife and children said the man whom she held tight with her arm looped through his please dont kill me she pressed the barrel of her beretta px storm automatic harder into his ribs urging him forward with a tug on his arm if i were going to kill you youd be dead already if anything happens to you itll be the fault of the police i know what im doing they dont if you want to stay alive and see your wife and kids again then shut up and keep walking once were in the city and i can lose myself in the crowds ill let you go she kept their pace even unhurried there had been a cop behind her closing the gap as she had approached the bench that was what had alerted her first then that stupid woman pretending to be a jogger but of course she had realised from twenty metres away that it wasnt uncle georg on the bench it was a stupid clumsy setup and she had been stupid and clumsy to walk into it hes watching me now she thought my money would be somewhere in an upper storey on harvestehuder weg tilt your head close to mine she hissed at the man he was tall nearly ten centimetres taller than she was make it look like were a couple and youre talking to me maybe she thought the manoeuvre had worked maybe they had crossed her off their list and were seeking some other woman approaching alone she thought about the man on her arm the fake uncle georg had probably looked at her as she had passed but she had turned her face away as if looking out across the water only this man had seen her up close if she got out into poseldorf she would take him up a side street she didnt have the silencer on her gun so she would finish him with her knife if she got out into poseldorf they had passed a hamburg parks department van a couple of seconds ago with a group of workmen standing beside it she felt like laughing they could have thrown in at least one older or overweight cop just for appearances the workmen had special weapons and training written all over them polizei hamburg mek unit six of them body armour under overalls probably she knew that these men could move fast and could keep pace with her on a long footpursuit to become a member of the polizei hamburgs mek squad you had to be able to run three thousand metres in less than thirteen minutes thirty seconds but the body armour would slow them legs and heads if it came to it she would go for legs and heads they had a massive advantage in numbers and equipment but she had a big advantage in knowing that they would do it all by the book by numbers fabel was watching her and hesitating she knew he was every second he hesitated brought her closer to the city to streets and people once she was there she could get away and if they came after her she would create so much havoc she would lose them in a tidal wave of dead civilians the polycarbide knife the beretta three spare clips fourteen rounds each in her shoulder bag she could see straight up alsterchausee the trick was not to start rushing she kept calm kept her grip on the hostage constant and firm she was nearly there he wasnt going to call it fabel wasnt going to call it uncle georg they had uncle georg then the realisation hit her they didnt have uncle georg he was dead she dug deep into herself to feel something and she had to dig deep so little feeling she thought about the talks they had had together she thought about when she had been fifteen and he had taught her everything she knew she remembered sitting on the grass outside the training school on a summers day she had felt the sun prickle on her neck she remembered the cool orange juice they had drunk together and the few moments they had chatted uncle georg liane margarethe and her about silly inconsequential things this is a golden moment uncle georg had explained between meetings you should enjoy these moments savour them and in that golden moment she had truly felt that the other girls were her sisters that uncle georg really was her uncle she had glimpsed a life that she had never known it had been a perfect golden lie for a perfect golden moment but even in that lie she had discovered what it must have been like to have been part of a family and now uncle georg was dead for a moment in the middle of the chill hamburg winter she felt the warmth of that longgone summer afternoon she found the pain the grief that she had dug for it was then that she heard them running towards her from behind shouting for her to let her hostage go and to stand still fabel had called it after all chapter seven anke wollner spun around pulling the man she held captive in front of her as a shield she knew of course that there would be other mek and criminal police closing in behind her but the main threat would come from the front the six mek men had broken into three teams of two standard formation by the book she saw the other cop the woman dressed as a jogger she was yelling at anke to stand still anke fired twice at the woman cop hitting her in both legs she went down and started to scream anke aimed for her head but was aware of the mek officers advancing towards her three moving three covering she fired into the face of the first the others opened fire but their shots went wide they were clearly afraid of hitting her hostage she fired twice more one miss the second took off the side of an mek mans head two dead cops one heavily wounded they would pull back to avoid any civilian injury anke backed up towards harvestehuder weg keeping the hostage in front of her he was shaking violently and she was having trouble steering him checking behind she saw two cops duck down behind a parked car she fired into the windows shattering them and sending glass flying she fired three shots into the petrol tank then a round onto the asphalt where the petrol had already started pooling the sparks from the round hitting the road ignited the petrol and the rear of the car lifted into the air as the tank exploded she heard screams from behind the car and other officers came running up she could see a car screech to a halt further up harvestehuder weg stopped by a uniformed officer anke released her grip on the hostage and sprinted in the direction of the car as she did so she turned and shot the hostage once in the stomach he fell down onto the road vomiting blood onto the wet street then he started screaming they would have to deal with him as anke ran towards the car she heard automatic fire something slapped the back of her calf and she was surrounded by the angry hornet zipping of bullets around her but she kept running they had to control their fire there were houses to the left of her and a stray bullet could take out a civilian that was their numberone disadvantage she didnt care who died or was injured they had to a uniformed officer to her left turned and reached for his side arm she kept running her beretta stretched out in her rodsteady arm she fired twice and hit the uniformed cop who she knew would not be bodyarmoured twice in the chest the driver of the car sat gawpmouthed anke ripped open the driver door and pulled the driver a young woman from the vw polo anke then shot her in the legs another casualty to slow things up she slammed the polo into gear and reversed at high speed up harvestehuder weg there were more shots and the windscreen shattered but anke didnt turn if they were going to hit her they would her only chance was to get away as fast as possible she spun the car into a degree skid on the wet street and floored the accelerator again she could see blue lights in her rearview mirror they were chasing her the one thing about a police chase uncle georg had told her is that the police will almost always win make them think theyre in a vehicle pursuit and then get out of the vehicle as quickly as possible she took the corner at poseldorfer weg at high speed tyres screeching turning sharp right into a side street a culdesac she pulled into the kerb reversing to park normally behind another car she saw the blue lights flash past the road end a second police car slowed down almost to a halt at the end of the culdesac obviously checking it out before taking off after the first car anke got out of the car as quickly as she could but found her leg was stiffening up she could feel the wet in her shoe and inside her trouser leg she couldnt look now she needed to get away put as much distance as possible as quickly as possible between herself and the car she still had her shoulder bag strapped across her chest she released the empty magazine from the berettas grip and slammed in a full one she walked without limping along the quiet street and took a sudden left turn through the gate of one of the houses she could see it was a substantial villa that had been converted into apartments she walked up to the main door as if she had done so every day in her life and checked the names on the buzzer board there was an apartment with two different surnames it was by no means guaranteed but she guessed it was lived in by an unmarried couple without kids probably a younger couple they would probably be out at work she pressed the buzzer no answer which was what she wanted she then proceeded to press every buzzer until she got an answer an older womans voice delivery said anke the door lock was buzzed open anke pushed open the door and shoved the toe of her boot in to stop it closing completely she pressed the old womans buzzer again sorry she said wrong address i thought this was poseldorfer weg after listening to the old womans complaints anke let herself in and eased the door quietly shut behind her she stood for a moment and caught her breath listening out for the sounds of a suspicious old woman on the stairwell when she was convinced she was alone she climbed the stairs to the first floor she found the flat she was looking for and picked the lock once inside she checked every room to make sure that the flat was really empty she looked down at the wooden floor she had left bloody footprints all along the hall that meant there was a trail all the way up the stairs and probably from the car even if it wasnt visible it would be very easy for a police sniffer dog to follow she would have to be quick going through to the bedroom she checked out the womans wardrobe she was a size bigger than anke but that didnt matter a size smaller would have been useless anke laid out a range of trousers jumpers and jackets on the bed and made a quick selection from them she also found a shoulder bag to replace her own smaller but it would do the bathroom was small and anke had to lean against the wall as she eased out of her shoes trousers and tights leaving a pool of blood on the tiled floor she turned her calf to examine the wound the bullet had not lodged in her leg but had carved its passage by gouging out a chunk of flesh there was no bath but anke was able to take down the shower head and run hot water over the wound before wrapping a towel tight around her calf she found the bathroom cabinet and tipped everything out into the basin she took a second towel and doused it with antiseptic there was a bandage still in its wrapper but no other dressings she went into the bedroom again and went through the drawers until she found a packet of sanitary pads which she took back through to the bathroom anke removed the towel from her leg and pushed the antisepticsoaked pad into the wound the pain exploded hot and sharp and she suppressed a scream into an inhuman sound caged behind her tightly clenched teeth applying two sanitary pads to the wound she bound them in place with the bandage when she was finished she washed her hands and the sweat from her face there was a photograph on the dresser presumably of the couple who lived in the flat the woman was tall and slim like anke and didnt look a full size bigger but she had dark hair and an olive tone to her skin anke reckoned her makeup would be heavier and darker than that which anke normally used and she spent five minutes in front of the mirror completely changing her face with a few strokes of the womans makeup brush she then changed into the clothes shed laid out putting on a pair of kneelength boots under her trousers it was a struggle to get the left boot zipped up over the wound but anke reckoned the boot would help keep the dressing tight and in place once she had put on the change of clothes including an anklelength coat and a beretstyle hat anke looked at herself in the mirror a different woman with a different style a different history a different life before leaving the flat anke tried to work out what to do with her discarded clothes her dna would be all over them but there again she thought her dna was now all over half of hamburg there was no forensic distance this time it was over she knew that uncle georg was dead or captured she had to get out of hamburg she had identities she could use she had enough money to live on for the rest of her life maybe this could be a new beginning the next twentyfour hours would tell she put the beretta the magazines her polycarbide knife and the box of sanitary pads into her shoulder bag she went over to the window and checked out the street below it seemed quiet but she could hear the sound of sirens in the streets all around she was going to have to walk through it all and out of poseldorf and then she would be free fabel had watched it all he had stood and watched as anna had been gunned down he had seen the flashes then anna crumple to the ground he should have stayed where he was but without thinking he found himself running down the stairs and out onto the street screaming into the radio for an ambulance by the time he got to anna there were already two mek officers tending to her applying firstaidkit pressure pads to the wounds in her legs werner was there too brushing the hair away from her face fabel felt sick as he saw the crimson bloom on the white gauze of the pressure pads anna he dropped to his knees beside her anna im so sorry her face was pale almost grey her breathing was shallow and short but she shook her head and smiled weakly not your fault mine im ready for that angermanagement course now the ambulance arrived and the paramedics set to work on her ordering werner and fabel to stand back dietz the mek commander approached them what the hell were you doing fabel screamed in his face how the fuck did you allow this to happen i brought you into this because this is exactly what i didnt want to happen he pointed in the direction of the paramedics working on anna before you start shooting your mouth off fabel id remind you that two of my men are dead two more critical from burns this isnt my fuckup its yours why the hell didnt you give us the sayso to take her down before she got to the road she knew that we would have to choose our shots if she got between us and occupied buildings there he jabbed a gloved finger in the direction of the park thats where our chances were best werner now without his wig placed his considerable bulk between them pack it in for gods sake this isnt helping jan weve got three more down the hostage is critical shot in the gut weve got a dead uniform and another wounded civilian its a mess all right have we found the car yet no it cant be that hard the windscreens shot out this bitch isnt going to be scared into a panicked flight said fabel my guess is shes dumped the car very close and stolen another i want the control room at the presidium to alert us to any stolen cars in a fivekilometre radius or a damaged polo being abandoned in the meantime get every mobile unit to check alleyways side streets disused sites anywhere she might have dumped it but im pretty sure well find it close by and have every woman walking alone stopped and questioned minimum two officers and extreme caution theres something else said dietz im pretty sure i hit her theres some blood on the road further up where she ran i think i got her in the leg shell have tried to find somewhere to get fixed up shes still here werner weve got to find her poseldorf was one of hamburgs trendiest addresses the property was expensive and the shops and restaurants exclusive but poseldorf had started off as hamburgs poor quarter and the layout was a tangle of cobbled streets anke used as many alleys and access lanes as possible even clambering over walls to avoid using the main streets she found herself on hallerstrasse near the tv studio and the rotherbaum tennis stadium the street was lined with cars but most were expensive newer models with complicated immobiliser and alarm systems she walked on she would have to walk back to where she had left her own car she needed to get it out of the area before it was treated as an abandoned vehicle giving the police a positive id and address for her but she had parked far enough away from the alsterpark to feel relatively secure it was a decision that she regretted now with every step she took her calf throbbed and her entire leg began to ache a result of the sudden and severe muscular contraction after the bullet had hit it would not have been too long a walk if she had been able to continue straight along mittelweg but she knew that the police would by now be stopping almost every woman walking alone so she was forced to take the most circuitous route more than tripling the distance she had to cover anke felt an enormous relief when she turned the corner and saw her lexus saloon parked where she had left it she sank into the leather seat and stretched her injured leg out straight allowing herself a moment to rest she eased her hand up the back of her boot and felt the wet leather when she got back to the apartment she was going to have to stitch the wound which given its position would not be easy leaning her head back against the seat anke closed her eyes for a moment she turned suddenly when she heard someone knocking on the side window anke smiled and slid the window open she assessed the situation young policewoman very young alone foot patrol inexperienced every one else hunting the killer from the alsterpark is this your vehicle yes it is is there a problem youve been parked here too long ill have to give you a ticket whats your name please youre checking my name against the database thought anke youve already radioed in the index number itll be flagged up later her identity her address all compromised jana eigen she gave the name shed been living under for the last ten years a name that had become as real to her as anke wollner now it was lost may i see your id card and drivers licence the young policewoman was trying hard to project authority anke estimated she was no older than twentythree pretty with dark hair under the police cap her blue police jacket was a size too big for her giving her an almost childlike appearance sure said anke reaching into the shoulder bag sitting next to her on the passenger seat here it is ankes first shot hit the policewoman in the throat she dropped beside the car anke swung the door open but it jammed against the policewomans body and she had to squeeze out hurting her leg as she did so the young policewoman was face down the oversized blue waterproof jacket bunched up like a turtles carapace with the word polizei emblazoned on it in white a sickeningly wet gurgling sound issued from her and she was trying to crawl away anke fired a second round into the back of the policewomans head and she lay still there were screams from onlookers and anke knew that shed have to move fast the policewomans body obstructed the car so anke had to drag it out into the road then she jumped back in the car and sped off she would have to dump the car she would have to find a safe place it was pretty much what fabel had expected van heiden had not been angry nor had he lectured fabel but he had communicated more by silences than words that things could not be worse and if the axe fell then it would fall squarely on fabels neck what hadnt helped had been the media attention accounts of the shootings on harvestehuder weg were repeated on every news bulletin on every channel and not just in hamburg the presidium was like a medieval castle under siege with satellitedishtopped vans parked outside and tv crews pointing their cameras at the building fabel even got a message that sylvie achtenhagen had been trying to get in touch with him she said its very urgent the cop at reception had told him i bet she did said fabel scrunching up the note leaning over the reception desk and dropping it into the wastebasket after leaving van heiden fabel phoned werner at the hospital hows anna still in theatre said werner ill phone as soon as she comes out and i hear anything try not to worry jan shes tougher than either of us after fabel hung up there was a knock on the door and dirk hechtner came in you okay chef i mean i know what you mean im okay thanks for asking what have you got the gun recovered from margarethe pauluss apartment weve traced it it used to be owned by a zlatko ljubi i c a croatian and listen to this ljubi i c was arrested during the same sting as goran vuja i c he was vuja i c s bodyguard where is he now im chasing that up said hechtner the danish police had to let him go its not illegal to be a gangsters bodyguard unless you can be nailed for doing something illegal yourself he worked in copenhagen as a security guard for a while after that i dont know yet but its a hell of a coincidence that theres a vuja i c connection after all anything else yeah i checked out svend langstrup gina bronsteds head of security no form but hes a former officer in the jgerkorpset thats the danish special forces he has dual nationality danish and german langstrup ran his own security company for a while and yes im way ahead of you im checking with the danish police to see if it was his company that zlatko ljubi i c worked with from what i can see hes on a huge salary he lives out in blankenese okay keep on it im heading down to the ops room the operations room was more crowded than usual and fabels heart sank when he saw both van heiden and police president steinbach amongst the other officers for fabel having his superiors present when he was trying to run an inquiry was like having a teacher peer over your shoulder while you did your homework but he could tell by van heidens face that his badnews day had just got worse weve lost another one said van heiden the bitch has killed another police officer who a young female officer called annika busing she was twentyfour jan where rotherbaum henk hermann joined them his long thin freckled face pale and grim beneath a mop of red hair he checked his notebook the car was a black lexus gsh saloon six months old the owner is a jana eigen she lives in blankenese wealthy looks like it and not at home okay henk you and dirk take the rotherbaum murder ill head over to the address weve got for frau eigen he turned to van heiden ive got all of my team committed i could do with someone to come to blankenese with me ill do it said van heiden do you have a service weapon of course i do said van heiden then less indignantly but its in my locker ill go get it if you dont mind id like to take karin vestergaard along with us ive sent a car to pick her up she has a vested interest in seeing this concluded were not the only ones to have lost colleagues fabel was aware of another figure at his shoulder he turned to see hans gessler of the corporate crime division i heard about anna jan he said im really sorry how is she im waiting for word i just wanted to let you know that ive been through frolovs information on gina bronsted and neuhansa weve got enough there to nail her but not for these murders theres no direct evidential link but shes toast as far as tax evasion falsification of permits and fraud are concerned i want her theres got to be something that ties her in with ordering these valkyrie hits not from her end maybe if we could find dreschers bank accounts ill look into it but it could be a numbered account in switzerland see what you can do hans give me something anything it wasnt the ideal day for a walk by the beach the water of the elbe frothed and snapped at the bitter wind that whipped at it and the dull steelgrey fog that smothered it he had his fists rammed deep into his coat pockets and a woollen hat pulled tight over his ears but he walked unbowed his wet and chilled face full into the wind he had walked here two summers ago with his wife they had talked then about the future about how maybe the time was right to have kids he stopped and watched the fogfudged outline of a freighter slide by further out in the elbe in the deep channel just beyond nesssand the naturereserve island the freighter was dark and massive in the gloom and as it passed it sounded its horn a low plaintive dinosaur cry in the fog he had just turned back into the wind to continue his walk when he saw a figure ahead of him another shadow in the grey gloom the figure was standing still staring out at the ship or at nothing he drew close he saw the profile now and the wisps of blonde hair from under the woollen hat a woman hello the woman gave a start and turned to face him her hands snapped out of her pockets and she held them at her side for a moment he thought she was going to attack him im sorry he said i didnt mean to startle you walking she said i was just walking are you all right she gazed at him blankly and for a moment he was struck by how terribly empty her expression was then she smiled im sorry she said yes you did startle me not your fault the fog are you sure youre all right the concern in his voice was genuine she shrugged selfdeprecatingly truth is ive got a bit lost i parked the car somewhere she waved her gloved hand vaguely along strandweg in the direction of the ferry pier i needed some fresh air a walk i didnt account for the fog being so thick its not a night for walking on the beach he said then what are you doing she smiled at him again he noticed for the first time how pretty she was totally different from silke his wife but very pretty i live near here i know where im walking she looked up to where blankenese loomed in the fog a dark mass punctuated by yellow lights you live here yes just over there he pointed could you walk me back to the path then please she asked ive actually lost where i came through the wall onto the beach certainly he said he held out his hand my names svend langstrup im birta birta henningsen they had just parked outside the villa in blankenese when they got the message that jana eigens car had been discovered in woods south of sulldorf my god said fabel thats just north of here walking distance jana eigen is anke wollner asked vestergaard and anke wollner is the valkyrie he pulled his automatic from its holster and checked the magazine shit shes come back theres something in the house that she needs he turned to van heiden horst weve got to make sure shes not in here we could wait until reinforcements arrive they didnt do much good in the alsterpark lets go fabel gestured for van heiden to wait and reached into the glove compartment he took out a sigsauer automatic in a holster and wrapped in a shoulder harness he held the weapon out to karin vestergaard but did not release it when she took it instead he turned again to van heiden what the hell said van heiden with a shrug vestergaard took the gun took off her coat and slipped on the holster before snapping back the carriage on the automatic and reholstering it by blankenese standards it was quite a modest property three bedrooms two bathrooms a dining room kitchen and lounge all of which were unoccupied their sweep of the house was made even more stressful by the urgent shrieking of the alarm that fabel had set off when he had forced the door once they were satisfied that anke wollner was not at home fabel phoned the presidium and asked that a forensic team be sent out to check out the house and for gods sake get on to commissariat twentysix in osdorf and let them know that its a false alarm fabel said and get them to send someone out to switch the damned thing off they searched the house every drawer every wardrobe every cupboard fabel pulled down the extendable ladder and checked out the attic at first sight there was nothing no arms cache no briefcase full of currency and passports none of the accoutrements of a professional killer like georg dreschers flat this house felt unlivedin everything in the house was expensive and tasteful yet there was no sense of permanent habitation about the place as if it were an extended hotel room rather than a home thats a hans jorgen wegner ox chair said vestergaard danish very danish even more expensive its not here fabel spoke loudly to be heard over the din of the house alarm whatever it is she came back for its not here not in this house i dont get it at all a change of car maybe suggested vestergaard the alarm shut off and they reholstered their guns could be i suppose said fabel in which case shes moved on already but she knows this address is compromised i dont think she would risk coming back here for a car that would also be registered to this place he heard the sound of vehicles pulling up outside three uniformed officers arrived with a man in overalls fabel told them to make sure nothing was disturbed more than it had already been by their search and informed them that the forensics team was on its way so you think shes still in blankenese asked van heiden if she dumped the car and came here on foot then she has a purpose fabel went over to the uniformed commissar who had arrived with the alarm engineer youre from pk in osdorf yes herr principal chief commissar can you get on to the commissariat and tell them we need as many bodies as possible down here right now were searching for a woman called anke wollner who lived in this house under the name jana eigen something akin to shock crossed the young commissars face my god you mean the person who killed those cops in the city centre you think shes here just get on to osdorf and get people out here fabel turned back to vestergaard and van heiden why would she come back i know im repeating myself but it doesnt make sense we can assume that she has several alternative identities up her sleeve and we failed to contain her at the crime scene she could presumably disappear into thin air she must have worked out by now that somethings happened to georg drescher fabel froze they gave him up what asked van heiden hold on fabel used his cellphone to call the presidium and asked to speak to hans gessler hes left for the evening said the duty officer on the other end then patch me through to his cellphone there was a pause fabel covered the mouthpiece and spoke to van heiden and vestergaard they gave drescher up it was gina bronsted who hired the valkyrie all these years drescher had enough on bronsted to send her away for life it would be his pension policy when bronsted was tidying up the loose ends of westland claasens and lensch she had already planned to tidy up frolov and drescher too she used the other valkyrie mad margarethe paulus to do her dirty work it was bronsted who provided margarethe with all of the cash and resources she needed but she never did anything directly he held up his hand and turned his attention back to his cellphone hi hans its fabel where did you say svend langstrup lived what oh blankenese do you have the address i think its somewhere just behind strandweg hold on after a few moments gessler came back with the address shes here to kill svend langstrup said fabel once hed hung up and then if im right shell go after gina bronsted langstrup brought the wine through to the lounge anke sat on the rug in front of the fire and watched the flames the fires glow accentuated the perfect sweep of her cheek and jawline and added gold to her pale blonde hair warmer mmm i am now she murmured contentedly despite the persistent nagging of her leg wound anke looked around the room she took a full mouthful of wine her eyes fell on a silverframed photograph on a side table in it langstrup and an attractive woman with strawberryblonde hair stood together in a garden they both faced the camera and langstrup embraced her his arms wrapped around her shoulders they both wore smiles his one of complete contentment joy the womans was different as if she wasnt really there behind the smile it was something that anke recognised your wife he nodded but did not look at the photograph yes thats silke shes very pretty yes where is she tonight i dont think shed approve of you bringing strange women in from the beach and plying them with drink silke had problems mentalhealth issues he stared into his wine glass depression she committed suicide oh god im so sorry i shouldnt have asked you werent to know it was a natural enough question langstrup said and took a long sip of white wine it was two years ago the police said it was unclear whether it was accidental death or suicide she didnt leave a note you see is that why you were down by the water i dont know yes maybe anke looked at the photograph again at the mask of a smile pulled over a void i really am so sorry said anke and she stood up i know what its like to lose someone like that do you im sorry to hear that my uncle she took another sip of wine and gazed at the fire i know it doesnt sound much but he was more than my uncle more like a father my parents well my parents werent around and he brought me up taught me everything i know all that i am i owe to him he died recently yes she placed the wine glass down on the coffee table and turned to face him square on langstrup looked up at her quizzically is everything all right the doorbell rang excuse me he said he stood up and shrugged apologetically i dont get many visitors but tonight the ringing of the doorbell became insistent then banging on the door langstrup frowned and made towards the hall as soon as langstrup turned his back to her anke leapt forward the black polycarbide knife arced round and caught him in the side of the neck she locked his head with the other arm and used her weight to drag him down onto the floor but he was strong and skilled his elbow slammed into her ribs and they crashed into the coffee table the knife was still in his neck but she had misjudged it and obviously had missed the carotid she could hear the front door being kicked in she let go of langstrup and leapt to her feet slightly off balance because of the wound in her calf the front door flew open and banged against the hall wall she snapped the beretta from the waistband of her skirt langstrup rolled over clutching the hilt of the knife rammed into his neck his small hard eyes now wild and full of terror the way she had wanted it the three police officers burst into the living room and aimed their weapons at her screaming at her to drop the gun she recognised one of them as jan fabel who had headed the operation in the alsterpark she knew the woman was karin vestergaard the boss and former lover of jens jespersen whom anke had killed in his hotel room anke had a choice she knew that take them on or finish langstrup she looked at the two men and a woman at the door their faces were tight and anxious she smiled at them its not so bad she wanted to tell them dont be scared killing really isnt so bad the adrenalin in her system slowed everything down she felt for a moment outside time she thought about liane and margarethe she thought again about uncle georg she thought about all the meetings she had had all the last moments she had shared anke wollner made her decision she fired four shots into langstrup all of them into his head before the police opened fire outside afterwards fabel vestergaard and van heiden sat together in the back of a police bus with blackedout windows it was an oasis of quiet while outside a maelstrom of police forensics and press swirled around them are you okay fabel asked them both but his question was aimed more at van heiden who sat grimfaced his elbows resting on his knees and his gaze fixed at some spot on the floor of the bus why do i get the feeling that weve just participated in an assisted suicide asked van heiden we did what we had to do said vestergaard we would have been next i guess that ties up the valkyrie case said van heiden to fabel yes i suppose it does said fabel other than nailing the person who instigated and paid for all of this mayhem gina bronsted but vestergaard read the doubt in fabels face anke wollner killed halvorsen in norway probably vuja i c in copenhagen westland lensch claasens and sparwald here in hamburg i know why and for whom she killed fabel frowned but we still dont know who the original angel of st pauli was it doesnt make sense that it was wollner and as i know only too well from the house call she made on me theres a third valkyrie out there liane kayser who is clearly leading a normal life and has nothing to do with all this said van heiden maybe so but she made it very clear to me that she is more than willing to kill to protect that life fabel shrugged and stood up anyway i have a hospital visit to make anna wolff asked van heiden anna wolff said fabel i need to talk to her about her future epilogue i it stung it stung like hell but fabel knew that he had to let it go but one day he swore he would get enough on her to put her away for good he glared at the television monitor in the murder commissions main office he glared at two faces he knew isnt this an embarrassment for the neuhansa group asked sylvie achtenhagen and an indictment of you personally that you employed and trusted a man who turned out to be a criminal someone who ordered and paid for the murders of so many people the first thing i want to make clear is this said gina bronsted with a smile that suggested she was talking to children the corporate crime division of the polizei hamburg has placed me and all of my business dealings under the very closest scrutiny and there is absolutely no evidence to suggest that i knew anything about svend langstrups criminal activities he was obviously running his own covert empire within the neuhansa group it is true that he got away with this for some time but there was no way werner switched off the tv with the remote dont eat yourself up over that bitch jan he said youve got to let it go shell be caught out sooner or later i believe the guys at corporate crime are as determined to nail her as you are and olaf said fabel grimly and okokrim in norway and the danish national police gina bronsted is going to have to tread very carefully from now on what about this firstmondayofthemonth deal you know the message in muliebritas thats monday coming are we going to stake it out no point said fabel three valkyries one dead one back in a mental institution and the third will do anything other than attract attention to herself true werner chuckled maliciously anyway she comes round to yours if she wants a chat fabel shot him a look and werner gathered up some papers from his desk and left the office once werner was gone fabel picked up the phone and punched in a number hello frau meissner jan fabel here i got your invitation to talk to the sabine charity about the polizei hamburgs initiative on violence against women id be delighted to ii the last meeting of the day had gone on late they had arranged for caterers to bring food in and eventually they had been able to crack open a bottle of champagne to seal the deal after all the negative publicity gina bronsted had had to do some tough negotiating and make some firm assurances but things were back on track because the meeting had gone on so late bronsted had decided to stay over in her penthouse above the offices truth was she loved it here with the huge windows looking over the harbour and out towards where they were building the new opera house she poured herself a glass and drank in the view and the champagne at the same time she was going to own this city one day and copenhagen something caught her eye reflected in the window glass she spun around what are you doing here bronsteds tone was more puzzled than angry how did you get in do you know who i am asked the blonde woman standing in the middle of bronsteds living room what the hell do you mean real anger now of course i know who you are now will you tell me what the hell you are doing here i have nothing more to say to you do you know my name asked the woman of course i know your name have you lost bronsteds voice trailed off her focus was now fixed on the gun that the woman had lifted out from the folds of her black coat my name isnt what you think it is my name my real name is liane kayser i am a valkyrie you know all about the valkyries dont you gina i bronsteds expression turned from realisation to fear listen i can give you work you mean you can use me the way you used margarethe and anke do you know the funny thing is that i didnt know i cared i thought i was incapable of feeling anything for anybody but i do care they were the closest thing i had to family but i am going to do something for you gina i know you like making the news im going to make you news tomorrow you will be big news i promise you i can make this right for you bronsteds eyes darted around the room the panic button the phone both a universe away you know gina youre right you can make it right for me liane kayser pulled the trigger twice the shots muffled by the suppressor attached to the makarov pm automatic bronsted fell to the ground she was breathing in short rapid gasps the blonde woman took a few steps closer do you know what the word valkyrie actually means it comes from the old norse valkyrja it means chooser of the slain she pulled the trigger twice more head shots goodbye gina iii it had changed so much since she had last been here halberstadt was somewhere sylvie achtenhagen had visited as a young girl that had been back then of course before the wall came down the city hadnt made much of an impact on the young sylvie it had looked pretty much like every other gdr town or small city she had visited halberstadt had been bombed flat at the very end of the second world war four weeks before the german surrender had been signed many suspected that the bombing had been a final vindictive act of vengeance whatever the motive the british had with full moral vigour and righteous zeal all but wiped the pretty little city off the face of the earth and had completely destroyed the medieval heart of halberstadt then with equally full moral vigour and righteous zeal the communist government of the gdr had rebuilt it as a workers city ugly plattenbau concrete housing blocks had crowded around the citys cathedral and all that was old or traditional had been replaced with the modern and functional and then the wall had come down and halberstadt had been reclaimed by its people halberstadt is a city without suburbs it sits selfcontained on a grassy plain before the harz mountains as she drove towards it sylvie had the impression of a fairytale picturebook town its red roofs halftimbered buildings and the spires of the cathedral and the martinikirche sitting prettily and perfectly in its landscape setting but it was as she navigated the town itself that she saw the real differences that had been made since she had last been there the monolithic plattenbau apartment blocks were mostly gone and the medieval altstadt had been faithfully restored and the square in front of the cathedral had again been opened out allowing the majesty of the building to breathe and be appreciated it was as if this small city had been given its soul back the hotel was a converted eighteenthcentury mansion in the heart of the city and sylvies room was highceilinged and woodpanelled furnished with what looked like genuine antiques sylvie found it disconcerting to sit in baroque luxury in the heart of a city that she had only ever known as part of the communist past she had put so far behind her from her cellphone she called the number she had been given frau achtenhagen yes meet me in the cathedral treasury in fifteen minutes ill find you helmut kittel was a wreck of a man he was tall but his shoulders had become rounded and his chest hollowed his skin tone was a jaundiced grey and his hair thin and dull he had followed sylvie out of the cathedral treasury and had sat next to her on the bench in the gardens by the cathedral i got your message said sylvie i knew you would he smiled did you see the news about gina bronsted i did his breathing was wet and rattling you realise that it was the work of the third socalled valkyrie the one whose name you say you know i admit that the information is now very valuable you have proof of the identity of the third valkyrie kittel broke into a spasm of coughing deep racking coughs that made his eyes water after it had passed he leaned back against the bench breathing hard and deep as if at some extreme oxygendeprived altitude cancer sylvie asked without malice he shook his head emphysema too many cigarettes the cold seems to make it worse well the information youve got is newsworthy very newsworthy and the more newsworthy the more well pay for it he smiled bitterly and you make the news dont you do you have the file or not sylvie failed to keep the impatience from her voice there were twelve girls to begin with kittel said they narrowed it down to three but then in the final stages of training they had to reject one of the final three liane kayser they realised they couldnt rely on her she had sociopathic tendencies they said you couldnt tell to look at her to talk to her apparently but they realised that she was incapable of serving anyone but herself that she would do anything kill anyone just so that she would achieve what she wanted to achieve he turned to her and smiled no frau achtenhagen i dont have the file there is no file other than the photographs i sent you im the only person who knows who liane kayser is i see she said still smiling and letting her eyes range over his face as if she were trying to read it i saw you interviewed once on tv he continued breathily you were talking about being a television journalist today how its not enough to be passive waiting for events or for a story to land in your lap i remember you said that you have to make the news yourself almost the angel of st pauli case really did make your name didnt it no one had the inside angle on it that you seemed to have always one step ahead of the others you really did make the news didnt you liane i know youre the angel of st pauli and i know you did it to boost your tv career im also pretty sure it was anke who carried out the last series of killings im guessing that drescher told her to make it look like it was your work that you were back again so where is the file i told you there is no file kittel laughed and his laughing caused him to cough violently again clasping his handkerchief to his mouth when the coughing subsided and he took the handkerchief away she noticed it was speckled bright red we both knew it would come to this liane the fact that youre here the fact that you knew where to come when you saw the announcement in muliebritas does it hurt terribly she asked looking at the bloodflecked handkerchief sometimes he nodded and the promise and the fear of the pain burned in his eyes they destroyed all the files the only one who knows about your real identity is me he smiled no arrogance just a sad almost childish smile i knew youd come i knew youd find me i dont want to die fighting for breath i want the pain and the fear to go away i dont want to be afraid any more sylvie smiled and gently pushed back a strand of hair from his damp brow she leaned close and whispered into his ear i know helmut i know it was nice to hear you call me liane no one has called me that in years now no one ever will thank you for that helmut as she spoke to him soothingly and without menace kittel felt something push upwards into his chest he felt suddenly breathless in a way that he had not before but there was little pain he stared into her eyes first in surprise but without fear then with something that looked like gratitude its better this way helmut she said easing the long needle out from under his ribcage and allowing his heart to rupture no more pain no more sweaty frightened nights racked with coughing ive taken away your pain for ever sylvie achtenhagen checked that there was no one around and stood up swiftly walking off towards the park exit behind her a thin middleaged man sat on the bench staring unblinking past the leafless trees across to the double braced spires of the martinikirche
