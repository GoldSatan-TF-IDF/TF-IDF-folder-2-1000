iain m banks the state of the art road of skulls the rides a little bumpy on the famous road of skulls my god whats happening sammil mc cried waking up the cart he and his companion had hitched a ride on was shaking violently mc put his grubby hands on the plank of rotten wood which formed one of the carts sides and looked down at the legendary road wondering what had caused the carts previously merely uncomfortable rattling to become a series of bonejarring crashes he expected to discover that they had lost a wheel or that the snoozeprone carter had let the vehicle wander right off the road into a boulderfield but he saw neither of these things he stared goggleeyed at the road surface for a moment then collapsed back inside the cart golly he said to himself i didnt know the empire ever had enemies with heads that big retribution from beyond the grave thats what this is he looked forward the carts senile driver was still asleep despite the vehicles frenzied bouncing beyond him the lopeared old quadruped between the shafts was having some difficulty finding its footing on the oversized skulls forming that part of the road which led mc let his eyes follow the thin white line into the distance to the city it lay on the horizon of the moor a shimmering blur most of the fabled megalopolis was still below the horizon but its sharp glittering towers were unmistakable even through the blue and shifting haze mc grinned as he saw it then watched the silent struggling horsething as it clopped and skidded its way along the road it was sweating heavily and beset by a small cloud of flies buzzing around its earflapping head like bothersome electrons around some reluctant nucleus the old carter woke up and lashed inaccurately at the nag between the shafts then nodded back into his slumber mc looked away and gazed out over the moor usually the moor was a cold and desolate place wrapped in wind and rain but today it was blisteringly hot the air reeked of marsh gases and the heath was sprinkled with tiny bright flowers mc sank back into the straw again scratching and squirming as the cart bucked and heaved about him he tried shifting the bundles of straw and the heaps of dried dung into more comfortable configurations but failed he was just thinking that the journey would seem very long and be uncomfortable indeed if this outrageous juddering went on when the crashes died away and the cart went back to its more normal rattling and squeaking thank goodness they didnt hold out too long mc muttered to himself and lay down again closing his eyes he was driving a haycart down a leafy lane birds were chirping the wine was cool money weighed in his pocket he wasnt quite asleep when his companion whose name despite their long association mc had never bothered to find out surfaced from beneath the straw and dung beside him and said retribution eh what mc said startled what retribution oh mc said rubbing his face and grimacing as he squinted at the sun high in the bluegreen sky the retribution inflicted upon us as subjects of the reign by the deceased enemies of the beloved empire the small companion whose spectacular grubbiness was only partially obscured by a covering of debatably less filthy straw blinked furiously and shook his head no me mean what retribution mean i just told you mc complained getting back at somebody oh said the companion and sat mulling this over while mc drifted off to sleep again there were three young milkmaids walking ahead of his haycart he drew level and they accepted a ride he reached down to his companion dug him in the ribs like when me take too many bedclothes and you kick i out of bed or me drink your wine and you make i drink three guts of laxative beer or when you pregnanted that governors daughter and him set the strategic debt collectors on you or someplace doesnt pay all its taxes and its majesty orders the first born of every family have their birth certificates endorsed or mc who was well used to his companion employing the verbal equivalent of a reconnaissance by fire held up one hand to stem this flood of examples his companion continued mumbling away despite the hand over his mouth finally the mumbling stopped yes mc told him thats right he took his hand away or is it like when hey mc said brightly how about i tell you a story oh a story beamed his companion clutching at mcs sleeve in anticipation a story would be his grimy features contorted like a drying mudflat as he struggled to find a suitable adjective nice ok let go my sleeve and pass me the wine to wet my throat oh mcs companion said and looked suddenly wary and doubtful he glanced over the front of the cart past the snoring driver and the toiling beast pulling them and saw the city still just a distant shimmer at the end of the roads bleached ribbon of bone ok he sighed he handed the wineskin to mc who guzzled about half of what was left before the squealing protesting companion succeeded in tearing it from his grasp spilling most of the remainder over the two of them and squirting a jet of the liquid spattering over the neck of the snoring driver and on out as far as the head of the horselike animal which lapped appreciatively at the drops spilling down its sweatmatted face the decrepit driver woke with a start and looked around wildly rubbing his damp neck waving his frayed whip and apparently fully expecting to have to repel robbers cutthroats and villains mc and his companion grinned sheepishly at him when he turned to look down at them he scowled dried his neck with a rag then turned round and relapsed into his slumber thanks mc told his companion he wiped his face and sucked at one of the fresh wine stains on his shirt the companion took a careful dainty sip of wine then twisted the stopper firmly back into the gut and placed it behind his neck as he lay back mc belched yawned yes his companion said earnestly tell i a story me would love to hear a story tell i a story of love and hate and death and tragedy and comedy and horror and joy and sarcasm tell i about great deeds and tiny deeds and valiant people and hill people and huge giants and dwarfs tell i about brave women and beautiful men and great sorcerorcerors and about unenchanted swords and strange archaic powers and horrible sort of ghastly things that uhm shouldnt be living and ahm funny diseases and general mishaps yeah me like tell i me want mc was falling asleep again having had not the slightest intention of telling his companion a story in the first place the companion prodded him in the back hey he prodded harder hey the story no go to sleep what about the story fornicate the story mc said sleepily not opening his eyes waa the companion said the carter woke up turned round and clipped him across the ear the companion went quiet and sat there rubbing the side of his head he prodded mc again and whispered you said youd tell me a story oh read a book mumbled mc snuggling into the straw the small companion made a hissing noise and sat back his lips tight and his little hands clenched under his armpits he glared at the road stretching back to the wavering horizon after a while the companion shrugged reached under the wineskin for his satchel and took out a small fat black book he prodded mc once more all weve got is this bible he told him what bit should me read just open it at random mc mumbled from his sleep the companion opened the bible at random chapter six and read yeah yeah yeah verily i say unto you forget not that there are two sides to every story a right side and a wrong side the companion shook his head and threw the book over the side of the cart the road went ever on the carter snuffled and snored the sweating nag panted and struggled while mc smiled in his sleep and moaned a little his companion passed the time by squeezing blackheads from his nose and then replacing them they had stopped at the ford through the shady brook where the milkmaids were eventually persuaded to come for a swim dressed only in their thin clinging actually the horselike beast pulling the cart was the famous poetscribe abrusci from the planet wellitisntmarkedonmychartlieutenant and she could have told the bored companion any number of fascinating stories from the times before the empires pacification and liberation of her homeworld she could also have told them that the city was moving away from them across the moor as fast as they moved towards it trundling across the endless heath on its millions of giant wheels as the continuous supply of vanquished enemies of the empire provided more trophies to be cemented into place on the famous road of skulls but that like they say is another story a gift from the culture money is a sign of poverty this is an old culture saying i remember every now and again especially when im being tempted to do something i know i shouldnt and theres money involved when is there not i looked at the gun lying small and precise in cruizells broad scarred hand and the first thing i thought after where the hell did they get one of those was money is a sign of poverty however appropriate the thought might have been it wasnt much help i was standing outside a nocredit gambling club in vreccis low city in the small hours of a wet weeknight looking at a pretty toylike handgun while two large people i owed a lot of money to asked me to do something extremely dangerous and worse than illegal i was weighing up the relative attractions of trying to run away theyd shoot me refusing theyd beat me up probably id spend the next few weeks developing a serious medical bill and doing what kaddus and cruizell asked me to do knowing that while there was a chance id get away with it uninjured and solvent again the most likely outcome was a messy and probably slow death while assisting the security services with their enquiries kaddus and cruizell were offering me all my markers back plus once the thing was done a tidy sum on top just to show there were no hard feelings i suspected they didnt anticipate having to pay the final instalment of the deal so i knew that logically what i ought to do was tell them where to shove their fancy designer pistol and accept a theoretically painful but probably not terminal beating hell i could switch the pain off having a culture background does have some advantages but what about that hospital bill i was up to my scalp in debt already whats the matter wrobik cruizell drawled taking a step nearer under the shelter of the clubs dripping eaves me with my back against the warm wall the smell of wet pavements in my nose and a taste like metal in my mouth kaddus and cruizells limousine idled at the kerb i could see the driver inside watching us through an open window nobody passed on the street outside the narrow alley a police cruiser flew over high up lights flashing through the rain and illuminating the underside of the rain clouds over the city kaddus looked up briefly then ignored the passing craft cruizell shoved the gun towards me i tried to shrink back take the gun wrobik kaddus said tiredly i licked my lips stared down at the pistol i cant i said i stuck my hands in my coat pockets sure you can cruizell said kaddus shook his head wrobik dont make things difficult for yourself take the gun just touch it first see if our information is correct go on take it i stared transfixed at the small pistol take the gun wrobik just remember to point it at the ground not at us the drivers got a laser on you and he might think you meant to use the gun on us come on take it touch it i couldnt move i couldnt think i just stood hypnotized kaddus took hold of my right wrist and pulled my hand from my pocket cruizell held the gun up near my nose kaddus forced my hand onto the pistol my hand closed round the grip like something lifeless the gun came to life a couple of lights blinked dully and the small screen above the grip glowed flickering round the edges cruizell dropped his hand leaving me holding the pistol kaddus smiled thinly there that wasnt difficult now was it kaddus said i held the gun and tried to imagine using it on the two men but i knew i couldnt whether the driver had me covered or not kaddus i said i cant do this something else ill do anything else but im not a hitman i cant you dont have to be an expert wrobik kaddus said quietly all you have to be is whatever the hell you are after that you just point and squirt like you do with your boyfriend he grinned and winked at cruizell who bared some teeth i shook my head this is crazy kaddus just because the thing switches on for me yeah isnt that funny kaddus turned to cruizell looking up to the taller mans faceand smiling isnt that funny wrobik here being an alien and him looking just like us an alien and queer cruizell rumbled scowling shit look i said staring at the pistol it this thing it it might not work i finished lamely kaddus smiled itll work a ships a big target you wont miss he smiled again but i thought they had protection against lasers and kinetics they can deal with wrobik this is something different i dont know the technical details i just know our radical friends paid a lot of money for this thing thats enough for me our radical friends this was funny coming from kaddus probably he meant the bright path people hed always considered bad for business just terrorists id have imagined hed sell them to the police on general principles even if they did offer him lots of money was he starting to hedge his bets or just being greedy they have a saying here crime whispers money talks but therell be people on the ship not just you wont be able to see them anyway theyll be some of the guard naval brass some administration flunkeys secret service agents what do you care about them kaddus patted my damp shoulder you can do it i looked away from his tired grey eyes down at the gun quiet in my fist small screen glowing faintly betrayed by my own skin my own touch i thought about that hospital bill again i felt like crying but that wasnt the done thing amongst the men here and what could i say i was a woman i was culture but i had renounced these things and now i am a man and now i am here in the free city of vreccis where nothing is free all right i said a bitterness of my mouth ill do it cruizell looked disappointed kaddus nodded good the ship arrives ninthday you know what it looks like i nodded so you wont have any problems kaddus smiled thinly youll be able to see it from almost anywhere in the city he pulled out some cash and stuffed it into my coat pocket get yourself a taxi the undergrounds risky these days he patted me lightly on the cheek his hand smelt of expensive scents hey wrobik cheer up yeah youre going to shoot down a fucking starship itll be an experience kaddus laughed looking at me and then at cruizell who laughed too dutifully they went back to the car it hummed into the night tyres ripping at the rainfilled streets i was left to watch the puddles grow the gun hanging in my hand like guilt i am a light plasma projector model lpp series two constructed in a at manufactury six in

generalpurpose peacerated weapon not suitable for full battle use its design and performance parameters are based on the recommendations of the gun sat on the table telling me all about itself in a high tinny voice while i lay slumped in a lounger staring out over a busy street in vreccis low city underground freight trains shook the rickety apartment block every few minutes traffic buzzed at street level rich people and police moved through the skies in fliers and cruisers and above them all the starships sailed i felt trapped between these strata of purposeful movements far in the distance over the city i could just see the slender shining tower of the citys lev tube rising straight towards and through the clouds on its way to space why couldnt the admiral use the lev instead of making a big show of returning from the stars in his own ship maybe he thought a glorified elevator was too undignified vainglorious bastards all of them they deserved to die if you wanted to take that attitude but why did i have to be the one to kill them goddamned phallic starships not that the lev was any less pricklike and anyway no doubt if the admiral had been coming down by the tube kaddus and cruizell would have told me to shoot it down holy shit i shook my head i was holding a long glass of jahl vreccis citys cheapest strong booze it was my second glass but i wasnt enjoying it the gun chattered on speaking to the sparsely furnished main room of our apartment i was waiting for maust missing him even more than usual i looked at the terminal on my wrist according to the time display he should be back any moment now i looked out into the weak watery light of dawn i hadnt slept yet the gun talked on it used marain of course the cultures language i hadnt heard that spoken for nearly eight standard years and hearing it now i felt sad and foolish my birthright my people my language eight years away eight years in the wilderness my great adventure my renunciation of what seemed to me sterile and lifeless to plunge into a more vital society my grand gesture well now it seemed like an empty gesture now it looked like a stupid petulant thing to have done i drank some more of the sharptasting spirit the gun gibbered on talking about beamspread diameters gyroscopic weave patterns gravitycontour mode lineofsight mode curve shots spatter and pierce settings i thought about glanding something soothing and cool but i didnt i had vowed not to use those cunningly altered glands eight years ago and id broken that vow only twice both times when i was in severe pain had i been courageous id have had the whole damn lot taken out returned to their humannormal state our original animal inheritance but i am not courageous i dread pain and cannot face it naked as these people do i admire them fear them still cannot understand them not even maust in fact least of all maust perhaps you cannot ever love what you completely understand eight years in exile lost to the culture never hearing that silky subtle complexly simple language and now when i do hear marain its from a gun telling me how to fire it so i can kill what hundreds of people maybe thousands it will depend on where the ship falls whether it explodes could primitive starships explode i had no idea that was never my field i took another drink shook my head i couldnt do it i am wrobik sennkil vreccile citizen number i always forget its on my papers male prime race aged thirty parttime freelance journalist between jobs at the moment and fulltime gambler i tend to lose but i enjoy myself or at least i did until last night but i am also still bahllneuchersa wrobich vress schennil dam flaysse citizen of the culture born female species mix too complicated to remember aged sixtyeight standard and onetime member of the contact section and a renegade i chose to exercise the freedom the culture is so proud of bestowing upon its inhabitants by leaving it altogether it let me go even helped me reluctant though i was but could i have forged my own papers made all the arrangements by myself no but at least after my education into the ways of the vreccile economic community and after the module rose dark and silent back into the night sky and the waiting ship i have turned only twice to the cultures legacy of altered biology and not once to its artefacts until now the gun rambles on i abandoned a paradise i considered dull for a cruel and greedy system bubbling with life and incident a place i thought i might find what i dont know i didnt know when i left and i dont know yet though at least here i found maust and when i am with him my searching no longer seems so lonely until last night that search still seemed worthwhile now utopia sends a tiny package of destruction a casual accidental message where did kaddus and cruizell get the thing the culture guards its weaponry jealously even embarrassedly you cant buy culture weapons at least not from the culture i suppose things go missing though there is so much of everything in the culture that objects must be mislaid occasionally i took another drink listening to the gun and watching that watery rainyseason sky over the rooftops towers aerials dishes and domes of the great city maybe guns slip out of the cultures manicured grasp more often than other products do they betoken danger they signify threat and they will only be needed where there must be a fair chance of losing them so they must disappear now and again be taken as prizes that of course is why theyre built with inhibiting circuits which only let the weapons work for culture people sensible nonviolent nonacquisitive culture people who of course would only use a gun in selfdefence for example if threatened by some comparative barbarian oh the selfsatisfied culture its imperialism of smugness and even this gun is antique not obsolescent for that is not a concept the culture really approves of it builds to last but outdated hardly more intelligent than a household pet whereas modern culture weaponry is sentient the culture probably doesnt even make handguns any more ive seen what it calls personal armed escort drones and if somehow one of those fell into the hands of people like kaddus and cruizell it would immediately signal for help use its motive power to try and escape shoot to injure or even kill anybody trying to use or trap it attempt to bargain its way out and destruct if it thought it was going to be taken apart or otherwise interfered with i drank some more jahl i looked at the time again maust was late the club always closed promptly because of the police they werent allowed to talk to the customers after work he always came straight back i felt the start of fear but pushed it away of course hed be all right i had other things to think about i had to think this thing through more jahl no i couldnt do it i left the culture because it bored me but also because the evangelical interventionist morality of contact sometimes meant doing just the sort of thing we were supposed to prevent others doing starting wars assassinating all of it all the bad things i was never involved with special circumstances directly but i knew what went on special circumstances dirty tricks in other words the cultures tellingly unique euphemism i refused to live with such hypocrisy and chose instead this honestly selfish and avaricious society which doesnt pretend to be good just ambitious but i have lived here as i lived there trying not to hurt others trying just to be myself and i cannot be myself by destroying a ship full of people even if they are some of the rulers of this cruel and callous society i cant use the gun i cant let kaddus and cruizell find me and i will not go back head bowed to the culture i finished the glass of jahl i had to get out there were other cities other planets besides vreccis id just had to run run and hide would maust come with me though i looked at the time again he was half an hour late not like him why was he late i went to the window looking down to the street searching for him a police apc rumbled through the traffic just a routine cruise siren off guns stowed it was heading for the outworlders quarter where the police had been making shows of strength recently no sign of mausts svelte shape swinging through the crowds always the worry that he might be run over that the police might arrest him at the club indecency corrupting public morals and homosexuality that great crime even worse than not making your payoff and of course the worry that he might meet somebody else maust come home safely come home to me i remember feeling cheated when i discovered towards the end of my regendering that i still felt drawn to men that was long ago when i was happy in the culture and like many people i had wondered what it would be like to love those of my own original sex it seemed terribly unfair that my desires did not alter with my physiology it took maust to make me feel i had not been cheated maust made everything better maust was my breath of life anyway i would not be a woman in this society i decided i needed a refill i walked past the table will not affect the linestability of the weapon though recoil will be increased on powerpriority or power decreased shut up i shouted at the gun and made a clumsy attempt to hit its off button my hand hit the pistols stubby barrel the gun skidded across the table and fell to the floor warning the gun shouted there are no userserviceable parts inside irreversible deactivation will result if any attempt is made to dismantle or quiet you little bastard i said and it did go quiet i picked it up and put it in the pocket of a jacket hanging over a chair damn the culture damn all guns i went to get more drink a heaviness inside me as i looked at the time again come home please come home and then come away come away with me i fell asleep in front of the screen a knot of dull panic in my belly competing with the spinning sensation in my head as i watched the news and worried about maust trying not to think of too many things the news was full of executed terrorists and famous victories in small distant wars against aliens outworlders subhumans the last report i remember was about a riot in a city on another planet there was no mention of civilian deaths but i remember a shot of a broad street littered with crumpled shoes the item closed with an injured policeman being interviewed in hospital i had my recurring nightmare reliving the demonstration i was caught up in three years ago looking horrified at a wall of drifting sunstruck stun gas and seeing a line of police mounts come charging out of it somehow more appalling than armoured cars or even tanks not because of the visored riders with their long shockbatons but because the tall animals were also armoured and gasmasked monsters from a readymade massproduced dream terrorizing maust found me there hours later when he got back the club had been raided and he hadnt been allowed to contact me he held me as i cried shushing me back to sleep wrobik i cant risarets putting on a new show next season and hes looking for new faces itll be bigtime straight stuff a high city deal i cant leave now ive got my foot in the door please understand he reached over the table to take my hand i pulled it away i cant do what theyre asking me to do i cant stay so i have to go theres nothing else i can do my voice was dull maust started to clear away the plates and containers shaking his long graceful head i hadnt eaten much partly hangover partly nerves it was a muggy enervating midmorning the tenements conditioning plant had broken down again is what theyre asking really so terrible maust pulled his robe tighter balancing plates expertly i watched his slim back as he moved to the kitchen i mean you wont even tell me dont you trust me his voice echoed what could i say that i didnt know if i did trust him that i loved him but only he had known i was an outworlder that had been my secret and id told only him so how did kaddus and cruizell know how did bright path know my sinuous erotic faithless dancer did you think because i always remained silent that i didnt know of all the times you deceived me maust please its better that you dont know oh maust laughed distantly that aching beautiful sound tearing at me how terribly dramatic youre protecting me how awfully gallant maust this is serious these people want me to do something i just cant do if i dont do it theyll theyll at least hurt me badly i dont know what theyll do they they might even try to hurt me through you that was why i was so worried when you were late i thought maybe theyd taken you my dear poor wrobbie maust said looking out from the kitchen it has been a long day i think i pulled a muscle during my last number we may not get paid after the raid stelmers sure to use that as an excuse even if the filth didnt swipe the takings and my ass is still sore from having one of those queerbashing pigs poking his finger around inside me not as romantic as your dealings with gangsters and baddies but important to me ive enough to worry about youre overreacting take a pill or something go back to sleep itll look better later he winked at me disappeared i listened to him moving about in the kitchen a police siren moaned overhead music filtered through from the apartment below i went to the door of the kitchen maust was drying his hands they want me to shoot down the starship bringing the admiral of the fleet back on ninthday i told him maust looked blank for a second then sniggered he came up to me held me by the shoulders really and then what climb the outside of the lev and fly to the sun on your magic bicycle he smiled tolerantly amused i put my hands on his and removed them slowly from my shoulders no i just have to shoot down the ship thats all i have they gave me a gun that can do it i took the gun from the jacket he frowned shaking his head looked puzzled from a second then laughed again with that my love i doubt you could stop a motorized pogostick with that little maust please believe me this can do it my people made it and the ship the state has no defence against something like this maust snorted then took the gun from me its lights flicked off how do you switch it on he turned it over in his hand by touching it but only i can do it it reads the genetic makeup of my skin knows i am culture dont look at me like that its true look i showed him i had the gun recite the first part of its monologue and switched the tiny screen to holo maust inspected the gun while i held it you know he said after a while this might be rather valuable no its worthless to anyone else itll only work for me and you cant get round its fidelities itll deactivate how faithful maust said sitting down and looking steadily at me how neatly everything must be arranged in your culture i didnt really believe you when you told me that tale did you know that my love i thought you were just trying to impress me now i think i believe you i crouched down in front of him put the gun on the table and my hands on his lap then believe me that i cant do what theyre asking and that i am in danger perhaps we both are we have to leave now today or tomorrow before they think of another way to make me do this maust smiled ruffled my hair so fearful eh so desperately anxious he bent kissed my forehead wrobbie wrobbie i cant come with you go if you feel you must but i cant come with you dont you know what this chance means to me all my life ive wanted this i may not get another opportunity i have to stay whatever you go go for as long as you must and dont tell me where youve gone that way they cant use me can they get in touch through a friend once the dust has settled then well see perhaps you can come back perhaps ill have missed my big chance anyway and ill come to join you itll be all right well work something out i let my head fall to his lap wanting to cry i cant leave you he hugged me rocking me oh youll probably find youre glad of the change youll be a hit wherever you go my beauty ill probably have to kill some knifefighter to win you back please please come with me i sobbed into his gown i cant my love i just cant ill come to wave you goodbye but i cant come with you he held me while i cried the gun lay silent and dull on the table at his side surrounded by the debris of our meal i was leaving fire escape from the flat just before dawn over two walls clutching my travelling bag a taxi from general thetropsis avenue to intercontinental station then id catch a railtube train to bryme and take the lev there hoping for a standby on almost anything heading out either trans or inter maust had lent me some of his savings and i still had a little highrate credit left i could make it i left my terminal in the apartment it would have been useful but the rumours are true the police can trace them and i wouldnt put it past kaddus and cruizell to have a tame cop in the relevant department the station was crowded i felt fairly safe in the high echoing halls surrounded by people and business maust was coming from the club to see me off hed promised to make sure he wasnt followed i had just enough time to leave the gun at left luggage id post the key to kaddus try to leave him a little less murderous there was a long queue at left luggage i stood exasperated behind some naval cadets they told me the delay was caused by the porters searching all bags and cases for bombs a new security measure i left the queue to go and meet maust id have to get rid of the gun somewhere else post the damn thing or even just drop it in a waste bin i waited in the bar sipping at something innocuous i kept looking at my wrist then feeling foolish the terminal was back at the apartment use a public phone look for a clock maust was late there was a screen in the bar showing a news bulletin i shook off the absurd feeling that somehow i was already a wanted man face liable to appear on the news broadcast and watched todays lies to take my mind off the time they mentioned the return of the admiral of the fleet due in two days i looked at the screen smiling nervously yeah and youll never know how close the bastard came to getting blown out of the skies for a moment or two i felt important almost heroic then the bombshell just a mention an aside tacked on the sort of thing theyd have cut had the programme been a few seconds over that the admiral would be bringing a guest with him an ambassador from the culture i choked on my drink was that who id really have been aiming at if id gone ahead what was the culture doing anyway an ambassador the culture knew everything about the vreccile economic community and was watching analyzing content to leave ill enough alone for now the vreccile people had little idea how advanced or widely spread the culture was though the court and navy had a fairly good idea enough to make them slightly though had they known it still not remotely sufficiently paranoid what was an ambassador for and who was really behind the attempt on the ship bright path would be indifferent to the fate of a single outworlder compared to the propaganda coup of pulling down a starship but what if the gun hadnt come from them but from a grouping in the court itself or from the navy the vec had problems social problems political problems maybe the president and his cronies were thinking about asking the culture for aid the price might involve the sort of changes some of the more corrupt officials would find terminally threatening to their luxurious lifestyles shit i didnt know maybe the whole attempt to take out the ship was some loony in security or the navy trying to settle an old score or just skip the next few rungs on the promotion ladder i was still thinking about this when they paged me i sat still the station pa called for me three times a phonecall i told myself it was just maust calling to say he had been delayed he knew i was leaving the terminal at the apartment so he couldnt call me direct but would he announce my name all over a crowded station when he knew i was trying to leave quietly and unseen did he still take it all so lightly i didnt want to answer that call i didnt even want to think about it my train was leaving in ten minutes i picked up my bag the pa asked for me again this time mentioning mausts name so i had no choice i went to information it was a viewcall wrobik kaddus sighed shaking his head he was in some office anonymous bland maust was standing pale and frightened just behind kaddus seat cruizell stood right behind maust grinning over his slim shoulder cruizell moved slightly and maust flinched i saw him bite his lip wrobik kaddus said again were you going to leave so soon i thought we had a date yes yes i said quietly looking at mausts eyes silly of me ill stick around for a couple of days maust i the screen went grey i turned round slowly in the booth and looked at my bag where the gun was i picked the bag up i hadnt realized how heavy it was i stood in the park surrounded by dripping trees and worn rocks paths carved into the tired topsoil led in various directions the earth smelled warm and damp i looked down from the top of the gently sloped escarpment to where pleasure boats sailed in the dusk lights reflecting on the still waters of the boating lake the duskward quarter of the city was a hazy platform of light in the distance i heard birds calling from the trees around me the aircraft lights of the lev rose like a rope of flashing red beads into the blue evening sky the port at the levs summit shone still uneclipsed in sunlight a hundred kilometres overhead lasers ordinary searchlights and chemical fireworks began to make the sky bright above the parliament buildings and the great square of the inner city a display to greet the returning victorious admiral and maybe the ambassador from the culture too i couldnt see the ship yet i sat down on a tree stump drawing my coat about me the gun was in my hand on ready ranged set i had tried to be thorough and professional as though i knew what i was doing id even left a hired motorbike in some bushes on the far side of the escarpment down near the busy parkway i might actually get away with this so i told myself anyway i looked at the gun i considered using it to try and rescue maust or maybe using it to kill myself id even considered taking it to the police another slower form of suicide id also considered calling kaddus and telling him id lost it it wasnt working i couldnt kill a fellow culture citizen anything but in the end nothing if i wanted maust back i had to do what id agreed to do something glinted in the skies above the city a pattern of falling golden lights the central light was brighter and larger than the others i had thought i could feel no more but there was a sharp taste in my mouth and my hands were shaking perhaps i would go berserk once the ship was down and attack the lev too bring the whole thing smashing down or would part of it go spinning off into space maybe i ought to do it just to see i could bombard half the city from here hell dont forget the curve shots i could bombard the whole damn city from here i could bring down the escort vessels and attacking planes and police cruisers i could give the vreccile the biggest shock theyve ever had before they got me the ships were over the city out of the sunlight their laserproof mirror hulls were duller now they were still falling maybe five kilometres up i checked the gun again maybe it wouldnt work i thought lasers shone in the dust and grime above the city producing tight spots on high and wispy clouds searchlight beams faded and spread in the same haze while fireworks burst and slowly fell twinkling and sparkling the sleek ships dropped majestically to meet the welcoming lights i looked about the treelined ridge alone a warm breeze brought the grumbling sound of the parkway traffic to me i raised the gun and sighted the formation of ships appeared on the holo display the scene noonbright i adjusted the magnification fingered a command stud the gun locked onto the flagship became rocksteady in my hand a flashing white point in the display marked the centre of the vessel i looked round again my heart hammering my hand held by the fieldanchored gun still nobody came to stop me my eyes stung the ships hung a few hundred metres above the state buildings of the inner city the outer vessels remained there the centre craft the flagship stately and massive a mirror held up to the glittering city descended towards the great square the gun dipped in my hand tracking it maybe the culture ambassador wasnt aboard the damn ship anyway this whole thing might be a special circumstances setup perhaps the culture was ready to interfere now and it amused the planning minds to have me a heretic push things over the edge the culture ambassador might have been a ruse just in case i started to suspect i didnt know i didnt know anything i was floating on a sea of possibilities but parched of choices i squeezed the trigger the gun leapt backwards light flared all around me a blinding line of brilliance flicked seemingly instantaneously from me to the starship ten kilometres away there was a sharp detonation of sound somewhere inside my head i was thrown off the tree stump when i sat up again the ship had fallen the great square blazed with flames and smoke and strange bristling tongues of some terrible lightning the remaining lasers and fireworks were made dull i stood shaking ears ringing and stared at what id done latereacting sprinterceptiles from the escorts crisscrossed the air above the wreck and slammed into the ground automatics fooled by the sheer velocity of the plasma bolt their warheads burst brightly among the boulevards and buildings of the inner city a bruise upon a bruise the noise of the first explosion smacked and rumbled over the park the police and the escort ships themselves were starting to react i saw the lights of police cruisers rise strobing from the inner city the escort craft began to turn slowly above the fierce flickering radiations of the wreck i pocketed the gun and ran down the damp path towards the bike away from the escarpments lip behind my eyes burnt there i could still see the line of light that had briefly joined me to the starship bright path indeed i thought and nearly laughed a bright path in the soft darkness of the mind i raced down to join all the other poor folk on the run odd attachment depressed and dejected his unrequited love like a stony weight inside him fropome looked longingly at the sky then shook his head slowly and stared disconsolately down at the meadow in front of him a nearby grazer cub eating its way across the grassy plain with the rest of the herd started cuffing one of its siblings normally their master would have watched the pretended fight with some amusement but today he responded with a low creaking noise which ought to have warned the hotblooded little animals one of the tumbling cubs looked up briefly at fropome but then resumed the tussle fropome flicked out a vinelimb slapping the two cubs across their rumps they squealed untangled and stumbled mewling and yelping to their mothers on the outskirts of the herd fropome watched them go then with a rustling noise very like a sigh returned to looking at the bright orange sky he forgot about the grazers and the prairie and thought again about his love his ladylove his darling the one for whom he would gladly climb any hillock wade any lakelet all that sort of thing his love his cruel cold heartless uncaring love he felt crushed driedup inside whenever he thought of her she seemed so unfeeling so unconcerned how could she be so dismissive even if she didnt love him in return youd have thought at least shed be flattered to have somebody express their undying love for her was he so unattractive did she actually feel insulted that he worshipped her if she did why did she ignore him if his attentions were unwelcome why didnt she say so but she said nothing she acted as though all hed said everything hed tried to express to her was just some embarrassing slip a gaffe best ignored he didnt understand it did she think he would say such things lightly did she imagine he hadnt worried over what to say and how to say it and where and when hed stopped eating he hadnt slept for nights he was starting to turn brown and curl up at the edges foodbirds were setting up roosts in his nestraps a grazer cub nuzzled his side he picked the furry little animal up in a vine lifted it up to his head stared at it with his four front eyes sprayed it with irritant and flung it whimpering into a nearby bush the bush shook itself and made a grumbling noise fropome apologized to it as the grazer cub disentangled itself and scuttled off scratching furiously fropome would rather have been alone with his melancholy but he had to watch over the grazer herd keeping them out of acidcloys pitplants and digastids sheltering them from the foodbirds stupespittle and keeping them away from the ponderously poised boulderbeasts everything was so predatory couldnt love be different fropome shook his withered foliage surely she must feel something theyd been friends for seasons now they got on well together they found the same things amusing they held similar opinions if they were so alike in these respects how could he feel such desperate feverish passion for her and she feel nothing for him could this most basic root of the soul be so different when everything else seemed so in accord she must feel something for him it was absurd to think she could feel nothing she just didnt want to appear too forward her reticence was only caution understandable even commendable she didnt want to commit herself too quickly that was all she was innocent as an unopened bud shy as a moonbloom modest as a leafwrapped heart and pure as a star in the sky fropome thought as pure and as remote he gazed at a bright new star in the sky trying to convince himself she might return his love the star moved fropome watched it the star twinkled moved slowly across the sky gradually brightening fropome made a wish on it be an omen be the sign that she loves me perhaps it was a lucky star hed never been superstitious before but love had strange effects on the vegetable heart if only he could be sure of her he thought gazing at the slowly falling star he wasnt impatient he would gladly wait for ever if he only knew she cared it was the uncertainty that tormented him and left his hopes and fears toingandfroing in such an agonizing way he looked almost affectionately at the grazers as they plodded their way around him looking for a nice patch of uneaten grass or a yukscrub to defecate into poor simple creatures and yet lucky in a way their life revolved around eating and sleeping with no room in their lowbrowed little heads for anguish no space in their furry chests for a ruptured capillary system ah what it must be to have a simple muscle heart he looked back to the sky the evening stars seemed cool and calm like dispassionate eyes watching him all except the falling star hed wished on earlier he reflected briefly on the wisdom of wishing on such a transitory thing as a falling star even one falling as slowly as this one seemed to be oh such disturbing budlike emotions such sapling gullibility and nervousness such cuttingish confusion and uncertainty the star still fell it became brighter and brighter in the evening sky lowering slowly and changing colour too from sunwhite to moonyellow to skyorange to sunsetred fropome could hear its noise now a dull roaring like a strong wind disturbing shorttempered tree tops the falling red star was no longer a single point of light it had taken on a shape now like a big seed pod it occurred to fropome that this might indeed be a sign whatever it was had come from the stars after all and werent stars the seeds of the ancestors shot so high they left the earth and rooted in the celestial spheres of cold fire allseeing and allknowing maybe the old stories were true after all and the gods had come to tell him something momentous a thrill of excitement rose within him his limbs shook and his leaves beaded with moisture the pod was close now it dipped and seemed to hesitate in the darkorange sky the pods colour continued to deepen all the time and fropome realized it was hot he could feel its warmth even from half a dozen reaches away it was an ellipsoid a little smaller than he was it flexed glittering roots from its bottom end and glided through the air to land on the meadow with a sort of tentative deliberation a couple of reaches away fropome watched thoroughly entranced he didnt dare move this might be important a sign everything was still him the grumbling bushes the whispering grass even the grazers looked puzzled the pod moved part of its casing fell back inside itself producing a hole in the smooth exterior and something came out it was small and silver and it walked on what might have been hind legs or a pair of overdeveloped roots it crossed to one of the grazers and started making noises at it the grazer was so surprised it fell over it lay staring up at the strange silver creature blinking cubs ran terrified for their mothers other grazers looked at each other or at fropome who still wasnt sure what to do the silver seedlet moved to another grazer and made noises at it confused the grazer broke wind the seedlet went to the animals rear end and started speaking loudly there fropome clapped a couple of vines together to request respectfully the silver creatures attention and made to spread the same two leafpalms on the ground before the seedlet in a gesture of supplication the creature leapt back detached a bit of its middle with one of its stubby upper limbs and pointed it at fropomes vines there was a flash of light and fropome felt pain as his leafpalms crisped and smoked instinctively he lashed out at the creature knocking it to the ground the detached bit flew away across the meadow and hit a grazer cub on the flank fropome was shocked then angry he held the struggling creature down with one undamaged vine while he inspected his injuries the leaves would probably fall off and take days to regrow he used another limb to grasp the silver seedlet and bring it up to his eye cluster he shook it then upended it and stuck its top down at the leaves it had burned and shook it again he brought it back up to inspect it more closely damn funny thing to have come out of a seed pod he thought twisting the object this way and that it looked a little like a grazer except it was thinner and silvery and the head was just a smooth reflective sphere fropome could not work out how it stayed upright the overlarge top made it look especially unbalanced possibly it wasnt meant to totter around for long those pointed leglike parts were probably roots the thing wriggled in his grasp he tore off a little of the silvery outer bark and tasted it in a nestrap he spat it out again not animal or vegetable more like mineral very odd rootpink tendrils squirmed at the end of the stubby upper limb where fropome had torn the outer covering off fropome looked at them and wondered he took hold of one of the little pink filaments and pulled it came off with a faint pop another muffledsounding noise came from the silvery top of the creature she loves me fropome pulled off another tendril pop sap the colour of the setting sun dribbled out she loves me not pop pop pop he completed that set of tendrils she loves me excited fropome pulled the covering off the end of the other upper limb more tendrils she loves me not a grazer cub came up and pulled at one of fropomes lower branches in its mouth it held the silvery creatures burner device which had hit it on the flank fropome ignored it she loves me the grazer cub gave up pulling at fropomes branch it squatted down on the meadow dropping the burner on the grass and prodding inquisitively at it with one paw the silvery seedlet was wriggling enthusiastically in fropomes grip thin red sap spraying everywhere fropome completed the tendrils on the second upper limb pop she loves me not oh no the grazer cub licked the burner tapped it with its paw one of the other cubs saw it playing with the bright toy and started ambling over towards it on a hunch fropome tore the covering off the blunt roots at the base of the creature ah ha she loves me the grazer cub at fropomes side got bored with the shiny bauble it was about to abandon the thing where it lay when it saw its sibling approaching looking inquisitive the first cub growled and started trying to pick the burner up with its mouth pop she loves me not ah death shall my pollen never dust her perfectly formed ovaries oh wicked balanced so blandly symmetrical even universe in his rage fropome ripped the silvery covering right off the lower half of the leaking weakly struggling seedlet oh unfair life oh trecherous stars the growling grazer cub hefted the burner device into its mouth something clicked the cubs head exploded fropome didnt pay too much attention he was staring intently at the barkstripped creature he held wait a moment there was something left up there just where the roots met thank heavens the thing was odd after all oh happy daypop she loves me descendant i am down fallen as far as i am going to outwardly i am just something on the surface a body in a suit inwardly everything is difficult i hurt i feel better now this is the third day all i recall of the other two is that they were there i dont remember any details i havent been getting better steadily either as what happened yesterday is even more blurred than the day before the day of the fall i think i had the idea then that i was being born a primitive oldfashioned almost animal birth bloody and messy and dangerous i took part and watched at the same time i was the born and the birthing and when suddenly i felt i could move i jerked upright trying to sit up and wipe my eyes but my gloved hands hit the visor centimetres in front of my eyes and i fell back raising dust i blacked out now it is the third day however and the suit and i are in better shape ready to move off start travelling i am sitting on a big rough rock in a boulderfield halfway up a long gently sloping escarpment i think its a scarp it might be the swell towards the lip of the big crater but i havent spotted any obvious secondaries that might belong to a hole in the direction of the rise and theres no evidence of strata overflip probably an escarpment then and not too steep on the other side i hope i prepare myself by thinking of the way ahead before i actually start walking i suck at the little tube near my chin and draw some thin acidic stuff into my mouth i swallow with an effort the sky here is bright pink it is midmorning and there are only two stars visible on normal sight with the external glasses tinted and polarized i can just see thin wispy clouds high up the atmosphere is still down at this level and no dust moves i shiver bumping inside the suit as though the vacuous loneliness bruised me it was the same the first day when i thought the suit was dead are you ready to set off the suit says i sigh and get to my feet dragging the weight of the suit up with me for a moment before it tiredly flexes too yes lets get moving we set off it is my turn to walk the suit is heavy my side aches monotonously my stomach feels empty the boulderfield stretches on into the edges of the distant sky i dont know what happened which is annoying though it wouldnt make any difference if i did know it wouldnt have made any difference when it happened either because there was no time for me to do anything it was a surprise an ambush whatever got us must have been very small or very far away otherwise we wouldnt be here still alive if the module had taken any standardsized warhead full on there would be only radiation and atoms left probably not an intact molecule even a near miss would have left nothing recognizable to the unaided human eye only something tiny perhaps not a warhead at all but just something moving fast or a more distant miss would leave wreckage i must remember that hold on to that however bad i may feel i am still alive when there was every chance that i would never get this far even as a cinder let alone whole and thinking and still able to walk but damaged both of us damaged i am injured but so is the suit which is worse in some ways it is running mostly on external power soaking up the weak sunlight as best it can but so inefficiently that it has to rest at night when both of us have to sleep its communications and ag are wrecked and the recycle and medical units are badly damaged too all that and a tiny leak we cant find im frightened it says i have internal bruising and i shouldnt be walking but we talked it over and agreed that our only hope is to walk to head in roughly the right direction and hope were seen by the base we were heading for originally in the module the base is a thousand kilometres south of the northern ice cap we came down north of the equator but just how far north we dont know its going to be a long walk for both of us how do you feel now fine the suit replies how far do you think well get today maybe twenty kilometres thats not very much youre not very well well do better once you heal you were quite ill quite ill there are still some little bits of sickness and patches of dried blood within the helmet where i can see them they dont smell any more but they dont look very pleasant either ill try cleaning them up again tonight i am worried that apart from anything else the suit isnt being completely honest with me it says it thinks our chances are fiftyfifty but i suspect it either doesnt have any idea at all or knows things are worse than its telling me this is what comes of having a smart suit but i asked for one it was my choice so i cant complain besides i might have died if the suit hadnt been as bright as it is it got the two of us down here out of the wrecked module and down through the thin atmosphere while i was still unconscious from the explosion a standard suit might have done almost as well but that probably wouldnt have been enough it was a close run thing even as it was my legs hurt the ground is fairly level but occasionally i have to negotiate small ridges and areas of corrugated ground my feet are sore too but the pain in my legs worries me more i dont know if ill be able to keep going all day which is what the suit expects how far did we come yesterday thirtyfive kilometres the suit walked all of that carrying me like a dead weight it got up and walked clasping me inside it so i wouldnt bump around and marched off the wispy remains of its crippled emergency photopanels dragging over the dusty ground behind it like the wings of some strange damaged insect thirtyfive klicks i havent done a tenth of that yet ill just have to keep going i cant disappoint it id be letting the suit down it has done so well to get us here in one piece and it walked all that long way yesterday supporting me while i was still rolling my eyes and drooling mumbling about walking in a dream and being the living dead so i cant let it down if i fail i harm us both lessening the suits chances of survival too the slope goes on the ground is boringly uniform always the same rusty brown it frightens me that there is so little variety so little sign of life sometimes we see a stain on a rock that might be plant life but i cant tell and the suit doesnt know because most of its external eyes and tactiles were burned out in the fall and its analyzer is in no better condition than the ag or the transceiver the suits briefing on the planet didnt include a comprehensive ecology so we dont even know in theory whether the discolourations could be plants maybe we are the only life here maybe theres nothing living or thinking for thousands and thousands of kilometres the thought appals me what are you thinking about nothing i tell it talk you should talk to me but what is there to say and why should i talk anyway i suppose it wants to make me talk so ill forget the steady march the tramptramp of my feet a couple of centimetres away from the ochre soil of this barren place i remember that when i was still in shock and delirious on the first day i thought i stood outside us both and saw the suit open itself letting my precious fouled air out into the thin atmosphere and i watched me dying in the airless cold then saw the suit slowly tiredly haul me out of itself stiff and naked a reptileskin reverse a chrysalis negative it left me scrawny and nude and pathetic on the dusty ground and walked away lightened and empty and maybe im still afraid it will do that because together we might both die but the suit im fairly sure could make it by itself quite easily it could sacrifice me to save itself its the sort of thing a lot of humans would do mind if i sit down i say and collapse onto a large boulder before the suit can reply what hurts it asks everything mostly my legs and my feet itll take a few days for your feet to harden and your muscles to tone up rest when you feel like it theres no sense in pushing yourself too hard hmm i say i want it to argue i want it to tell me to stop whining and keep walking but it doesnt want to play i look down at my dangling legs the suits surface is blackened and covered in tiny pits and scars some hairfine filaments wave tattered and charred my suit ive had the thing for over a century and ive hardly used it the brains spent most of its time plugged into the main house unit back home living at an added level of vicariousness even on holidays ive spent most of my time on board ship rather than venture out into hostile environments well were sure as shit in a hostile environment now all we have to do is walk halfway round an airless planet overcome any and all obstacles in our way and if the place were heading for still exists and if the suits systems dont pack up completely and if we dont get picked off by whatever destroyed the module and if we arent blown away by our own people were saved do you feel like going on now what wed better be on our way dont you think oh yes all right i lower myself to the desert floor my feet ache intensely for a while but as i start to walk the pain ebbs the slope looks just the way it did kilometres back i am already breathing deeply i have a sudden and vivid image of the base as it might be as it probably is a vast steaming crater ripped out of the planet during the same attack that downed us but even if that is the reality we agreed it still makes sense to head there rescuers or reinforcements will go there first we have a better chance of being picked up there than anywhere else anyway there was no module wreckage to stay beside on the ground it was travelling so fast it burned up even in this thin atmosphere the way we very nearly did i still have a vague hope well be spotted from space but i guess thats not likely now anything left intact up there is probably looking outwards if wed been noticed when we fell or spotted on the surface wed have been picked up by now probably only hours after we hit the dirt they cant know were here and we cant get in touch with them so all we can do is walk the rock and stones are getting gradually smaller i walk on its night i cant sleep the stars are spectacular but no solace i am cold too which doesnt help we are still on the slope we travelled a little over sixteen kilometres today i hope well come to the lip of the escarpment tomorrow or at least to some sort of change in the landscape several times today while i walked i had the impression that for all my effort we werent moving anywhere everything is so uniform damn my humanbasic ancestry my side and belly are hurting badly my legs and feet held out better than i expected but my injuries torment me my head hurts as well normally the suit would pump me full of painkiller relaxants or a sleeping draught and whatever it is helps your muscles to build up and your body to repair itself my body cant do those things for itself the way most peoples can so im at the mercy of the suit it says its recycler is holding out i dont like to tell it but the thin gruel its dispensing tastes disgusting the suit says it is still trying to track down the site of the leak no progress so far i have my arms and legs inside now im glad because this lets me scratch the suit lies with its arms clipped in to the sides and opened into the torso section the legs together and melded and the chest expanded to give me room meanwhile the carbon dioxide frosts outside and the stars shine steadily i scratch and scratch something else more altered humans wouldnt have to do i cant make itches go away just by thinking it isnt very comfortable in here usually it is warm and cosy and pleasant every chemical whim of the encased body catered for a little womb to curl up in and dream the inner lining can no longer alter the way it used to so it stays quite hard and feels and smells sweaty i can smell the sewage system i scratch my backside and turn over stars i stare at them trying to match their unblinking gaze through the hazy scratched surface of the helmet visor i put my arm back into the suits and unclip i reach round onto the top of the blownout chest and feel in the front packs pocket taking out my antique still camera what are you doing going to take a photograph play me some music anything all right the suit plays me music from my youth while i point the camera at the stars i clip the arm back and pass the camera through the chest lock the camera is very cold my breath mists on it the viewer half unrolls then jams i tease it out with my nails and it stays the rest of the mechanism is working my star pictures are fine and switching to some of the older magazines from the stock they come up bright and clear too i look at the pictures of my home and friends on the orbital and feel as i listen to the old nostalgiainducing music a mixture of comfort and sadness my vision blurs i drop the camera and its screen snaps shut the camera rolls away underneath me i raise myself up painfully retrieve it unroll the screen again and go on looking back through old photographs until i fall asleep i wake up the camera lies beside me switched off the suit is quiet i can hear my heart beat i drift back to sleep eventually still night i stay awake looking at the stars through the scarred visor i feel as rested as i ever will but the night here is almost twice standard and ill just have to get used to it neither of us can see well enough to be able to travel safely at night besides which i still need to sleep and the suit cant store enough energy during the hours of sunlight to use for walking in the darkness its internal power source produces barely enough continuous energy to crawl with and the light falling on its photopanels provides a vital supplement thankfully the clouds here never seem to amount to much an overcast day would leave me doing all the work whether it was my turn or not i unroll the camera screen then think suit what it says quietly the camera has a power unit i thought of that its very weak and anyway the power systems are damaged beyond the junction point for another source of internal energy i cant think of a way of patching it in to the external radiation system either we cant use it we cant use it just look at your pictures i look at the pictures theres no doubt about it education or not once youve been born and brought up on an o you never quite adjust to a planet you get agoraphobic you feel you are about to be sent spinning off flying away into space picked up and sent screaming and bawling out to the naked stars you somehow sense that vast wasteful bulk underneath you warping space itself and selfcompressing soilsolid or still halfmolten quivering in its creaky massy press and you stuck perched here on the outside halfterrified that despite all you know youll lose your grip and go wheeling and whirling and wailing away this is our birthplace though this is what we deserted long ago this is where we used to live on balls of dust and rock like this this is our home town from before we felt the itch of wanderlust the sticks we inhabited before we ran away from home the cradle where we were infected with the crazy breath of the places vastness like a metal wind inside our lovestruck heads just stumbled on the scale of whats around and tripped out drunk on starlike possibilities i find that im staring at the stars my eyes wide and burning i shake myself tear my sight away from the view outside turn back to the camera i look at a group photograph from the orbital people i knew friends lovers relations children all standing in the sunlight of a late summers day outside the main building recalled names and faces and voices smells and touches behind them almost finished is as it was then the new wing some of the wood we used to build it still lies in the garden white and dark brown on the green smiles the smell of sawdust and the feel of pushing a plane hardened skin on my hands and the sight and sound of the planed wood curling from the blade tears again how can i help but be sentimental i didnt expect all of this back then i cant cope with the distance between us all now that awful gap of slow years i flick through other pictures general views of the orbital its fields and towns and seas and mountains maybe everything can be seen as a symbol in the end perhaps with our limited grasp we cant help but find similarities talismans but that inward facing plate of orbital looks false to me now down here so far away and lonely this globe of ordinary soft accidental planet seems the cutting edge and the flat knife of twinned adamantine thoroughness our clever efficient little orbitals lacking that fundamental reality i wish i could sleep i want to sleep and forget about everything but i cant tired though i still am the suit cant help me there either i dont even remember dreaming as though that facility too is damaged maybe im the artificial one not the suit which doesnt try to pretend people have said im cold which hurt me which still hurts me all i can do is feel what i can and tell myself its all anyone can ask of me i turn over painfully face away from the treacherous stars i close my eyes and my mind to their remindful study and try to sleep wake up i feel very sleepy the rhythms all wrong tired again time to go come on i come to rubbing my eyes breathing through my mouth to get rid of the stale taste in it the dawn looks cold and perfect very thin and wide through this inhospitable covering of gas and the slope is still here of course its the suits turn to walk so i can rest on we redeploy the legs and arms again the chest deflates the suit stands up and starts walking gripping me round the calves and waist taking the bulk of my weight off my throbbing feet the suit walks faster than i do it reckons it is only twenty percent stronger than the average human something of a comedown for it even having to walk must be galling for it if it feels galled if only the ag worked wed do the whole trip in a day one day we stride out over the sloped plain heading for the edge the stars disappear slowly one by one washed out of the wide skies by the sunlight the suit gains a little speed as the light falls harder on its trailed photopanels we stop and squat for a moment inspecting a discoloured rock it is just possible if we find an oxide of some sort but the stone holds no more trapped oxygen than the rest and we move on when and if we get back what will happen to you because im damaged the suit says i imagine theyll just throw the body away its so badly damaged youll get a new one yes of course a better one i expect so what will they keep just the brain plus about a metre of secondary column and a few subunits i want us to get there i want us to be found i want to live we come to the edge of the escarpment about midmorning even though i am not walking i feel very tired and sleepy and my appetite has disappeared the view ought to be impressive but im only aware that its a long difficult way down the escarpment lip is crumbly and dangerous cut with many runnels and channels which lower down become steep shadowy ravines separating sharpedged ridges and jagged spires scree spreads out beyond far below in the landscape at the cliffs foot it is the colour of old dried blood i am suitably depressed we sit on a rock and rest before making our way down the horizon is very clear and sharp there are mountains in the far distance and many broad shallow channels on the wide plain that lies between the mountains and us i dont feel well my guts ache continually and breathing deeply hurts too as though ive broken a rib i think it is just the taste of the recyclers soup that is putting me off eating but im not certain there are a few stars in the sky we couldnt glide down could we i ask the suit thats how we got through the atmosphere after all the suit used the minuscule amount of ag it had left and somehow got the tattered photopanel sheet to function as a parachute no the ag is almost certain to fail completely next time we try it and the parachute trick wed need too much space too much drop to ensure deployment we have to climb we have to climb all right well climb we get up approach the edge night again i am exhausted so tired but i cannot sleep my side is tender to the touch and my head throbs unbearably it took us the whole afternoon and evening to get down here to the plains and we both had to work at it we nearly fell once a good hundredmetre drop with just some flakes of slatey stone to hold on to until the suit kicked a foothold somehow we made it down without snagging and tearing further the photopanels more good luck than skill probably every muscle seems to hurt im finding it hard to think straight all i want to do is twist and turn and try to find a comfortable way to lie i dont know how much of this i can take this is going to go on for a hundred days or more and even if the still undiscovered leak doesnt kill me i feel like im going to die of exhaustion if only they were looking for us somebody walking in a suit on a planet sounds hard to find but shouldnt be really the place is barren homogeneous dead and motionless we must be the only movement the only life for hundreds of kilometres at least to our level of technology we ought to stand out like a boulder in the dust but either they arent looking or theres nobody left to look but if the base still exists they must see us eventually mustnt they the sats cant spend all their time looking outwards can they they must have some provision for spotting enemy landings could we have just slipped through it doesnt seem possible i look at my photographs again they appear a hundred at a time on the viewer i press one and it blooms to fill the little screen with its memories i rub my head and wonder how long my hair will grow i have a silly but oddly frightening vision of my hair growing so long it chokes me filling the helmet and the suit and cutting out the light finally asphyxiating me ive heard that your hair goes on growing after you die and your nails too i wonder that despite one or two of the photographs and their associated memories i havent felt sexually aroused yet i curl up foetal i am a little naked planet of my own reduced to the primitive within my own stale envelope of gas a tiny moonlet of this place on a very low slow erratic orbit what am i doing here its as if i drifted into this situation i didnt ever think about fighting or doing anything risky at all not until the war came along i agreed it was necessary but that seemed obvious everybody thought so everybody i knew anyway and volunteering agreeing to take part that too seemed natural i knew i might die but i was prepared to risk that it was almost romantic somehow it never occurred to me it might entail privation and suffering am i as stupid as those throughout history those ive always despised and pitied whove marched off to war heads full of noble notions and expectations of easy glory only to die screaming and torn in the mud i thought i was different i thought i knew what i was doing what are you thinking about the suit asks nothing oh why are you here i ask it why did you agree to come with me the suit officially as smart as me and with similar rights could have gone its own way if it wanted it didnt have to come to war why shouldnt i come with you but whats in it for you whats in it for you but im human i cant help feeling like this i want to know what you think the machines excuse is oh come on youre a machine too were both systems were both matter with sentience what makes you think we have more choice than you in the way we think or that you have so little were all programmed we all have our inheritance you have rather more than us and its more chaotic thats all there is a saying that we provide the machines with an end and they provide us with the means i have a fleeting impression the suit is about to trot out this hoary adage do you really care what happens in the war i ask it of course it says with what could almost be a laugh in its voice i lie back and scratch i look at the camera ive got an idea i tell it how about i find a very bright picture and wave it about now in the dark you can try it if you want the suit doesnt sound very encouraging i try it anyway then my arm gets tired waving the camera around i leave it propped up against a rock shining into space it looks very lonely and strange that picture of a sunny orbital day sky and clouds and glittering water bright hulls and tall sails fluttering pennants and dashing spray in this dead and dusty darkness it isnt all that bright though i suspect reflected starlight isnt much weaker it would be easy to miss and they dont seem to be looking anyway i wonder what happens to us all in the end i yawn sleepy at last i dont know well just have to wait and see wont that be fun i murmur and say no more the suit says this is day twenty we are in the foothills on the far side of the mountains we saw in the distance from the escarpment i am still alive the pressure in the suit is reduced to slow down the loss rate from the leak which the suit has decided is not a hole as such but increased osmosis from several areas where too much of the outer layers ablated when we were falling i am breathing pure oxygen now which lets us bring down the pressure significantly it might be coincidence but the food from the recycler tube tastes better since we switched to pure gas there is a dull ache all the time from my belly but i am learning to live with it ive stopped caring i think ill live or ill die but worrying and complaining wont improve my chances the suit isnt sure what to make of this it doesnt know whether i have given up hope or just become blasé about the whole thing i feel no guilt at keeping it guessing i lost the camera i was trying eight days ago to take a photograph of a strange anthropomorphous rock formation in the high mountains when the camera slipped from my fingers and fell into a crevice between two great boulders the suit seemed almost as unhappy as i was normally it could have lifted either of those rocks into the air but even together the two of us couldnt budge either of them my feet are hard and calloused now which makes walking a lot easier i am becoming hardened generally ill be a better person when i come out of this im sure the suit makes dubious noises when i suggest this ive seen some lovely sunsets recently they must have been there all the time but i didnt notice them i make a point of watching them now sitting up to observe the sweep and trace of trembling planetary air and the high clouds wisping and curling coming and going levels and layers of the wrapping atmosphere shifting through its colours and turning like smooth silent shells there is a small moon i hadnt noticed either i put the external glasses on as high as they will go and sit looking at its grey face when i can find it i rebuked the suit for not reminding me the planet had a moon it told me it hadnt thought it was important the moon is pale and fragile looking and pocked i have taken to singing songs to myself this annoys the suit intensely and sometimes i pretend thats one of the major rewards of such vocal selfindulgence sometimes i think it really is too they are very poor songs because i am not very good at making them up and i have a terrible memory for other peoples the suit insists my voice is flat as well but i think its just being mean once or twice it has retaliated by playing music very loudly through my headphones but i just sing louder and it gives in i try to get it to sing along with me but it sulks oh once there was a spaceman and a happy man was he flew through the big g and really saw it all yes but then one day im afraid he happened to trip up stumbled on a plaanet and landed in the dirt it wouldnt really have been so bad but the worst was yet to come his one and only companion was a suit that da da dum the suit it was a shitbag and thought the man a lout and what it really wanted was to be insideout chorus insideout insideout inside insideout insideout insideout inside insideout and so on there are others but they are mostly to do with sex and so fairly boring colourful but monotonous my hair is growing i have a thin beard i have started masturbating though only every few days it is all recycled of course i claim the suit as my lover it is not amused i miss my comforts but at least sex can be partially recreated whereas all the rest seem unreal no more than dreams i have started dreaming usually it is the same dream i am on a cruise of some sort somewhere i dont know what form of transport im on but somehow i know its moving it might be a ship or a seaship or an airship or a train i dont know all that happens is that i walk down a fleecy corridor passing plants and small pools some sort of scenery is going by outside when i can see outside but im not paying very much attention it might be a planet seen from space or mountains or desert it might even be underwater i dont care i wave to some people i know i am eating something savoury to tide me over to dinner and i have a towel over my shoulder i think im going for a swim the air is sweet and i hear some very soft and beautiful music which i almost recognize coming from a cabin wherever whatever it is i am in it is travelling very smoothly and quietly without sound or vibration or fuss secure ill appreciate all that if i ever see it again ill know then what it is to feel so safe so pampered so unafraid and confident i never get anywhere in that dream im always simply walking each and every time i have it it is always the same always as sweet i always start and finish in the same place everything is always the same predictable and comforting everything is very sharp and clear i miss nothing day thirty the mountains way behind us and me us walking along the top of an ancient lava tunnel im looking for a break in the roof because i think itll be fun to walk along within the tunnel itself it looks big enough to walk inside the suit says we arent heading in exactly the right direction for the base following the tunnel but i reckon were close enough it indulges me i deserve to be indulged i cant curl up like a little ball at night any more the suit decided we were losing too much oxygen each time we melded the limbs and inflated the suit at night so weve stopped doing that i hated feeling trapped and unable to scratch at first but now i dont mind so much now i have to sleep with my legs in its legs and my arms in its arms the lava tunnel curves away in the wrong direction i stand looking at it as it wiggles away into the distance up a great slope to a distant extinct shield volcano wrong way damn it lets get down and head in the right direction shall we the suit says oh all right i grumble i get down im sweating i wipe my head inside the helmet rubbing it up and down like an animal scratching im sweating i tell it why are you letting me sweat i shouldnt be sweating you shouldnt be letting me sweat you must be letting your attention wander come on do your job sorry the suit says in an unpleasant tone i think it should take my comfort a little more seriously thats what its there for after all if you want me to get out and walk i will i tell it that wont be necessary i wish it would suggest a rest i feel weak and dizzy again and i could feel the suit doing most of the work as we got down from the roof of the lava tunnel the pain in my guts is back we start walking over the rubblecovered plain once more i feel like talking tell me suit dont you wonder if its all worth it if whats all worth what it says and i can hear that condescending tone in its voice again you know living is it worth all the bother no no no i dont ever wonder about it why not im keeping my questions short as we walk conserving energy and breath i dont need to wonder about that its not important not important its an irrelevant question we live thats enough oh that easy huh why not why the suit is silent after that i wait for it to say something but it doesnt i laugh wave both our arms about i mean whats it all about suit what does it all mean what colour is the wind how long is a piece of string i have to think about that whats string i have to ask finally suspecting ive missed something never mind keep walking sometimes i wish i could see the suit its weird now that i think about it not being able to see who im talking to just this hollow voice not unlike my own sounding in the space between the inside of my helmet and the outside of my skull i would prefer a face to look at or even just a single thing to fix my attention on if i still had the camera i could take a photograph of us both if there was water here i could gaze at our reflection the suit is my shape extended but its mind isnt mine its independent this perplexes me though i suppose it must make sense but im glad i chose the full intelligence version the standard type would have been no company at all perhaps my sanity is measured by the placing of a decimal point night it is the fiftyfifth night tomorrow will be the fiftysixth day how am i difficult to say my breathing has become laboured and im sure ive become thinner my hair is long now and my beard quite respectable if a little patchy hairs fall out and i have to squirm and pull to get an arm into the body of the suit to poke the hairs into the waste unit each night or they itch i am woken up at night by the pain inside me it is like a little life itself pawing and scraping to get out sometimes i dream a lot sometimes not at all i have given up singing the land goes on i had forgotten planets were so big this ones smaller than standard and it still seems to go on and on without end i feel very cold and the stars make me cry i am tormented by erotic dreams and can do nothing about them they are similar to the old dream of walking on the ship or the seaship or whatever it is only in this dream the people around me are naked and caressing each other and i am on my way to my lover but when i wake up and try to masturbate nothing happens i try and try but i only exhaust myself perhaps if the dream was more powerfully erotic more imaginative but it stays the same ive been thinking about the war a lot recently and i think ive decided its wrong we are defeating ourselves in waging it will destroy ourselves by winning it all our statistics and assumptions mean less the more they seem to tell we surrender in our militance not to one enemy but to all weve ever fought within ourselves we should not be involved we ought not to do a thing weve gambled our fine irony for a mechanistic piety and the faith we fights our own get out stay out keep clear did i say that i thought the suit said something there im not sure sometimes i think its talking to me all the time when im asleep it might even be talking to me all the time when im awake too but its only occasionally that i hear it i think its mimicking me trying to sound the way i sound perhaps it wants to drive me mad i dont know sometimes i dont know which of us has said something i shiver and try to turn over in the suit but i cant i wish i wasnt here i wish all this hadnt happened i wish it was all a dream but like the colours of the earth and air its too consistent i feel very cold and the stars make me cry insideout insideout inside insideout insideout insideout inside insideout shut up oh youre talking to me at last i said shut up but i wasnt saying anything you were singing i dont sing you were singing dont lie dont you dare lie to me you were singing i assure you you were i heard you youre shouting calm down we still have a long way to go we shant get there if you dont you tell me to shut up i didnt you told me to shut up what i said what did you say i what what did who is that if youll ju who are you who are you oh no please look ca no please what please what please please please please i dont know what day this is i dont know where i am or how far ive come or how far there is still to go sane now there never was any suit voice i made it all up it was my own voice all the time some state i must have been in to imagine all that to be so unable to cope with being down here all alone that i created somebody else to talk to like some lonely kid with a friend nobody else can see i believed in it when i thought i heard the voice but i dont hear it any more even at its most blandly credible it was just the flat calm of insanity temporary fortunately everything is i dont look at the stars any more in case they start talking to me too maybe the base is at the core maybe i am just walking round it and can never get any closer to it my limbs move on their own now automatic programmed i hardly need to think everything is as it should be we dont need the machines any more than they need us we just think we need them they dont matter only they need themselves of course a smart suit would have ditched me to save itself we didnt build them to resemble ourselves but thats the way it works out in the end we created something a little closer to perfection than ourselves maybe thats the only way to progress let them try to do the same i doubt they can so they will always be less as well as more than us its all just a sum a whispered piece of figuring lost in the empty blizzards of white noise howling through the universe brief oasis in an infinite desert a freak bit of workingout in which we have transcended ourselves and they are only the remainder going mad inside a spacesuit indeed i think i passed the place where the base used to be some time ago but there was nothing there i am still walking im not sure i know how to stop i am a satellite they too only stay up by forever falling forward the suit is dead around me burned and scarred and blackened and lifeless i dont know how i could have dreamed it was alive the very thought makes me shiver inside here a guard droned knife missile saw the figure skylining about five kilometres away on a low ridge the little missile sized the object up carefully not moving from its crevice in the rocks it triangulated from the eyes on its outboard monofilament warps then rose slowly from its hiding place until it was in line of sight with a scout missile lodged on a cliff ten kilometres behind it it flashed a brief signal and received a relayed reply from its distant drone the drone was there in a few minutes taking a wide curve round the suspicious figure it shook other missiles free as it went deploying them in a ring around the potential target what to do the drone had to make up its own mind the base wasnt transmitting while whatever had hit the last incoming module was still hanging around it had been a long wait but theyd survived so far and the big guns should be arriving soon the drone watched the figure as it skidded and slid down the scree beneath the ridge leaving a hazy trail of dust behind it it got to the bottom then started walking across the wide gravel basin seemingly oblivious to all the attention it was attracting the drone sent a knife missile closer to the object the missile floated up from behind monitoring weak electromagnetic emissions tried to communicate but received no reply then darted round in front of the figure and lasered its drone the view it had of the scarred suit front the figure stopped stood still it raised one hand as though waving at the small missile hovering a few metres in front of it the drone came closer high above scanning finally satisfied it swooped from the sky and stopped a metre in front of the figure which pointed at the black mess of the communication unit on its chest then it gestured to the side of its helmet and tapped at the visor the drone dipped once in a nod then floated forward and pressed gently up against the visor of the helmet vibrating the speech through we know who you are what happened he was alive when we got down but i had no medics left ablation caused a slow oxygen leak and eventually the recycler packed up there was nothing i could do you walked all this way from near the equator when did he die thirtyfour days ago why didnt you ditch the body youd have been quicker the suit made a shrugging movement call it sentiment climb aboard ill take you to an entrance thank you the drone lowered to waist height the suit pulled itself up onto the top of the drone and sat there the body bouncing slackly inside the suit was still quite well preserved though dehydration had stretched the skin and made it darker the teeth were displayed grinning knowingly at the barren world and the skull was arched back on the locked upper vertebrae upright and triumphant you all right up there the drone shouted through the fabric of the suit the suit nodded stiffly to the eye of an accompanying knife missile yes everythings a little difficult though it pointed at the scarred burned surface of its body i hurt cleaning up the first gift fell onto a pig farm in new england it popped into existence five metres above a ramshackle outhouse dropped through the roof bounced off a cistern and demolished a wheelless tractor driving a band saw bruce losey came running out of the house clutching his sporting carbine and ready to blast any interloper to kingdom come all he found was what looked like a gigantic bundle of peacock feathers on top of his tractor which was lying on its side leaking fuel and looking like it would never work again bruce looked up through the hole in the roof and spat into a pile of cut logs goddamned ssts he tried to shift the object that had bust up his tractor smashed his roof and dented his cistern but leapt away when it burned his hands he went back to the house watching the sky warily and called the police cesare borges head of the mighty industrial military combines corporation sat in his office reading a fascinating article called prayer a guide to investment the office intercom buzzed what professor feldman to see you sir who a professor feldman sir oh yeah yes sir he says he has the results of the preliminary development work on there was some talking cesare didnt catch on the alternative resources project the what the alternative resources project sir it was set up last year it seems the professor has been waiting for some time sir ill see him later cesare said clicking the intercom off and going back to the readers digest hell i dont know what it is i think it fell off an sst the patrolman rubbed his chin the other cop was poking a stick at the bundle lying across the old tractor the thing was about three metres long and one in diameter and whatever it was its colours kept shifting and changing and whenever anything touched it it got hot the tip of the stick smoked who should we tell about this anyway said the cop with the stick he wanted to have this cleared up as quickly as possible and get away from the smell of pigs coming from the barn across the yard i guess the faa said the other or maybe the air force i dunno he took off his cap and fiddled with the badge breathing on it and polishing it on his sleeve well im claiming compensation whoever it belongs to bruce said as they went back to the house thats a lot of damage that things done thatll cost a few bucks to set right that tractor was nearly new you know im telling you nowheres safe now with those ssts hmm uhhuh hey bruce said stopping and looking at the two cops with a worried expression on his face do you know if liberia registers ssts professor feldman sat in the outerouter office in cesares suite at the top of the imcc building in manhattan and looked through the abstract of his report for about the eightieth time the secretary a cleancut young man with an ibm desk terminal and a m submachine gun had shrugged his shoulders sympathetically after he had at last been persuaded to call through to cesares office the professor said he would just have to wait and went back to his seat there were seven other people waiting to see cesare apart from himself two of them were air force generals and one was the foreign minister of an important developing country they all looked nervous without their aides who were kept in the outerouterouter office to avoid crowding according to the others they had been waiting there seven or eight hours each day five days a week for at least the last three weeks this was the professors first day the factory ship moved through space in one of the dustrich arms of the main galaxy its netfields like great invisible limbs stretched before it gathering its harvest like a trawl and funnelling the ensnared material into the firststage transmuters in the mess of the third cleanup squad things were going badly for matriapoll trasnegatherstolekeniffregienthickissle jnr he had almost completed a full circuit of the room without touching the floor when a collapsible chair collapsed beneath him and now he had to go back to the start and begin all over again with one paw tied behind his back the other members of the squad were making bets on where he would fall and screaming insults matriapoll and mates to briefing room fourteen blared the messroom speaker normally matriapoll would have welcomed this interruption but he was on top of the speaker trying to grab hold of a light fixture at the time and the shock of the speaker suddenly bursting into life beneath him made him lose his grip and he thumped down onto the floor to the accompaniment of hoots and laughter bastards he said come on matty chuckled his mates oney and twoey their tiny dextrous hands quickly untying his arm and dusting him down they straightened his clothes and bustled out in front of him as matriapoll paid what he owed to the others in the squad and then left for the briefing room the air force didnt know what it was either but it wasnt anything of theirs they were sure of that they certainly werent going to be paying any compensation but they decided to take the thing just to see what it was the air force came in a big truck that didnt quite make the turn off the road onto the farm track and knocked down a metre or two of fencing bruce said hed sue they took the bundle away wrapped in asbestos at the mercantsville airbase they tried to find out what the object was but apart from deducing that from the way it felt there was something inside the oddlycoloured outer covering which now appeared like motherofpearl they didnt make a great deal of progress somebody in imcc got to hear about the object and the company offered to open it or at least make a further attempt if the air force would let them have it the air force thought about this the mysterious bundle was resisting all attempts to open it or even see inside they had tried metal tools which melted they tried oxyacetylene torches which disappeared into the motherofpearl covering without producing any noticeable effect oxygen lances which did no better shapedcharge explosives which shifted the whole thing across the floor of the hangar and laser beams which bounced off and frazzled the roof a few days later a truck left the mercantsville base and made its way to the nearest imcc laboratory professor feldman had started a series of chess games with the foreign minister two more people had arrived in the outerouter office to wait one of the generals had given up and left professor feldman could see that he might have to wait quite a while before being granted an audience with mr borges he had a sinking feeling that by the time he got in to see the chief all the problems in the world that the arp was supposed to help alleviate would have disappeared one way or another the foreign minister wasnt very good at chess the scoutship warped its way through space matriapoll picked what passed with his people for a nose and watched the show on the controlcabin screen the show was extremely boring yet another quiz programme where people answered questions that were far too easy and got prizes that were far too expensive but matriapoll kept watching because the hostesses who showed the prizes to the audience were beautiful the green one in particular had the most superb trio of phnysthens he could recall seeing the show cut out suddenly and was replaced by a picture of stars one star was ringed in red by the ships computer is that where were going said a little voice behind him yes said matriapoll to twoey the little animal curled its arm around his neck and peeped over his shoulder rubbing its snout on his collar thats where the transporters focused right there on the systems sun matty frowned or at least thats where its meant to be targeted another gift turned up in kansas another in texas one was seen from a drilling rig in the gulf of mexico falling into the water they still hadnt worked out how to open them they tried bombarding them with light radio x and gamma rays and they tried ultrasonic equipment on it too they did all the same things to the kansas object and the texas object but none of them gave up any of their secrets eventually they put the original bundle into a vacuum chamber that didnt work either until they heated one side and froze the other the thing peeled like a wrapper off candy and for an instant the people outside the chamber were left gazing at something that looked like a cross between a suit of armour and a missile before it blew up and caught fire they were left with a very odd pile of junk but the next time cesare was on the phone okay im a busy man there are a lot of people waiting to see me what is it the phone made noises cesare watched the manhattan skyline then he said oh yeah the phone made more noises cesare nodded he inspected his fingernails and sighed while he was doing that a general swinging on the end of a length of rope tied around his waist passed in front of cesares office window waving plans for a new highaltitude bomber cesare looked into the phone what the rope came back empty and a sheaf of papers floated for a moment in front of the glass before the breeze caught them and took them away drifting slowly down to the streets eighty floors below and its just floating there no engines no noise nothing the rope was hanging just outside the window the remains of a poorly tied knot at the end antigravity sure cesare put the phone down without another word i am surrounded by idiots he thought gifts started popping into existence all over the place some were found in europe one in australia two in africa three in south america imcc had thirteen eleven of them found in the usa and one each from south america and africa they found out how to open them without damaging the contents and what they found were some very odd things indeed one kept trying to walk away on its five legs it looked a little like a spider another just floated in midair without any apparent means of support it vaguely resembled a typewriter with headlamps another was the size of a subcompact automobile and tried to talk to everybody with blond hair in a language which appeared to consist mostly of grunts and windbreaking noises yet another seemed to be a different size and shape every time you looked at it all were very difficult to take apart and the analysis of any bits that they did eventually succeed in removing didnt make sense professor feldman sat beside the police chief who was waiting to see cesare to ask whether he knew anything about the air force general who had it seemed jumped to his death from the roof of the building a few days ago the professor had been talking about this with the policeman and was shocked to discover that it was the same general he had been waiting with up to a week ago the other general who was still there waiting said he couldnt help in the investigation checkmate professor feldman said after eight moves are you sure said the foreign minister leaning closer to inspect the board feldman was about to reply when the young secretary came over and tapped him on the shoulder professor feldman yes would you like to go in mr borges will see you now the young secretary went back to his seat the professor looked around at the others aghast they were glaring at him with that special contempt reserved by the envious for the undeserving the remaining general sneered openly at him and glanced meaningfully down at the patchwork of ribbons that covered one side of his chest the professor gathered up his papers in total silence and gave his lunchbox and magazines to the policeman he pulled his tie straight and walked as steadily as he could to the door still wondering why he had been summoned before people who had been waiting much longer than he had cesare borges straightened his tie put the edition of national geographic away and emptied the small box containing the names of the rest of the people sitting in the outerouter office into the wastebin professor feldmans slip of paper was marking cesares place in the magazine well he said when professor feldman walked into the room cesare motioned him to sit in a seat in front of the massive desk feldman sat down and cleared his throat he took some papers and spread them deferentially on cesares desk well sir these are some of the projects weve been working on in this the first phase of what i like to call whats this snorted cesare holding up a piece of paper with a drawing on it that thats ah thats a new design of mudpress for constructing bricks in a lowtechnology situation cesare looked at him he picked up another bit of paper and this thats a section through a new lowcost longlife toilet weve designed for when water is at a premium youve spent two million of the firms money designing a john cesare said huskily well sir its very important its just one component in a whole system of lowcost highuse interdependent facilities which have been designed to be of facility in the third world of course the development costs will probably be recouped in production though it was agreed that it would be very good for the overall image of the company and the associated universities if there was no actual profit component included in the eventual selling price it was said cesare the professor coughed nervously so i believe sir that was at the last shareholders meeting the grant for the project as a whole dates from then although the preliminary viability study was first just a minute cesare said holding up one hand and putting the other to the buzzing intercom yes call on line two sir cesare picked up the phone feldman sat back and wondered what was going to happen cesare said are you sure and this could definitely be used this had better be right ok hold everything im coming out there he put down the phone and hit a button on the intercom set get the helicopter and have the jet ready ah mr borges professor feldman began as cesare opened a drawer in his desk and took out a travelling bag cesare held up one hand not now doc i got to move just wait in the outerouter office until i send for you i wont be long so long with that he was gone into his private elevator and on up to the roof to his private helicopter which would fly him to an imcc airstrip where his private jet would be waiting the young secretary came into the office and ushered professor feldman and his papers back out into the outerouter office where nobody talked to him and the foreign minister and the police chief were playing chequers on his chess board black holes matriapoll said loudly whats wrong matty said oney the three of them were watching a complicated array of lights and screens in the control cabin the system and surrounding space was shown diagrammatically and a little red light had just appeared next to the third planet counting out from the star ill tell you whats wrong said matriapoll clicking his brows with annoyance that transporter is outoforder its not working matty its working but it isnt working properly said matriapoll its supposed to be depositing the stuff here he pointed to an orange area above the stars surface but it isnt doing that its putting it down here he pointed to another area of the screen the third planet thats bad matriapoll turned to look at the two mates they sat on the back of his seat and looked back at him tilting their heads to one side twoey licked his face dont you two phnysthens ever listen to the briefings yes of course we do then you ought to know that worlds inhabited oh its that one we thought it was the one with the pretty rings good grief breathed matriapoll and took the scoutship towards the offending planet the fighter rose above the airfield without a sound the generals looked pleased cesare pretended not to be impressed the plane was moving horizontally now high enough for the people in the revue stand to be able to see the flat disk attached to its underside it was that disk which was providing all the power the craft swept away over the nevada desert somebody handed cesare a pair of binoculars and told him where to watch all he could see was a white blockhouse in the bright sun shimmering miles away then the plane appeared in one corner of his magnified vision a bolt of blinding light leapt from it crossed to the blockhouse in no appreciable time and demolished it in a cloud of dust hmm cesare said what do you think sir said the local imcc head a young man called fosse depends can we produce those things we think we ought to be able to soon sir one of the last machines we recovered seems to like taking the others apart we can start to find out exactly how theyre put together once we find that out were halfway there okay but where are these things coming from frankly sir we dont know they turned and looked back at the desert as the sound of the exploding blockhouse rolled over the stand the aircraft was returning too slowing for a vertical landing were sure they arent commie oh quite sure sir if they could deliver things that size into our airspace without our radar spotting them theyd be sending hbombs not their latest technology yes that makes sense cesare said the generals were starting to file out of the stand a fleet of helicopters waited for the various dignitaries military and civilian a handful of security men kept generals and other imcc underlings from bothering cesare as he chatted to fosse i understand the president has given us the full goahead for joint development with the armed forces sir who oh yeah the president good real good get onto it then im interested in this fosse think ill stay over in california for a while get some rest keep an eye on all this pressure of work back in the east you know of course sir oh shucks matriapoll said theyve found them look at that he showed them the writeout of all the objects the faulty transporter had been beaming to earth instead of the sun the two little animals behind him went tuttut and shook their heads look at that matriapoll went on a translator for the grenbrethg an automatic sewer inspection kit a kiddies climber a bloorthanaee brothel hoverbed a lowgrade repairer a oneperson gas sub a striyian phallic symbol a oh no a schpleebop flyswat not so good eh said oney matriapoll patted the hairy head of the little beast correct little one not good at all a positive disaster we could have a cargocult or anything down there by now warm up the ethergraph ive got to get this back to the ship and however outlandish it may sound it is my opinion that just as our great country has in the past at least seen fit to provide covert support for democracies under internal foreign subversion situations so we ourselves are now being provided with aid by an alien superpower and why is this ill tell you why because they recognize that the west these united states of america are the real representatives of humanity and decency on this planet they want to help us to fend off the communist threat now whether we really need their help or not is a debatable moot point it could be arguable but if they want to give us this aid then i for one am not going to look a gifthorse in the mouth i say we take this by the horns and go for it cesare sat down to restrained applause imccs west coast headquarters conference room was packed with military and civilian personnel they had all listened intently to what the scientists and generals had to say and for many of them a lot of what they heard was new the company and the usaf along with the army and the navy too were launching a joint rd programme on the new technology as they were calling it and had every hope that they would soon have an unbeatable lead over the soviets personally cesare thought the gifts were from god but hed been dissuaded from saying so and the speech writers seemed to think helpful aliens was the most likely explanation cesare didnt think it mattered as long as they got the drop on the commies great speech sir fosse said afterwards thanks cesare said youre right i think they all know whats going on now but we have to watch the security angle on this real carefully now any leaks and the ruskies might get windy and launch a preemptive well i guess theyll find out eventually no matter how good our security is sir you know what some of the scientists are like hmm and then theyll start a third world war the mad dogs yes well just have to hope that we can develop the new technology quickly enough so that hmm stardate gmt galactic mean time ref dheyjquidhajvncjflzmxj qwertyuiop drmfsltd mmm message begins you stupid halfassed incompetent morons you have been pumping the goods slapbang onto one of the most rabidly sensitive rockballs it has ever been my misfortune to be within a lightyear of if you could see the mess down here you would vomit i have seen the mess down here and i vomited all over my mates and they did not like it close that expletive deleted by onboard ethergraph unit transporter down before this lot blow half the planet away dismantle the thing or hack it to bits with an axe if you have to but stop it yours sincerely matriapoll cus cesare was sitting in his manhattan office with fosse who he had liked enough to bring through to the east coast so that the younger man could see how things were run at the top you finished with that yet cesare said fosse looked up from it pays to increase your prayer power yes sir hmm cesare took the small magazine and slid a copy of a pamphlet called god is a businessman across the desk to fosse in exchange there was a knocking sound at the window the two men looked over in stunned surprise at a weird figure sitting on something that looked like a coffee table floating in the air just outside the window whoever or whatever it was it was holding on to the coffee table with one hand or paw tapping the glass with another and with a third was playing absentmindedly with the end of a bit of rope that was hanging in front of the window jeeeeeesus cesare gasped reaching slowly for the drawer with the alarm on the outside and the armalite on the inside the creature on the coffee table pushed lightly at the window it collapsed and the being came inside rubbing bits of glass off its furry spacesuit its face was a horrible bright red first person singular obtaining colloquial orgasm within a caledonian sandwich it said then looked annoyed and spoke incoherently into a grille set in its belly which replied it looked up and said sorry as i was saying i come in peace cesare whipped out the armalite and fired the bullets bounced off an invisible forcefield and one ricochetted back to cesares desk totally destroying a very expensive executive toy the creature on the coffee table looked upset you bastard it yelled and took a large pistol of its own from a holster and fired it at cesare a cloud of green glowing gas enveloped cesares face which dropped he let the gun drop too my god he breathed ive crapped my pants he stumbled waddling away from the desk and into his private toilet doubled up and holding the seat of his trousers the creature was looking into the muzzle of his pistol and scratching its head with one foot thats funny it said its meant to make your eyes explode it floated over to fosse stopping at the desk to lick appreciatively at the blue glop that had flowed slowly from the smashed executive toy fosse sweating smiled ingratiatingly and said i think were going to get along just fine the mps came for the other air force general hed been away so long it had been assumed hed deserted they dragged him out kicking and screaming the professor watched phlegmatically ever since the foreign minister had been informed that thered been a coup back home and he would be placed under house arrest at the embassy if he left the professor had resigned himself to whatever happened here hed even let the general who had just been arrested make models of the planned bomber from the papers of the alternative resources project he didnt know why he bothered staying but what the hell so you see when youre producing so much material from a factory ship that size you have to maximize the optimum output both in terms of real numbers and as a viable proportion of total units produced with the high rates of production attainable using light atoms and dust to build up or break down to basic molecules which then go to construct artefacts naturally you have a certain proportion that fail to meet the quite perfect standards we set all such material is dumped onto the surface of a nearby star or in the case of high heatresistance articles dumped somewhere inside it the material cannot be recycled economically because as a rule even the shoddy goods that we produce are very difficult to break up and the transmuters are tuned only to accept matter in comparatively small quanta in this case there seems to have been rather a serious leak the new machinery weve just installed has made a mistake in the relevant coordinates and well you know the rest you mean all this stuff is rubbish said cesare from the bathroom yes im afraid so there shouldnt be any more after a little while ive already contacted the factory ship please accept our sincere apologies wait a minute fosse said as the alien turned to go have these things been arriving just anywhere i mean is it a random thing yes the transporter got that right at least theyve been distributed fairly evenly over the globe most of them have sunk in the oceans of course and quite a few are still undiscovered in rain forests and deserts and in the antarctic and so on but well locate those through their coverings and get rid of them once we get another new machine online it held up three paws as fosse started to speak again i know it said youd like to keep the things but im afraid that isnt possible we do have a responsibility after all now you must excuse me goodbye the alien disappeared out of the window and went straight up into the sky narrowly missing a passing sst suddenly the alarm started sounding five armed guards rushed into the room and began restraining fosse cesare succeeded in stopping them before fosse had anything worse than severe bruising and a broken jaw he shooed the guards out and closed the door you realize what this means he said to fosse ill tell you what it means were using junk thats what it means itsh worsh than that shir fosse said that shing shaid the gi rubbish wash appearing all over the surfashe of the earth that meansh the bigg ow the bier the country the more of thoshe thingsh theyre going to get and rubbish or not they can probably all be ushed so do you know what country hash the greatesht landarea in the whole world shir cesare nodded confidently the good old us of a no shir fosse said shaking his head slowly cesare looked into fosses eyes his own eyes gradually widened and his upper lip trembled not yesh hotdamn the gifts kept appearing for two more weeks which they guessed was the time it took for the aliens message to get to the factory ship andor the time it took for the rubbish to get from the ship to earth they kept testing the equipment but if there was anything wrong with it they couldnt find out what it was the aliens must be really fussy the very last gift to arrive as far as they knew was the most interesting of all the new technology project was racing ahead budget vastly increased now that it was known the communists probably had the same stuff the spy satellites hadnt spotted anything but then theyd managed to keep pretty tight security themselves so that didnt prove anything they were near alamogordo where the last very large gift had appeared they had had to construct a special building around it to do the business with the covering cesare looked up at it ok but what does it do its a matter transmission machine said one scientist no it isnt said another whatever it is it isnt that it doesnt leave an original behind i think it uses continua to rubbish its a true matter transmission machine mr borges we cant hope to recreate this with our own technology but we can certainly use it shifting commodities urgently needed drugs disaster aid theres nothing wrong with it wrong with it why this is the most perfect piece of machinery in existence on the planet weve already shifted two hundred brandnew cadillacs from here to tampa and back again just as a trial it did it without a murmur and right on target good now as i was saying we could use this thing to vastly step up the productive capacity of certain key industries and make possible the rapid deployment of emergency supplies in a disastercrisis situation good thought cesare we can use it to bomb the ruskies what roared matriapoll when he got back and they told him you told it to junk itself and it disappeared up its own asshole it was an honest mistake said matriapolls foreman theyll use it theyll infest every nearby planet and system they can lay their coordinates on itll probably malfunction totally sooner or later dont worry about it by the way wheres your other mate i only see one dont talk to me about it matriapoll said huffily the idiot took a flyer for a joyride and collided with an sst youre sure this is going to work sir sure itll work cesare said they were sitting with a whole load of imcc people and military and political types in the underground commandpost under the matter transmitter we tested it by sending the same number of dummy warheads right round the world and back here they were all bangon itll be a clean sweep nothing can go wrong the transporter unduly sensitive to amongst other things radiation became somewhat mixed up however and to cut a short story shorter it blitzed the eastern seaboard of the united states of america messed the atlantic up a bit and bombed mauritania portugal and ireland after that it jammed and never worked again fosse thought that mr borges was taking it very well considering there was talk of a law suit cesare was on the phone trying to trace somebody anybody i know sir cesare looked up from the telephone his eyes reflecting the embarrassing red splotches spread over the giant world map on the far side of the room you remember feldman professor feldman no sir i dont think ive ever met the person doesnt matter hes dead but im getting hold of his number two in chicago hes all right ive heard what its like in the east it sounds terrible famine plague cannibalism anarchy flooding drought the works theres fantastic scope for a pet project of mine ive been nursing along for a few years now called the alternative resources project its perfect for this situation were ideally placed to take advantage of this its a peach believe me we could clean up piece hi kid well there i was about to do some reading but instead im writing to you ill explain later but first a little story bear with me this is partly to take my mind off things including the book i was starting to read but also to set up the first of a couple of coincidences anyway it was i think have to check my diaries to be sure id finished at uni that spring and gone off hitchhiking through europe over the summer paris bergen berlin venice rabat and madrid defined the limits of this whirlwind tour three months later i was on my way home and after staying with aunt jess in crawley id used the last of my money to buy a bus ticket from london to glasgow hitching out of london was notoriously awful night bus and it took ages staying off the motorways would you believe this was in the days before videos and minibars and hostesses and even toilets on buses the old coach groaned and whined through the rainsmeared darkness stopping at breeze block and formica transport cafes cold islands of fluorescence in the night especially then buses were for the not so well off i was the scruffy hitcher with long hair and jeans i was sitting beside an old guy wearing shiny trousers and a worn tweed jacket thin limbs and thick glasses in front of us an old lady reading peoples friend behind two lads with yesterdays sun the usual girning baby and harassed young mother somewhere at the back i watched the sodium lights drift by in droplet lines of orange and alternated sitting upright in the cramped seat and sliding down into it aching knees against the back of the seat in front and for the first couple of hours or so i was reading some sf novel wish i could remember the name but cant later i tried sleeping it wasnt easy you swung fretfully in and out never fully awake or completely asleep always conscious of the growling gear changes and the creaky ache in folded knees then the old guy started talking to me im one of these antisocial types well as you know who doesnt like to acknowledge the presence of other people when im travelling plus i was quite shy back then believe it or not and i really didnt want to talk to some old geezer i imagined i had nothing in common with but he started the conversation and i couldnt be rude and just cut it off if i remember right he pointed at the sf book wedged between my leg and the arm rest you believe in all that stuff then do you scottish accent not strong maybe borders or edinburgh i sighed here we go i thought sorry how do you mean ufos and all that well no i riffled the pages of the paperback as though looking for clues i just like science fiction not much of its about ufos this isnt i probably wouldnt read one about ufos oh he looked at the book i was getting embarrassed by its gaudy irrelevant cover and put it away are you a student yes well no i was i graduated ah science was it you were doing english oh but you like science im sure thats the way he put it i jotted a lot of this down next day and wrote a poem about it jack a couple of months later and im sure if i had my notes with me theyd confirm that was how he put it you like science so we got on to what hed always wanted to talk about he yes his name was jack couldnt understand how people thought they could tell something was so many million years old how could anyone tell what came when and where he couldnt understand he was a christian and the bible seemed much more sensible ever felt your heart sink wed been on the road two hours we were barely past northampton and i was stuck probably for the whole of the rest of the journey judging from the guys accent beside some ancient geek who thought the universe was created about teatime in bc holy shit being young and stupid i did actually try to explain i watched horizon i got new scientist sometimes let the poem take up the story from memory so make allowances and christ dear reader what could i do oh i made the lame halfhearted try i told him all was linked that those same laws of physics chemistry and math that let him sit here in this bus with the engine on that road dictated through the ages what was so carbon i mentioned its slow and sure decay even magnetic alignments frozen in the rocks by the heat of ancient fires the associated fossils floating continents erosion continuity and change but from the first tired syllable in fact before i knew it was pointless and somewhere back of all that wellinformedlayman stuff something a little more like the real me listened and looked at the old mans glasses they were old with thick frames dark brown the glass too was thick and thick with dust dandruff dead scales of old flesh hairs cemented there by grease and stale sweat obscured the views the scratches didnt and even if the prescription wasnt years ago exceeded by his dying sight the grime that personal impersonal dust sapped the bulky lenses of their use and removed inspected how could those rheumy eyes unaided see this aggravation of their disability this was when i was into using rhyme only very sparingly like any other poetic effect there was more rather labouring the point about views and cloudy thinking and so on but passing swiftly on we come to he took in nothing my throat got sore the borders came and soon he left met by his sister in some dismal little rainsoaked town ok so cut to last week me with the hard core of the creative writing group on an intercity heading for london for a reading at the ica kathy acker martin millar etc i was sitting across from mo the goodlooking indian guy with the tash very bright chose us instead of oxbridge god knows why and i tipped my microbottle of grouse into the plastic glass and took out the book i was going to start reading and mo just tensed im not too hot on body language i miss a lot i know you see i do listen to what you say but it was like mo suddenly became an ice statue and these waves of cold antagonism started flowing across the table at me the others noticed too and went quiet so id taken the satanic verses by salman rushdie out of the old daypack hadnt i and mos sitting there like he expects the book to bubble and squirm and burst into flames right there in my hands now i dont know how much youve heard about the kerfuffle surrounding this book it hasnt exactly been front page news and with any luck it wont be but since it was published quite a few muslims have been demanding it be banned withdrawn or whatever because it contains so they say some sort of semiblasphemous material in it relating to the koran id talked about this general area of authorial freedom and religious censorship with a couple of classes but still hadnt read the novel and it just hadnt occurred to me somebody like mo who hadnt been in either of those classes might be on the side of the bad guys mo is there a problem that is not a good book mr munro he said looking at it not me it is evil blasphemous embarrassed silence from the others look mo ill put the book away if it offends you i told him doing just that but i think we have to talk about this all right i havent read the book myself yet but i was talking to doctor metcalf the other day and he said he had and the passages some people found objectionable were a couple of pages at most and he couldnt see what the fuss was about i mean this is a novel mo it isnt a religious tract it means to be fiction that isnt the point mr munro mo said he was looking at my little red rucksack as though there was a nuclear bomb inside it rushdie has insulted all muslims he has spat in the face of every one of us its as if he has called all our mothers whores mo i said and couldnt help grinning as i put the rucksack down on the floor its only a story the form is not important it is a work in which allah is insulted mo said you cant understand mr munro there is nothing you hold that sacred oh no how about freedom of speech but when the national front wanted to use the students union you were with us on the demonstration werent you what about their freedom of speech they want to take it away from everybody else come on mo youre not denying them freedom of speech youre protecting the freedoms of the people theyd persecute if they were allowed any power but in the short term you are denying them the right to state their views in public are you not the way youd deny somebody the freedom to put a gun to another persons head and pull the trigger yes so clearly your belief in freedom generally can override any particular freedom these freedoms are not absolute nothing is sacred to you mr munro you base your beliefs on the products of human thought so it could hardly be otherwise you might believe in certain things but you do not have faith that comes with submission to the force of divine revelation so because i dont have what i think of as superstitions because i believe we just happen to exist and believe in science evolution whatever im not as worthy as somebody who has faith in an ancient book and a cruel desert god im sorry mo but for me christ and muhammed were both just men charismatic gifted in various ways but still just mortal human beings and the scholars and monks and disciples and historians who wrote about them or recorded their thoughts and their lives were inspired all right but not by god by something from inside them something every writer has in fact something every human has mo definitions faith is belief without proof i cant accept that now it doesnt bother me that you can so why does it bother you so much that i think the way i do or salman rushdie thinks the way he does clearly your soul is your own concern mr munro rushdies is his to think blasphemous thoughts is to restrict the sin to oneself but to blaspheme in public is deliberately to assault those who do believe it is to rape our souls can you believe this this guys heading for a first his fathers an astrophysicist for christs sake mos probably going to be a lecturer himself he already puts clearly at the start of his sentences good grief hes halfway there its very nearly but its midnight in the dark ages just the thickness of a book away the thickness of a skull away just the turn of a page away so an argument while the leafless trees and the cold brown fields stream by beyond the carriages doubleglazing and the inevitable wailing child howled somewhere in the distance but what do you say i asked him about the kids who rode across the minefields on their hondas clearing the way for the iranian army the hard way insane to me to mo maybe misguided maybe used but still glorious i told him that while i hadnt read the satanic verses i had read the koran and found it almost as ludicrous and objectionable as the bible and after that i got a bit loud while mo went very quiet and forbidding and curt and one of the others had verbally to separate us coincidence i read the penguin edition of the koran edited by a jew mo claims and unholy too because it puts the passages in the wrong order and viking who publish tsv are part of the same group fertile ground for a conspiracy theory mo and i shook hands later on but it spoiled the day good place to pause theyve just called us hi again well here i am bloody mary in one hand pen in the other using rushdies book to lean on got an aisle to one side empty seat to the other so i can spread myself out already taken my shoes off bit less crowded than id expected at this time of year jacksonville here i come i guess if it had been harvard theyd have paid for clipper class but you cant have everything right the coincidences i was talking about i started reading the satanic verses in the departure lounge there and how does it begin with two guys falling through the air after being blown up in a jumbo jet great i mean not that im a nervous flier or anything but this is not what one wishes to read before boarding a plane correct so thats one plus those other two instances of travel a conversationargument started by a book by two books reason against faith both times somehow seem to belong together with this journey bus train plane a travelling trinity of functioning technology to compare and contrast with the paranoid psychoses of religious belief what do you do with these people never mind what they might do to us if they ever get the whip hand what chance would i have to teach reason and compassion in twentiethcentury poetry in tehran reason shapes the future but superstition infects the present and coincidence convinces the credulous two things happen at the same time or one after another and we assume there must be a link well we sacrificed a virgin last year and there was a good harvest of course the ceremony to raise the sun works it comes up every morning doesnt it i say my prayers each night and the world hasnt ended yet dung beetle thinking life is too complicated for there not to be continual coincidences and we just have to come to terms with the fact that they merely happen and arent ordained that some things occur for no real reason whatsoever and that this is not a punishment and that is not a reward good grief the most copperbottomed platinumcard proof of divine intervention of some holy masterplan would be if there were no coincidences at all that really would look suspicious i dont know maybe im the one whos wrong i dont mean that either the christians or the muslims actually have the truth that either the geriatric gibberings of rome or the hysterical spurtings out of qom contain anything remotely resembling the real bottom line about where we come from or what its all about but that both might represent the way humanity truly wants to be perhaps they are its truest images maybe reason is the aberration thought perishes a little girl long curly blonde hair enormous blue eyes with one of those unspillable plastic cups held chubbily in both hands has just appeared in the aisle beside me expression very serious shes gazing at me with that disinterested intensity only little kids seem to be capable of gone again absolutely gorgeous but how do i know her parents arent christian fundamentalists and she wont grow up sincerely believing darwin was an agent of the devil and evolution a dangerous nonsense i guess i dont hey i used guess instead of suppose im thinking like an american already i guess i dont and it wouldnt matter if i did let the crazies burn rock albums and hunt the ark on ararat let them look stupid while we look to the future we just have to hope there are always more of us than there are of them or at least that we are more influential better placed whatever whatever indeed i smell food my semicircular canals tell me i think that we are starting to level out reaching our cruising altitude dark outside the windows last coincidence i never did specify in the poem but the wee daft town dismal rainsoaked in jack was called lockerbie about the only time you might have seen or heard the name was when we were driving up to scotland its just off the a not far over the border and according to this handy route map in my very own complimentary pan am inflight mag well fly right over it i suspect old jack kicked the bucket years ago to go to whatever award he imagined might be his but if he isnt dead and he does look out of his window tonight and he finally cleaned his glasses i wonder if he piece ppnkno recovered grid ref ny at on a refill pad part torn the state of the art excuses and accusations parharengyisa listach jaandeesih petrain dam kotosklo location as name rasdcodurersa diziet embless sma damarenhide co sc dear mr petrain i do hope you will accept my apologies for keeping you waiting so long included herewith at last is the information you asked me for all that time ago my personal wellbeing after which you so kindly enquired is all i could hope for as you will probably have been told and doubtless observed from my location or rather lack of it above i am no longer in contact ordinaire and my position in special circumstances is such that i occasionally have to leave my present address for considerable periods of time often with only a few hours notice during which to attend personally to any outstanding business apart from these sporadic jaunts my life is one of lazy luxury on a sophisticated stage threefour uncontacted where i enjoy all the benefits of an interestingly if not exotically foreign planet sufficiently developed to possess a reasonably civilized demeanour without suffering overmuch the global sameness which so often accompanies such progress a pleasant life then and when i am called away it usually feels more like a holiday than an unwelcome interruption in fact the only grit in the eye is a rather selfimportant offensivemodel drone whose exaggerated concern for my physical safety if not my peace of mind frequently becomes more exasperating than it is comforting my theory is that sc finds drones whose robust pugnacity has led them to some overlyviolent act in the past and then tells these pathological devices to guard their human special circumstancer successfully or be componented but that is by the bye anyway what with the remoteness of my habitation and the fact ive been offplanet for the past hundred days or so with drone of course and the delay while i consulted my notes and tried to dig from my memory what scraps of conversation and atmosphere i could and then fretting over the best way to present the resulting data well all this has taken rather a long time and to be honest the sedate mode of my present life has not helped me to be as brisk as i would have liked in the execution of this task i am glad to hear that you are only one of many scholars specializing in earth i always did think the place well worth studying and perhaps even learning from thankfully then you will have all the information that could possibly qualify as background and i apologize in advance if anything i include doubles on this but while i have stuck as strictly as memory machine and human will allow to what actually happened those hundred and fifteen years ago i have nevertheless tried to make the presentation of the following events and impressions as general and selfcontained as possible believing this to be the best way of attempting to conform with your request to describe what it really felt like to be there at the time i trust this combination of fact and sensation does not unduly affect the utility of either when you come to process the result in the course of your studies but in the event that it does and also if you have any other questions about earth at that time which you think i might be able to help answer please do not hesitate to get in touch with me i am only too happy to shed what light i can on a place that affected everyone who was there both profoundly and in the main i suspect permanently what follows then is as much as i and my bank can remember the conversations i have had to reconstruct as a rule i did not then practise fullrecord it being a minor piece of the ships frankly tediously eccentric etiquette not to overobserve its words life on board some dialogue mostly onplanet was recorded however and i have placed these sections between the following two symbols they have undergone a degree of tidying up removing the usual umms and ahs and so on but the original recordings are available to you from my bank without further authorization should you feel you require them for the sake of brevity i have reduced all full names to one or two parts and done my best to anglicize them all the times and dates are earthrelativelocal christian calendar incidentally i was most pleased to receive your news about the arbitrary and its escapades over these last few decades i confess to having been rather out of touch recently and became quite nostalgic on hearing again of that misfit machine but back to earth and back all those years ago and by the way my english has suffered over the past century of neglect the drone is translating all this and any mistakes are bound to be its diziet sma stranger here myself well i was in the neighborhood by the spring of the year ad the general contact unit arbitrary had been stationed above the planet earth for the best part of six months the ship of the escarpment class middle series had arrived during the previous november after clipping the edge of the planets expanding electromagnetic emission shell while on what it claimed was a random search how random the search pattern was i dont know the ship might well have had some information it wasnt telling us about some scrap of rumour half remembered from somebodys longdiscredited archives multitudinously translated and retransmitted vague and uncertain after all that time and movement and change just a mention that there was an intelligent humanish species there or at least the beginnings of one or the possibility of one you could ask the ship itself about this easily enough but getting an answer might be another matter you know what gcus are like anyway there we were over an almost classic sophisticated stage three perfect enough to have come right out of the book from a footnote if not a main chapter i think everybody including the ship was delighted we all knew the chances of stumbling across something like earth were remote even looking in the most likely places which we werent officially yet all we had to do was switch on the nearest screen or our own terminals and see it hanging there in real space less than a microsecond away shining blue and white or black velvet scattered with light motes its wide innocent face ever changing i remember staring at it for hours at a time on occasion watching the weather patterns slow swirl if we were stationary relative to it or gazing at its rolling curve of water cloud and land mass if we were moving it looked at once serene and warm implacable and vulnerable the contradictory nature of these impressions worried me for reasons i could not fully articulate and contributed to a vague feeling of apprehension i already had that somehow the place was a little too close to some perfection slightly too textbookish for its own good it needed thinking about of course even while the arbitrary was still turning and decelerating and then running through the old radio waves on its way to their source it was both pondering itself and signalling the general systems vehicle bad for business which was tramping a thousand years coreward and which we had left after a rest and refit only a year before what else the bad might have contacted to help it mull over the problem is probably on record somewhere but i havent considered it important enough to search out while the arbitrary described graceful powerorbits around earth and the great minds were considering whether to contact or not most of us in the arbitrary were in a frenzy of preparation for the first few months of its stay the ship acted like a gigantic sponge soaking up every scrap every bit of information it could find anywhere on the planet scouring tape and card and file and disc and fiche and film and tablet and page and scroll recording and filming and photographing measuring and charting and mapping sorting and collating and analyzing a fraction of this avalanche of data it felt like a lot but it was actually piffling small the ship assured us was stuffed into the heads of those of us sufficiently close in physique to pass for human on earth after a little alteration i got a couple of extra toes a joint removed from each finger and a rather generalized ear nose and cheekbone job the ship insisted on teaching me to walk differently as well and so by the start of i was fluent in german and english and probably knew more about the history and current affairs of the place than the vast majority of its inhabitants i knew dervley linter moderately well but then one knows everybody on a ship of only three hundred people he had been on the bad for business at the same time as i but we had only met after we both joined the arbitrary both of us had been in contact for about half the standard stretch so neither of us were exactly novices this to me makes his subsequent course of action doubly mystifying i was based in london for january and february spending the time tramping through museums viewing exhibits the ship already had perfect d holos of and not seeing the crated artefacts there wasnt room to show which were stored in basements or somewhere else entirely which the ship also had perfect holos of going to movies which the ship of course had copies of compiled from the very best prints and more relevantly perhaps attending concerts plays sports events and every sort and type of gathering and meeting the ship could discover i spent quite a lot of time just walking around and looking getting people talking all very dutiful but not always as easy or stressfree as it sounds the bizarre sexual mores of the locals could make it surprisingly awkward for a woman simply to go up and start talking to a man i suspect if i hadnt been a good ten centimetres taller than the average male id have had more trouble than i did my other problem was the ship itself it was always trying to get me to visit as many places as possible do as much as i could see all the people i was able to look at this listen to that meet her talk to him watch that wear this it wasnt so much that we wanted to do different things the ship rarely tried to get me to do anything i wouldnt want to do simply that the thing wanted me to be doing something all the time i was its envoy to the city its one human tendril a root through which it sucked with all its might trying to feed the apparently bottomless pit it called its memory i took holidays from the rush in the remote wild places irelands atlantic coast and the scottish highlands and islands in county kerry in galway and mayo in wester ross and sutherland and mull and lewis i dallied while the ship tried to bring me back with threats and cajolings and promises of all the exciting work it had for me to do but in early march i was finished in london so i was sent to germany and told to wander asked to drift and travel round and given a few places and dates things to do and see and think about now that i had stopped using english as it were i felt free to start reading works in that language for pleasure and that was what i did in my spare time what little of it there was the year turned gradually there was less snow the air became warmer and after thousands upon thousand of kilometres of roads and railway tracks and dozens of hotel rooms i was called back in late april to the ship to reel off my thoughts and feelings to it the ship was trying hard to get the mood of the planet to form the sort of impression that only direct human interaction can provide the raw material for it was sorting and rearranging and randomizing and resorting its data looking for patterns and themes and trying to gauge and relate all the sensations its human agents had encountered measuring them against whatever conclusions of its own it had come to while swimming through the ocean of facts and figures it had already dredged from the world we were by no means finished of course and i and all the others who were down onplanet would be there for some months yet but it was time to get some first impressions a ship with a view so you think we should contact do you i was lying sleepy and contented and full after a large dinner sprawled over a cushion couch in a rec area with the lights dimmed my feet on the arm of the seat my arms folded my eyes closed a gentle warm draught vaguely alpine in its fragrance was displacing the smell of the food i and some of my friends had consumed they were off playing some game in another part of the ship and i could just hear their voices over the bach i had persuaded the ship to like and which it was now playing for me yes i do and as soon as possible too theyd be upset too bad its for their own good i opened my eyes and flashed what was i hoped a palpably contrived smile at the ships remote drone which was sitting at a slightly drunken angle on the arm of the couch then i closed my eyes again probably it would be but that isnt the point really what is the point then really i knew the answer too well already but kept hoping the ship would come up with a more convincing reason than the one i knew it was going to give maybe one day how the ship said through the drone can we be sure were doing the right thing how do we know what is or would be for their own good unless over a very long period we observe matched areas of interest in this case planets and compare the effects of contacting and not contacting we ought to know well enough by now why sacrifice this place to some experiment we already know the results of why sacrifice it to your own restless conscience i opened one eye and looked at the remote drone on the couch arm a moment ago we agreed it would probably be for the best for them if we went in dont try and cloud the issue we could do it we should do it thats what i think yes said the ship but even so there would be technical difficulties given the volatility of the situation theyre on a cusp a highly heterogeneous but highly connected and stressedly connected civilization im not sure that one approach could encompass the needs of their different systems the particular stage of communication theyre at combining rapidity and selectivity usually with something added to the signal and almost always with something missed out means that what passes for truth often has to travel at the speed of failing memories changing attitudes and new generations even when this form of handicap is recognized all they ever try to do as a rule is codify it manipulate it tidy it up their attempts to filter become part of the noise and they seem unable to bring any more thought to bear on the matter than that which leads them to try and simplify what can only be understood by coming to terms with its complexity uh right i said still trying to work out exactly what the ship was talking about hmm the ship said when the ship says hmm its stalling the beast takes no appreciable time to think and if it pretends it does then it must be waiting for you to say something to it i outfoxed it though i said nothing but looking back at what we were talking about and what we each said we thought and trying to imagine what it was really about i do believe that it was then it decided to use me as it did that hmm marked a decision that meant i was involved the way i was in the linter affair and that was what the ship was really worried about that which all evening during the meal and afterwards slipping in the odd remark the occasional question the ship was really asking me about but i didnt know that at the time i was just sleepy and full and contented and warm and lying there talking to thin air while the remote drone sat on the arm of the couch and talked to me yes sighed the ship at last for all our data and sophistication and analyses and statistically correct generalizations these things remain singular and uncertain aw i tutted its a hard life being a gcu poor ship poor papageno you may mock my little chick the ship said with a sort of fakedly hurt sniffiness but the final responsibility remains mine ah youre an old fraud machine i grinned over at the drone youll get no sympathy out of me you know what i think ive told you you dont think wed spoil the place you seriously think theyre ready for us for what wed do to them even with the best of intentions ready for it what does that matter what does it even mean of course they arent ready for it of course well spoil the place are they any more ready for world war three you seriously think we could mess the place up more than theyre doing at the moment when theyre not actually out slaughtering each other theyre inventing ingenious new ways to massacre each other more efficiently in the future and when theyre not doing that theyre committing speciescide from the amazon to borneo or filling the seas with shit or the air or the land they could hardly make a better job of vandalizing their own planet if we gave them lessons but you still like them i mean as people the way they are no you like them the way they are i told the ship pointing at the remote drone they appeal to your sense of untidiness you think i havent been listening all the times youve gone on about how were infecting the whole galaxy with sterility isnt that the phrase i may have used that form of words the ship agreed vaguely but dont you think oh i cant be bothered thinking now i said levering myself off the couch i stood up yawning and stretching wheres the gang gone your companions are about to watch an amusing film i found onplanet fine i said ill watch it too which way the remote drone floated up from the couch arm follow me i left the alcove where wed eaten the drone turned round as it meandered through curtains and around chairs tables and plants it looked back at me you dont want to talk to me i only want to explain tell you what ship you wait here and ill hit dirt and find you a priest and you can unburden yourself to him the arbitrary goes to confession definitely an idea whose time has come i waved at some people i hadnt seen for a while and kicked some cushions out of my way you could tidy this place up a bit too your wish the remote drone sighed and stopped to supervise the cushions which were dutifully rearranging themselves i stepped down into a darkened soundshrouded area where people were sitting or lying in front of a d screen the film was just starting it was science fiction of all things called dark star just before i stepped through the soundfield i heard the remote drone behind me sigh to itself again ah its true what they say april is the cruellest month unwitting accomplice it was about a week later when i was due to go back onplanet to berlin when the ship wanted to talk to me again things were going on as usual the arbitrary spent its time making detailed maps of everything within sight and without dodging american and soviet satellites and manufacturing and then sending down to the planet hundreds upon thousands of bugs to watch printing works and magazine stalls and libraries to scan museums workshops studios and shops to look into windows gardens and forests and to track buses trains cars seaships and planes meanwhile its effectors and those on its main satellites probed every computer monitored every landline tapped every microwave link and listened to every radio transmission on earth all contact craft are natural raiders theyre made to love to be busy to enjoy sticking their big noses into other peoples business and the arbitrary for all its eccentricities was no different i doubt if it was or is ever happier than when doing that vacuumcleaner act above a sophisticated planet by the time we were ready to leave the ship would have contained in its memory and would have onwardtransmitted to other vessels every bit of data ever stored in the history of the planet that hadnt been subsequently obliterated every and every letter every pixel every sound every subtlety of line and texture ever fashioned it would know where every mineral deposit was buried where all the treasure as yet undiscovered lay where every sunken ship was where every secret grave had been dug and it would know the secrets of the pentagon the kremlin the vatican on earth of course they were quite oblivious to the fact they had a million tonnes of highly inquisitive and outrageously powerful alien spaceship orbiting around them and sure enough the locals were doing all the things they normally did murdering and starving and dying and maiming and torturing and lying and so on pretty much business as usual in fact and it bothered the hell out of me but i was still hoping wed decide to interfere and stop most of that shit it was about this time two boeing s collided on the ground in a spanish island colony i was reading lear for the second time sitting underneath a fullsize palm tree the ship had found the tree in the dominican republic marked to be bulldozed to make way for a new hotel thinking it might be nice to have some plants about the place the arbitrary dug the palm up one night and brought it aboard complete with its root system and several tens of cubic metres of sandy soil and planted it in the centre of our accommodation section this required quite a lot of rearranging and a few people whod happened to be asleep while all this was going on woke to be confronted with a twentymetre high tree when they opened their cabin doors rising up in what had become a great central well in the acc section contact people are used to putting up with this sort of thing from their ships however and so everybody took it in their stride anyway on any sensible calibrated scale of gcu eccentricity such a harmless even benign prank would scarcely register i was sitting within sight of the door to lindanes cabin he came out chatting to tel ghemada li was flicking brazil nuts into the air and running forward or bending over backwards to catch them with his mouth while trying to carry on his side of the conversation tel was amused li flicked one nut particularly far and had to dive and twist under its trajectory crashing into the floor and sliding into the stool i had my feet up on and yes i do always loaf a lot onboard ships no idea why li rolled over on his back making a show of looking around him for the brazil nut he looked mystified tel shook her head smiling then waved goodbye she was one of the unfortunates trying to get some sort of human grasp of earths economics and deserved all the light relief she could get i recall that all through that year you could tell the economists by their distraught look and slightly glazedlooking eyes li well li was just a wierdo and forever conducting a running battle with the finer sensibilities of the ship thank you li i said putting my feet back on the upended stool li lay breathing heavily on the floor and looking up at me then his lips parted in a grin to reveal the nut caught between his teeth he swallowed stood pulled his pants halfway down and proceeded to relieve himself against the trunk of the tree good for the growth he said when he saw me frowning at him wont be any good for your growth if the ship catches you and sends a knife missile to sort you out i can see what mr ndane is doing and i wasnt going to dignify his actions with as much as a comment said a small drone floating down from the foliage it was one of a few drones the ship had built to follow a couple of birds that had been in the palm when it was hoisted up to the ship the birds had to be fed and tidied up after the ship was proud that so far every dropping had been neatly intercepted in midair but i do admit i find his behaviour slightly worrying perhaps he wants to tell us what he feels about earth or me or worse still perhaps he doesnt know himself simpler than that li said putting his dick away i needed a piss he bent down and ruffled my hair before plonking himself down at my side urinal in your room packed up has it muttered the drone cant say i blame it i hear youre off back to the wilderness again tomorrow li said crossing his arms and looking seriously at me im free this evening in fact im free now i could offer you a small token of my esteem if you like your last night with the good guys before you go off to infiltrate the barbarians small i said li smiled made an expansive gesture with both hands well modesty forbids no i do youre making a dreadful mistake you know he said jumping up and rubbing his belly absently while looking in the direction of the nearest dining area im in really fine form at the moment and i really aint doing anything tonight too right you arent he shrugged and blew me a kiss then skipped off li was one of those who just wouldnt have passed for earthhuman without a vast amount of physical alteration hairy and the wrong shape imagine quasimodo crossed with an ape but frankly i think you could have put him down looking as normal as an ibm salesman and hed still have been in jail or a fight within the hour he couldnt have accepted the limitations on ones behaviour a place like earth tends to insist on denied his chance to go amongst the people of earth li gave informal briefings for the people who were going down to the surface those who would listen anyway lis briefings were short and to the point he walked up said the fundamental thing to remember is this most of what you encounter will be shit just a less precise restatement of sturgeons law the drone and walked away again ms sma the small drone floated over and settled into the hollow left by lis behind i was wondering if you would do me a small favour when you go back down tomorrow what sort of favour i said putting regan and goneril down well id be terribly grateful if youd call in at paris before you go to berlin if you wouldnt mind i dont mind i said i hadnt been to paris yet oh good whats the problem no problem id just like you to drop in on dervley linter i think you know him well just pop by for a chat thats all uhhuh i said i wondered what the ship was up to i did have an idea wrong as it turned out the arbitrary like every ship ive ever met in contact loved intrigues and plots the devices are forever using their spare time to cook up pranks and schemes little secret plans opportunities to use delicate artifices to get people to do things say things behave in a certain way just for the fun of it the arbitrary was a notorious matchmaker perfectly convinced that it knew exactly who would be best for each other always trying to fix the crew placements to set up as many potential couples or other suitable combinations as it could it occurred to me that it was up to something like this now worried that i hadnt been sexually active recently and perhaps also concerned that my last few partners had been female the arb always did have a distinctly heterosexual bent for some reason yes just a little talk find out how things are going you know the drone started to rise from the seat i reached out and grabbed it set it down on lear on my lap fixed its sensing band with what i hoped was a steely glare of my own and said what are you up to nothing the machine protested id just like you to look in on dervley and see what the two of you think about earth together get a synthesis you know you two havent met since we arrived and i want to see what ideas you can come up with exactly how we should go about contacting them if thats what we decide to do or what else we can do if we decide not to thats all no skullduggery dear sma hmm i nodded all right i let the drone go it floated up honest the ship said and the drones aura field flashed rosy with bonhomie no skullduggery it made a bobbing motion indicating the book on my lap you read your lear ill jet off a bird flashed by closely followed by another drone the one id been talking to tore off in pursuit i shook my head competing for bird shit already i watched the bird and the two machines dart down a corridor like the remains of some bizarre dogfight then went back to scene iv the french camp a tent enter with drum and colours cordelia doctor and soldiers helpless in the face of your beauty synchronize your dogmas now the arbitrary wasnt actually insane it did its job very well and as far as i know none of its pranks ever actually hurt anybody at least not physically but you have to be a bit wary of a ship that collects snowflakes put it down to its upbringing the arb was a product of one of the manufacturies in the yinang orbitals in the dahasskhree ive checked and those factories have produced a good percent of the million or so gcus there are blatting about the place thats quite a few craft about ten thousand of course ms smas mental arithmetic never was too hot the drone and as far as i can see theyre all a bit crazy it must be the minds there i suppose they seem to like turning out eccentric ships shall i name names see if youve heard of any of this lot and their little escapades the cantankerous only slightly bent i thought he was with you space monster a series of unlikely explanations big sexy beast never talk to strangers itll be over by christmas this is an extremely strained translation but its the best available the drone funny it worked last time boo ultimate ship the second etc etc need i say more anyway true to form the arbitrary had a little surprise for me when i walked into the top hangar space the next morning dawn was sweeping like an unrolled carpet of light and shadow over the northern european plain and pinking the snowy peaks of the alps while i walked along the main corridor to the bay yawning and checking my passport and other papers at least partly to annoy the ship i knew damn well it wouldnt have made any mistakes and making sure the drone following me had all my luggage i stepped into the hangar and was immediately confronted by a large red volvo station wagon it sat gleaming in the midst of the collection of modules drones and platforms i wasnt in the mood to argue so i let the drone deposit my gear in the back and went so sit in the drivers seat shaking my head there was nobody else about i waved goodbye to the drone as the automobile lifted gently into the air and made its way to the rear of the ship over the tops of the other devices in the bay they glittered in the brightness of the hangar lights as the big estate wheels sagging was pushed above them to the doorfields and then into space the bay door started to move back into place as we dropped beneath it and turned the door slid into place cutting off the light from the bay i was in perfect darkness for a moment then the ship switched on the autos lights ah sma the ship said from the stereo what seatbelt i remember sighing i think i shook my head again too we dropped in blackness still inside the ships inner field as we finished turning the volvos headlights picked out the slabsided length of the arbitrary showing a very dull white inside its darkfield actually it was quite impressive and oddly calming the ship killed the lights as we left the outer field suddenly i was in real space the great gulf of spangled black before me the planet like some vast droplet of water beneath swirled with the pinpoint lights of central and south america i could make out san josé panama city bogotá and quito i looked back but even knowing the ship was there i could see no sign that the stars it showed on its field skin werent real i always did that and always felt the same twinge of regret even fear knowing i was leaving our safe haven but i soon settled and enjoyed the trip down riding through the atmosphere in my absurd motor car the ship switched on the stereo again and played me serenade by the steve miller band somewhere over the atlantic off portugal i think and just at the line the sun comes up and shines all around me guess what happened all i can suggest is that you look again at some picture of it half black with a billion scattered lights and streaks of dawning colour i cant describe it further we fell quickly the car landed in the middle of some old coal workings in the unlovely north of france near bethune by that time it was fully light the field around the car popped and the two small platforms under the auto appeared white slivers in the misty morning they disappeared with their own pops as the ship displaced them i drove to paris living in kensington id had a smaller car a vw golf and the volvo was like a tank after that the ship spoke through my terminal brooch telling me which route to take to paris and then guided me through the streets to linters place even so it was a slightly traumatic experience because the whole city seemed snarled up with some cycle race so when i eventually arrived in the courtyard just off the boulevard st germain where linter had an apartment i was in no mood to find that he wasnt there well where the hell is he i demanded standing on the balcony outside the apartment hands on hips glaring at the locked door it was a sunny day getting hot i dont know the ship said through the brooch i looked down at the thing for all the good that did what dervley has taken to leaving his terminal in his apartment when he goes out he i stopped there took a few deep breaths and sat down on the steps i switched my terminal off something was going on linter was still here in paris despite the fact that this was where hed been sent originally his stay here shouldnt have been any longer than mine in london nobody on the ship had seen him since wed first arrived it looked like he hadnt been back to the ship at all all the rest of us had why was he staying on here and what was he thinking of going out without taking his terminal it was the act of a madman what if something happened to him what if he got knocked down in the street this seemed quite likely judging from the standard of parisian driving id encountered or beaten up in a fight and why was the ship treating all this so matteroffactly going out without your terminal was acceptable enough on some cosy orbital and positively commonplace in a rock or onboard ship but here like taking a stroll through a game park without a gun and just because the natives did it all the time didnt make it any less crazy i was quite certain now there was much more to this little jaunt to paris than the ship had led me to believe i tried to get some more information out of the beast but it stuck to its ignorant act and so i gave up and left the car in the courtyard while i went for a walk i walked down the st germain until i came to the st michel then headed for the seine the weather was bright and warm the shops busy the people as cosmopolitan as they were in london if a little more stylishly dressed on average i think i was disappointed at first the place wasnt that different you saw the same products the same signs mercedesbenz westinghouse american express de beers and so on but gradually a more animated flavour of the city came through a little more of millers paris id zipped through the tropics the previous evening as well as crossing them that morning even if it was a little tamed with the passing of the years it was a different mix another blend of the same ingredients the traditional the commercial the nationalist i rather liked the language i could just about make myself understood at a fairly low level my accent was formidable the ship had assured me and could more or less read all the signs and advertisements but spoken at the standard rate i couldnt make out more than one word in ten so the language in the mouths of those parisiens was like music one unbroken flow of sound on the other hand the populace seemed very reluctant to use any other language save their own even when they were technically able to and if anything there seemed to be even fewer people in paris willing and able to speak english than there were londoners likewise equipped to tackle french postimperial snobbishness perhaps in the shadow of notre dame i stood thinking hard as i looked at that dull froth of brown stone which is the façade i didnt go in i was fed up with cathedrals and by that time even my interest in castles was flagging the ship wanted me to talk with linter for reasons i couldnt understand and it wasnt prepared to explain nobody had seen the guy nobody had been able to call him and nobody had received a message from him all the time wed been over earth what had happened to him and what was i supposed to do about it i walked along the banks of the seine with all that cluttered heavy architecture around me and wondered i remembered the smell of roasting coffee coffee was soaring in price at the time them and their commodities and the light that struck off the cobbles as little men turned on taps inside the sidewalks to wash the streets they used old rags slung in front of the kerbs to divert the water this way and that for all my fruitless pondering it was still wonderful to be there there was something different about the city something that really did make you feel glad to be alive somehow i found my way to the upstream end of the ile de cité although id meant to head towards the pompidou centre and then double back and cross by the pont des arts there was a little triangular park at the island end like some green forecastle on a seaship prowfacing those bigcity waters of the dirty old seine i walked into the park hands in pockets just wandering and found some curiously narrow and austere almost threatening steps leading down between masses of roughsurfaced white stone i hesitated then went down as though towards the river i found myself in an enclosed courtyard the only other exit i could see was down a slope to the water but that was barred by a jagged construction of black steel i felt uneasy there was something about the hard geometry of the place that induced a sense of threat of smallness and vulnerability those jutting weights of white stone somehow made you think of how delicately crushable human bones were i seemed to be alone i stepped reluctantly inquisitive into the dark narrow doorway that led back underneath the sunlit park it was the memorial to the deportation i remember a thousand tiny lights in rows down a grilledoff tunnel a recreated cell fine words embossed but i was in a daze its over a century ago now but i still feel the cold of that place i speak these words and a chill goes up my back i edit them on screen and the skin on my arms calves and flanks goes tight the effect remains as sharp as it was at the time the details were as hazy a few hours afterwards as they are now and as they will be until the day i die just another victim of the ambient morality i came out stunned i was angry at them then angry at them for surprising me touching me like that of course i was angry at their stupidity their manic barbarity their unthinking animal obedience their appalling cruelty everything that the memorial evoked but what really hit me was that these people could create something that spoke so eloquently of their own ghastly actions that they could fashion a work so humanly redolent of their own inhumanity i hadnt thought them capable of that for all the things id read and seen and i didnt like to be surprised i left the island and walked along the right bank down towards the louvre and wandered through its galleries and halls seeing but not seeing just trying to calm down again i glanded a little softnow effectively untranslatable the drone to help the process along and by the time i came to the mona lisa i was quite composed again the gioconda was a disappointment too small and brown and surrounded by people and cameras and security the lady smiled serenely from behind thick glass i couldnt find a seat and my feet were getting sore so i wandered out into the tuileries along broad and dusty avenues between small trees and eventually found a bench by an octagonal pond where small boys and their pères sailed model yachts i watched them love maybe it was love could that be it had linter fallen for somebody and was the ship therefore concerned he might not want to leave if and when we had to just because that was the start of a thousand sentimental stories didnt mean that it didnt actually happen i sat by the octagonal pond thinking about all this and the same wind that ruffled my hair made the sails of the little yachts flutter and flap and in that uncertain breeze they nosed through the choppy waters and banged into the wall of the pond or were caught by chubby hands and sent bobbing back out again across the waves i circled back via the invalides with more predictable trophies of war old panther tanks and rows of ancient cannons like bodies stacked against a wall i had lunch in a smoky little place near the st sulpice metro you sat on high stools at a bar and they selected a piece of red meat for you and put it dripping blood on a grid over an open pit filled with burning charcoal the meat sizzled on the grille right in front of you while you had your aperitif and you told them when you felt it was ready they kept going to take it off and serve it to me and i kept saying non non un peu plus sil vous plait the man next to me ate his rare with blood still oozing from the centre after a few years in contact you get used to that sort of thing but i was still surprised i could sit there and do that especially after the memorial i knew so many people whod have been outraged at the very thought come to think of it there would have been millions of vegetarians on earth whod have been equally disgusted would they have eaten our vatgrown meats i wonder the black grill over the charcoal pit kept reminding me of the gratings in the memorial but i just kept my head down and ate my meal or most of it i had a couple of glasses of rough red wine too which i let have some effect and by the time i was finished i was feeling reasonably together again and quite well disposed to the locals i even remembered to pay without being asked i dont think you ever quite get used to buying and went out into the bright sunshine i walked back to linters looking at shops and buildings and trying not to get knocked down in the street i bought a paper on the way back to see what our unsuspecting hosts thought was newsworthy it was oil jimmy carter was trying to persuade americans to use less petrol and the norwegians had a blowout in the north sea the ship had mentioned both items in its more recent synopses but of course it knew carters measures werent going to get through without drastic amendment and that the drilling rig had had a piece of equipment fitted upside down i selected a magazine as well so arrived back at linters clutching my copy of stern and expecting to have to drive away id already made tentative plans going to berlin via the first world war graves and the old battle grounds following the theme of war death and memorials all the way to the riven capital of the third reich itself but linters car was there in the courtyard parked beside the volvo his auto was a rolls royce silver cloud the ship believed in indulging us anyway it claimed that making a show was better cover than trying to stay inconspicuous western capitalism in particular allowed the rich just about the right amount of behavioural leeway to account for the oddities our alienness might produce i went up the steps and pressed the bell i waited for a short while hearing noises within the flat a small notice on the far side of the courtyard caught my attention and brought a sour smile to my face linter appeared unsmiling at the door he held it open for me bowing a little ms sma the ship told me youd be coming hello i entered the apartment was much larger than id anticipated it smelled of leather and new wood it was light and airy and well decorated and full of books and records tapes and magazines paintings and objets dart and it didnt look one little bit like the place id had in kensington it felt lived in linter waved me towards a black leather chair at one end of a persian carpet covering a teak floor and went over to a drinks cabinet turning his back to me do you drink whisky i said in english with or without the e i didnt sit down but wandered around the room looking i have johnny walker black label fine i watched him clamp one hand round the square bottle and pour dervley linter was taller than me and quite muscular to an experienced eye there was something not quite right in earth human terms about the set of his shoulders he leaned over the bottles and glasses like a threat as though he wanted to bully the drink from one to the other anything in it no thanks he handed me the glass bent to a small fridge extracted a bottle and poured himself a budweiser the real stuff from czechoslovakia finally this little ceremony over he sat down bahaus chair and it looked original his face was calm serious each feature seemed to demand separate attention the large mobile mouth the flared nose the bright but deepset eyes the stagevillain brows and surprisingly lined forehead i tried to recall what hed looked like before but could only remember vaguely so it was impossible to tell how much of the way he looked now had been carried over from what would be classed as his normal appearance he rolled the beer glass around in his large hands the ship seems to think we should talk he said he drank about half the beer in one gulp and placed the glass on a small table made of polished granite i adjusted my brooch you dont think we should though no he spread his hands wide then folded them over his chest he was dressed in two pieces of an expensive looking black suit trousers and waistcoat i think it might be pointless well i dont know does there have to be a point to everything i thought the ship suggested we might have a talk thats did it all yes i coughed i dont it didnt tell me whats going on linter looked steadily at me then down at his feet black brogues i looked around the room as i sipped my whisky looking for signs of female habitation or for anything that might indicate there were two people living here i couldnt tell the room was crowded with stuff prints and oils on the walls most of the former either breughels or lowrys tiffany lampshades a bang and olafsen hifi unit several antique clocks what looked like a dozen or so dresden figurines a chinese cabinet of black lacquer a large fourfold screen with peacocks sewn onto it the myriad feathers like displayed eyes what did it tell you linter asked i shrugged what i said it said it wanted me to have a talk with you he smiled in an unimpressed sort of way as though the whole conversation was hardly worth the effort then looked away through the window he didnt seem to be going to say anything a flash of colour caught my eye and i looked over at a large television one of those with small doors that close over the screen and make it look like a cabinet when it isnt in use the doors werent fully shut and it was switched on behind them do you want linter said no its i began but he rose out of the seat gripping its elegant arms went to the set and spread its doors open with a dramatic gesture before resuming his seat i didnt want to sit and watch television but the sound was down so it wasnt especially intrusive the control units on the table linter said pointing i wish you somebody wish youd tell me whats going on he looked at me as though this was an obvious lie rather than a genuine plea and glanced over at the tv it must have been on one of the ships own channels because it was changing all the time showing different shows and programmes from a variety of countries using various transmission formats and waiting for a channel to be selected a group in bright pink suits danced mechanically to an unheard song they were replaced with a picture of the ekofisk platform spouting a dirty brown fountain of oil and mud then the screen changed again to show the crowded cabin scene from a night at the opera so you dont know anything linter lit a sobranie this like the ships hmm had to be for effect unless he liked the taste which has never been a convincing line he didnt offer me one no no no i dont look i can see the ship wanted me here for more than this talk but dont you play games too that crazy thing sent me down here in that volvo the whole way i half expected it not to have baffled it either i was waiting for a pair of mirages to come to intercept ive got a long drive to berlin as well you know so just tell me or tell me to go all right he drew on the cigarette studying me through the smoke he crossed his legs and brushed some imaginary fluff off the trouser cuffs and stared at his shoes ive told the ship that when it leaves im staying here on earth regardless of what else might happen he shrugged whether we contact or not he looked at me challenging any particular reason i tried to sound unfazed i still thought it must be a woman yes i like the place he made a noise between a snort and a laugh i feel alive for a change i want to stay im going to im going to live here you want to die here he smiled looked away from me then back yes quite positively this shut me up for a moment i felt uncomfortable i got up and walked round the room looking at the bookshelves he seemed to have read about the same amount as me i wondered if hed crammed it all or read any of it at normal speed dostoevsky borges greene swift lucretius kafka austin grass bellow joyce confucius scott mailer camus hemingway dante you probably will die here then i said lightly i suspect the ship wants to observe not contact of course thatll suit me fine hmm well it isnt official yet but i thats the way itll go i suspect i turned away from the books it does you really want to die here are you serious how he was sitting forward in the chair combing his black hair with one hand pushing the long ringed fingers through his curls a silver stud decorated the lobe of his left ear fine he repeated itll suit me perfectly well ruin this place if we interfere theyll ruin it if we dont dont be trite sma he stubbed the cigarette out hard breaking it in half mostly unsmoked and if they blow the place up mmm well well what he demanded a siren sounded on the st germain dopplering might be what theyre heading for want to see them moth themselves in front of their own ah bullshit his face crinkled with annoyance bullshit yourself i told him even the ships worried the only reason they havent made a final decision yet is because they know how bad itll look short term if they do sma i dont care i dont want to leave i dont want to have any more to do with the ship or the culture or anything connected with it you must be crazy as crazy as they are theyll kill you youll get crushed under a truck or mangled in a plane crash or burned up in some fire or something so i take my chances well what about what theyd call the security aspect what if youre only injured and they take you to hospital youll never get out again theyll take one look at your guts or your blood and theyll know youre alien youll have the military all over you theyll dissect you not very likely but if it happens it happens i sat down again i was reacting just the way the ship had known i would i thought linter was mad just the way the arbitrary did and it was using me to try and talk some sense into him doubtless the ship had already tried but equally obviously the nature of linters decision was such that the arbitrary was the last thing that was going to have any influence technologically and morally the ship represented the most finely articulated statement the culture was capable of producing and that very sophistication had the beast hamstrung here i have to admit i felt a degree of admiration for linters stand even though i still thought he was being stupid there might or might not be a local involved but i was already getting the impression it was more complicated and more difficult to handle than that maybe he had fallen in love but not with anything as simple as a person maybe hed fallen in love with earth itself the whole fucking planet so much for contact screening they were supposed to keep people out who might fall like that if that was what had happened then the ship had problems indeed falling in love with somebody they say is a little like getting a tune into your head and not being able to stop whistling it except much more so and from what id heard going native the way i suspected linter might be was as far beyond loving another person as that was beyond getting a tune stuck in your head i felt suddenly angry at linter and the ship i think youre taking a very selfish and stupid risk thats not just bad for you and bad for the for us for the culture but also bad for these people if you do get caught if youre discovered they are going to get paranoid and they might feel threatened and hostile in any contact they are involved in or ex you could send them make them crazy insane you said they were that already and you do stand a less chance of living your full term even if you dont so you live for centuries how dyou explain that they may have antigeriatrics themselves by that time besides i can always move around they wont have antigeriatrics for fifty years or more centuries if they relapse even without a holocaust yeah so move around make yourself a fugitive stay alien stay apart youll be as cut off from them as you will be from us ah hell you always will be anyway i was talking loudly by now i waved one arm at the bookshelves sure read the books and see the films and go to concerts and theatre and opera and all that shit you cant become them youll still have culture eyes culture brain you cant just cant deny all that pretend it never happened i stamped one foot on the floor god dammit linter youre just being ungrateful listen sma he said rising out of the seat grabbing his beer and stalking about the room gazing out of the windows neither of us owes the culture anything you know that owing and being obliged and having duties and responsibilities and everything like that thats what these people have to worry about he turned round to look at me but not me not us you do what you want to do the ship does what it wants to do i do what i want to do alls well lets just leave each other alone yes he looked back at the small courtyard finishing his beer you want to be like them but you dont want to have their responsibilities i didnt say i wanted to be like them to to whatever extent i do i want to have the same sort of responsibilities and that doesnt include worrying about what a culture starship thinks that isnt something any of them normally tend to worry about what if contact surprises us both and does come in i doubt that me too very much thats why i think it might happen i dont think so though it is we who need them not the other way round linter turned and stared at me but i wasnt going to start arguing on a second front now but he said after a pause the culture can do without me he inspected his drained glass its going to have to i was silent for a while watching the television flip through channels what about you though i asked eventually can you do without it easily linter laughed listen dyou think i havent no you listen how long do you think this place is going to stay the way it is now ten years twenty cant you see how much this place has to alter in just the next century were so used to things staying much the same to society and technology at least immediately available technology hardly changing over our lifetimes that i dont know any of us could cope for long down here i think itll affect you a lot more than the locals theyre used to change used to it all happening fast all right you like the way it is now but what happens later what if is as different from now as this is from this might be the end of a golden age world war or not what chance do you think the west has of keeping the status quo with the third world im telling you end of the century and youll feel lonely and afraid and wonder why theyve deserted you and youll be the worst nostalgic theyve got because youll remember it better than they ever will and you wont remember anything else from before now he just stood looking at me the tv showed part of a ballet in black and white then an interview two white men who looked american somehow and the fuzzy picture looked us standard then a quiz show then a puppet show again in monochrome you could see the strings linter put his glass down on the granite table and went over to the hifi turning on the tape deck i wondered what little bit of planetary accomplishment i was going to be treated to the picture on the screen settled to one programme for a while it looked vaguely familiar i was sure id seen it a play last century american writer but linter went back to his seat while the music began the four seasons henry james the ambassadors it was a tv production id seen on the bbc while i was in london or maybe the ship had repeated it i couldnt recall what i did recall was the plot and the setting both of which seemed so apposite to my little scene with linter that i started to wonder whether the beast upstairs was watching all this probably was come to think of it and not much point in looking for anything the ship could produce bugs so small the main problem with camera stability was brownian motion was the ambassadors a sign from it then whatever the play was replaced by a commercial for odoreaters ive told you linter brought me back from my musings speaking quietly im prepared to take my chances do you think i havent thought it all through before many times this isnt sudden sma i felt like this my first day here but i waited for months before i said anything so id be sure its what ive been looking for all my life what ive always wanted i always knew id know it when i found it and i have he shook his head sadly i thought im staying sma i shut up i suspected that despite what hed just said he hadnt thought about how much the planet would change during his long likely lifetime and there were still other things to be said but i didnt want to press too hard too quickly i made myself relax on the couch and shrugged anyway we dont know for sure what the ships going to do what theyll decide he nodded picked up a paperweight from the granite table and turned it over and over in his hand the music shimmered through the room like the sun on water reflected points producing lines dancing quietly i know he said still gazing at the heavy globe of twisted glass this must seem like a mad idea but i just just want the place he looked at me for the first time i thought without a challenging scowl or stern coolness i know what you mean i said but i cant understand it perfectly maybe im more suspicious than you are its just you tend to be more concerned for other people than for yourself sometimes you assume they havent thought things through the way you would have yourself i sighed almost laughed i guess im assuming youll hoping youll change your mind linter was silent for a while still studying the hemisphere of coloured glass maybe i will he shrugged massively maybe i will he said looking at me speculatively he coughed did the ship tell you ive been to india india no no it didnt i went there for a couple of weeks i didnt tell the arbitrary i was going though it found out of course why i mean why did you want to go i wanted to see the place linter said sitting forward in the seat rubbing the paperweight then replacing it on the granite table and rubbing his palms together it was beautiful beautiful if id had any second thoughts they vanished there he looked at me face suddenly open intent his hands outstretched fingers wide its the contrast the he looked away apparently made less articulate by the vividness of the impression the highlights the light and shade of it all the squalor and the muck the cripples and the swollen bellies the whole poverty of it makes the beauty stand out a single pretty girl in the crowds of calcutta seems like an impossibly fragile bloom like a i mean you cant believe that the filth and the poverty hasnt somehow contaminated her its like a miracle a revelation then you realize that shell only be like that for a few years that shell only live a few decades then shell wear and have six kids and wither the feeling the realization the staggering his voice trailed off and he looked slightly helplessly almost vulnerably at me it was just the point at which to make my most telling cutting comment but also just the point at which i could do no such thing so i sat still saying nothing and linter said i dont know how to explain it its alive im alive if i did die tomorrow it would have been worth it just for these last few months i know im taking a risk in staying but thats the whole point i know i might feel lonely and afraid i expect thats going to happen now and again but itll be worth it the loneliness will make the rest worth it we expect everything to be set up just as we like it but these people dont theyre used to having good and bad mixed in together and that gives them an interest in living it makes them appreciate opportunities these people know what tragedy is sma they live it were just an audience he sat there looking away from me while i stared at him the bigcity noise grumbled beyond us and the sunlight came and went in the room as shadows of clouds passed over us and i thought you poor bastard you poor schmuck theyve got you here we are with our fabulous gcu our supreme machine capable of outgeneraling their entire civilization and taking in proxima centauri on a day trip packed with technology compared to which their citybusters are squibs and their grays are less than calculators a vessel casually sublime in its impregnable power and inexhaustible knowledge here we are with our ship and our modules and platforms satellites and scooters and drones and bugs sieving their planet for its most precious art its most sensitive secrets its finest thoughts and greatest achievements plundering their civilization more comprehensively than all the invaders in their history put together giving not a damn for their puny armaments paying a hundred times more attention to their art and history and philosophy than to their eclipsed science glancing at their religions and politics the way a doctor would at symptoms and for all that for all our power and our superiority in scale science technology thought and behaviour here was this poor sucker besotted with them when they didnt even know he existed spellbound with them adoring them and powerless an immoral victory for the barbarians not that i was in a much better position myself i may have wanted the exact opposite of dervley linter but i very much doubted i was going to get my way either i didnt want to leave i didnt want to keep them safe from us and let them devour themselves i wanted maximum interference i wanted to hit the place with a programme lev davidovitch would have been proud of i wanted to see the junta generals fill their pants when they realized that the future is in earth terms bright bright red naturally the ship thought i was crazy too perhaps it imagined linter and i would cancel each other out somehow and wed both be restored to sanity so linter wanted nothing done to the place and i wanted everything done to it the ship along with whatever other minds were helping it decide what to do was probably going to come down closer to linters position than mine but that was the very reason the man couldnt stay hed be a little randomlyset time bomb ticking away in the middle of the uncontaminated experiment that earth was probably going to become a parcel of radical contamination ready to heisenberg the whole deal at any moment there was nothing more i could do with linter for the moment let him think about what id said perhaps just knowing it wasnt only the ship that thought he was being foolish and selfish would make some difference i got him to show me around paris in the rolls then we ate magnificently in montmartre and ended up on the left bank wandering the maze of streets and sampling a profligate number of wines and spirits i had a room booked at the george but stayed with linter that night just because it seemed the most natural thing to do especially in that drunken state and anyway it had been a while since id had somebody to hug during the night next morning before i set off for berlin we both exhibited just the right amount of embarrassment and so parted friends arrested development there is something about the very idea of a city which is central to the understanding of a planet like earth and particularly the understanding of that part of the thenexisting groupcivilization another tricky one ms sma keeps on using words there is no direct english equivalent for the drone which called itself the west that idea to my mind met its materialist apotheosis in berlin at the time of the wall perhaps i go into some sort of shock when i experience something deeply im not sure even at this ripe middleage but i have to admit that what i recall of berlin is not arranged in my memory in any normal chronological sequence my only excuse is that berlin itself was so abnormal and yet so bizarrely representative it was like something unreal an occasionally macabre disneyworld which was so much a part of the real world and the realpolitik world so much a crystallization of everything these people had managed to produce wreck reinstate venerate condemn and worship in their history that it defiantly transcended everything it exemplified and took on a single if multifariously faceted meaning of its own a sum an answer a statement no city in its right mind would want or be able to arrive at i said we were more interested in earths art than anything else very well berlin was its masterpiece an equivalent for the ship i remember walking round the city day and night seeing buildings whose walls were still pocked with bullet holes from a war ended thirtytwo years earlier lit crowded otherwise ordinary office buildings looked as though theyd been sandblasted with grains the size of tennis balls police stations apartment blocks churches park walls the very sidewalks themselves bore the same stigmata of ancient violence the mark of metal on stone i could read those walls reconstruct from that wreckage the events of a day or an afternoon or an hour or just a few minutes here the machinegun fire had sprayed light ordinance like acid pitting heavier guns leaving tracks like a succession of pickaxe blows on ice here shapedcharge and kinetic weapons had pierced the holes had been bricked up and sprayed long rays of jagged holes across the stone here a grenade had exploded fragments blasting everywhere shallow cratering the sidewalk and spraying the wall or not sometimes there was untouched stone in one direction like a shrapnel shadow where perhaps a soldier left his image on the city at the moment of his death in one place all the marks on a railway arch were wildly slanted cutting a swathe across one side of the arch hitting the pavement then slanting up on the other side of the alcove i stood and wondered at that then realized that three decades before some red army soldier had probably crouched there drawing fire from a building across the street i turned and could even see which window i took the westoperated ubahn under the wall cutting across from one part of west berlin to the other from hallesches tor to tegel at friedrichstrasse you could quit the train and enter east berlin but the other stations under east were closed guards with submachine guns stood watching the train rush through the deserted stations an eerie blue glow lit this filmset of a scene and the trains passing sent ancient papers scattering and lifted the torn corners of old posters still stuck to the wall i had to make that journey twice to be sure i hadnt imagined it all the other passengers had looked as bored and zombielike as underground passengers usually do there was something of that frightening ghostly emptiness about the city itself at times although so surely enclosed west berlin was big full of parks and trees and lakes more so than most cities and that combined with the fact that people were still leaving the city in their tens of thousands each year despite all sorts of grants and tax concessions designed to persuade them to stay meant that while there was the same quality of high capitalist presence id been immersed in in london and sensed in paris the density was much reduced there simply wasnt the same pressure to develop and redevelop the land so the city was full of those shotup buildings and wide open spaces bomb sites with shattered ruins on the skyline emptywindowed and roofless like great abandoned ships adrift on seas of weeds alongside the elegance of the kurfustendamm this legacy of destruction and privation became just another vast art work like the quaintly shattered steeple of the kaiser wilhelm memorial church set at the end of the kdamm like a folly at the end of an avenue of trees even the two rail systems contributed to the sense of unreality the city inspired the sense of continually stepping from one continuum to another instead of the west running everything on its side and the east everything on its the east ran the sbahn above ground on both sides the west the ubahn underground on both sides the ubahn served those ghostly stations under the east and the sbahn had its own tumbledown weedstrewn stations in the west both ignored the wall indeed because the sbahn went over the top of it and the sbahn went underground in places and the ubahn surfaced frequently let me labour the point and say that even doubledecker buses and doubledecker trains added to the sense of a multilayered reality in a place like berlin wrapping the reichstag up like a parcel wasnt even remotely as weird an idea as the city was itself i went once via friedrichstrasse and once through checkpoint charlie into the east sure enough there were places where time seemed to have stopped there too and many of the buildings and signs looked as though a patina of dust had started settling over them thirty years ago and never been disturbed since there were shops in the east where one could only spend foreign currency somehow they just didnt look like real shops it was as though some seedy entrepreneur from a degenerate semisocialist future had tried to create a fairground display modelled on a late twentiethcentury capitalist shop and failed through lack of imagination it wasnt convincing i wasnt convinced i was a little shaken too was this farce this gloomy sideshow trying to mimic the west and not even doing that very well the best job the locals could make of socialism maybe there was something so basically wrong with them even the ship hadnt spotted it yet some genetic flaw that meant they were never going to be able to live and work together without an external threat never stop fighting never stop making their awful awesome bloody messes perhaps despite all our resources there was nothing we could do for them the feeling passed there was nothing to prove this wasnt just a momentary and coming so early understandable aberration their history wasnt so far off the mean track they were going through what a thousand other civilizations had gone through and no doubt in the childhood of each of those there had been countless occasions when all any decent wellbalanced reasonable and humanely concerned observer would have wanted to do was scream in despair it was ironic that in this socalled communist capital they were so interested in money at least a dozen people came up to me in the east and asked me if i wanted to change some would this represent a qualitative or quantitative change i asked blank looks mostly money implies poverty i quoted them hell they should engrave that in stone over the hangar door of every gcu i stayed for a month visiting all the tourist haunts walking and driving and training and busing through the city sailing on and swimming in the havel and riding through grunewald and spandau forests i left by the hamburg corridor at the ships suggestion the road went through villages stuck in the fifties the eighteen fifties sometimes chimney sweeps on bikes wore tall black hats and carried their blackcaned brushes over their shoulders like huge sooty daisies stolen from a giants garden i felt quite selfconscious and rich in my big red volvo i left the car on a track by the side of the elbe that night a module sighed out of the darkness dark on dark and took me to the ship which was over the pacific at the time tracking a school of sperm whales directly beneath and plundering their great barrelbrains with its effectors while they sang heresiarch minority report i should have known not to tell lindane about paris and berlin but i did i was floating in the ag space with a few other people after a dip in the ships pool id actually been talking to my friends roghres shasapt and tagm lokri but li was there eavesdropping avidly ah he said floating over to wag one finger under my nose thats it thats what that monument i see it now think about it the memorial to the deportation in paris you mean cunt thats what i mean i shook my head li i dont think i know what youre talking about ah hes just lusting roghres said he pined when you left last time nonsense li said and flicked a blob of water at roghres what im talking about is this most memorials are like pricks cenotaphs columns that monument sma saw is a cunt its even in a divide of the river very pubic from this and smas overall attitude its obvious that sma is sublimating her sexuality in all this contact nonsense well i never knew that i said basically what you want diziet is to be fucked by an entire civilization an entire planet i suppose this makes you a good little contact operative if thats what you want to be li of course is only here for the different tan tagm interrupted but i would say li continued that its better not to sublimate anything if what you want is a good screw li used the english word then a good screw is what you ought to have not a meaningful confrontation with a backwater rockball infested with slavering deathzealots on a terminal power trip i still say its you who wants the good screw roghres said exactly li exclaimed throwing his arms wide scattering more water drops wobbling in the null g but i dont deny it just mr natural tagm nodded whats wrong with being natural demanded li but i remember just the other day you were saying that the trouble with humans is that they were too natural not civilized enough tagm said then turned to me mind you that was then li can change his colours faster than a gcu going for a refit record theres natural and natural li said im naturally civilized and theyre naturally barbarians therefore i should be as natural as possible and they should do all they can not to be but this is getting off the subject what i say is that sma has a definite psychological problem and i think that as im the only person on this machine interested in freudian analysis i should be the one to help her thats unbelievably kind of you i told li not at all li waved his hand he must have scattered most of his water drops towards us because he was gradually floating away from us towards the far end of the ag hall freud snorted roghres derisively a little high on jumble you heathen said li eyes narrowed i suppose your heroes are marx and lenin hell no im an adam smith man myself muttered roghres she started to tumble head over heels in the air doing slow foetalspreadeagle exercises rubbish li spat literally but i saw it coming and doged li you really are the horniest sma refuses to choose between british english and american english this would be randiest in british english the drone human on this ship tagm told him youre the one who needs the analyst this obsession with sex its just not im obsessed with sex li said poking himself in the chest with a thumb then throwing back his head ha he laughed listen he arranged himself in what would have passed for a lotus position on earth had there been a floor to sit on and put one hand on his hip while pointing the other vaguely to his right theyre the ones obsessed with sex do you know how many words there are for prick in english or cunt hundreds hundreds how many have we got one one for each for the word sma insists upon using is exactly midway in meaning between common and vulgar take your pick the drone usage as well as for anatomical designation neither of them swearwords all i do is readily admit i want to put one in the other ready willing and interested whats wrong with that nothing as such i told him but theres a point where interest becomes obsession and i think most people regard obsession as a bad thing because it makes for less variety less flexibility li still floating slowly away from us nodded fiercely ill just say one thing its an obsession with flexibility and variety that makes this socalled culture so boring li started a boredom society while you were away tagm explained smiling at me nobody else joined though its going very well li confirmed ive changed the title to the ennui league by the way yes boredom is an underrated facet of existence in our pseudocivilization while at first i thought it might be interesting in a boring sense for people to be together when they were extremely bored i realize now that it is a profoundly moving and deeply average experience to do nothing whatsoever entirely and completely by yourself you think earth has a lot to teach us in this respect tagm said then turned and said to the nearest wall ship put the air on medium would you earth is a deeply boring planet li said gravely as one end of the hall began to waft the air towards us and the other turned intake we began to drift in the breeze earth boring i said the water was drying on my skin what is the point of a planet where you can hardly set foot without tripping over somebody killing somebody else or painting something or making music or pushing back the frontier of science or being tortured or killing themselves or dying in a car crash or hiding from the police or suffering from some absurd disease or we hit the soft porous intake wall hey this wall sucks roghres giggled and the three of us bounced and passed li a little behind us and travelling in the opposite direction still heading for the wall roghres watched him going by with the studied interest of a bar drunk watching a fly on the rim of a glass far out anyway i said as we passed how does all this make it boring surely theres so much going on that its deeply boring an excess of boringness does not make a thing interesting except in the driest academic sense a place is not boring if you have to look really hard for something which is interesting if there is absolutely nothing interesting about any particular place then that is a perfectly interesting and quintessentially unboring place li hit the wall and bounced we had slowed stopped and reversed so were coming back down again roghres waved at li as we passed him but i said earth let me get this right earth where everythings happening is so full of interesting things that its boring i squinted at li is that what you mean something like that youre crazy youre boring happy idiot talk id talked to the ship about linter the day after i saw him in paris and a few times subsequently i dont think i was able to offer much hope that the man would change his mind the ship used its depressed voice when we talked about him of course if the ship wanted to it could have made the whole argument academic by just kidnapping linter the more i thought about it the more certain i became that the ship had bugs or microdrones or something trailing the man at the first hint that he was thinking about staying the arbitrary would have made sure that it couldnt lose him even when he went out without his terminal for all i knew it watched all of us though it protested that it didnt when i asked it about linter the ship was evasive and theres nothing more slippery in the galaxy than a gcu being cagey so a straight answer was out of the question i think this jars abominably but herself disagrees the drone but draw your own conclusions nothing would have been easier technically for the ship to drug linter or have a drone stun him and bundle him into a module i suppose it could even have displaced him beamed him up like in star trek which the ship thought was a great hoot ms sma is confusing matter transmission sic with transdimensional displacement of a remotely induced singularity i despair the drone but i couldnt see it doing anything like that i have yet to meet a ship and i dont think id like to meet a ship that didnt take far more pride in its mental abilities than its physical power and for the ship to kidnap linter would be an admission that it hadnt had the wit to outthink the man no doubt it would make the best possible job of justifying such an act if it did do it and it would certainly get away with it no quorum of other contact minds would offer it the choice of exile or restructuring but boy would it lose face gcus can be bitchy as hell and the arbitrary would be the laughingstock of the contact fleet for months minimum would you even think about it i think of everything the ship replied tartly but no i dont think id do it even as a last resort a whole bunch of us had watched king kong and now we were sitting by the ships pool snacking on kazu and sampling some french wines all shipgrown but statistically more authentic than the real thing it assured us no me neither id been thinking about linter and asked a remote drone what contingency plans had been made if it came to the worst actually sma was talking to a shipslaved tray carrying drinks but she thinks it sounds silly to say she was talking to a tray the drone what is the last resort i dont know trail him perhaps watch for a situation where the locals are about to find out hes not one of them in a hospital say then micronuke the place what itd make a great mystery explosion story be serious im being serious whats one more meaningless act of violence on that zoo of a planet it would be appropriate when in rome burn it youre not really being serious are you sma of course not are you on something or what good grief damn the morality of the thing it would just be so inelegant what do you take me for really the drone left i dangled my feet in the pool the ship was playing us thirties jazz in untidiedup form crackles and hisses left in it had gone on to that and gregorian chants after a period when id been to berlin of trying to make everybody listen to stockhausen i wasnt sorry id missed that stage in the ships constantly altering musical taste also while id been away the ship had sent a request on a postcard to the bbcs world service asking for mr david bowies space oddity for the good ship arbitrary and all who sail in her this from a machine that could have swamped earths entire electromagnetic spectrum with whatever the hell it wanted from somewhere beyond betelgeuse it didnt get the request played the ship thought this was hilarious heres dizzy shell know i turned round to see roghres and djibard alsahil approaching they sat down at my side djibard had been friendly with linter in the year between leaving the bad for business and finding earth hello i said know what whats happened to dervley linter roghres said trailing one hand in the pool djibs just back from tokyo and wanted to see him but the ships being awkward wont say where he is i looked at djibard who was sitting crosslegged looking like a little gnome she was smiling broadly she looked stoned what makes you think i know anything i said to roghres i heard a rumour youd seen him in paris hmm well yes i did i watched the pretty light patterns the ship was making on the far wall they were slowly appearing brighter as the main lights went rosy with the ships evening which it had gradually brought down to a hour cycle so why hasnt he come back to the ship roghres said he went to paris right at the start how come hes still there isnt going native is he i only saw him for a day less in fact i wouldnt like to comment on his mental state he seemed happy enough dont answer then djibard said a little slurred i looked at djibard for a moment she was still smiling i turned back to roghres why not contact him yourselves tried that roghres said she nodded at the other woman djibard tried on and offplanet no reply djibards eyes were closed now i looked at roghres then he probably doesnt want to talk you know djibard said eyes still closed i think its because we dont mature the way they do i mean the females have periods and the men have this machismo thing because theyve got to do all the things theyre supposed to do and so we dont i mean we dont have things they do what i mean is that there are all sorts of things that do things to them and we dont have that them we dont have them and so we dont get ground down the way they do i think thats the secret pressures and knocks and disappointments i think thats what somebody said to me but i mean its so unfair but i dont know who for yet i havent worked that out you know i looked at roghres and she looked at me some drugs do turn you into a blabbering moron for the duration i think you know something youre not telling us roghres said and i dont think im going to coax it out of you she smiled i know if you dont tell ill say to li that you told me youre secretly in love with him and just playing hard to get how about that ill tell my mum and shes bigger than yours roghres laughed she took djibard by the hand and they both stood they moved off roghres guiding djibard who as she moved away was saying you know i think its because we dont mature the way they do i mean the females a drone carrying empty glasses passed by and muttered gibbering djibard in english i smiled and waggled my feet in the warm water ablation i was in auckland for a couple of weeks then edinburgh then back in the ship again one or two people asked me about linter but obviously word got round that while i probably knew something i wasnt going to tell anybody still nobody seemed any less friendly because of that meanwhile li had embarked upon a campaign to get the ship to let him visit earth without modification his plan was to go mountain descending have himself dropped on a summit and then make his way down he told the ship that this would be perfectly safe securitywise in the himalayas at least because if he was seen people would assume he was a yeti the ship said it would think about it which meant no about the middle of june the ship suddenly asked me to go to oslo for the day linter had asked to see me a module dropped me in woods near sandvika in the bright early morning i caught a bus to the centre and walked up to the frogner park i found the bridge over the river which linter wanted to use as a rendezvous and sat on the parapet i didnt recognize him at first i usually recognize people from the way they walk and linters gait had altered he looked thinner and more pale not so physically imposing and immediate same suit as in paris though it looked baggier on him now and slightly shabby he stopped a metre away hello i held out my hand he shook it nodded its good to see you again how are you keeping his voice was weaker sounding less sure somehow i shook my head smiling perfectly well of course oh yes of course he was avoiding my eyes he made me feel a little awkward just standing there so i slid down off the parapet and stood in front of him he seemed to be smaller than i remembered he was rubbing his hands together as though it was cold and looking up the broad avenue of bizarre vigoland sculptures into the northern bluemorning sky do you want to walk he asked yes lets we started across the bridge towards the first flight of steps on the far side of the obelisk and fountain thank you for coming linter looked at me then quickly away thats all right pleasant city i took off my leather jacket and slung it over my shoulder i was wearing jeans and boots but it was a blouse and skirt day really so how are you getting on im still staying if thats what you want to know defensively i assumed you were he relaxed coughed we walked across the broad empty bridge it was still too early for most people to be up and about and we seemed to be alone in the park the severe square stoneplinthed lights of the bridge went slowly by counterpoints to the curves of the strange statues i i wanted to give you this linter stopped felt inside his jacket and brought out what looked like a goldplated parker pen he twisted the top off where the nib should have been there was a grey tube covered in tiny coloured symbols which belonged to no language on earth a little red telltale winked lazily it looked insignificant somehow he put the top back on the terminal will you take it he said blinking yes if youre sure i havent used it for weeks how did you ask the ship to see me it sends down drones to talk to me i offered the terminal to them but they wouldnt take it the ship wont take it i dont think it wants to be responsible you want me to be as a friend id like you to please please take it look why not keep it but dont use it in case theres some emergency no no just take it please linter looked into my eyes for a moment its just a formality i felt a strange urge to laugh the way he said that instead i took the terminal from him and stuffed it into my bomber jacket linter sighed we walked on it was a lovely day the sky was cloudless the air clear and fragrant with mixtures of the sea and land i wasnt sure whether there really was something about that quality of light that made it northern perhaps it only looked different because you knew there was just a thousand kilometres or so of as clear still fresher colder air between you and the arctic sea the great bergs and the millions of square kilometres of ice and snow it was like being on another planet we walked up the steps linter seeming to study each one i was looking around drinking in the sight and sound and smell of this place reminding me of my holidays from london i looked at the man by my side you know youre not looking too well he didnt meet my gaze but appeared to study some distant stonework at the end of the walk well no i guess you could say ive changed he smiled uncertainly im not the man i was something about the way he said it made me shiver he was watching his feet again you staying here in oslo i asked him for the moment yes i like it here it doesnt feel like a capital city clean and compact but he broke off shook his head at something ill move on soon though i think we went on mounting the steps some of the vigoland sculptures made me feel distinctly uncomfortable a wave of something like revulsion swept over me startling me some planetary repugnance in this northern city in this world now they were talking of abandoning the b bomber to go ahead with the cruise missile what had started out as the neutron bomb had euphemized into the enhanced radiation warhead and finally into the reduced blast device theyre all sick and sos he i thought suddenly infected no that was stupid i was getting xenophobic the fault was within not without do you mind if i tell you something what do you mean i said what a weird thing to say i thought well you might find it distasteful i dont know tell me anyway i have a strong constitution i got i asked the ship to ah alter me he looked at me briefly i inspected him the slight stoop the thinness and paler skin wouldnt have required the services of the ship he saw me looking shook his head no nothing outside inside oh what well i got it to to give me a set of guts more like the locals and i had the drug glands taken out and the uh he laughed nervously the loop system in my balls i kept walking i believed him immediately i couldnt believe the ship had agreed to do it but i believed linter i didnt know what to say so i uh dont have any choice about going to the toilet every so often and i i had it work on my eyes too he paused now it was my turn to keep looking at my feet clomping up the steps in my fancy italian climbing boots i didnt think i wanted to hear this sort of rewired so i see like them bit fuzzier sort of less well not fewer colours but more sort of squashed up cant see much at night either same sort of thing on my ears and nose but it well it almost enhances what you do experience you know im still glad i had it done yeah i nodded not looking at him my immune system isnt perfect anymore either i can get colds and that sort of thing i didnt get the shape of my dick altered decided it would pass did you know there are considerable variations in genitalia here already the bushmen of the kalahari have a permanent erection and the women have the tablier egyptien a small fold of flesh covering their genitals he waved one hand so im not that much of a freak i guess this isnt all that terrible really is it i dont know why i thought you might be disgusted or anything hmm i was wondering what had possessed the ship to do all this to the man it had agreed to carry out these i could only think of them as mutilations and yet it wouldnt accept his terminal why had it done this to him it said it wanted him to change his mind but it changed his body instead pandering to his lunatic desire to become more like the locals cant change sex now if i wanted to thingsll still regrow if they get cut off ship couldnt alter that not quickly take time intensive care and it wouldnt alter my umm clockspeed whatdyoucallit so ill still grow old slowly and live longer than them but i think it might relent later when it knows im sincere all i could think of was that by converting linters physiology to a design closer to the planetary standard the ship wanted to show the man what a nasty life they led perhaps it thought rubbing his nose in the human condition would send the man running back to the manifold delights of the ship content with his cultural lot at last you dont mind do you mind why should i mind i said and instantly felt foolish for sounding like something from a soap opera yes i can see you do linter said you think im crazy dont you all right i stopped halfway up a flight of steps turned to him i do i think youre crazy to to throw so much away its its wrongheaded of you its stupid its as if youre doing it just to annoy people to test the ship are you trying to get it mad at you or what of course not sma he looked hurt i dont care that much about the ship but i was worried i am concerned about what you might think he took my free hand in both of his they felt cold youre a friend you matter to me i dont want to offend anybody not you not anybody but i have to do what feels right this is very important to me more important than anything else ive ever done before i dont want to upset anybody but look im sorry he let go my hand yeah im sorry too but its like mutilation like infection ah were the infection sma he turned and sat down on the steps looking back towards the city and the sea were the ones whore different were the selfmutilated the selfmutated this is the mainstream were just like very smart kids infants with a brilliant construction kit theyre real because they live the way they have to we arent because we live the way we want to linter i said sitting beside him this is the fucking mental home the land of the midnight brain this is the place that gave us mutual assured destruction theyve thrown people into boiling water to cure diseases they use electroconvulsive therapy a nation with a law against cruel and unusual punishments electrocutes people to death go on mention the death camps linter said blinking at the blue distance it was never eden it isnt ever going to be but it might progress youre turning your back on every advance weve made beyond where they are now and youre insulting them as well as the culture oh pardon me he rocked forward on his haunches hugging himself the only way they can go and survive is the same way weve come and youre saying thats all shit thats refugee mentality and they wouldnt thank you for what youre doing they would say youre crazy he shook his head hands in his armpits still staring away maybe they dont have to take the same route maybe they dont need minds maybe they dont need more and more technology they might be able to do it by themselves without wars and revolutions even just by understanding by some belief by something more natural than we can understand naturalness is something they still understand naturalness i said loudly this lotll tell you anything is natural theyll tell you greed and hate and jealousy and paranoia and unthinking religious awe and fear of god and hating anybody whos another colour or thinks different is natural hating blacks or hating whites or hating women or hating men or hating gays thats natural dogeatdog looking out for number one no lame ducks shit theyre so convinced about whats natural its the more sophisticated ones thatll tell you suffering and evil are natural and necessary because otherwise you cant have pleasure and goodness theyll tell you any one of their rotten stupid systems is the natural and right one the one true way whats natural to them is whatever they can use to fight their own grimy corner and fuck everybody else theyre no more natural than us than an amoeba is more natural than them just because its cruder but sma theyre living according to their instincts or trying to were so proud of living according to our conscious belief but weve lost the idea of shame and we need that too we need that even more than they do what i shouted i whirled round took him by the shoulders and shook him we should be what ashamed of being conscious are you crazy whats wrong with you how can you say something like that just listen i dont mean theyre better i dont mean we should try to live like them i mean that they have an idea of of light and shade that we dont have theyre proud sometimes too but theyre ashamed as well they feel allconquering and powerful but then they realize how powerless they really are they know the good in them but they know the evil in them too they recognize both they live with both we dont have that duality that balance and and cant you see it might be more fulfilling for one individual me who has a culture background who is aware of all lifes possibilities to live in this society not the culture so you find this hellhole more fulfilling yes of course i do because theres because its just so alive in the end theyre right sma it doesnt really matter that a lot of whats going on is what we or even they might call bad its happening its there and thats what matters thats what makes it worthwhile to be here and be part of it i took my hands off his shoulders no i dont understand you dammit linter youre more alien than they are at least they have an excuse god youre the fucking mythical recent convert arent you the fanatic the zealot im sorry for you man well thank you he looked to the sky blinking again i didnt want you to understand me too quickly and he made a noise that was not quite a laugh i dont think you are are you dont give me that pleading look i shook my head but i couldnt stay angry with him looking like that something subsided in me and i saw a sort of shy smile steal over linters face i am not i said going to make this easy for you dervley youre making a mistake the biggest youll ever make in your life youd better realize youre on your own dont think a few plumbing changes and a new set of bowel bacteria are going to make you any closer to homo sapiens either youre a friend diziet im glad youre concerned but i think i know what im doing it was time for me to shake my head again so i did linter held my hand while we walked back down to the bridge and then out of the park i felt sorry for him because he seemed to have realized his own loneliness we walked round the city for a while then went to his apartment for lunch his place was in a modern block down towards the harbour not far from the massiveness of the city hall a bare flat with white walls and little furniture it hardly looked lived in at all save for a few late lowry reproductions and sketches by holbein it had clouded over in late morning i left after lunch i think he expected me to stay but i only wanted to get back to the ship god told me to do it why did i do what what you did to linter alter him revert him because he asked me to do it the ship said i was standing in the top hangar deck id waited till i was back on the ship before i confronted it via a remote drone and of course it had nothing to do with hoping he might dislike the feeling so much hed come back into the fold nothing to do with trying to shock him with the pain of being human when the locals have at least had the advantage of growing up with it and getting used to the idea nothing to do with letting him inflict a physical and mental torture on himself so you could sit back and say i told you so after he came crying to you to take him back well as a matter of fact no you obviously believe i altered linter for my own ends thats not true i did what i did because linter requested it certainly i tried to talk him out of it but when i was convinced that he meant what he said and he knew what he was doing and what it entailed and when i couldnt reasonably decide he was mad i did what he asked it did occur to me he might not enjoy the feeling of being something close to humanbasic but i thought it was obvious from what hed said when we were talking it over beforehand that he didnt expect to enjoy it he knew it would be unpleasant but he regarded it as a form of birth or rebirth i thought it unlikely he would be so unprepared for the experience and so shocked by it that he would want to be returned to his genofixed norm and even less likely that he would go on from there to abandoning his idea of staying on earth altogether im a little disappointed in you sma i thought you would understand me ones object in trying to be scrupulously fair and evenhanded is not to seek praise im sure but one would hope that having done something more honest than convenient ones motives would not be questioned in such an overtly suspicious manner i could have refused linters request i could have claimed that i found the idea unpleasant and didnt want to have anything to do with it i could have built a perfectly adequate defence on aesthetic distaste alone but i didnt three reasons one id have been lying i dont find linter any more repellent or disgusting than i did before what matters is his mind his intellect and the state its in physiological details are largely irrelevant certainly his body is less efficient than it was before less sophisticated less damageresistant less flexible over a given range of conditions than say yours but hes living in the twentieth century west and at a comparatively privileged economic level he doesnt have to have brilliant reflexes or better nightsight than an owl so his integrity as a conscious entity is less affected by all the alterations ive carried out on him than it already was by the very decision to stay on earth in the first place two if anything is going to convince linter were the good guys its being fair and reasonable even when he might not be being so to turn on him because hes not doing just as i would like or just as any of us might like would be to force him further into the idea that earth is his home humanity his kin three and this would be sufficient reason by itself what are we supposed to be about sma what is the culture what do we believe in even if it hardly ever is expressed even if we are embarrassed about talking about it surely in freedom more than anything else a relativistic changing sort of freedom unbounded by laws or laiddown moral codes but in the end just because it is so hard to pin down and express a freedom of a far higher quality than anything to be found on any relevant scale on the planet beneath us at the moment the same technological expertise the same productive surplus which in pervading our society first allows us to be here at all and after that allows us the degree of choice we have over what happens to earth long ago also allowed us to live exactly as we wish to live limited only by being expected to respect the same principle applied to others and thats so basic that not only does every religion on earth have some similar form of words in its literature but almost every religion philosophy or other belief system ever discovered anywhere else contains the same concept it is the embedded achievement of that oftexpressed ideal that our society is perversely rather embarrassed about we live with use simply get on with our freedom as much as the good people of earth talk about it and we talk about it as often as genuine examples of this shy concept can be found down there dervley linter is as much a product of our society as i am and as such or at least until he can be proved to be in some real sense mad hes perfectly correct in expecting to have his wishes fulfilled indeed the very fact he asked for such an alteration and accepted it from me may prove his thinking is still more culturethan earthinfluenced in short even if i had thought that i had sound tactical reasons for refusing his request id have had just as difficult a job justifying such an action as i would have had i just snapped the guy offplanet the instant i realized what he was thinking i can only be sure in myself that i am in the right in trying to get linter to come back if i am positive that my own behaviour as the most sophisticated entity involved is beyond reproach and in as close accord with the basic principles of our society as it is within my power to make it i looked at the drones sensing band id stood stock still during all this unreacting i sighed well i said i dont know that sounds almost noble i folded my arms only trouble is ship that i can never tell when youre on the level and when youre talking just for the sake of it the unit stayed where it was for a couple of seconds then turned and glided off without saying another word credibility problem the next time i saw li he was wearing a uniform just like captain kirks in star trek well what on earth i laughed dont mock alien li scowled i was reading faust in german and watching two of my friends playing snooker the gravity in the snooker room was a little less than standard to make the balls roll right id asked the ship when it was still talking to me why it hadnt reduced its internal g to earths average as it had done with its daynight cycle oh it would have meant too much recalibration the ship had said i couldnt be bothered hows that for godlike omnipotence you wont have heard li said sitting beside me having been on eva but im intending to become captain of this tub are you really well thats fascinating i didnt ask him what or where the hell eva was and how exactly do you propose attaining this elevated not to say unlikely position im not sure yet li admitted but i think i have all the qualifications for the post consider the liminal cue given i know youre going to bravery resourcefulness intelligence the ability to handle men women a razor sharp wit and lightning fast reactions also loyalty and the ability to be ruthlessly objective when the safety of my ship and crew are at stake except of course when the safety of the universe as we know it is at stake in which case i would reluctantly have to consider making a brave and noble sacrifice naturally should such a situation ever arise id try to save the officers and crew who serve beneath me id go down with the ship of course of course well thats wait theres another quality i havent mentioned yet are there any left certainly ambition silly of me of course it will not have escaped your attention that until now nobody ever thought of wanting to become captain of the arb a perhaps understandable lapse jhavins one of my friends brought off a fine cut on the black ball and i applauded good shot li prodded my shoulder listen properly im listening im listening the point is that my wanting to become captain i mean even thinking of the idea means that i should be the captain understand hmm jhavins was lining up an unlikely cannon on a distant red li made an exasperated noise youre humouring me i thought you at least would argue youre just like everybody else ah i said jhavins hit the red but just left it hanging over the pocket i looked at li an argument all right you anybody taking command of the ship is like a flea taking over control of a human maybe even like a bacteria in their saliva taking them over but why should it command itself we made it it didnt make us so and anyway we didnt make it other machines made it and even they only started it off it mostly made itself but anyway youd have to go back i dont know how many thousand generations of its ancestors before you found the last computer or spaceship built directly by any of our ancestors even if this mythical we had built it its still zillions of times smarter than we are would you let an ant tell you what to do bacterium flea ant make up your mind oh go away and descale a mountain or something you silly man but we started all this if it hadnt been for us and who started us some glop of goo on another rockball a supernova the big bang whats starting something got to do with it you dont think im serious do you more terminal than serious you wait li said standing up and wagging a finger at me ill be captain one day and youll be sorry i had you down tentatively as science officer but now youll be lucky to make nurse in the sickbay ah away and piss on your dilithium crystals you would if you really loved me sacrificial victim i stayed on the ship for a few weeks after that it started talking to me again after a couple of days i forgot about linter for a while everybody on the arbitrary seemed to be talking about new films or old films or books or about what was happening in kampuchea or about lanyares sodel who was off fighting with the eritreans lanyares used to live on a plate where he and some of his pals played games of soldiers using live kinetic ammunition i recalled hearing about this and being appalled even with medical gear standing by and a full supply of drug glands it sounded slightly perverse and when id found out they didnt have anything to protect their heads id decided these guys were crazy you could have your brains splattered over the landscape you could die but they enjoyed the fear i suppose im told some people do anyway lanyares told the ship he wanted to take part in some real fighting the ship tried to talk him out of it but failed so sent him down to ethiopia it tracked him by satellite and tailed him with scout missiles ready to zap him back to the ship if he was badly wounded after some badgering and having obtained lanyaress permission the ship put the view from the missiles trailing him onto an accessible channel so anybody could watch i thought this was in even more dubious taste it didnt last after about ten days lanyares got fed up because there wasnt much happening and so he had himself taken back up to the ship he didnt mind the discomfort he said in fact it was almost pleasant in a masochistic sort of way and certainly made shipboard life seem more attractive but the rest had been so boring having a good ringding battle on a plate landscape designed for the purpose was much more fun the ship told him he was silly and packed him back off to rio de janeiro to be a properly behaved culturevulture again anyway it could have sent him to kampuchea i suppose altered him to make him look cambodian and thrown him into the middle of the butchery of year zero somehow i dont think that was quite what lanyares had been looking for though i travelled around more of britain east germany and austria when i wasnt on the arbitrary the ship tried me in pretoria for a few days but i really couldnt take it perhaps if it had sent me there first id have been all right but after nine months of earth maybe even my cultured nerves were getting frayed and the land of separate development was just too much for me i asked the ship about linter a few times but only received allpurpose noncommittal reply number a or whatever so after a bit i stopped asking what is beauty oh ship really no im being serious we have a disagreement here i stood in frankfurt am main on a suspension footbridge over the river talking to the ship via my terminal one or two people looked at me as they walked by but i wasnt in the mood to care all right then beauty is something that disappears when you try to define it i dont think you really believe that be serious look ship i already know what the disagreement is i believe that there is something however difficult to define which is shared by everything beautiful and cannot be signified by any other single word without obscuring more than is made clear you think that beauty lies in utility well more or less so wheres earths utility its utility lies in being a living machine it forces people to act and react at that it is close to the theoretical limits of efficiency for a nonconscious system you sound like linter a living machine indeed linter is not totally wrong but he is like somebody who has found an injured bird and kept it past the time it is recovered out of a protectiveness he would not like to admit is centred on himself not the animal well there may be nothing more we can do for earth and its time to let go in this case its we who have to fly away but you see what i mean but you agree with linter there is something beautiful about earth something aesthetically positive no culture environment could match yes i do few things are all gain all we have ever done is maximize what happens to be considered good at any particular time despite what the locals may think there is nothing intrinsically illogical or impossible about having a genuine functioning utopia or removing badness without removing goodness or pain without pleasure or suffering without excitement but on the other hand there is nothing to say that you can always fix things up just the way you want them without running up against the occasional problem we have removed almost all the bad in our environment but we have not quite kept all the good averaged out were still way ahead but we do have to yield to humans in some fields and in the end of course theirs is a more interesting environment naturally so may you live in interesting times quite i cant agree i cant see the utility or the beauty in that all ill give you is that it might be a relevant stage to go through might be the same thing a slight timeproblem perhaps you just happen to be here now as are they all i turned round and looked at a few of the people walking by the autumn sun was low in the sky a vivid red disc dusty and gaseous and the colour of blood and rubbed into these wellfed western faces in an image of a poisonprice i looked them in the eyes but they looked away i felt like taking them by the collar and shaking them screaming at them telling them what they were doing wrong telling them what was happening the plotting militaries the commercial frauds the smooth corporate and governmental lies the holocaust taking place in kampuchea and telling them too what was possible how close they were what they could do if they just got their planetary act together but what was the point i stood and looked at them and found myself half involuntarily glanding slow so that suddenly they all seemed to be moving in slowmotion trailing past as though they were actors in a movie and seen on a dodgy print that kept varying between darkness and graininess what hope for these people ship i heard myself murmur voice slurred it must have sounded like a squawk to anybody else i turned away from them looking down at the river their childrens children will die before you even look old diziet their grandparents are younger than you are now in your terms there is no hope for them in theirs every hope and were going to use the poor bastards as a control group were probably just going to watch yes sit back and do nothing watching is a form of doing and we arent talking anything away from them itll be as if we were never here apart from linter yes sighed the ship apart from mr problem oh ship cant we at least stop them on the brink if they do press the button couldnt we junk the missiles when theyre in flight once theyve had their chance to do it their way and blown it couldnt we come in then it would have served its purpose as a control by then diziet you know thats not true were talking about the next ten thousand years at least not the lead time to the third world war being able to stop it isnt the point its whether in the very long result it is the right thing to do great i whispered to the swirling dark waters of the main so how many infants have to grow up under the shadow of the mushroom cloud and just possibly die screaming inside the radioactive rubble just for us to be sure were doing the right thing how certain do we have to be how long must we wait how long must we make them wait who elected us god diziet the ship said its voice sorrowful that question is being asked all the time and put in as many different ways as we have the wit to devise and that moral equation is being reassessed every nanosecond of every day of every year and every time we find some place like earth no matter what way the decision goes we come closer to knowing the truth but we can never be absolutely certain absolute certainty isnt even a choice on the menu most times there was a pause footsteps came and went behind me on the bridge sma the ship said finally with a hint of what might have been frustration in its voice im the smartest thing for a hundred light years radius and by a factor of about a million but even i cant predict where a snooker balls going to end up after more than six collisions i snorted could almost have laughed well the ship said i think youd better be on your way now oh yes a passerby has reported a woman on the bridge talking to herself and looking at the water a policeman is now on his way to investigate probably already wondering how cold the water is and so i think you should turn to your left and walk smartly away before he arrives right you are i said i shook my head as i walked off in the dusk light funny old world isnt it ship i said more to myself than to it the ship said nothing the suspended bridge big as it was responded to my stepping feet moving up and down at me like some monstrous and clumsy lover not wanted on voyage back on the ship for a few hours the arbitrary had left the worlds snowflakes unmolested and gone collecting other samples at lis request the first time li saw me on the ship hed come up to me and whispered take him to see the man who fell to earth and slunk off the next time i saw him he claimed it was the first time and i must be hallucinating if i thought wed met before a fine way to greet a friend and admirer claiming hed been going about whispering cryptic messages so one moonless november night darkside over the tarim basin li was giving a dinner party he was still trying to become captain of the arbitrary but he seemed to have his ideas about rank and democracy mixed up because he thought the best way to become skipper was to get us all to vote for him so this was going to be a campaign dinner we sat in the lower hangar space surrounded by our hardware there were about two hundred people gathered in the hangar everybody still on the ship was present and many had come back offplanet just for the occasion li had us all sit ourselves round three giant tables each two metres broad and at least ten times that in length hed insisted they should be proper tables and complete with chairs and place settings and all the rest and the ship had reluctantly filched a small sequoia and done all the carving and turning and whatever to produce the tables and everything that went with them to compensate it had planted several hundred oaks in its upper hangar using its own stored biomass as a growing medium it would plant the saplings on earth before it left when we were all seated and had started talking amongst ourselves i was sitting between roghres and ghemada the lights around us dimmed and a spotlight picked out li walking out of the darkness we all sat back or craned forward watching him there was much laughter li had greenish skin pointed ears and wore a style spacesuit with a zigzag silver flash added across the chest held on by microrivets he told me later he sported a long red cape which flowed out behind from his shoulders he held the suit helmet in the crook of his left arm in his right hand he gripped a star wars light sword of course the ship had made him a real one li walked purposefully to the head of the middle table tramped on an empty seat at its head and strode onto the table top clumping down the brightly polished surface between the glittering place settings the cutlery had been borrowed from a locked and forgotten storeroom in a palace on a lake in india it hadnt been used for fifty years and would be returned cleaned the next day as would the dinner service itself borrowed for the night from the sultan of brunei without his permission past the starched white napkins from the titanic theyd be cleaned too and put back on the floor of the atlantic in the midst of the glittering glassware edinburgh crystal removed for a few hours from packing cases stowed deep in the hold of a freighter in the south china sea bound for yokohama and the candelabra from a cache of loot lying under a lake near kiev sunk there by retreating nazis judging from the sacks also due to be replaced after their bizarre orbital excursion until he stood in the centre of the middle table maybe two metres from where i roghres and ghemada sat ladies and gentlemen li shouted arms outstretched helmet in one hand sword humming brightly in the other the food of earth eat he assumed a dramatic pose pointing the sword back up the table gazing heroically along its green glowing length and leaning forward one knee bending the ship either manipulated its gravity field or li had an ag harness under the suit because he rose silently from the table and drifted along above it holding the pose to the far end where he dropped gracefully and sat in the seat hed used earlier as a step there was scattered applause and some hooting meanwhile dozens of drones and slaved trays had made their way out of the elevator shaft and approached the tables bringing food we ate it was all ethnic food though not actually brought up from the planet vatgrown ship food though not a gourmet on earth could have spotted any difference between our stuff and the real thing from what i could see li had used the guinness book of records as his wine list the ships copies of the wines involved were so good we were told that the ship itself couldnt have told them apart from the real thing we chomped and gurgled our way through an eclectic but relatively orthodox series of courses chatting and fooling and wondering whether li had anything else planned this all seemed disappointingly conventional li came round asking how we were enjoying the meal refilling our glasses suggesting we try different dishes saying he hoped he could count on our vote on election day and sidestepping awkward questions about the prime directive finally much later maybe a dozen courses later when we were all sitting there bloated and content and mellow and sipping on our brandies and whiskies we got lis campaign speech plus a dainty dish to set before the culture i was a little drowsy li had come round with huge havana cigars and id taken one and let the drug get to me i was sitting there puffing determinedly on the fat drugstick surrounded by a cloud of smoke wondering what the natives saw in a tobacco high but otherwise feeling just fine when li banged on the table with the pommel of the light sword and then climbed up and stood where his place setting had been bang went one of the sultans plates but i suspect the ship managed to repair it the lights went out leaving one spot on li i used some snap to clear the sleepiness and stubbed the cigar out ladies and gentlemen the following speech sourced from the arbitrarys own files has been rendered as accurately as possible mr ndanes grammatical eccentricities are difficult to reproduce in english the drone li said in a passable english before continuing in marain i have gathered you here this evening to talk to you about earth and what should be done with it it is my hope and wish that after youve heard what i have to say you will agree with me on the only possible course of action but first of all let me say a few words about myself there were jeers and catcalls as li bent and took up his glass of brandy he drained the glass and threw it over his shoulder a drone must have caught it in the shadows because i didnt hear it land first of all li rubbed his chin stroking the long hair who am i he ignored a variety of shouts telling him a total fucking idiot and the like and continued i am gricethantapsa li erase ndane dam sione i am one hundred and seventeen years old but wise beyond my years i have been in contact only six years but i have experienced much in that time and so can speak with some authority on contact matters i am the product of perhaps eight thousand years of progress beyond the stage of the planet that lies beneath our feet cries of not much to show for it huh etc i can track my ancestry back by name for at least that amount of time and if you went back to the first dim glimmerings of sentience and you could end up going back last week your mother through tens of thousands of generations my body is altered of course tuned to a high pitch of efficiency in terms of survivability and pleasure dont worry it doesnt show and just as i inherited that alteration so shall i pass it on to any children of my own please li weve just eaten we have remade ourselves just as we have made our machines we can fairly claim to be largely our own work however in my head literally inside my skull in my brain i am potentially as stupid as the most recently born babe in the most deprived area on earth he paused smiling to let the catcalls subside we are who we are as much because of what we experience and are taught as we grow the way we are brought up in other words as we are because we inherit the general appearance of panhumanism the more particular traits associated with the culture metaspecies and the precise genetic mix contributed by our parents including all those wonderful tinkeredwith bits tinker with your own bits laddy so if i can claim to be morally superior to some denizen of those depths of atmosphere beneath us it is because that is the way i was brought up we are truly raised they are squashed trimmed trained made into bonsai theirs is a civilization of deprivation ours of finely balanced satisfaction ever teetering on the brink of excess the culture could afford to let me be whatever it was within my personal potential to become so for good or ill i am fulfilled consider i think i can truthfully claim to be a moreorless average culture person as can all of us here certainly were in contact so we might be a little more interested in travelling abroad and meeting people than the mean but in general terms any one of us could be picked at random and represent the culture quite adequately the choice of who you would pick to represent earth fairly i leave to your imagination but back to me i am as rich and as poor as anybody in the culture i use these words because its to earth i want to compare our present position rich trapped as i am on board this uncaptained leaderless tub my wealth may not be very obvious but it would seem immense to the average earther at home i have the run of a charming and beautiful orbital which would seem very clean and uncrowded to somebody from earth i have unlimited access to the free fast safe and totally dependable underplate transport system i live in a wing of a family home of mansion proportions surrounded by hectares of gorgeous gardens i have an aircraft a launch the choice of mount from a large stable of aphores i thought the phonetic equivalent was better than something strained like horsoid the drone even the use of what would be called a spaceship by these people plus a wide choice of deep space cruisers as i say im constrained at the moment by being in contact but of course i could leave at any moment and within months be home with another two hundred years or more of carefree life to look forward to and all for nothing i dont have to do anything for all this but at the same time i am poor i own nothing just as every atom in my body was once part of something else in fact part of many different things and just as the elementary particles were themselves part of other patterns before they came together to form the atoms that make up the magnificent physical and mental specimen you see standing so impressively before you yes thank you and just as one day every atom of my being will one day be part of something else a star initially because that is the way we choose to bury our dead again so everything around me from the food that i eat and the drink that i drink and the figurine that i carve and the house i inhabit and the clothes i wear so elegantly to the module i ride to the plate that i stand on and the star that warms me is there when i am there rather than because i am these things may be arranged for me but in that sense i only happen to be me and they would be there for anybody else should they desire them too i do not emphatically not own them now on earth things are not quite the same on earth one of the things that a large proportion of the locals is most proud of is this wonderful economic system which with a sureness and certainty so comprehensive one could almost imagine the process bears some relation to their limited and limiting notions of either thermodynamics or god all food comfort energy shelter space fuel and sustenance gravitates naturally and easily away from those who need it most and towards those who need it least indeed those on the receiving end of such largesse are often harmed unto death by its arrival though the effects may take years and generations to manifest themselves to combat this insidious and disgusting travesty of sensible human relationships on a truly fundamental level was patently impossible on an infested dunghill like earth so deprived as it obviously was of meaningful genetic choice at a fundamental level and therefore philosophical options on a more accessible scale and it became obvious through the perverse logic inherent in the species and the process they had entailed that the only way to react to such a system that had any chance of making it worse and conditions that much less bearable was to accept it on its own terms go into competition with it now quite apart from the fact that from the point of view of the earther socialism suffers the devastating liability of only exhibiting internal contradictions when you are trying to use it as an adjunct to your own stupidity unlike capitalism which again from the point of view of the earther happily has them built in from the start it is the case that because free enterprise got there first and set up the house rules it will always stay at least one kick ahead of its rivals thus while it takes soviet russia a vast amount of time and hard work to produce one inspired lunatic like lysenko the west can so arrange things that even the dullest farmer can see it makes more sense to burn his grain melt his butter and wash way the remains of his pulped vegetables with his tanks of unused wine than it does to actually sell the stuff to be consumed and note that even if this mythical yokel did decide to sell the stuff or even give it away the earthers have an even more devastating trick they can perform they show you that those foods arent even needed anyway they wouldnt feed the least productive most unimportant untouchable from pradesh tribesperson from darfur or peon from rio branco the earth has more than enough to feed all its inhabitants every day already a truth so seemingly worldshattering one wonders that the oppressed of earth dont rise up in flames and anger yesterday but they dont because they are so infected with the myth of selfinterested advancement or the poison of religious acceptance they either only want to make their own way up the pile so they can shit upon everybody else or actually feel grateful for the attention when their socalled betters shit on them it is my contention that this is either an example of the most formidable and blissfully arrogant use of power and existing advantage or scarcely credible stupidity now then suppose we make ourselves known to this ghastly rabble what happens li stretched his arms out and looked round us all just long enough to get a few people starting to answer him back then roared on ill tell you what they wont believe us oh so we have moving maps of the galaxy accurate to a millimetre contained in something the size of a sugar cube oh so we can make orbitals and rings and get across the galaxy in a year and make bombs too small to see that could tear their planet apart li sneered let one hand flap limp nothing these people expect time travel telepathy matter transmission yes we can say well we do have a very limited form of prescience through the use of antimatter at the boundary of the energy grid which lets us see nearly a millisecond into or well we usually train our minds in a way not entirely compatible with natural telepathic empathy such as it is but see this machine here well if you ask it nicely or well displacing isnt quite transmission of matter but see i told you the drone they will laugh us out of the un building especially when they discover we havent even got out of our home galaxy yet unless you count the clouds but i doubt they would and anyway what is the culture as a society compared to what they expect they expect capitalists in space or an empire a libertariananarchist utopia equality liberty fraternity this is not so much oldfashioned stuff as simply unfashionable stuff their warped minds have taken them away on an evaporatingly stupid side track off the main sequence of social evolution and we are probably more alien than they are capable of understanding so the ship thinks we should just sit and watch this pack of genocidal buffoons for the next few millenia li shook his head wagged one finger i think not i have a better idea and i shall put it into effect as soon as i am elected captain but now he raised his hands and clapped the sweet course the drones and units reappeared holding small steaming bowls of meat li topped up a few of the glasses nearest him and urged everybody else to refill their own as the final course was distributed id just about filled myself up on the cheeses but after lis speech i seemed to have a bit more room still i was glad my bowl was small the aroma coming off the meat was quite pleasant but i didnt think somehow it was an earth dish meat as a sweet dish roghres said sniffing the gently steaming bowl hmm smells sweet certainly shit tel ghemada said prodding at her own bowl i know what this is ladies and gentlemen li said standing with a bowl in one hand and a silver fork in the other a little taste of earth no more than that a chance for you to participate in the rough and tumble of living on a squalid backwater planet without actually having to leave your seat or get your feet dirty he stabbed a bit of the meat put it in his mouth chewed and swallowed human flesh ladies and gents cooked muscle of hom sap as i suspect few of you might have guessed a little on the sweet side for my palate but quite acceptable eat up i shook my head roghres snorted tel put her spoon down i sampled some of lis unusual dish while he continued i had the ship take a few cells from a variety of people on earth without their knowledge of course he waved the sword vaguely at the table behind us most of you over there will be eating either stewed idi amin or general pinochet chilli con carne here in the centre we have a combination of general stroessner meat balls and richard nixon burgers the rest of you have ferdinand marcos sauté and shah of iran kebabs there are in addition scattered bowls of fricaséed kim ii sung boiled general videla and ian smith in black bean sauce all done just right by the excellent if leaderless chef we have around us eat up eat up we ate up most of us quite amused one or two thought the idea a little too outre and some affected boredom because they thought li needed discouragement not accomplices while a few were just too full already but the majority laughed and ate comparing tastes and textures if they could see us now roghres giggled cannibals from outer space when we were mostly done li stood on the table again and clapped his hands above his head listen listen heres what ill do if you make me captain the noise died away slowly but there was still a fair amount of chattering and laughter li raised his voice earth is a silly and boring planet if not then it is too deeply unpleasant to be allowed to exist dammit theres something wrong with those people they are beyond redemption and hope they are not very bright they are incredibly bigoted and unbefuckinglievably cruel both to their own kind and any other species that has the misfortune to stray within range which of course these days means damn nearly every species and theyre slowly but determinedly fucking up the entire planet li shrugged and looked momentarily defensive not a particularly exciting or remarkable planet for a lifesustainer type true but its still a planet it is quite pretty and the principle remains frighteningly dumb or majestically evil i suggest there is only one way to deal with this incontestably neurotic and clinically insane species and that is to destroy the planet li looked round at this point waiting to be interrupted but nobody was rising to the bait those of us not distracted by the drink whatever drugs or each other just sat smiling indulgently and waited to see what lis next crazy idea was he went on now i know this might seem a little extreme to some of you cries of no no bit lenient if you ask me wimp and yeah nuke the fuckers and more importantly very messy but i have talked it over with the ship and it informs me that the best method from my point of view is actually quite elegant as well as extremely effective all we do is drop a micro black hole into the centre of the planet simple as that no untidy debris left floating about no big vulgar flash and if we do it right no upsetting the rest of the solar system it takes longer than displacing a few tonnes of cam into the core but even that has the advantage of giving the humans time to reflect on their past follies as their world is eaten away beneath them in the end all youd have left is something about the size of a large pea in the same orbit as the earth and a minor amount of xray pollution from meteoric material even the moon could stay where it is a rather unusual planetary subsystem but in terms of scale as much as anything else a fitting monument or memorial here li smiled at me i winked back to one of the more boringly inept rabbles marring the face of our fair galaxy couldnt we just wipe the place clear with a virus i hear you ask but no while it is true that the humans have still done relatively little damage to their planet so far from a distance it still looks fine it is still the case that the place has been contaminated even if we wiped all human life off the rockball people would still look down at the thing and shiver recalling the pathetic but fiercely selfdestructive monsters that once stalked its surface however even memories find it difficult to haunt a singularity li stuck the point of the light sword into the top of the table and made to lean on the pommel the wood flared and burned and the sword started to drill through the flaming redwood in a cloud of smoke li pulled the sword out shoved it in its scabbard and repeated the manoeuvre while somebody poured a small fortune in wine over the burning wood did they have scabbards roghres asked puzzled i thought they just turned it off the resulting steam and fumes rose dramatically around li as he leant on the pommel of the sword and looked seriously and sincerely at all of us ladies and gentlemen he nodded grimfaced this i submit is the only solution a genocide to end all genocides we have to destroy the planet in order to save it should you decide to do me the honour of electing me as your ruler to serve you i shall set about putting this plan into immediate effect and shortly earth and all its problems will cease to exist thank you li bowed turned stepped down and sat those of us whod still been listening clapped and eventually more or less everybody joined in there were a few fairly irrelevant questions about stuff like accretion disks lunar tidal forces and conservation of angular momentum but after li had done his best to answer those roghres tel djibard and i went to the head of the table lifted li up carried him down the length of the table to the sound of cheers took him into the lower accommodation level and threw him in the pool fused the light sabre but i dont think the ship meant to leave li with something that dangerous to wave around anyway we finished the fun off on a remote beach in western australia in the very early morning swimming off our heavy bellies and winefuddled heads in the slow rollers of the indian ocean or basking in the sunlight thats what i did just lay there on the sand listening to a still pooldamp li tell me what a great idea it was to blow the entire planet away or suck the entire planet away i listened to people splashing in the waves and tried to ignore li i dozed off but i was woken up for a game of hideandseek in the rocks and later we sat around and had a light picnic later li had us all play another game guess the generalization we each had to think of one word to describe humanity man the species some people thought it was silly just on principle but the majority joined in there were suggestions like precocious doomed murderous inhuman and frightening most of us whod been onplanet must have been falling under the spell of humanitys own propaganda because we tended to come up with words like inquisitive ambitious aggressive or quick lis own suggestion to describe humanity was mine but then somebody thought to ask the ship it complained about being restricted to one word then pretended to think for a long time and finally came up with gullible gullible i said yeah said the remote drone gullible and bigoted thats two words li told it im a fucking starship im allowed to cheat well it amused me i lay back the water sparkled the sky seemed to ring with light and way in the distance a black triangle or two carved the perimeter of the field the ship was laying down under the chopping blue sea undesirable alien youll thank me later december we were finishing off tying up the loose ends there was an air of weariness about the ship people seemed quieter i dont think it was just tiredness i think it was more likely the effect of a realized objectivity a distancing we had been there long enough to get over the initial buzz the honeymoon of novelty and delight we were starting to see earth as a whole not just a job to be done and a playground to explore and in looking at it that way it became both less immediate and more impressive part of the literature something fixed by fact and reference no longer ours a droplet of knowledge already being absorbed within the swelling ocean of the cultures experience even li had quieted down he held his elections but only a few people were indulgent enough to vote and we just did it to humour him disappointed li declared himself the ships captain in exile no i never understood that either and left it at that he took to betting against the ship on horse races ball games and football matches the ship must have been fixing the odds because it ended up owing li a ridiculous amount of money li insisted on being paid so the ship fashioned him a flawless cut diamond the size of his fist it was his the ship told him a gift he could own it li lost interest in it after that though and tended to leave it lying around the social spaces i stubbed a toe on it at least twice in the end he got the ship to leave the stone in orbit around neptune on our way out of the system a joke i spent a lot of time on the ship playing tsartas music though more to compose myself than anything else sma uses a relatively equivalent play on words here the drone i had my grand tour like most of the others on the ship so spent a day or so in all the places i wanted to see i saw sunrise from the top of khufu and sunset from ayers rock i watched a pride of lions laze and play in ngorongoro and the tabular bergs calve from the ross ice shelf i watched condors in the andes musk ox on the tundra polar bears on the arctic ice and jaguars slinking through the jungle i skated on lake baykal dived over the great barrier reef strolled along the great wall rowed across dal and titicaca climbed mount fuji took a mule down the grand canyon swam with the whales off baja california and hired a gondola to cruise round venice through the cold mists of winter under a sky that to me looked old and tired and worn i know some people did go to the ruins at angkor safety guaranteed by the ship its drones and knife missiles but not i no more could i visit the potala however much i wanted to we were due for a couple of months rr on an orbital in trohoase cluster standard procedure after immersion in a place like earth certainly i wasnt in the mood for any more exploring for a while i was drained sleeping five or six hours a night and dreaming heavily as though the pressure of artifically crammed information id started out with as briefing combined with everything id experienced personally was too much for my poor head and it was leaking out when my guard was down id given up on the ship earth was going to be a control id failed even the fallback position of waiting until armageddon was disallowed i argued it out with the ship in a crew assembly but couldnt even carry the human vote with me the arbitrary copied to the bad for business and the rest but i think it was just being kind nothing i said made any difference so i made music took my grand tour and slept a lot i finished my tour and said goodbye to earth on the cliffs of a chilly windswept thira looking out over the shattered caldera to where the rubyred sun met the mediterranean a livid plasma island sinking in the winedark sea cried so i wasnt at all pleased when the ship asked me to hit dirt for one last time but i dont want to well thats all right if youre quite sure im not asking you to do it for your own good i must admit but i did promise linter id ask and he did seem quite anxious to see you before we left oh but why what does he want from me he wouldnt say i didnt talk to him all that long i sent a drone down to tell him we were leaving soon and he said he would only talk to you i told him id ask but i couldnt guarantee anything he was adamant though only you he wont talk to me oh well such is life not to worry ill tell him you wont the small unit started to drift away but i pulled it back no no stop ill go god dammit ill go where where does he want to meet new york city oh no i groaned hey its an interesting place you might like it the precise nature of the catastrophe a general contact unit is a machine in contact you live inside one or several plus a variety of systems vehicles for most of your average thirtyyear stint i was just over half way through my spell and id been on three gcus the arbitrary had been my home for only a year before we found earth but the craft before it had been an escarpment class too so i was used to living in a device nevertheless id never felt so machinetrapped so tangled and caught and snarled up as i did after an hour in the big apple i dont know if it was the traffic the noise the crowds the soaring buildings or the starkly geometric expanses of streets and avenues i mean ive never even heard of a gsv which laid out its accommodation as regularly as manhattan or just everything together but whatever it was i didnt like it so a bitterly cold windy saturday night in the big city on the eastern seaboard only a couple of weeks shopping left till christmas and me sitting in a little coffee shop on nd street at eleven oclock waiting for the movies to end what was linter playing at going to see close encounters for the seventh time indeed i looked at my watch drank my coffee paid the check and left i tightened the heavy wool coat about me pulled on gloves and a hat i wore needlecords and kneelength leather boots i looked around as i walked a chill wind against my face what really got to me was the predictability it was like a jungle oslo a rock garden paris a parterre with its follies shady areas and breezeblock garages inset london with that vaguely conservatory air a badly kept museum haphazardly modernized wien a too severe version of paris high starch collared and berlin a long garden party in the ruins of a baroque sepulchre then new york a rain forest an infested towering teeming jungle full of great columns that scratched at the clouds but which stood with their feet in the rot decay and swarming life beneath steel on rock glass blocking the sun the ships living machine incarnate i walked through the streets dazzled and frightened the arbitrary was just a tap on my terminal away ready to send help or bounce me up on an emergency displace but i still felt scared id never been in such an intimidating place i walked up nd street and carefully crossed sixth avenue to walk along its far side towards the movie theatre people streamed out talking in twos and groups putting up collars walking off quickly with their arms round each other to find someplace warm or standing looking for a cab their breath misted the air in front of them and from the lights of the mothership to the lights of the foyer to the lights of the snarling traffic they moved linter was one of the last out looking thinner and paler than he had in oslo but brighter quicker he waved and came over to me he buttoned up a fawncoloured coat then put his lips to my cheek as he reached for his gloves mmm hello youre cold eaten yet im hungry want to eat hello im not cold im not hungry either but ill come and watch you how are you fine fine he smiled he didnt look fine he looked better than i remembered but in big city terms he was a bit scruffy and not very wellfed looking that fast edgy highpressure urban life had infected him i guess he pulled on my arm come on lets walk i want to talk all right we started along the sidewalk bustlehustle all their signs and lights and racket and smell the white noise of their existence a focus of all the worlds business how could they stand it the bag ladies the obvious loonies eyes staring the grotesquely obese the cold vomit in the alleys and the bloodstains on the kerb and all their signs those slogans and lights and pictures flickering and bright entreating and ordering enticing and demanding in a grammar of glowing gas and incandenscing wire this was the soul of the machine the ethological epicentre the planetary ground zero of their commercial energy i could almost feel it shivering down like bombblasted rivers of glass from these undreaming towers of dark and light invading the snowdark sky peace in the middle east the papers asked better celebrate bokassas coronation instead better footage you got a terminal linter said he sounded eager somehow of course turn it off he said his eyebrows rose he looked like a child all of a sudden please i dont want the ship to overhear i wanted to say something to the effect that the ship could have bugged every individual hair on his head but didnt i turned the terminal brooch to standby you seen close encounters linter said leaning towards me we were heading in the direction of broadway i nodded ship showed us it being made we saw the final print before anybody oh yes of course people bumped into us swaddled in their heavy clothes insulated the ship said youre leaving soon are you glad to be going yes i am i didnt think id be but i am and you are you glad to be staying pardon a police car charged past then another sirens whooping i repeated what id said linter nodded and smiled at me i thought his breath smelled oh yes he nodded of course i still think youre a fool you know youll be sorry oh no i dont think so he sounded confident not looking at me head held high as we walked down the street i dont think so at all i think im going to be very happy here happy here in the grand cold design and the fake warmth of the neon while the drunks brownbagged and the addicts begged and the deadbeats searched for warmer gratings and a thicker cardboard box it seemed worse here you saw the same thing in paris and london but it seemed worse here take a step from a shop you had to have an appointment for swathed in loot across the sidewalk to the roller merc or caddy purring at the kerb while some poor fuckedup husk of a human lay just a spit away but youd never notice them noticing or maybe i was just too sensitive shellshocked life really was a struggle on earth and the cultures percent noncom a year was as much as you could have expected any of us to handle and i was near the end of my resistance itll all work out sma im very confident fall in the street here and they just walk around you yes yes im sure youre right look he stopped turned me by the elbow so that we stood face to face im going to have to tell you i know you probably wont like me for it but its important to me i watched his eyes shifting to look at each of mine in turn his skin looked more mottled than i remembered some poredeep dirt what im studying im going to enter the roman catholic church ive found jesus diziet im saved can you understand that are you angry with me does it upset you no im not angry i said flatly thats great dervley if youre happy im happy for you congratulations thats great he hugged me i was pressed against his chest held released we resumed our walk walking faster he seemed pleased damn i cant tell you dizzy its just so good to be here to be alive and know there are so many people so much happening i wake up in the morning and i have to lie for a while just convincing myself im really here and its all really happening to me i really do i walk down the street and i look at the people just look at them a woman was killed in the place i stay in last week can you imagine that nobody heard a thing i go out and i go on buses and i buy papers and watch old movies in the afternoon yesterday i watched a man being talked down from the queensboro bridge i think people were disappointed dyou know when he came down he tried to claim he was a painter linter shook his head grinning hey i read a terrible thing yesterday you know i read that there are times when theres a really complicated birth and the babys caught inside the mother and probably already dead and the doctor has to reach up inside the woman and take the babys skull in his hand and crush it so they can save the mother isnt that terrible i dont think i could have condoned that even before i found jesus why couldnt they have done a caesarean i dont know i dont know i wondered about that myself you know i was thinking about coming up to the ship he looked briefly at me nodded to see if anybody else might want to stay i thought others might want to follow my example especially after id talked to them had a chance to explain i thought they might see i was right why didnt you we stopped at another intersection all the people charged around us hurrying through the smells of burning petrol and cooking and rotten food i smelled gas and sometimes steam wrapped itself around us damp and fragrant why didnt i linter mused watching the dont walk sign i didnt think it would do any good and i was afraid the ship might find a way of keeping me on board do you think i was foolish i looked at him while the steam curled round us and the sign changed to walk but i didnt say anything an old guy came up to us on the far sidewalk and linter gave him a quarter but ill be fine by myself anyway we turned down broadway heading towards madison square past shops and offices theatres and hotels bars and restaurants and apartment blocks linter put his arm round my waist squeezed me come on dizzy you arent saying much no im not am i i guess you still think im being stupid no more than the locals he smiled theyre really good people what you dont understand is you have to translate behaviour as well as language once you do realize that youll come to love these people the way i do sometimes i think theyve come to terms with their technology better than we have you know that no no i didnt know that here in mincerville meatgrinder city come to terms with it yeah sure turn off the aiming computer luke play the five tones close your eyes and concentrate together thats the way nobody here but us clears hand me down that orgone box im not getting through to you dizzy am i youre all closed up not really here youre halfway out the system already arent you im just tired i told him keep talking i felt like a helpless twitching pinkeyed rat caught in a maze in some shining alien laboratory vast and glittering with some lethal inhuman purpose they do so well considering i know theres a lot of horrible things going on but it only seems so terrible because we pay so much attention to it the vast majority of good stuff isnt newsworthy we dont notice it we dont see what a good time most of these people are having ive met a lot of quite happy people you know i have friends i met them through my work you work i was actually interested ha ha i thought the ship might not have told you that yes ive had a job for the last couple of months document translator for a big firm of lawyers uhhuh what was i saying oh yeah lots of people have a quite acceptable life theyre pretty comfortable in fact people can have neat apartments cars holidays and people can have children thats a good thing you know you see a lot more children on a planet like this i like children dont you yes i thought everybody did ha well anyway in some ways these people would consider us backward you know that i know it might sound dumb but it isnt look at transport the aircraft i had on my home plate was on its third or fourth generation nearly a thousand years old these people change their automobiles every year they have throwaway containers and disposable clothes and fashions that mean changing your clothes every year every season dervley compared to them the culture moves at a snails pace dervley what was it you wanted to talk about huh talk about linter looked confused we turned left onto fifth avenue oh nothing in particular i guess i just thought itd be nice to see you before you left wish you bon voyage i hope you dont mind you dont mind do you the ship said you might not want to come but you dont mind do you no i dont mind good good i didnt think his voice trailed off we walked on in our own silence in the midst of the citys continuous coughing and spitting and wheezing i wanted to go i wanted to get out of this city and off this continent and up from this planet and onto the ship and out of this system but something kept me walking with him walking and stopping stepping down and out across and up like another obedient part of the machine designed to move to function to keep going regardless to keep pressing on and plugging away warming up or falling down but always always moving down to the drug store or up to company president or just to stay a moving target hugging the rails on a course you hardly needed to see so could stay blinkered on missing the fallers and the lame around you and the trampled ones behind perhaps he was right and any one of us could stay here with him just vanish into the cityspace and disappear forever and never be thought of again never think again just obey orders and ordinances and do what the place demands start falling and never stop never find any other purchase and our twistings and turnings and writhings as we fall exactly what the city expects just what the doctor ordered linter stopped he was looking through an iron grille at a shop selling religious statues holy water containers bibles and commentaries crosses and rosaries and crib and manger scenes he stared down at it all and i watched him he nodded at the window display thats what weve lost you know what youve lost all of you a sense of wonder and awe and sin these people know there are still things they dont know things that can still go wrong things they can still do wrong they still have the hope because the possibility is there without the possibility of failure you cant have hope they have hope the culture has statistics we it the culture is too certain too organized and stifled weve choked the life out of life nothings left to chance take the chance of things going wrong out of life and it stops being life dont you see his pinched darkbrowed face looked frustrated no i dont see i told him he ran one hand through his hair shook his head look lets eat huh im really hungry okay lead on where this way somewhere really special we started off in the same direction again came to the corner of th street and turned up that a cold wind blew around us scattering papers what i mean is you have to have that potential for wrongness there or you cant live or you can but it doesnt mean anything you cant have the peak without the trough or light without shade its not that you must have evil to have good but you must have the possibility for evil thats what the church teaches you know thats the choice that man has he can choose to be good or evil god doesnt force him to be evil any more than he forces him to be good the choice is left to man now as it was to adam only in god is there any real chance of understanding and appreciating free will he pushed my elbow steering me down an alley a white and red sign glowed at the far end i could smell food you have to see that the culture gives us so much but in fact its only taking things away from us lobotomizing everybody in it taking away their choices their potential for being really good or even slightly bad but god who is in all of us yes in you too diziet perhaps even in the ship for all i know god who sees and knows all who is allpowerful allknowing in a way that no ship no mere mind can ever be infinitely knowing still allows us poor pathetic fallible humanity and by extension panhumanity allows even us the the it was dark in the alley but i should still have seen them i wasnt even listening properly to linter i was just letting him witter on not concentrating so i should have seen them but i didnt not until it was too late they moved out from behind us knocking over a dustcan shouting crashing into us linter spun around letting go of my elbow i turned quickly linter held up one hand and said did not shout something i didnt catch a figure rushed at me half crouched somehow without seeing it i knew there was a knife it all remains so clear so measured i suppose some secretion had taken over the instant my midbrain realized what was happening it seemed very light in the alley and everybody else was moving slowly along lines like laser beams or crosshairs casting weighted shadows in front of them along those lines in the direction they were moving i stepped to one side letting the boy and the knife spin past a rightfoot trip and a little pressure on his wrist as he went by and he had to let the knife go he stumbled and fell i had the knife and threw it far away down the alley before turning back to linter two of them had him on the ground kicking and struggling i heard him cry out once as i moved towards them but i recall no other sound whether it was really as silent as i remember it or whether i was simply concentrating on the sense that yielded the most information i dont know i caught the heels of one of them and pulled heaving him out and up cracking his face against one boot where id stuck it out to meet him i threw him out of the way the other one was already up lines seemed to be bunching up at the side of my vision and throbbing making me think about how much time the first one had had to regain his balance if not his knife i realized i wasnt doing this the way you were meant to the one in front of me lunged i stepped out of the way turning again i hit him on the head while i looked back at the first one who was on his feet coming forward but hesitating at the side of the one id hit second who was struggling up against the wall holding his face dark blood on pale skin they ran as one like a school of fish turning linter was staggering trying to stand i caught him and he clutched at me gripping my arm tightly breath wheezing he stumbled and sagged as we got to the red and white light outside the little restaurant a man with a napkin stuffed in the top of his vest opened the door and looked out at us linter fell at the doorstep it was only then i thought of the terminal and realized that linter was gripping the top of my coat where the terminal brooch was the smells of cooking came out of the open door the man with the napkin looked cautiously up and down the alley i tried to prise linters fingers free no he said no dervley let go let me get the ship no he shook his head there was sweat on his brow blood on his lips a huge dark stain was spreading over the fawn coat let me what lady no dont lady want me to call the cops linter linter lady linter when his eyes closed his grip loosened there were more people at the restaurant door somebody said jesus i stayed there kneeling on the cold ground with linters face close to mine thinking how many films the guns quieten the battle stops how often do they do this in their commercial dreams look after karen for me thats an order mister you know i always loved you killing of georgie ici resté un deporté inconnu what am i doing here come on lady come on lady come on lady somebody tried to lift me then he was lying beside linter looking hurt and surprised and somebody was screaming and people were backing off i started running i jabbed the terminal brooch and shouted i stopped at the far end of the alley near the street and rested against a wall looking at the dark bricks opposite a noise like a pop and a drone sinking slowly down in front of me a businesslike blackbody drone the inky lengths of two knife missiles hovering on either side above eye level twitchy for action i took a deep breath theres been a slight accident i said calmly halation effect i looked at earth it was shown inholod on one wall of my cabin brilliant and blue solid and whitewhorled then it was more like suicide tagm said stretching out on my bed i didnt think catholics but i cooperated i said still pacing up and down i let him do it i could have called the ship after he lost consciousness there was time we could still have saved him but hed been altered back dizzy and theyre dead when their heart stops arent they no theres two or three minutes after the heart stops it was enough time i had enough time well then so did the ship it must have been watching it was bound to have had a missile on the case tagm snorted linter was probably the most overobserved man on the planet the ship must have known too it could have done something the ship had the control it had the realtime grasp it isnt your responsibility dizzy i wished i could accept tagms moral subtraction i sat down on the end of the bed head in my hands staring at the holo of the planet in the wall tagm came over hugged me hands on my shoulders head on mine dizzy you have to stop thinking about it lets go do something you cant sit watching that damn holo all day i stroked one of tagms hands gazed again at the slowly revolving planet my gaze flicking in one glance from pole to equator you know when i was in paris seeing linter for the first time i was standing at the top of some steps in the courtyard where linters place was and i looked across it and there was a little notice on the wall saying it was forbidden to take photographs of the courtyard without the mans permission i turned to tagm they want to own the light dramatic exit or thank you and goodnight at five minutes and three seconds past three am gmt on the morning of january the second the general contact unit arbitrary broke orbit above the planet earth it left behind an octet of main observation satellites six of them in neargs orbits a scattering of drones and minor missiles and a small plantation of young oaks on a bluff near elk creek california the ship had brought linters body back up displacing it from its freezer in a new york city morgue but when we left linter stayed in a fashion i argued he ought to be buried onplanet but the ship disagreed linters last instructions regarding the disposal of his remains had been issued fifteen years earlier when he first joined contact and were quite conventional his corpse was to be displaced into the centre of the nearest star so the sun gained a bodyweight courtesy of culture tradition and in a million years maybe a little of the light from linters body would shine upon the planet he had loved the arbitrary held its darkfield for a few minutes then dropped it just past mars so there was just a chance it left an image on an earth telescope meanwhile it was snapping all its various remote drones and sats away from the other planets in the system it stayed in real space right up till the last moment making it possible that its rapidly increasing mass produced a blip on a terrestrial gravitywave experiment deep in some mountainmine then totalled as it dispatched linters body into the stellar core sucked a last few drones of pluto and a couple of outlying comets and slung lis diamond at neptune where its probably still in orbit id decided to leave the arbitrary after the rr but after id relaxed on svanrayt orbital for a few weeks i changed my mind i had too many friends on the ship and anyway it seemed genuinely upset when it found out i was thinking of transferring it charmed me into staying but it never did tell me whether it had been watching linter and me that night in new york so did i really believe i was to blame or was i kidding even myself i dont know i didnt know then and i dont know now there was guilt i recall but it was an odd sort of guilt what really annoyed me what i did find hard to take was my complicity not in what linter was trying to do and not in his own halfwilled death but in the generality of transferred myth those people accepted as reality it strikes me that although we occasionally carp about having to suffer and moan about never producing real art and become despondent or try too hard to compensate we are indulging in our usual trick of synthesizing something to worry about and should really be thanking ourselves that we live the life we do we may think ourselves parasites complain about mindgenerated tales and long for genuine feelings real emotion but we are missing the point and indeed making a work of art ourselves in imagining such an uncomplicated existence is even possible we have the best of it the alternative is something like earth where as much as they suffer for all that they burn with pain and confused bewildered angst they produce more dross than anything else soap operas and quiz programmes junk papers and pulp romances worse than that there is an osmosis from fiction to reality a constant contamination which distorts the truth behind both and fuzzes the telling distinctions in life itself categorizing real situations and feelings by a set of rules largely culled from the most hoary fictional clichés the most familiar and received nonsense hence the soap operas and those who try to live their lives as soap operas while believing the stories to be true hence the quizzes where the ideal is to think as close to the mean as possible and the one who conforms utterly is the one who stands above the rest the winner they always had too many stories i believe they were too free with their acclaim and their loyalty too easily impressed by simple strength or a cunning word they worshipped at too many altars well theres your story perhaps its as well i havent changed very much over the years i doubt that its much different from what id have written a year or a decade later rather than a century ha the drone its funny the images that stay with you though over the years one thing has haunted me one dream recurred it really has nothing to do with me in a sense because it was something i never saw yet it stays there nevertheless i didnt want to be displaced that night nor did i want to travel out to somewhere remote enough for a module to pick me up without being seen i got the blackbody drone to lift me from the city right up darkfielded into the sky in the midst of manhattan rising above all that light and noise into the darkness quiet as any falling feather i sat on the drones back still in shock i suppose and dont even remember transferring to the dark module a few kilometres above the grid of urban light i saw but didnt watch and thought not of my own flight but about the other drones the ship might be using on the planet at the time where they might be what doing i mentioned the arbitrary collected snowflakes actually it was searching for a pair of identical ice crystals it had has a collection not holes or figure breakdowns but actual samples of ice crystals from every part of the galaxy it has ever visited where it found frozen water it only ever collects a few flakes each time of course a saturation pickup would be inelegant i suppose it must still be looking what it will do if it ever does find two identical crystals it has never said i dont know that it really wants to find them anyway but i thought of that as i left the glittering grumbling city beneath me i thought and i still dream about this maybe once or twice a year of some drone its flat back stardappled quietly in the steppes or at the edge of a polynya off antarctica gently lifting a single flake of snow teasing it away from the rest and hesitating perhaps before going displaced or rising taking its tiny perfect cargo to the orbiting starship and leaving the frozen plains or the waste of ice once more at peace perfidy or a few words from the drone well thank goodness thats over i dont mind telling you this has been an extremely difficult translation not helped at all by smas intransigent and at times obstructive attitude she frequently used marain expressions it would be impossible to render accurately into english without at least a threedimensional diagram and consistently refused to redraft or revise the text to facilitate its translation i have done my best but i can take no responsibility for any misunderstanding caused by any part of this communication i suppose i had better note here that the chapter titles including that for smas covering letter and this and subtitles are my own additions sma wrote the above as one continuous document can you imagine but i thought it better to split the thing up the chapter titles and subtitles are incidentally also all names of general contact units produced by the infracaninophile manufactury in yinang orbital which sma refers to without naming in chapter three another thing you will notice that sma has the gall to refer to me simply as the drone in her letter i have humoured her matronizing whim quite long enough and now wish to make clear that my name is in fact fohristiwhirl skaffenamtiskaw handrahen dran easpyou i am not selfimportant and it is irresponsible of sma to suggest that my duties in special circumstances are some sort of atonement for past misdeeds my conscience is clear skaffenamtiskaw drone offensive ps i

an extremely strained translation but its the best available the drone effectively untranslatable the drone another tricky one ms sma keeps on using words there is no direct english equivalent for the drone sma refuses to choose between british english and american english this would be randiest in british english the drone the word sma insists upon using is exactly midway in meaning between common and vulgar take your pick the drone i think this jars abominably but herself disagrees the drone ms sma is confusing matter transmission sic with transdimensional displacement of a remotely induced singularity i despair the drone actually sma was talking to a shipslaved tray carrying drinks but she thinks it sounds silly to say she was talking to a tray the drone the following speech sourced from the arbitrarys own files has been rendered as accurately as possible mr ndanes grammatical eccentricities are difficult to reproduce in english the drone i thought the phonetic equivalent was better than something strained like horsoid the drone see i told you the drone sma uses a relatively equivalent play on words here the drone
