david dalglish the old ways jerico reached for his shield as he heard the rider thunder into the dark village of wilhelm whats going on asked darius sitting up in his bedroll is he one of sebastians jerico shook his head peering through a crack in the door of the small shed that they slept in no he said i dont think so theyd been on the run since the battle between arthur and sebastian hemman the two paladins originally on opposite sides of the conflict but jerico had won his friend over and together theyd defeated several faithful to karak arthurs army had lost however forcing them to flee to safety sebastians men had combed the surrounding forests and it had taken a lot of running and a bit of luck for the two to reach wilhelm without being seen theyd rented the only room available in the farming village the shed i only use it when an animal gets sick to keep it away from the others the farmer had said dont worry none been awhile since the last and i changed the straw jerico had been looking forward to his first peaceful night of sleep in what felt like days but then the horsed rider had come crying out something jerico hadnt quite caught he might be looking for arthurs men darius said rubbing his eyes the village is loyal to kaide jerico said pressing open the door the rider had stopped in the village square and several older men and women were coming out to greet him in their bedclothes you so certain jerico nodded kaide was a local hero in the north a bandit who robbed sebastian hemmans caravans and gave away the wealth and supplies he didnt need it was his private war against sebastian that had started everything with arthur only recently taking up arms against his brother we are safe no matter the coin they offer no matter the coin asked darius jerico shrugged well within reason everyone has their price that so then what is yours eternity said jerico stepping outside the shed id love to see sebastian offer me that given jericos prominent role in the battle he knew he needed to be careful in case the rider had been told his description with his long hair red beard and bluesilver armor he wasnt the most easily forgotten of men still the night was dark and his armor was in the shed if he kept his distance he should be able listen in without being noticed the rider was still gathering people ensuring that there would be no need to repeat himself before riding off to his next destination jerico leaned against the side of a house hidden in the shadows cast by the torchlight the rider wore light armor and he bore a crest jerico recognized sir robert godley and his men had worn similar markings when they came to help fight off the wolfmen in durham it seemed like ages ago to jerico but he knew itd been hardly three months he felt his worry lessen robert was a friend and had little to do with the brothers conflict people of wilhelm i seek a man responsible for a most terrible tragedy the rider began the speech was wellrehearsed and though his words were fiery he spoke them in a perfunctory manner to jerico he sounded beyond exhausted not long ago a man helped burn down the village of durham and slaughtered many of its residents this act was done without mercy and without reason ive come offering a bounty of five hundred gold coins to whoever brings me or any proper authority of the king this mans head a gasp ran through the people five hundred gold was a fortune a thousand times more than any farmers might see in their lifetime jerico felt something catch in his throat as he thought of durham hed preached alongside darius there becoming friends with the people hed lost many fighting the wolfmen succeeding only because of roberts help now someone had attacked it again who asked one of the crowd as if on cue who indeed thought jerico he found himself wishing he held his mace in hand who would dare defile the sacrifices theyd made his name is darius cried the rider a tall man with long blond hair he hails from the stronghold and wears the cruel armor of their kind he is extremely dangerous and should be greatly feared my master sir robert godley offers this bounty so this vile criminal will be brought to justice for his terrible deeds jerico felt like hed been punched in the gut his blood drained from his face and as the people began to murmur he remembered the words hed spoken in jest not moments ago everyone has their price indeed and the villagers were just exceeded tenfold jerico turned and ran for the shed knowing time was not on their side darius waited for him leaning beside the door with his arms crossed seeing jericos worry he frowned whats wrong he asked put your armor on jerico said ignoring him now the countless hours spent putting on and taking off the cumbersome plate and chainmail served him well as jerico donned it in the darkness darius strapped on his greaves then reached for his chestplate whats going on he asked again jerico knew he should ask about durham but wasnt sure he wanted to hear the answer still he had to know theres a bounty on your head he said not looking at his friend they saythey say you helped destroy durham helped kill a lot of people he left his question unspoken as he pulled on his gauntlets torchlight flickered through cracks in the walls as outside the first of many arrived they would not rush in until the whole town was gathered jerico was certain their little shed would be surrounded with more coming every second all to guarantee no escape he grabbed his mace and his shield soft blue light shone across them in the light darius met his gaze i killed no one darius said but i was there and i deserve their anger jerico struck a board felt the whole shed vibrate several people outside gasped come out darius someone shouted jerico recognized him as the messenger from robert theres no reason to spill any more blood darius finished putting on the last of his armor then reached for his weapon it was an enormous twohanded sword its edges serrated in sections it shimmered with a faint light far dimmer than jericos shield the glow represented the strength of their faith and jerico felt worry squirm in his gut at how weak dariuss was whatever had happened at durham it still troubled him greatly darius cried the messenger amid an uneasy rumble of conversation what do i do asked darius theyll be knocking down the walls any second we cant kill them jerico said theyre just desperate id say greedy how much was the bounty five hundred jerico muttered silver gold darius chuckled damn if you are guilty theyre just obeying the law i wont shed innocent blood darius shook his head i wont give myself up for a hanging you must trust me i killed no one even did my best to protect them dont you dare turn on me here the door rattled jerico kicked it open and as the people scattered away he stepped out amid the mob his shield shining bright on his arm there were over two hundred gathered men and women of all ages those closest bore weapons sickles pitchforks and staves designed for farming not warfare only roberts messenger wielded a blade and he held it before him as if expecting jerico to attack at any moment jerico looked into their eyes as they held their collective breaths he saw fear desperation and a greedy hope for something far beyond their tired meager lives he could not blame them but that didnt mean he had to accept it go back to your homes he told them we were offered safety and a soft place to lay our heads will you betray that now all for the promise of gold hes a criminal said an older man jerico recognized him as the farmer who had lent them the shed several others murmured in agreement as am i jerico said an outlaw so says your lord sebastian will you turn me in next plenty looked unhappy at that support for kaide ran deep and jerico had quickly become a hero for his pivotal role in the battle at green gulch only the messenger seemed not to care thats different muttered one of the farmers you aint done what hes done send him out and let it all be over quick jerico felt torn but knew he could show no weakness he needed to hear it from dariuss lips know for certain what had happened shed no innocent blood if there was anything that had been hammered into his thick skull during his training at the citadel that had been it but he was also trained to protect and letting his friend be strung up by a mob felt a bit contradictory to that the coin wont buy you happiness jerico said his voice softer it will only tear apart the love you have for one another it wont bring peace it wont bring safety do not do this you offered us shelter and safety dont stain your hands with treachery before any could answer darius stepped out into the night his armor dark steel shimmered in the torchlight his hollow eyes looked to the crowd which gave him a wide berth despite their numbers attacking someone so well armored strong and skilled was something none of them were prepared to do alone enough he said his voice carrying authority jerico had always considered him the far better speaker and a master at manipulating crowds many stepped back as if expecting him to draw his blade which so far remained on his back darius youre under arrest said the messenger he was sweating and his sword was unsteady in his hand darius shook his head i have too much to atone for my life does not end here not to a misled mob in the dead of night i do not want to hurt any of you and jerico will insist the same i have done many wrongs but of this i am accused unfairly i took no lives i spilled no blood if you would hang me or cut off my head you end the life of the wrong man the one who committed that deed is dead slain by my hand move aside and let us be we still fight for you for kaide but i will protect myself if i must he drew his sword and pointed ahead of him move aside at first jerico thought they would the speech was sincere his certainty forceful jerico felt uncomfortable with the implied threat but surely the people would understand surely they would realize the gold coin was not worth the bloodshed and betrayal of cowards said the messenger thrusting for a crease in dariuss armor before it hit darius stepped to one side and swung the blade cut the messenger at the wrist blood arced across the grass as both weapon and hand twirled and fell jerico felt his heart stop and his breath catch in his throat the mob saw blood and it was like fire on dry leaves push through jerico shouted ducking his head and leading with his shield his armor was thick and his shield thicker he felt blows strike him mostly ineffective a sickle scraped across his pauldron and a pitchfork struck the shield before sliding to one side legs pumping jerico continued on giving them no chance to resist no chance to regroup he burst through the other side of the crowd feeling battered and bruised but alive spinning he saw darius trying to follow but the crowds attention had turned on him without a shield he could only lead with his sword he cut and parried relying on his armor to protect him from fists and clubs and his blade to protect him from all else his armor had many sharp ridges and edges and he slammed through people who tried to block his way blood coated the dark steel darius jerico shouted as the way closed between them he ran using his shield to shove aside a group of three trying to stop dariuss exit two more blocked the way both with heavy sickles darius smacked aside one but the other slipped through his defenses the curved end hooked over his chestplate past his neck and into the flesh of his collarbone darius screamed and then whipped his sword around cleaving the attacking farmer in half no jerico cried the way was clear and darius sprinted free jerico stood before the crowd and he braced with his shield forgive me if this is wrong he prayed light swelled in the center of his shield then burst outward with the strength of a lightning bolt blinded the people staggered hooking his shield on his back jerico turned and ran following darius out of wilhelm and into the wilderness beyond they ran for a long hour both of them conditioned to such exertion as well as blessed with strength from their deity not a word was said between them at last they reached the end of the farmland and feeling confident they could lose themselves in the hills beyond jerico slowed bending over to catch his breath he let his shield slip to the ground glad to be free of its weight darius did the same jamming his sword into the dirt and leaning on it the handle pressed against his face youre bleeding jerico said most of the blood isnt mine no your neck darius pulled off his glove and then touched the wound at his collarbone his fingers came back red not too deep he said ill live an awkward silence fell between them jerico felt he should be the teacher darius his student even though darius was actually older he knew more of the world understood better the politics of the north but hed erred badly darius he started to say save it i know i made a mistake a mistake you cut a man in two darius glared i was hurt and frightened a second more and they would have buried me what would you have done then watched me die or risked dying yourself when you tried to save me there was no reasoning with them and you know it they might have listened until you cut off a mans hand his voice was rising and much as he knew he shouldnt he continued anyway were beacons examples for others to follow were not executioners bullshit darius was in his face now overcome with exhaustion and frustration i saw how many wolfmen you killed far more than i ever did i saw you slaughter sebastians men youre just as good at killing as i am if not better i killed one man one man protecting my life you think im happy about it think i enjoyed it gods damn it if this world were just theyd have killed me in my sleep without giving me the choice you werent there you didnt see it he fell silent jerico took a deep breath and forced himself to calm down he couldnt judge darius harshly not without knowing everything hed gone through this was a man turned from karak to ashhur a dark paladin would have had no qualms about slaughtering an entire village to protect himself that he felt guilt at all was a poignant sign what happened in durham jerico asked softly ive not asked before but now i think it best you tell me darius looked back to the village then sighed a priest found me wandering and lost he said he offered me a chance to redeem myself in the eyes of karak he was a cold cruel man jerico if he was ever even a man very powerful and worst of all his words were like poison in my mind i believed him he was karaks prophet the voice of my god and then he brought me to durham to make amends for my mistakes i was to convert the faithful make the entire village bend its knee jerico thought of the many he knew there and could guess their reaction what happened then he asked darius chuckled and he wiped at his eyes i couldnt do it i tried but they knew me better than i knew myself yet it didnt matter the prophetwhen he came backdamn it damn it all i told them to run i told them how dangerous he was some listened but not enough he came with fire and magic and he started laughing despite his grief you know what jerico im glad theres a bounty on my head it means a few made it out alive it means at least i might have done something right jerico looked back and he saw a distant cluster of torches about a mile away by his estimate we need to continue he said it looks like theyre pursuing us farther than i thought i dont blame them they gathered their things they had terribly few supplies and jerico expected a very hungry day until they could reach another village or trap a rabbit or squirrel darius said jerico please just promise me you wont kill anyone else coming after you because of that bounty theyre only obeying the law ill help protect you from the people but dont make me protect the people from you darius looked down at his armor saw the blood on the sharp edges ill try he said forgive me ive much to learn jerico thought of his dilemma earlier and chuckled i think we both have plenty to learn lets just keep the body count to a minimum while we do sir robert godley was at the top of the blood tower when karaks army arrived robert asked daniel coldmine roberts most trusted companion the lieutenant stood at the halfopen door his fingers still wrapped about the handle i know robert said staring out the window at the reinforced doors of the walls surrounding the tower beyond were tents caravans and many many armed men his heavy hands lay flat across his desk between them were a bottle and an empty glass send whoever is in charge up to me daniel hesitated sir we still have the option to turn them away the worst they can do is voice their complaint back at mordeina they cant be mad enough to attack servants of the king and expect no retribution i said bring their leader to me robert said still refusing to turn around i will show no fear not to the likes of them now go daniel bowed ill return shortly take as much time as you need robert said to no one he reached for the bottle then pushed it away he wasnt drunk but he was getting damn close it was shameful enough using the liquor to bolster his courage confronting the priests shitfaced was an embarrassment hed never let himself live down he was better than that and more importantly he owed his men better than that it hadnt taken long within two weeks of his bounty on the paladin darius hed received message that an envoy from mordeina would soon arrive to represent the stronghold robert had put a death sentence on the head of one of their own at the time daniel had warned him such an action would not go unnoticed and hed been right as to how karaks children would respond he could only guess but seeing over five hundred private soldiers bearing the mark of the lion surrounding his tower roberts imagination didnt need to work too hard a knock at the door sent him slowly to his feet enter he said the door opened and daniel escorted two men inside one was older with thin gray hair that hung down to his bony shoulders he stood straight though and walked without a limp he offered a wrinkled hand and when robert shook it he squeezed with impressive strength greetings knight said the priest his voice was deep wellaged my name is luther priest of our glorious god karak with me is my pupil cyric the other man stepped forward unlike luther he looked young barely into his twenties he bowed low in a manner more respectful than luther had shown his hair was a deep brown and cut short so that his forehead seemed much larger than it was combined with his blue eyes and slender nose it gave him an awkward youthful look when he spoke though his voice echoed with an authority and a certainty that immediately revealed why hed been chosen as luthers pupil i am honored to meet the man who devised the banishment of the heathen elves from our lands said cyric you did mordan a great service youd have been at your mothers breast when that happened if not still in her belly robert said how could you know much of that hes a voracious reader said luther i doubt there is a book in our library he has not read but come we have not traveled all this way to discuss forgotten battles word of your bounty on one of the strongholds paladins reached us quickly sir godley robert exchanged a look with daniel who shifted his stance so his hand rested on the hilt of his sword im not a fool said robert i knew youd come but if there were ever a guilty man in the north it would be darius i have over a hundred people wholl swear that he we have not come to question his guilt luther interrupted darius is a fallen servant and has rejected karaks teachings we have reason to believe he killed several of our paladins good men sent to find and ascertain his faithfulness to our ways roberts eyes narrowed they werent here to argue or to protect darius it sounded too good to be true which made him all the more suspicious then why have you come luther i can see your armed men from my window the north is dangerous but not so much to require that large an escort for only two priests indeed said luther smiling i pray we have not frightened you but yes we have come with a request you handed darius a sentence of death but we ask that you deliver him unto us instead you want to spare his life asked daniel and robert could see his anger ready to burst forth spare it asked the young cyric laughing our tomes detail quite clearly the fate blasphemers and traitors must suffer whatever death you think darius deserves i assure you ours will be worse luther shot his pupil a look and robert recognized it well it was a warning against speaking out of turn robert had just sent daniel that same look for his own outburst this is about more than punishment luther said clearing his throat darius is a dangerous man and your bounty invites much unnecessary death if he can kill our skilled paladins then poor farmers and soldiers desperate for a bit of coin stand little chance i ask that you retract the bounty and instead make it for information only let the stronghold deal with darius he will not remain hidden for long not from me robert crossed his arms and tried to think the offer was tempting but something about it bothered him the two priests were acting too kind too understanding no doubt they were trying to save face for their order by having darius executed in private hardly the example robert wanted to set his crimes are against the kings citizens robert said trying to stall whose protection has been left to lord sebastian said luther but has he done anything of course not hes too busy squabbling with his brother for land leaving this matter to you speaking of which the old man walked over to the map on the far side of roberts wall and he rubbed his chin as he stared at it with bloodshot eyes how goes the north he asked we hear only rumors in mordeina and struggle to know what is true and what is not lord arthur met lord sebastian in fair battle and lost robert said he retreated to his castle which lord sebastian has put under siege that is the last i have heard but i expect it to take months before the castle of caves falls sebastian is a good friend of karak cyric said more to luther than robert we must ensure his victory over his brother i thought the priests and paladins of karak remained neutral in political matters daniel interrupted again robert knew well his distaste for the priests and if he couldnt hold his tongue go prepare lodging for luthers men he ordered daniel looked displeased but he bowed low and left to carry out his orders a rebellious man luther said softly chuckling he only asks what i myself am thinking robert said and you are right in a way we are neutral in most politics but when it comes to karak and his children we are ever vigilant sebastian is a faithful servant whereas arthur is under the delusion we are a detriment to the north besides is sebastian not the lawful ruler of these lands we only uphold the law robert as do i said robert and darius has broken it forgive me but my bounty stays if he is no longer a paladin of the stronghold then he should be of no concern to you we do not operate under your laws cyric said we live under the law of karak which is wise as it is cyric looked furious but luther remained calm not even turning from the map enough cyric said luther he gestured to the door leave us i will speak with our host in private cyrics look was bitter but he bowed low and obeyed as the door closed luther sighed may i sit he asked by all means luther walked over to a chair pressed against the wall that was usually reserved for daniel his joints creaked as he sat his eyes bored into robert who sat at his desk something about that look shriveled his testicles and made him wish he could call daniel back in you must forgive my pupil luther said he is still young and has difficulty understanding that the way of the world is rarely as easy as his books would imply robert grunted very little of the world is easy especially here in the north indeed i do not think he would understand what i have to say to you for i know what he expects me to say the will of karak is lord of all things and for you to resist speaks blasphemy against that which is holy robert decided to the abyss with it and poured himself another glass and what would you say he asked before taking a drink that such a claim would be an insult to your honor you have the safety of many people in your hands and the lawful authority to do what you have done you also fear our power for you know how strong our influence is in mordeina you also fear karak i can see it in your eyes yes what you did is within your power but not all we do is wise you may have the authority to lay judgment on a priest or paladin of karak but it is not your place to do so i need to be convinced you are aware of that you just said darius was no longer a paladin of the stronghold something you were unaware of when you offered that bounty robert tried to summon fury at having his station challenged his authority mocked instead he could only stare into luthers eyes and feel the power of the entire priesthood prepared to move against him i fail to see how you are any different from your pupil he said putting aside his glass cyric would view your resistance as blasphemy worthy of punishment and purging with cleansing fire he would threaten you with the abyss and escalate this into a conflict of wills and pride i only hope that we might see eye to eye you do not have to agree with me robert only acknowledge who wields the greater power and act as the pragmatic man i know you are robert swallowed there was no doubt about who wielded the greater power it took months of begging just to get king baedan to send a fraction of their needed resupplies yet meanwhile the priests of karak whispered into his ear day and night you want the bounty changed to capture only correct he asked i do luther said he smiled as if sensing roberts breaking resolve i want you to make me a promise robert said and swear to it in writing on the same parchment upon which i alter the bounty and what do i promise that your order will execute darius for his crimes i dont care how and dont care when i just need to know he will suffer for what he did to durham he has turned his back on our god luther said rising to his feet the stars may fall from the heavens and our sun dwindle and die yet his suffering will continue amid darkness and fire never ending never relenting if you wish you may write so on your parchment and i will sign it with my blood will that suffice it will suffice robert said but he felt no comfort cyric may have been a fanatic but this manhe truly believed what he said that he would capture darius and force him to endure such tortures but even amid the fanatic belief he could still see through roberts eyes understand his motives and react accordingly luther had left him with no argument against accepting his request other than basic pride should he resist anyway it would only take the time for a letter to reach king baedan and back before he was reprimanded and overruled excellent luther said clapping his hands my men will stay here while we await word of dariuss location as well as plan our conflict with this rebellious lord arthur oh and before i forget he pulled out a scroll from one of his lengthy robe pockets i know your provisions are low so as a measure of gratitude we have brought gifts from mordeina robert accepted the scroll unfurled it and began to read his jaw dropped bread butter caskets of ale jars of honey clothes coats furs blanketshe could reinforce nearly every tower along the gihon for the winter just with what their wagons had brought thank you he said stunned no thank you said luther for your cooperation robert heard his meaning loud and clear my men thank you as well luther smiled i am glad do not worry about finding my men a place to sleep they will bunk in our wagons and tents to lessen our burden upon you i must insist upon a room for cyric and myself though now if you do not object i must oversee my companions he left and robert leaned back in his chair his eyes flicked over the list still stunned by the donated wealth a rock built in his stomach as he thought of how refusing the priests would have kept him from receiving a single crumb of bread his men would have found out too his blood chilled theyd hear of the warm coats the abundant food and then hear how theyd lost it all because of a single criminal as dissension spread luther would have remained outside his tower surrounding it with his wagons damn it he said tossing the scroll to his desk it had never been an option the result had never been in doubt in time luther would have had his way once more he felt the power of the priesthood arrayed against him and knew how helpless he was before it his only consolation was knowing that that same power had turned its focus to darius deep down he believed luther would find him and bring him back to the stronghold in chains it would only be a matter of time v alessa stood naked before the door of the farmhouse she wanted to barge in but knew she had to find out for certain she had to know how much was left of her humanity her knuckles rapped against the wood its solidity against her touch reassuring at least there was that as the door opened she tried her best to act the poor wounded girl she held her daggers behind her back bandits she stammered to the heavyset farmer and his wife her body shivered like she was cold yet her red hair was singed in places as if by fire the husband set aside the dagger hed been holding while the wife reached for her sympathy in her eyes you poor dear said the woman come in please cale go see what you can find for her to wear the ceiling was low but the house was large enough for several rooms the walls were old wood but clean as the floor was meticulously swept a fire burned in the hearth and she fought an urge to sit beside it as valessa stepped inside the woman reached for her both flinched at the contact the womans fingers touching her shoulders only briefly oh my she said pulling back and rubbing her hands together her face looked a mixture of sadness and fear by gods youre cold cale returned holding a blanket and he made a point to stare at her eyes instead of elsewhere here you go miss he said wrapping it about her shoulders as the blanket settled over her she forced herself to concentrate to remain calm part of her expected it to fall right through her as if she were a ghost but it did not there was no warmth to it no comfort but at least she wasnt standing there naked care to sit with me by the fire asked the woman she gestured to two chairs carved of wood each on opposite sides of the fireplace iyes said valessa she shuffled as if she had been wounded in a way she had been though of her own volition every time she closed her eyes to rest she relived the memory of impaling herself on dariuss blade darius the betrayer my names dora and this is my husband cale said the woman settling down in her chair might i have your name valessa she said wrapping the blanket tighter about her it wasnt her nakedness she was trying to hide it was how with every movement she made her skin thinned its color draining away as it became liquid shadow she was darkness given form and a soul that she could hold the blanket gave her hope perhaps there was still a chance she might have some decency and normality even in the form her god had cursed her with forgive me she muttered blessed not cursed shed been given a chance to hunt down the traitor to make amends for her failure never should she spit in the face of her god and his gifts oh its no bother said dora misunderstanding her truth be told neither of us were sleeping the older we get the more the night seems to like us better than the day valessa settled in the chair focusing on every inch that touched her body there could be no give no shift there was still plenty she had to experiment with but if she were to be the assassin she needed to be simple acts like sitting in a chair needed to be mastered so far so good feeling confident she set her daggers beside her still hidden by the blanket cale returned a meager assortment of clothes in his calloused hands its not much he said holding them out for her to take but itll do until we can get you back to your family valessa tried to smile as a gray sister shed been trained in a hundred different personas from obedient servants to wealthy noblewomen she tried to be the wounded victim to keep her motions quick and startled her eyes wide her speech rare concentrating amid the pain though thank you she said reaching a hand out from underneath her blanket her reaction was too fast despite it being appropriate to the persona she channeled a wisp of smoke trailed over her skin cale didnt seem to notice and she thanked karak for that grabbing the clothes she felt the rough fabric its touch almost painful she set them on her lap and assumed correctly the couple would understand if she remained there still warming im hungry she said dora stood and she motioned for cale to take her seat i think we still have a bit of soup from earlier she said nodding to a pot set near the fireplace retrieving a wooden bowl and spoon from a cupboard she knelt and scraped up a meager portion of soup it was a dark brown broth with hints of meat and vegetables floating inside it looked appetizing enough valessa had yet to eat or drink a thing since herwhat should she call it resurrection recreation salvation it didnt matter that was over a week ago she should have been dead but she was not or perhaps she was she took the bowl slowly this was it she knew she dipped the spoon into the bowl then brought it to her lips her hand shook and its color faded opening her mouth she slipped the spoon inside she imagined the taste heavy and meaty but it was not there no sensation just the texture and an awareness of its lukewarm temperature the only thing she felt was pain every second day and night she felt a throbbing ache everywhere she once had muscle and flesh the taste of food was just another sensation without pleasure or satisfaction she wanted to cry but tears would not come her new form refused such a weakness valessa swallowed instead of traveling down her throat the liquid passed through the bottom of her chin and neck dripping across her blanket careful dear dora said when she saw the mess cale had not seen at all too busy staring into the fire with a halfasleep expression on his face fighting down her fury valessa offered the bowl back to dora with one hand too fast her hand became shadow and smoke the bowl fell right through her hitting the floor with a dull thud this time dora saw and her mouth dropped open valessa moved before she could scream she grabbed her daggers and shot from her chair she didnt cast aside the blanket for she passed right through it in a single smooth motion she slashed open the womans throat then turned to cale the man was still trying to get up from his chair when she jammed a dagger into his chest and twisted he coughed once his knuckles white as he clutched the arms of his chair and then he died blood poured across the handle of her dagger but when it reached her quivering flesh it slid past and down to the floor she dropped the dagger and naked on her knees she howled out in mindless fury softness pleasure comfort a loving embraceall denied to her and why because she had failed her duty failed to kill that bastard darius hatred seethed in her heart at the mere thought of his name hed suffer oh how shed make him suffer her new form might be a penance imposed by karak but there would be no penance for darius only torment when finished shed use her daggers to send him to karak and let her deity deliver for an eternity all the suffering darius deserved stop it she told herself even as she continued to shriek karak was not a god of love he was a god of order darius had broken that order as had valessa in failing to kill him she couldnt be angry not at karak no that wasnt fair it took all her willpower to choke down her fury at her beloved deity now was not the time for weakness it was time for revenge she looked down at her naked form valessa was not ashamed of exposing her body in any way and in truth had seduced many in the name of her god all to execute the unfaithful but trying to go about unnoticed would be impossible she needed clothes returning to her chair she grabbed a shirt and slid it over her head it was too big and left much of her breasts exposed but it was better than nothing pausing for a moment to focus her thoughts she took a single step every inch of fabric brushing against her shadowed flesh itched in her mind but she remained solid another step still good but she could not waddle everywhere like a lame animal the real test came as she lifted her arms above her head and twirled in a halfremembered dance that had been common in court the shirt fell through her to the floor her body a whirling creature of shadow and smoke why she shrieked her fists pounded against the floor until her hands began to pass through striking nothing it made no sense how could she perform her gods will when saddled with such difficulty how could he expect her to stroll naked through open streets in a hunt for his fallen paladin please she prayed her body might not create tears but she was sobbing anyway her grief overwhelming her please help me karak show me the way she heard no answer which perhaps she deserved trying to overcome her grief she looked at her naked body and began to think her body was not real only an illusion she could make parts of it solid particularly through concentration was her skin not also an illusion as she stared at herself she tried to see what she truly was not what she remembered before her eyes she became darkness the sight terrified her but in it she found hope perhaps there was more to it than that closing her eyes again she imagined her old leather armor covered with dull plain clothes and a long gray cloak wrapped about her shoulders shed worn such an outfit so often it was natural to her she could still imagine the way it felt and how her cloak would billow in the wind when she opened her eyes she was no longer naked thank you she whispered she moved her arms watched the sleeves fade along with her skin her body was just an illusion a projection of how she imagined herself which meant she closed her eyes again thinking of her former partner claire she tried to imagine claires blonde hair falling down to her shoulders over her more slender form and then she opened her eyes saw the hair saw the subtle shift of her hands the true power of karaks gift came to her then and she might have wept for joy yes she would have to endure pain but all gifts came with a price she could be anyone limited only by her imagination valessa retrieved her daggers only they would remain in her grasp when she moved at full speed somehow blessed by karak during the process of herrevival one last thought came to her one she had to finally test turning to a wall and without any time to think and therefore frighten herself off her course of action she ran straight at it no slowing at the last moment she closed her eyes when she opened them she was outside daggers still in hand she laughed where is he she asked looking to the stars where is the traitor when she lay down to sleep she relived her moment of death thrusting her neck upon his blade but when she focused on his name his face she could always look to the sky day or night and see a red star burning showing her the way sure enough she saw it and forgetting her hunger her pain her sorrow she left the corpses inside the farmhouse and headed southwest toward darius as the two paladins walked into stonahm jerico did not wonder about linking back up with kaide or worry that the villagers might hand darius over for coin all he cared about was finally getting himself a decent meal you sure they wont try for the bounty darius asked as they passed the nearby homes im not too eager to repeat what happened at wilhelm neither am i said jerico as he glanced about but this is kaides home his family the last time jerico had been in stonahm was not long after sebastians army had come and pillaged it much of the damage had been repaired over the past two weeks and as faces peered at them from windows and doorways he saw no anger only fear ive helped them fought for them to go against me and turn over an enemy of sebastian wouldnt even cross their minds he stopped in the center of the village with not so much as a word spoken to them in greeting everyone seemed eager to either avoid them or pretend they were not there i think jerico muttered as a group of men came around a corner and approached he recognized their leader the elderly kalgan the closest person the village had to a healer i see you survived kalgan said hardly sounding pleased by that fact jerico tried not to feel angry with him jericos protection of a woman from one of sebastians knights had caused the lord to send his army down to punish them in the first place as much as he tried to convince himself he was in the right it did little to sway his guilt and he well understood kalgans ire weve come for shelter jerico said weve traveled far and are hungry kalgan eyed him and darius and the other men with him shuffled nervously follow me he said we need to get you out of sight jerico glanced at darius who only shrugged they followed the elderly man back to his empty hut opening the door he gestured for them to enter once inside kalgan waved away the others then joined them shutting the door after them you have a lot of nerve to return here kalgan said his voice more tired than angry jerico sat on the bed glad to be off his feet while darius remained standing in the corner clearly on edge i never fled the battle if that is what youre thinking jerico said i was there to the end but sebastian had too many it was kaide who called for the retreat not me its not that ive heard what you did you are a twofaced blessing jerico sometimes bringing joy sometimes sorrow sebastian has sent knights to all corners of the north looking for as they put it the man with the god shield his reward is substantial though i wouldnt worry about any of the villagers here turning you over should you travel beyond kaides influence however the old man looked to darius and his frown deepened and you you look like the man sir robert is searching for the one who supposedly burned durham to the ground are you darius of the stronghold when darius nodded kalgan rubbed his eyes and swore two wanted men appearing in our town ashhur help us sebastian already fears us rebelling to have both of you out in the opendamn it do neither of you have any sense i thought you said no one here would turn us in darius said i meant jerico not you kalgan said and it doesnt matter one errant word one man with more greed than sense and sebastians knights will ride in again and this time they may not stop at just rape and fire you two must leave now before you cause any more trouble jerico leaned against the wall and sighed so much for a night of relaxing and enjoying a bit of corn meal warm soup and maybe a roll of bread where is kaide he asked that is why were here we separated after the battle with sebastians army between us hes back in the forest kalgan said not sure how long hell be there hes trying to recruit more men the gods help him he thinks he can break sebastians siege of arthurs castle jerico frowned though he wasnt surprised by the news with arthurs defeat hed have little choice but to flee a lengthy siege would be expensive and draining for sebastians men but he had the patience and manpower to do it victory would only be a matter of time well leave for his camp then jerico said slowly rising to a standing position it felt like every muscle in his body ached from the constant walking and his stomach growled as if realizing its good meal had been delayed kalgan opened the door glanced about to make sure no one waited for them and then gestured for them to leave a fine welcome for one who fought and bled for you darius said as he brushed past the old man there have been enough of both in this village kalgan said unimpressed forgive me for hoping we might have peace for a change as they headed for stonahms limits someone cried out jericos name he turned then smiled as beth came running up to him without slowing she hugged both her intact arm and her stump about him that she was not selfconscious about the injury brightened his mood considerably youre back she said all smiles i promised didnt i beth dont you have work to do kalgan said beth took a step back and nodded curtly to him i do but katie said she saw jerico and i wanted enough go on she nodded again then turned back to jerico my father will be so happy you returned she said tell him i miss him i will he kissed her forehead then continued on toward the forest a fan darius asked eliciting a chuckle from jerico a spider bite nearly killed her i saved her life but still had to take her arm shes kaides daughter that makes a bit more sense id be interested to meet this kaide how does he compare to his rumors he doesnt care for honor has no qualms about killing and is driven by revenge but hes not a cannibal if thats what youre wondering darius smirked welli guess theres that how far a walk is it better part of a day the other paladin sighed we should have asked for food before we left despite kalgans obvious impatience jerico rubbed his eyes and sighed as well yeah t hey slept at the forests edge eating a few berries they found as well as some roots that darius was certain were the most bitter thing hed ever tasted they built a large fire jerico hoping the smoke might alert one of kaides gang of their approach but come morning there was no one jerico tried assuring darius it would be no problem and with their things packed they trudged into the forest there appeared to be no path though a couple of strangely cut branches might have been a marking you do know where youre going right he asked jerico more or less hardly the confidence darius was hoping for more or less he asked as they pressed through the rough thicket jerico what does more or less mean ive been this way a couple of times im fairly certain i can find it darius winced and if you cant kaides men will find us jerico said grinning at him find our starved corpses you mean darius muttered they walked for an hour at a fairly slow pace as jerico kept checking the surroundings what his friend was looking for he didnt have a clue at last they stumbled upon a stream which jerico insisted was a great sign they stopped to rest darius yanked off his armor and dipped his head into the wonderfully cold water what id give for a mule or something to carry my armor instead he said not much of a luxury either of us can afford id sleep in it if it were at all comfortable darius grinned at him as water dripped down his face and hair that worried about daggers in the night if youre asleep wearing armor matters little when the assassin stabs you through the eye jerico chuckled then turned his attention to dariuss armor he nodded toward the chestplate you should do something about that he said darius followed his gaze and saw the lion painted across the chest would you have me paint a golden mountain there instead he asked honestly yes darius shifted uncomfortably and he ducked his head back into the river to stall as the cold seeped into his pores he tried to think in jerico hed seen something he knew he wanted a hope for a dark world far more sacred and meaningful than the fire and order karak promised but he still felt uncomfortable calling himself a servant of ashhur ever since his childhood hed been a warrior for karak it was hard not to consider himself a traitor no matter how terrible some of karaks servants had been or what karak had shown in blessing him for the killing of innocents because they worshipped ashhur the enemy and now he was sworn to that enemy according to his teachings in the stronghold he was doomed to an eternity of torment was that still true or would he escape to the golden eternity pulling his head free from the cold water he gasped in air while wiping at his eyes he inspecting his armor jerico had a point he looked so much darker so much more dangerous than jerico when they stood side by side there was little he could do about the color which was stained into the armor during its crafting the symbol of the lion though he could remove with enough diligence and the scraping of a knife no matter how hesitant he might be to publicly announce his worship of ashhur he was certain he wanted to claim no allegiance to karak give me time and ill get it off he told jerico might make it a bit easier to go unnoticed without it too roberts looking for darius of the stronghold not the citadel at the mention of the citadel jericos mood darkened forgive me darius said im sure such a loss will take a long time to heal jerico nodded then reached for his shield flinging it across his back i must go back there sometime he said i must see for myself its ruin but arthur needs my help more urgently than i need some shallow confirmation are you ready to go if we follow the stream i believe i can find their camp just let me get dressed daggers in the night and all darius put back on his armor and for the first time felt uncomfortable with the lion on his chest to be sure he touched his greatsword and saw the faintest of blue light shimmer across its edges he still believed at least some small part of him did he held on to that and followed jerico another hour later darius felt the hairs on his neck stand on end long used to trusting his combat instincts he looked about then spotted a man in a distant tree in his hands the man held a bow the arrow already nocked and ready to fly jerico he started to say i see him jerico said lets pray hes a friend hail he waved while subtly letting his shield shift to his other arm in case he needed its protection the man tensed for a moment then relaxed as he caught sight of the blue glow jerico cried the distant man shimmying down the tree he was a far bigger man than darius expected and his was face covered with scars how have the past few weeks treated you adam jerico asked clasping the mans wrist and pumping it up and down like shit adam said was hoping to be stomping sebastians ass all the way from here to mordeina instead were stuck waiting jerico nodded to the weapon slung across his shoulder i didnt know you could use a bow gotta hunt to eat dont you darius thought of their meager meals the past few days not necessarily he said this brought the big mans attention over to him who the fuck are you he asked darius he said offering a mock bow consider me flattered to finally meet one of kaides most infamous knights adam paused a moment as if still thinking over the words then his face spread into a giant grin funny man he said punching darius in the shoulder despite his armor but if youre half as good as jerico and willing to fight well treat you fine as any prince darius raised an eyebrow at jerico who only shrugged better than being chased out by people eager for a bounty right if you say so come on said adam follow me kaidell want to know you made it out of the green gulch alive and breathing the paladins let him lead the way away from the stream and into kaides camp darius was surprised by the amount of buildings all built of wood and straw hed expected a few tents maybe a single home but not this more surprising was how many wandered about working at various tasks nearly everyone stopped what they were doing as adam led the newcomers to the camps center darius could hardly believe the heros welcome they received even durham had not been so thankful after theyd protected them from the wolfmens attack wheres kaide adam roared as the people began to crowd them out back training said one of the men darius could only guess where out back meant but adam seemed to know they followed curling around one of the buildings to a large open stretch between the trees twenty or so men stood in a line old metal swords in their hands a man walked before them barking out orders while making slow motions in the air with his dirk he was lithe well fit with his prematurely gray hair bound into a ponytail he moved with such authority darius knew immediately that he had to be kaide his eyes carried such an intensity it left him with little wonder how the man had managed to raise an army against lord sebastian however illequipped and meager it was jerico he said sheathing his dirk he wiped his hands on his tunic and unlike the others he seemed only mildly surprised that the paladin had returned so you survived after all there any doubt jerico asked and he smiled as the two embraced itll take far more than a couple thousand soldiers to bring me down a halfhearted cheer came from the men training kaide turned on them whatever joy had been present in his composure immediately gone back to training all of you he said pat you lead until i get back kaide thanked adam for escorting them to the camp then sent him back to his hunt takes a lot of food to feed so many kaide said as he headed to his quarters with the two of them in tow thankfully the deer here are plentiful and even in winter we can usually capture a few squirrels venison sounds wonderful jerico said as they stepped inside the small log cabin and darius heartily agreed once the door shut behind them kaide turned and swung his fist crunched into jericos jaw the blow knocking him a step backward so that he thudded against the door instead of retaliating jerico stood there mouth agape and rubbed his face when you tell me to flee you dont stand there and keep on fighting yourself kaide said jamming a finger in jericos face we fight together you and i if youre going to hold a line until death then i stay at your side and if i retreat then your ass follows whatever miracle allowed you to survive i dont want to have to rely on it again youre the heart of this band now the one thing that gives them hope and your stand at the green gulch only solidified that do we understand each other you going to hit me again if i say no the tension continued for a few more seconds and then kaide broke out into a laugh no but sandra might she missed you we all have he turned his attention to darius i see you brought a friend my name is darius he said bowing jerico saved my life and i seek to return the favor at hearing the name kaide froze and his eyes seemed to sparkle darius he said as in darius of the stronghold from durham darius swallowed and he tried not to show any emotion yes will that be a problem a problem depends whod you piss off to get that bounty on your head darius thought it might be prudent to lie but he immediately felt ashamed for even entertaining the notion i was once of the stronghold but no longer he said standing up straighter so his full height towered over kaide karaks followers have never taken kindly to one who leaves the fold thats strange kaide said rubbing his chin report i heard said the bounty came from sir robert at the towers i was there when one of karaks greatest priests burned it to the ground im sure the blame has been cast upon me enough jerico said standing between them weve come back to help in whatever way we can kaide shifted his attention to his friend but darius felt no comfort it lingered in the air that unspoken challenge the question of his guilt his role in durham no doubt jerico saw the strong leader that kaide was but darius also saw in him a greed and a hunger that set his nerves on edge he saw a man with a cause yet no ideals the whole world might burn while kaide waged his war on lord sebastian and it wouldnt matter so long as in the end he found victory we dont have enough men not yet said kaide but soon well move out well starve sebastians army of supplies hit their caravans set fires when they sleep anything to make their lives miserable with each passing day my men scour the north telling tales of sebastians depravity well build another rebellion one that wont be stamped out after a single battle but we can talk about those details later once bellok comes back with more supplies for now lets get you something to eat and find you a room he opened the door then glanced back at jerico whose face was starting to swell on one side you tripped crossing the stream on the way here he said then exited arent you the clumsy one darius said following jerico out but there was no humor in his voice only unease as the rest of the camp cheered once more for their arrival with how many kaide had gathered there was no more room left in the few cabins so they were given heavy blankets and bedrolls which jerico accepted gladly weve both had plenty of experience sleeping on the ground he said still prefer a bed though darius said jerico chuckled smacked him on the shoulder and found a spot to make his own it was at the outset of the camp and he wasnt surprised when darius didnt follow him the man had been sullen since wilhelm and theyd been traveling together since the battle in the green gulch no doubt darius wanted to have some solitude for once and to be honest jerico felt the same the nearworship kaides followers gave him didnt help much by the way they acted it was as if they thought jerico could singlehandedly win them the war which he couldnt hed try of course but even he had his limits and he felt safe in assuming that taking on an army by himself was one of them as he was smoothing out the grass and weeding out any rocks or sticks that might make sleep difficult he heard a woman call his name he turned to see kaides sister sandra weaving through the trees toward him he raised his hand in greeting but she ignored it instead wrapping her arms about him her smile was the finest thing hed seen in weeks they told me you stayed behind when everyone else fled she said slipping out of his arms i did i tend to do stupid things like that i should slap you for worrying me so he turned his head so she could see the light bruise on his cheek your brother beat you to it she laughed and they embraced once more id say he is only under stress and worried about you but i think i spend too much time apologizing for my brothers behavior as it is jerico found himself increasingly aware of the feel of her in his arms the way her silver hair curled about her face before falling past her shoulders and the scent of flowers crushed into a perfume that wafted up from her neck it made him feel awkward and his mind failed to think of conversation its been rough since the battle sandra said if she noticed his sudden awkwardness she gave no acknowledgment of it she sat down in the space jerico had cleared and leaned back against the nearby tree he had planned to use to prop up his pillow he took a seat next to her thinking of the aftermath hed seen arthurs men in flight as sebastians cheered in victory i cant imagine he said did kaides men escape the fight cleanly sandra shook her head sir gregane gave chase and while my brother led them on a wild hunt the rest started filtering back here she shuddered so many were wounded and there was no one else i kept hoping youd return be there with those healing hands of yours that lightbut you never came just me that was all i sewed and stitched everything i could but we didnt have enough herbs for the pain not for any of them she looked at him and her eyes had tears tell me of other things of a world so much better than this one i want to think of anything else but the bloodshed and heartache of the north jerico took her hand in his and she did not protest only squeeze hard against his fingers ive not traveled much he said forcing a smile to his lips but i did visit ker before heading north and traveled to angkars harbor he told of men and women hed met a few strange creatures kept in cages as pets of ashhur and even how hed defeated a gang of thieves with nothing but a wooden spoon they talked and the sun swung low across the sky d arius chose a place to sleep on the far outskirts of the camp it felt as if eyes lingered too long on him and conversations turned to whispers just by his passing he ate around the main bonfire when they served supper hoping that he might acclimate kaides men to his presence he expected jerico to help but the other paladin was nowhere to be seen thanks jerico kaide muttered as he prepared his bedroll and blankets just leave me out to dry the sun was just setting but he was tired from the travel and the many people had worn him thin he sat down removed his armor and then held his chestplate in his lap he stared at the sigil of the lion and wondered what it meant to him anymore was it just a dead reminder of what he had been did it represent the enemy or was it nothing but paint a useless symbol given far too much importance it didnt matter he wanted it gone slowly carefully he scraped away with the thick edge of his greatsword near the hilt chip by chip the paint vanished and the stars came out above the forest canopy he thought jerico might swing by at some point but he did not darius knew he shouldnt be upset but was anyway yes hed come to help but he didnt know these people and they certainly didnt know him well other than that tiny fact of a bounty the gold glinted in their eyes when they glanced his way he lay down and thought to pray to ashhur but what was he to pray for every night it seemed he begged for forgiveness every night he reopened old wounds and felt his soul bleed the scars velixar had inflicted ran deep even in his dreams he remembered the fire and bloodshed at durham in his minds eye he saw the innocent family praying to ashhur velixar peering through a dirty window like a hunting animal a locust an evil beast come to consume everything pure and good and now he was there on his bedroll in a dark forest trying to pray just the same darius would have rather been the child to have known nothing for how did he go to ashhur as anything other than a miserable wretch im sorry darius whispered to ashhur jerico insists i feel no guilt that i am redeemed but he wasnt there and sometimes i wonder if you were either enough he thought he laid his sword above his head the handle in easy reach and closed his eyes it took plenty of shifting and turning but at last sleep came to him it didnt last long his eyes opened and his instincts fired off commands he did not understand his hands flung above him and only then did he realize a club swung for his face it hit his arms hard enough to make his bones ache his legs kicked out but someone was on top of him he felt rope and fists and his eyes hurt in the light of torches his groggy mind yearned for his armor and reaching for his sword did nothing but expose his face to another blow of the club blood splashed across his lips as it connected with his nose he gagged and then the rope was about his neck quiet now one of the men said as he felt himself pulled to his feet dont want him hearing him him who he opened his mouth to ask but one of the men shoved a thick wad of cloth between his teeth he spat it out but they struck his cheek with a club then shoved it in again slender rope looped about his face holding the cloth in place tears ran down but he finally could see a group of ten men surrounded him with two of them holding his arms at either side a heavy rope wound around his knees waist and arms several held torches and others held clubs many bore splashes of his blood who he thought again kaide or did they mean jerico who was it that had sold him out he looked to the men and he felt anger stirring in his heart these fools these men hed come to help now sought to sell him for coin so much for the incredible loyalty kaide supposedly instilled so much for a noble war against lord sebastian hurry said the same man apparently the leader of the group squinting darius realized it was the one who had found him the enormous ugly man with the scars adam that was his name and then someone who looked just like adam grabbed the front of his shirt at first he thought he saw double but no there were two both alike but for their scars he remembered the twins having seen them briefly when eating around the campfire bring the horses over griff adam said and the other nodded dont let him make a sound griff said im not a damn fool now go two men restrained his arms plus the huge adam held him by the shirt it didnt matter darius felt his anger growing he struggled the knots werent the tightest and theyd been hastily tied adam struck him across the mouth and dariuss chest heaved as he gagged on the cloth but his legs were gaining strength and he flung himself to one side knocking the two men off balance they fell adam cursing as his fingers caught in the rope that curse turned to a cry of pain as one of the fingers dislocated darius rolled as the rest of the men swung their clubs as if to beat him into submission when he hit a mans legs he curled onto his knees then kicked the top of his skull rammed into the mans groin dropping him like a log the knot at his heels loosened even more and he freed his right leg his arms were still bound and he could only breathe through his nostrils but at least he could run not that he had anywhere to go the men still surrounded him and more worrying adam had regained his composure and grabbed a club from one of the others dont be a fool darius adam said were hoping your bountys worth more with you alive than dead but we still get paid even if we drag your corpse to robert drop to your knees before i crack your fucking skull like a walnut if darius had his armor and sword hed have laughed and dared the man to try instead he tensed with all his strength with karak he could have called upon his deity for power and filled his hands with fire to burn away the cords but what did ashhur offer he didnt know but it was time to find out his neck muscles tensed the rope dug deep into his wrists and he snarled into his gag like an animal adam shook his head as if disappointed but his grin was ear to ear as he stepped forward to swing the rope snapped the club hit his left forearm and even though he felt bones snap darius struck adam with his right fist throwing all his weight into the blow the roundhouse sent the big man staggering and blood splattered across the dark earth as several teeth flew the sound of the punch seemed to freeze the others as if they could hardly believe what theyd seen goddamn adam sputtered his hand against his mouth blood dripped through his fingers you hit like jerico and then he swung his club darius ducked underneath falling back into a retreat the rest moved to join his advantage of surprise finally lost he shifted and parried blows with his right arm keeping his left tucked against him and using it to absorb hits only when he had to he headbutted one man spun and then rammed his elbow into the neck of another two bandits with torches tried to burn him but the torches made poor weapons and darius pushed them aside a club struck his back but it hit thick muscle not even knocking the air from his lungs spinning he kicked the man in the knee hard enough that he could hear the joint crack adam closed the distance but darius caught him with a knee to the groin and as he bent over darius uppercut him in the throat adams mouth opened and closed trying for air but he remained eerily silent the rest backed away and darius felt his rage overwhelming him dont kill jerico had said protect the innocent but what of these bandits these pathetic cowards who would steal him away in the night did they deserve his protection when he saw that none were moving against him he reached up and yanked the rope from his head then spat out his gag is this the best you can do he asked gasping in air the pain in his left arm was growing and he felt his fingers shaking no wonder sebastian doesnt give two shits about your army it aint that said griff returning with a horse he led by a rope in his other hand he held a long blade and he pointed it at darius we wanted to do this with you alive outta respect for jerico but looks like you aint giving us much choice seems so griff suddenly crumpled to his knees as the sound of metal rang out through the forest behind him stood jerico his shield in hand he looked about as mad as darius felt he lacked any armor but his mace was clipped to his belt so far he hadnt drawn it so far all of you should be ashamed jerico said the light of his shield washing over them he joined dariuss side and he winced at the sight of all the blood how could you turn on one of your own he aint one of us said adam sounding funny with the missing teeth and his swelling lips were just following orders said another orders jerico looked about and somehow his anger grew whose orders mine kaide said stepping through the ring of men his hand was on the hilt of his dirk im not going in as your little prize darius told him grinning despite the pain i hope that wont be a problem i dont understand jerico said approaching kaide the rest of the men tensed how could you do this how could i not said kaide drawing his dirk and pointing it toward darius do you know what he is hes months of food hes an arsenal of weapons hes a mercenary band that could break the siege at the castle of caves everything i need right here just by slitting his throat do it and ill kill you jerico said he looked about the gathered group and darius found himself stunned by the sheer fury in his eyes it felt as if the air about them thickened and no fool darius moved to his bedroll and lifted his greatsword into one hand he might have trouble swinging it but itd be better than fighting unarmed jerico freed his mace dont make this worse jerico kaide took a step back among his men i tried to take him alive for your sake we still need you but we owe this stranger nothing he helped burn durham to the ground and if he is innocent then let him plead his case to robert not me ill take the gold it doesnt mean a damn thing to me if i have to buy my revenge with blood money move aside jerico said adam yeah get on out added griff the two paladins shifted so they stood back to back jerico tilted his head and spoke to darius im sorry i thought them my friends so am i allowed to kill them jerico shook his head id still prefer not i think its up to them darius pointed his greatsword at kaide move aside he said im leaving tonight and you will not stop me kaide jerico said and he met the brigand leaders gaze dont do this dont make me do this not after all weve suffered through youre better than this you know i will defend him i dont need my armor to bring you all down not when i have my shield kaide jammed his dirk back into its sheath and shook his head i told you jerico he said theres no honor in our war only justice but for your sakeso be it he turned to darius leave here tonight as you said i will send no man after you so long as jerico stays with me youre too kind darius said kaide left and at his absence the rest of the men dispersed leaving the two paladins alone at the dark edge of the camp darius kicked scattering his armor then collapsed to his knees jerico knelt beside him setting aside his shield to examine dariuss many wounds some friends he said as jericos hands began to glow with bluewhite light quiet darius relaxed as the healing light shone across his arms then plunged into his muscle he felt a sharp snap of pain in his bones and then it faded he stretched the arm the limb tight and sore but otherwise healthy he wished the same could be done for his mood we cant go on like this darius said of course well both go and find no darius shook his head thats not what i mean this bounty is absurd no matter where we go ill stick out like a sore thumb we can repaint your armor maybe stash it on a horse or donkey and accomplish what what can we do when i must hide and fear the very mention of my name no ill fix this one way or another how darius leaned his sword against a tree then began gathering his things im going to the blood tower he said what ill speak to sir robert face to face whatever crime he believes ive committed ill hear it with my own ears ill tell him of the horrors done by karaks prophet in return either he rescinds the bounty or ill or youll what asked jerico darius struck the tree with his fist the bark tore into his hand and he clenched his teeth against the pain i dont know how you do this he said his voice lowering how do you expect me to leave them alone to forgive these unjust accusers thieves and murderers what did you once tell me jerico asked taking dariuss sword and offering him the hilt our path is a hard one nothings changed not with that mercy over vengeance grace over condemnation darius drew his sword and held it before his eyes a light in the darkness he whispered seeing its glow he sheathed it once more then held the rest of his things farewell jerico he said what im coming with you i wont argue this sebastian is dangerous to the north and his allegiance to karak is only the beginning you must stop him any way you can even if it means helping the men who just tried to kill you darius chuckled and he clapped jerico across the shoulder never said itd be easy he turned to leave how will we find each other again jerico asked as darius ducked his head and marched into the forest ill listen for the stories darius called back hunger had grown a constant to her a sensation now as meaningless as the feel of wind across her skin or the pain that flared from every inch of her body valessa used it to propel her onward she longed for the comfort of sleep for a respite from the pain and guilt but it would not come so onward she followed the red star it led her through plains farmlands and at last to a forest whose name she did not know the sun and moon rose and fell their light and darkness just as meaningless to her as bread or water the thick branches and leaves proved problematic at first for they blocked the light of the star but she found that when she stopped to focus to demand its crimson light it could pierce even the forest canopy praise be karak she whispered praise be she ran at first weaving through the trees on nothing more than instinct when she realized how pointless that was she might have laughed but even laughter caught in her throat her body was meant for slaughter and pain not humor not pleasure penance her path lost its weave and she plunged through the trees feeling the trunks and low branches pass through her she was smoke shadow an incorporeal being her speed increased distant wolves howled and the red star shone on its light was so bright she knew darius had to be close his presence burned in her mind like a beacon her hands clutched her daggers and with near ecstasy she imagined plunging them into his throat the sensation of pleasure overwhelmed her she hadnt realized something like that had been left to her but it seemed she was wrong she could still feel joy she could still know karaks love all by repenting for her error all by slaughtering darius the traitor in the distance she saw a camp and she slowed her run it had to be kaides she realized who else would have a miniature village lost in the woods it certainly explained sebastians difficulty in finding him had darius taken shelter with them up ahead she saw two figures a man and a woman valessa slowed even more and she let her presence fade away gone were her clothes her pale flesh replaced only with darkness unseen she crept up on the couple the way the red star flared shed hoped it was darius but it was not her disappointment did not last long she recognized that red hair that enormous shield strapped to the mans back jerico she whispered the word curling off her tongue like a purr the paladin of ashhur was equally as responsible for her failure as darius all because of his meddling and that damn shield of his he spoke with a silverhaired woman who looked upset but was hiding it well valessa glanced to the sky saw that the red star beckoned further but she could not deny herself such an opportunity how might karak bless her for defeating such a terrible foe how much joy would soar through her shadowy soul when her daggers tore the life from his veins she looked to the nearby camp then smiled a plan already forming j erico watched until darius was gone and then shook his head darius was right sebastian was trouble but darius was young in faith and itd been mere weeks since hed been in the prophets thrall to separate now felt risky but in the end he had to hold faith in ashhur it was the right thing to do letting him go so was this he gathered his things pulled his shield across his back and waved goodbye to the camp kaide had threatened to send men after darius if jerico did not stay good luck he thought any fool that went after darius now deserved the beating they received but he could not stay theyd betrayed his trust and no matter how important kaide claimed he was that importance was not enough for them to take darius under their protection barely beyond the light of the camps torches jerico heard sandra call his name he turned steeling himself against any guilt jerico wait she said hurrying after what is it he asked are you here to apologize for your brother again sandra shook her head and he realized she carried a small bundle against her stomach you didnt know did you he asked id have stopped him if i did she said she looked back to the camp and he could see the sadness in her eyes and the way her lips quivered ive been at his side for years now always the older brother the one who would save our family but i dont know who that man is not anymore i once told you i thought he knew nothing but revenge tonight proved that jerico stopped and he put his hands on her shoulders are you sure he asked hes your family and theyre your friends i understand their desperation as much as i might loathe their actions dont risk whatever happiness you know just for my sake she shook her head our town is gone my parents are dead whatever happiness i knew it died that winter kaides just kept that pain fresh we gave him his battle and i saw the dead and the dying it did nothing only fed the beast thats taken over my brother she brushed her hair away from her face and behind her left ear let me come with you she said i dont care where just let me follow you until i can find a new home free of all these memories she stepped closer and jerico felt his throat tighten shouldnt you say goodbye he asked her hed never take it well jerico sighed he knew his path was dangerous and he had no intention of giving up the fight against lord sebastian all right he said but we need to hurry and put as much ground between us and here by morning because youre righttheres not a chance kaide understands she smiled and he accepted her embrace as his arms wrapped about her he saw a figure walking toward them from the camp he tensed sandra sensed it and turned the figure grew closer shit said sandra its my brother so much for a romantic flight through the dark forest she punched his chestplate then pulled free of his arms let me talk to him she said approaching kaide the moonlight fell across his features and seeing them he clearly did not look happy what are you doing he asked dont be upset sandra said crossing her arms over her chest im allowed to make my own choices youre not our father he never slowed never stopped his hand dipped to his belt then thrust jerico felt his heart shatter sandra gasped as the dagger pierced her belly jerico was too shocked to scream time crawled still and she fell to the ground blood pouring kaide looked at him and he smiled but suddenly he was no longer kaide he was a creature of shadow his clothes melding and changing into the face of a woman he thought had long since departed for the abyss valessa he said the woman darius had killed the word stuck in his throat his arms felt like they were made of stone valessas now feminine body shimmered and fading in and out of dark smoke he saw her gray clothes and leather armor her daggers shimmered with crimson power in her hands you killed claire she said yet it was still kaides voice that spoke you killed me ive come to return the favor what are you he asked it was the only thought that he could manage behind her sandra wept in pain her life bleeding out her stomach still alive thought jerico praise ashhur she was still alive his hand shifted for the complicated straps of his shield im karaks judgment she said now in her own voice the daggers twirled in fingers that lost all color and texture his executioner his beloved she lunged and he yanked free his shield the light flared amid the darkness and valessa let out a shriek her dagger struck the center and slid to the side jerico grabbed his mace and swung twice the first missed valessa ducking beneath with a bend of her back that looked beyond humanly possible but the return swing clipped the side of her face instead of shattering her jawbone it passed right on through her face reformed and it grinned at him despite the obvious pain the light of his shield caused her not good jerico muttered flinging himself backward his shield blocked the next flurry of blows but one twisted about and jerico had no choice but to try a parry with his mace it connected with the dagger and batted it aside his relief was palpable her flesh might defy reason but at least her weapons still made sense confidence growing he took the offensive he swung his mace in arcs using it not as a threat but a means to keep her daggers engaged for as he anticipated she fought with the finely honed instincts shed had when still alive still human he couldnt tell what she was now other than that her whole being was composed of karaks raw power and fury the light of his shield that was his weapon and he wielded it accordingly anytime she pressed close he saw the pain on her face saw the way she twisted and turned to add distance and keep herself from staring into its center youll die she cried as her daggers struck his shield amid a shower of sparks you your whore the bastard dariusall of you will die sacrificed in karaks name her movements grew faster a twirling monster of smoke but time was running out and jerico no longer had the patience no he said lifting his shield high then slamming it to the ground we wont he cried out the name of his god the light on his shield flared brighter and brighter until the clearing shone as if a blue sun had risen in the sky valessa let out a cry akin to a cat in pain her flesh peeled and her daggers lost their glow jerico swung his mace passing through her chest valessa stumbled and it seemed to take longer for her shadowy body to put itself back together her legs wobbled and jerico flung his shield toward her as the light dimmed she shrieked again then was gone jerico gasped in air his shoulders heaving as he looked about the clearing in his mind he felt no danger heard no warning from ashhur he forgot all about the gray sister for he heard sandra weeping he clipped his mace to his belt flung his shield onto his back and then rushed to her side a lump in his throat he knelt and took her hands in his they were soaked with blood dont she said i must he pulled her hands apart to look the stab wound was wide circular valessa had twisted the blade on the way out he realized he clutched sandras hands tighter and did his best to keep down his hatred no matter what it wasnt right i can save you he whispered making sure none of his doubt crept into his voice trust me sandra you wont die here ive got you he pressed his hands into the wound the blood and the exposed intestines his fingers shook and he clenched his teeth and closed his eyes to keep them still fear and doubt would ruin his ability to be a conduit of healing power please ashhur he whispered please this is all i know to do light shone and his tears fell upon her chest when he opened his eyes he saw blood and a vicious scar but the bleeding had stopped shed still be weak and he knew it would take several days before she recovered from the loss of blood but her pulse was strong and when he touched her face she smiled at him do strange men and women attack you often she asked her voice hoarse more than id prefer can you stand sandra nodded he stood gently took her into his arms and lifted her feet were unsteady beneath her but he kept her still she looked like she might vomit for a moment but it passed her whole body trembled as if she were cold who was that sandra asked glancing about the forest someone with a grudge is she dead he shook his head i dont know she tried to step away but it was too much he caught her and looked back to kaides camp torn could he really take her with him wounded as she was a day or two of bed rest was what she needed not rough travel sandra he started to say but she cut him off im going she said her fingers clutched his arm in a viselike gripe and her other hand pressed against her stomach if not now i never will jerico couldnt believe her strength if that was what she wanted what she was capable of then who was he to deny her so be it but we rest whenever you cannot go on if your brother gives chase he will catch us no matter how much we hurry are you prepared for the consequences she smiled a delirious smile and pulled her hand away from the hole in her dress how could he do any worse to me than what he already has done jerico chuckled then patted his shield well just have to be careful take my hand with the rest of her things tucked away on his back she accepted his aid leaned much of her weight against him and followed him out of the forest k aide stood before the dwindling campfire hands clasped behind his back the stars were out but theyd soon vanish the morning sun only an hour or two away he should have been asleep but one of his scouts had woken him fearful to say what hed discovered kaide had had to badger it out of him its jerico said the scout now kaide waited as several men searched the surrounding area hed known darius was leaving but he thought jerico would stay to ensure his friends safety it seemed that was not the case was it a bluff a reproof or perhaps jericos pride was injured it didnt seem to matter after twenty minutes of searching he knew for certain jerico was not just sleeping in the distance hed left for good damn you jerico he said sadly shaking his head the paladin had meant so much to him but that was his fault for putting his faith in a man who valued gods above all else ashhur couldnt care less for his plight couldnt care less for his quest of revenge where had the god been when the deep snows piled up around ashvale after sebastians knights had ransacked every bit of their food and livestock where had ashhur been when they threw the first of the dead upon the fire when the smoke wafted up and their stomachs growled and their children cried in hunger adam approached looking tired and angry for the disruption of sleep his lips were still swollen and he had done a poor job cleaning off the blood from his chin youre not gonna like hearing this adam said out with it its your sister he started to ask what about her but adams look was enough a stone shifted in kaides stomach and he looked to the dying fire do we go after them adam asked you did say i know what i said adam shifted his arms crossed then what do we do kaide drew his dirk and he twirled it before his eyes staring into the multitude of reflections cast by the light of the dying embers before him let them go he said jamming it back into its sheath call off the search bellok should be back soon and well need to be rested weve wasted enough time tomorrow we march and well bring the abyss to sebastian and his men youre the boss adam left and once more alone kaide cursed the paladins name take good care of her he whispered looking up to the night sky otherwise ill kill you myself he returned to his cabin hoping for a few more hours of sleep after tossing and turning for an eternity he gave up hope and only stared at the ceiling until at last daylight streamed in through a window daniel put on the last of his armor then left his room the morning was young and he had men to train his mood was foul but not because of the training hed had a horrible time avoiding the two priests and their men it seemed every hour they came to robert with new demands or expectations and it seemed every time robert conceded the idea of pandering to karaks fanatics burned his gut hed warned robert of the strongholds strength yet hed gone ahead with the bounty on dariuss head now look what itd gotten them he turned a corner approaching the bottom door to the blood tower when he encountered one of the priests it was the young one cyric the way he leaned against the door with his arms behind his back made it seem like hed been waiting for him morning daniel said hoping to barge right past without conversation morning cyric said stepping in the way a word if you please daniels jaw tightened but he nodded of course what do you need cyric rubbed his knuckles against his robe and then looked at them as if oblivious to daniels impatience something has been bothering me luther insists i not worry but perhaps you might indulge me anyway i would like to speak with the witnesses of the attack on durham the young man looked up and smiled daniel felt his blood chill it was a serpents smile a killers grin for what reason he asked sir robert has already judged they speak truthfully i do not mean to doubt roberts decision cyric said only to hear with my own ears what happened i find it hard to believe that just one man caused such destruction dont you daniel swallowed the townsfolk had spoken of another man that came after dariuss warning fire had leapt from his hands and demonic words from his tongue theyd given no name and among them all couldnt even agree on a description other than the color of his eyes a deep red that shone as if the fires of the abyss burned behind them with so little to go on robert had restricted the bounty to the one person whose blame no one could deny darius a paladin of karak can be a very powerful foe daniel said indeed cyric said his smile growing i am not ignorant of their power five traveled with luther and me from mordeina after all daniel sensed the implied threat and did his best to pretend he hadnt thats fine but i dont think it appropriate you speak to the townsfolk they have suffered enough without you bringing up bad memories i am afraid i must insist daniel then insist to robert you have my answer he grabbed the handle to the door cyric remained leaning against it as if daring daniel to pull it open well be holding a service tomorrow said the fledgling priest you should attend the abyss will freeze over before i do careful said cyric stepping out of the away the time of judgment approaches on the backs of lions i would hate to be caught unaware daniel stormed outside glad to be away hed hoped to take his frustration out on his men in a grueling training session but it seemed one of the gods was conspiring against him and it took little wit to guess which one normally they held practice in a wide area of trampled dirt within the small courtyard that stretched between the tower and the outer walls that morning luther stood in its center a book in hand a tenth of the blood towers fighting men stood about listening as luther preached in a firm steady voice the mere sight sent daniels blood boiling what is going on here he asked pulling one of his men aside just listening said the man though he looked away as if guilty of something daniel bit his tongue as he realized luther was in midprayer he felt awkward interrupting it especially when he realized several others were praying along karak or ashhur sir robert had never cared so long as it didnt interfere with his soldiers duties despite his anger daniel tried to honor that and let the priest finish and may we always abide by the strength and wisdom of the lion said luther and all those with wisdom say amen five or six echoed the word amen and for whatever reason it set the hair on the back of daniels neck to standing the prayer over the men scattered all shooting glances toward daniel who approached luther a word he said grabbing luthers robe by the shoulder of course luther said nothing but calm though remember whose robe you grab and perhaps show wisdom the next time you would act in anger daniel accepted the rebuke and forced his temper in check their situation was no less precarious now than it had been at the priests first arrival my apologies daniel said dryly but this place is for my men to train every morning and i cannot have you occupying them with speeches and sermons does the soul not need training as well luther asked as he led him toward the gate to the outside what good does it to teach men how to kill if they know not when or why to use those abilities thats why we have a chain of command why we teach them to follow orders exactly luther said sounding pleased it made daniel feel like he was just another of the old priests students and he didnt like it chain of command such a good term to describe what we do imagine the blood tower represents our world you are to your men as i am to my flock a teacher above you is sir robert just as above me are the old masters in mordeina and the stronghold and as the king is above sir robert so is karak above us all we are in the same field of work daniel and i would hope you appreciate my difficulties im training men to defend all the west from the bloodthirsty creatures in the vile wedge and im training men to defend their souls from the evils of the world i dare say that my task is more important wouldnt you they stepped out the gate across the lush field fed by the gihon was karaks encampment formed of several dozen tents over five hundred men were there well armed and armored their very look made him uneasy they were like private mercenaries only worse the stronghold might pay them with gold or jewels but they viewed their service as a religious duty they served no king only karak the very notion made daniel nervous once a man invested his loyalty in something other than his own king it made him unpredictable and dangerous what is it youre here for daniel asked as luther stopped to view his camp he kept his voice low as if they were discussing secrets you have what you wanted well take darius alive and deliver him to you why do you stay there is the matter of the two hemman brothers lord arthur is trapped in his castle and will starve in the next few months you have nothing to fear there do we not luther turned to face him and with those eyes staring into him daniel felt naked he tried not to meet his gaze but was powerless against it this is more than a mere squabble between brothers more than a war between fellow lords i have long heard of the norths faith to karak we believed it for the tithes were great and lord sebastian was ever eager to please but now that i walk these lands i find myself doubting so few of your soldiers practice any religion let alone the truth of karak in the villages we stayed in during our journey here many harbored hidden sympathy for ashhur when most spoke of karak i heard no love no loyalty a sickness grows in our most faithful of territories and i must find out why fascinating but why should we give a damn luther smiled youre much like sir robert and if you would trust me we might get along well you are a practical man as am i perhaps i deal with spiritual matters but i understand we will never achieve perfection and there will always be men like you who as you might say dont give a damn luther gestured to the three hundred daniel watched them closely and realized they were preparing their things to move out where will you be heading he asked to the castle of caves you are correct luther said most of them will leave tomorrow theyll go to ensure victory for the lord that is most obedient to karak at least on the surface i now wonder how faithful sebastian is but even if he is false his actions and tithes are real enough my student will stay here for there is still much work to be done daniel didnt like the sound of that but he feared to say so if the three hundred men were leaving then at least he might walk about roberts tower without fear of an impending coup but what work remained would he proselytize the rest of his soldiers or would they strike out for the nearby villagers in an attempt to root out the reason for the sickness as luther put it for all your gracious gifts we will try our best to accommodate your student he said bowing slightly for now i must go train my men of course daniel started to hurry back but luther spoke his last parting words of wisdom you are a good man daniel but you must soon bring your mind to the things beyond this world the hour comes when a war will bathe dezrel with blood fire and death i would hate to see you caught on the wrong side daniel couldnt help himself and what side would that be he asked glancing back there is safety in karaks arms said luther his smile kind but his eyes glinting with danger good day lieutenant daniel snorted and pulled at the collar of his shirt as he returned to the blood tower safety he muttered thinking of those cold eyes bullshit v alessa had thought she knew pain she thought she understood torment but shed never known this in the light of the moon she knelt on her hands and knees and prayed for death it didnt matter if it was a blasphemy it didnt matter if she cursed the gift her god had bestowed upon her she wanted the agony to stop that was all that mattered to make it stop her form shifted and twisted and she felt every interminable inch it throbbed unending with pain and failure she felt knives twisting inside her felt fire burning outside her felt hatred within her nonexistent veins the light of jericos shield had left her weak and nearly broken whatever essence kept her together it had taken all her focus to flee and in the shadows of the forest she waited for her strength to return damn you she whispered she felt her lungs solidify by her thoughts so that air might press through felt her tongue gain form so that it might speak the curse each moment was torture but she said it anyway damn you jerico damn you to the abyss a thousand times this was her failure of course shed been given a second chance at taking down darius not jerico but she had ignored the wishes of her god shed thought to impress him as if that were possible using a life and form granted by his hands she was nothing without her deity and despite the hatred and agony her confrontation with jerico had helped her remember that she tried to be thankful it was better than crying out her fury against karak she worshipped him loved him accepted his authority over her but never before had she hated him so not like this it was no longer a matter of pride revenge or faith she needed to kill darius for her freedom the fires of the abyss surely would not burn her so she was a child of karak valessa focused her prayers begging for forgiveness begging for his touch day and night swirled over her but she was aware of it only distantly she did not sleep she did not eat she did not live with each minute each prayer she felt herself growing whole her skin regained its color and her naked form assumed the clothes she once wore her daggers having never left her hands started to glow once more the pain in the center of her being faded becoming only the constant ache she had learned to accept looking to the sky she hoped karak had not yet abandoned her had forgiven her for her weaknesses seeing the red star she smiled an even greater surprise she felt liquid running down the sides of her face valessa touched her cheek and when she pulled her fingers away she saw them stained red tears of blood perhaps grief was not yet lost to her thank you she whispered to the night i will make you proud it had been several days though how many she did not know but darkness was about her the red star above her and with a singleminded purpose she ran the days had not gotten any easier despite sandras hope otherwise the flesh around the wound in her stomach had tightened and scarred after mere minutes of walking it would start to ache teeth grinding together shed fought on and it wasnt until the second day that jerico noticed how badly it hurt her you should have told me he berated her as she lay down on a soft patch of grass his hands pressed against her waist and she shivered i didnt want to worry you worry said jerico as his hands began to shine white i could have helped you sandra besides worrys what i do his healing prayers subdued the pain but when he finished she saw the look on his face the trepidation something was wrong but he wasnt telling her what night after night he had to pray over her so she could sleep without sobbing from the pain the scar continually flared red as if trying to reopen shed seen jerico close the most brutal of wounds this shouldnt have been beyond him yet somehow she sensed it was she tried to not let him see her fingers brush the scar from time to time each touch always more painful than the last enough she told him as the sun dipped beneath the horizon on the third day after leaving her brothers hideout i cantmy legs cant take any more jerico nodded and as she sat he began preparing a fire she rubbed her calves and watched him it hadnt been a lie the constant walking was murder on her body something she was far from accustomed to again shed hoped itd improve with time but that didnt seem to be the case jerico looked spry as ever as he gathered kindling for a fire and that was with him wearing armor and carrying their supplies on his back whatever the paladin was sandra was starting to believe he wasnt human he unwrapped a small strip of dried heavily salted meat hed bought from a town theyd passed through stabbing it with a stick he held it over the fire and its smell awakened sandras hunger kaide must not be tracking us if he hasnt found us by now she said staring into the fire we dont need to use such haste nor avoid every village we encounter the northern folk are loyal to your brother jerico said turning the meat id rather he not know our every move she pulled her knees to her chest and curled her arms around them you speak as if he were an enemy i pray he isnt she ate her portion of the meal surprised as always by how hungry she felt come nightfall jerico finished before her and began removing his armor piece by piece why do you always wear it she asked him easier than carrying it besides ever since the citadel fell i never know when the next fight will be id sleep in it if it were at all comfortable and use your mace for a pillow he chuckled help me with these straps will you with the rest of his armor piled to the side she made a show of waving her hand before her nose in truth the smell of leather and sweat didnt bother her much but the gesture always earned a smile from jerico she removed her own worn shoes stretched out before the fire and closed her eyes it felt so good to be still and if not for the pain in her stomach she might have drifted to sleep instead her mind wandered she thought of the irons twins her niece beth and most of all her brother with each day of travel the castle of caves neared and her friends grew that much farther away jerico sat beside her and she shifted so she might rest against him she felt his hand stroke her hair once gently his fingers were rough calloused from his gauntlets and the constant training do you wish you had stayed he asked her softly a tear ran down her face and she nodded it doesnt matter she said i knew i would regret it when i left maybe when kaide has finally won and this whole damn fight is overi just want my brother back jerico i hope my leaving hurts him i hope it eats at him makes him realize just how much hes lost because of it is it wrong for me to pray for his misery i think your hearts in the right place he said though id prefer you pray for his vengeance to leave him instead of misery taking its place i just want to slap some sense into him she said and she laughed to force away the rest of her tears truth be told this is the first time ive been on my own in years weve always been so close sandra jerico said his voice still soft but now with a barely contained urgency sit up right now dont ask why he was looking beyond her into the distance his left arm was slowly reaching for his shield beside him suddenly afraid she sat up wincing at the pain in her stomach who is out there she asked ignoring his instructions otherwise before he could answer jerico shoved her hard with his right hand his left clutched the handles of his shield and pulled it before him as sandra landed on her back she let out a cry and she heaved from the pain splitting across her stomach light flooded their campsite and illuminated the surrounding grasslands an arrow pierced that light struck the center of jericos shield and then ricocheted harmlessly into the dirt stay down jerico told her as another arrow sailed in this one missing the mark he moved toward the fire where his mace lay beside their rucksack of things but a third arrow flew in and its aim was far better than the last jerico dropped to one knee the bottom of his shield clipping the arrow just in time without his armor he had only his shield to protect him and their conversation earlier didnt seem quite so entertaining now where is he sandra called out still lying low the grass was tall but there werent any trees or large rocks for someone to hide behind he had to be crouched down standing only to fire right here girl a voice said mere feet behind her sandras blood ran cold she whirled already kicking a large man towered over her his face unshaven and his left eye scarred over he held a short sword in his left hand raised to swing her kick caught him in the thigh doing little down came the swing but then jerico was there slamming in with his shield the swing halted in midair the man let out a cry and then both continued out of the campsite and into the tall grass sandra rolled to her knees and watched as jerico crouched his shield constantly shifting he kept the thug with the sword occupied but she realized others were out there at least the one with the bow she looked saw a shorter man standing in the grass thirty yards out barely visible in the flickers of their firelight jerico she cried as he nocked another arrow jerico shoved away another thrust then spun his shield intercepting the arrow just in time the other thugs sword slashed in and it cut across jericos arm before he could turn furious he struck the mans jaw with his fist then pressed in punching and slamming with his shield he was trying to take out the one opponent so he could deal with the archer but the man with the sword knew they had numbers and remained on the defensive always retreating shit muttered sandra she wouldnt sit by and watch him die nor let him protect her on his own kaide had raised her better than that near the fire was jericos mace and she ran for it another arrow flew but it was for jerico not her she heard a cry of pain and prayed it wasnt the paladin clutching the mace she lifted it surprised by how light it felt holding the handle with both hands she looked for the archer this time he had noticed her movement and the bow swiveled toward her she dropped to her knees the sound of her heartbeat pounding in her ears the arrow flew past her head the wind of it tugging against her hair and then she was up sprinting as fast as her aching feet could manage gasping for air she crossed the distance feeling interminably slow despite all her efforts the archer readied another arrow and he pulled the string tight as she closed in for a swing she saw his size his long hair and the slenderness of his body not a man sandra realized a woman the mace pushed the bow aside the arrow releasing just above her left shoulder then the flanged edges struck the flesh of the archers face tearing holes the weight of its center hit bone and the womans jaw cracked sandra saw this in the span of a single breath such a quick moment but the sight burned into her a memory that hung before her eyes like a brutal painting the body collapsed and lay still a smell hit her the dead archer had shit herself footsteps behind her she swung again but a strong hand caught the hilt she pressed harder then saw it was jerico his shield slung across his back blood covered the front of his clothes but it wasnt his blood she released the handle glad to be rid of the weapon her arms shook as she stood there feeling dazed and confused its all right he said clipping his mace to his belt and then holding her against him this smeared the blood from his shirt against her arms and she pushed him away the shakes will go away in time he told her he looked down at the body and shook his head are they with kaide sandra glanced at the woman then shook her head no i dont recognize her nor the man jerico sighed and he sounded relieved good he knelt down and pulled the corpse into his arms what are you doing she asked he didnt answer and instead walked back to their campfire she followed still trembling it was as if her pulse refused to slow despite the battle ending back at the fire was the body of the man who had attacked her she saw no outer wounds but the way his throat was bruised and misshapen told her enough of how jerico had killed him i had to jerico said putting the womans body down next to the mans i feared you might not reach the archer in time might bei had no time to be careful you wont receive any judgment from me she told him its not you who i fear judgment from he pointed to a distant cluster of trees several hundred yards out grab a branch biggest you can find she did not ask only obeyed the walk there helped calm her down and the last of her shakes faded as they did though she felt the pain in her stomach flare reaching the trees she stopped to press her hand against her abdomen she felt blood was it from jericos embrace or herself she didnt know didnt want to know finding a halfbroken branch she tore it free and carried it back jerico took it lit it in their fire and handed it back go start another campfire he said why because it will take all night and day to dig a grave for them time we dont have i wont leave them here for the carrion she thought of the look the man had given her before hed tried to take her life with his sword they dont deserve it she said crossing her arms feeling very cold they were bandits probably husband and wife i dont know what family they have what life theyve led children may starve now because we killed them if only theyd asked i would have given them what little coin i had if only theyd asked jerico sighed i hate this world sometimes now go on before that branch burns too low and hurts your hand sandra nodded but couldnt go just yet you really hate this world she asked him jerico grinned despite his apparent exhaustion yeah he said i do but i love the people in it now go she set up camp farther away near the cluster of trees so she might have ready kindling when finished she looked back saw jerico tending the pyre her stomach heaved and she turned to vomit in the light of the fire she saw it was a deep red blood she felt like crying instead she lay down closed her eyes and waited for jerico the paladin returned long after though she could not say just how much time had passed sandra she heard him ask his shield thudded into the ground beside her and then his palm was against her forehead sandra youre burning up why didnt you tell me didnt know she murmured she felt very tired jerico carefully lifted her shirt so he might examine the wound on her stomach oh god he whispered she was scared to look to see what frightened him so all she knew was that it hurt like a blade driven deep in her belly eyes closed she thought of the bandit woman as her mace struck her face ive never killed anybody before sandra said feeling as if shed drunk too much of griffs personal stash of hard liquor ive seen people die saw plenty after the green gulchbut never killed before dont dwell on it jerico said as he pressed his palms against her abdomen she screamed but wasnt sure why all she felt was a sharp pressure canthelp it she said white light shone and she relaxed the healing magic would flow into her banish the pain like it had the past several nights she was safe with jerico safe sandra he said after several minutes sweat lined his forehead and he wiped it away with his wrist i dont know whats wrong im not sure i can heal this she swallowed tried to remain calm panic swelled in her breast coupled with anger youve healed worse she said ive seen it ive seen it why me why this jerico grabbed her hand and clutched it with both of his forgive me he said i can do this but i need you to stay with me can you do that sandra talk to me sandra sandra a river ran through her mind softly swaying side to side and in it she was free of the pain the fear and the anger she closed her eyes and let it carry her away sandra sandra she opened her eyes that river suddenly gone she knew time had passed dimly aware of it in some instinctual way jerico knelt over her and she saw his hands pressed against her stomach his head was bowed his eyes closed guilt washed over her for she realized he was praying and it felt wrong to be present in a moment so private but his words struck her and she realized he was crying as he spoke dont let me fail her jerico said his jaw trembling it seemed like every part of him was fighting against losing control dont do this to me i dont know what ive done where i erred but dont let her suffer for it i can be stronger i can do better please your strength not mine your strength not mine she reached out and touched his face he stiffened then looked to her eyes red he smiled sandra he said and it seemed as if her very name swept away his sorrow she kissed his lips then held him tight against her as the pain in her stomach slowly returned and she was once more aware of the chill of the night the soft cries of the crickets and the way his strong arms kept her close what happened she whispered i dont know i think you were stabbed with a cursed dagger ive done what i can everything else is in ashhurs hands am i cured i dont know id need to examine the wound to be certain she kissed him again not now she said let me sleep without knowing he gently lowered her back to the grass then lay beside her his arms carefully wrapped about her chest his face pressed against her neck the heat of the fire washed over her face thank you she said he gave no answer only kissed the back of her neck she fell asleep not long after the rhythmic warmth of his breath against her ear cyric helped his master and teacher prepare for departure and did his best to hide his excitement it wasnt that he bore any ill will toward lutherfar from it but this meant a chance to finally be on his own to have a measure of trust placed upon him with it came expectations but he felt confident he could handle whatever the world threw at him his faith in karak was strong after all remember to keep your patience when speaking to daniel and sir robert luther said as he folded together similar colored robes then cinched the container tight they will never be faithful to karak but they can still be of use in our crusade against chaos they should be replaced if they will not bow to the true god cyric said hoisting a trunk of luthers things onto his shoulder in time my student in time all the world will bow but it does not yet and expecting perfection from this chaotic world will only lead to disappointment cyric led the way down the stairs to the outer wall where the wagons waited what you say sounds like defeat he said he didnt like arguing with luther but today he felt confident proud luther was to leave fifty men in his care he had every intention of using that gift to its utmost potential defeat and acceptance are not the same thing luther said cyric could not see him but he heard the impatience creeping into his voice youll understand one day when you have walked across dezrel as much as i cyric put the chest into the wagon and shoved it into place then took luthers bag and gently tossed it in as well that was the last of it and all around them the armed men of karak prepared to leave luther crossed his arms and looked cyric over the younger man held down a shiver he hated when his master analyzed him so what will you do luther asked cyric stood up straight and did not hide the pride in his voice continue to spread the faith weaken sir roberts control over the blood tower until he acknowledges our right to rule over him with that done i will find the remnants of durham they will learn the folly of accusing a paladin of karak of causing chaos and destruction and how will you do that luthers voice had grown quieter more guarded cyric knew he was treading on dangerous ground but didnt care hed put much thought into this and it was time to reveal the truths hed uncovered ive read the older tomes said cyric there are spells in them rituals of such power and strength it overwhelms the mind that strength will be mine with it i will renew the faithful and crush those that worship the false god or deny karaks power it is time to bring the old ways back to the north i told you to avoid those tomes luther said our council has deemed them too dangerous to the cause of karak but why with them i can force the will of karak upon all chaotic life you would enslave them cyric dont you understand we must use a firm hand when reshaping this world but we must also ensure that there is still a choice no matter how illusionary it may be man will struggle against foreign chains about his neck but if he binds himself willingly humbly he will remain free of chaos forever that is why you must not use the old ways cyric felt his temper rise at such a rebuke and his pride stung deeply not all the priesthood feel as you do he said trying to stand tall before his imposing master hayden often laments the loss of the old ways and ive read peloraks teachings from enough luther said striking the wagon dark magic flared across his fist and the wood splintered from the blow you are my disciple not theirs how can i pass on my wisdom to you if you would ignore me and go only by the books you read and the dreams that fill your head if you resurrect the old ways you will bring about terrible ruin to yourself and to the north he stepped into the wagon and called out for the rider to begin you may not approve cyric said walking behind it as it started to move but i am yet to hear you forbid me from doing so luther leaned back his arms crossed it is still your choice he said i will not deny you that be mindful of your prayers and listen for the whispers of karak i trust he will dissuade you from this naive hope if you find yourself lost trust in salauls advice cyric bowed respectfully but the moment luther was gone he shoved his teacher from his thoughts he would not listen to a man so closedminded against the wisdom of the great fathers of their faith hurrying through the now largely abandoned campsite cyric searched out the man left by luther to aid him in spiritual matters the dark paladin salaul he found him reorganizing the layout of the camp because of their far fewer numbers relocating them into the inner walls of the blood tower my friend cyric said bowing to the paladin salaul leaned back and crossed his arms he was an older man with graying hair now living a life of training and teaching instead of actual combat but he was a paladin of karak and his strength was still greater than that of most mortals a greataxe hung on his back from several leather straps cyric could only begin to guess how many lives it had claimed young priest salaul said his voice incredibly deep luther told me you would be assuming control of the situation here at the blood tower i offer you my wisdom for i have seen much in this world for good and ill your wisdom will aid me greatly cyric said trying to sound even half as authoritative as salaul but for now i have a task for you one that must be done away from prying eyes salaul narrowed his gaze i will do nothing that might dishonor my god he said what is it you would ask of me it was a gamble cyric knew hed learned everything he could of salaul of his many battles against bandits his periodic trips to mordeina to preach on the streets and most of all of his total lack of hesitation in using that greataxe of his to enforce the will of karak tonight i will cross the gihon and into the wedge cyric said nodding toward the river i wish to communicate with our god all i require is one man or woman to accompany me someone loyal to karak above all else any of our men would gladly volunteer salaul said gesturing about the camp then find me the most faithful and have them meet me at the river come nightfall understood salaul tugged at his armor adjusting the padding underneath they will want to know what it is they volunteer for he said cyric sensed the real question beneath it the paladins desire to know the truth he had to be careful here but his gut told him salaul would be open to the old ways more so than many i will not say but you may accompany me salaul karak surely will hear my prayer if you are there to lend it strength perhaps salaul bowed and cyric returned to his room in the blood tower his heart raced it was time all his patience would now be rewarded in his room he retrieved a book from his satchel hed read many things in the strongholds library as well as the priests library in mordeina in the dark corners hed found tomes untouched for over a hundred years at the stronghold hed discovered one in particular that had sent his fingers tingling just by touching its leatherbound frame and set his heart racing by reading the faded cover the collected words of the prophet it had no drawings no gold lettering nothing that might indicate the immense knowledge within he still remembered the first sentence the moment that had put his entire life into order and given him a purpose for his discipleship he opened it now fingers lovingly touching the paper and then read aloud to the best of my abilities here within i recount the wisdom granted to me by the man with a thousand faces karaks most holy servant he flipped through stopping at a section hed marked with a thin dried leaf tonight he thought tonight the hours crawled as in seclusion he read over passages hed studied a hundred times there could be no error no slip of the tongue this was the first of the rituals his childlike step into the old ways should he be successful all of dezrel would soon know his name within the temple hed be revered for his accomplishments at last the sun began to set he closed the book and tucked it under his arm before going he reached into his trunk and pulled out a bundle of cloth tied shut with string hiding it within his robes he left the blood tower waiting for him at the river was salaul and another man who cyric did not recognize we are here salaul said at his arrival cyric this is pat arenson karak saved me from my sinful life of murder and rape said pat he was a shorter man with black hair that curled about his neck and ears i owe everything to you priests whatever you need from me ill do it with a song on my lips cyric smiled excellent i can sense your faith pat stand tall and be proud i have selected you for a great honor unbestowed for far too many years very good salaul said hardly sounding impressed he gestured to the river do you have a way for us to cross otherwise i procured us a boat a boat will suffice the three men rode to the opposite side cyric standing in the center while the other two rowed he felt the cold night air blowing through his hair and it did nothing to diminish his smile instead it made him feel more alive closer to the stars and therefore closer to his god when they hit the shore salaul hammered down a stake in the dark earth and tied the boat to it meanwhile cyric hurried across the grass searching for a flat section it was all flat so he chose a spot at random upon which to begin be with me karak he said closing his eyes in prayer priests of karak could wield great power but so far cyric had been given little chance to demand it it was not something that could be practiced for karak frowned on pointless use of his power but nownow was the time fire burned across his hands and he felt pride at its strength the grass caught and he controlled it like he might his own limb guiding it in a circle the heat grew the fire roared and then the interior of the circle was also consumed with a clap of his hands it died leaving him a space to perform his ritual clear out the ash he told pat the man knelt and scooped away with his hands without complaint meanwhile cyric flipped to the marked section and fought down a last moment of nerves this was it he would show no fear no hesitation the words of the prophet soothed him when pat finished cyric glanced at salaul who was watching with his arms crossed was that mistrust in his eyes or merely boredom the paladin might not be impressed yet but he would be soon cyric read aloud a passage feeling the power of karak flowing through him the burned ground flashed red for the briefest moment then faded falling to his knees cyric slowly dipped a finger in the dirt and scratched a symbol it was as if he were opening a wound into the world revealing an angry red glow burning across melted rock cyric hurried about the circles perimeter drawing rune after rune his confidence grew as each one flared with power there was no boredom in salauls eyes when he finished only a growing awareness of the momentous event you dabble in ancient powers he said i awaken what was forgotten cyric said i practice what our god once preached will you stop me the paladin shook his head i still remember a time when the stronghold held to the old ways i was only a child but i remember their faith what would you have me do asked pat step into the center cyric said pointing close your eyes lift your arms up and your head to the stars pray to karak with all your strength beg for his mercy his wisdom let it flow upon us all as you wish pat hesitated only a moment impressing cyric with his determination the runes shone about him bathing him in crimson light pat lifted his head closed his eyes and began to pray it was a constant drone but it was sincere heart pounding in his chest cyric pulled out the cloth package and broke the string with his fingers he let the wrappings fall and he held the dagger hidden within there was a time when karak himself walked the world and he gave his wisdom to his priests and followers there were a few who recorded those words and the rituals demanded therein time had diminished their power and council after council had challenged their use they were rules for a more barbaric time they claimed primitive practices filled with superstition exaggerations and uncivilized ways the priesthood had moved on it had evolved but cyric knew the truth the world had not changed people had not changed only their faith their determination had changed and it was not for the better place your blessing upon me cyric said lifting his dagger to the heavens let it flow upon us opening our eyes our hearts and our minds this was it the only time salaul could stop him but he did not cyric stepped forward into the circle where pat continued to pray praise be whispered cyric and he felt a chill run up his spine at the words he slashed open pats throat then grabbed his jaw and held him still pats eyes opened wide and his arms convulsed but he was helpless before the power that flooded into the runes blood poured down cyrics arm and it splashed across the circle the runes burst with fire that stretched ever higher but the heat did not burnat least not him pats body flickered orange and red the skin blackened in cyrics hand the sacrifice was consumed the lion roared cyric felt a force fling him to his knees the stars were gone replaced by a solid black sky that rumbled angrily red lightning crackled though there were no clouds the ground shook and he realized it was from the approach of a great stampede in the distance he saw their eyes their molten skin lions thousands of them racing toward him as one they roared and it seemed all of dezrel quaked with their fury the pack grew closer swirling about him like a river he did not see salaul and in truth hardly even remembered he had been there what is it you seek the voice came from everywhere as if spoken by the sky the earth the lions and his own mind it overwhelmed him to tears he struck the ground with his fists crying out for strength the voice was so deep so cold but he would not be afraid he would not cower i am a servant he shouted but his voice was lost in a sudden wind it blew in from the west and in its fury came fire consuming the very air cyric closed his eyes as he felt his hair burn away and his flesh peel whom do you serve you he cried i serve karak the fire poured down his throat igniting his insides his tongue dried to dust the ground beneath him turned molten and he sank within his legs were gone his arms what do you desire he opened his mouth to scream but he had no tongue no voice it didnt matter he cried it out with his heart with the last vestiges of his strength it was the truth for he could not lie not in that storm not with the fires of the abyss consuming the chaos of his very soul to bring order to all i touch the wind blew again and it left a shocking cold he saw nothing heard only the growls of the legion of lions their tongues licked at his flesh their teeth bit into his bones again he shrieked his cry for order he would banish the chaos by blade and fire he would take life away from the unfaithful deny them the gifts their wretched ungrateful souls did not deserve all of it he screamed he would do all of it in karaks name and then in a sudden silence he was given his wish then stand the vision left him the pain was gone cyric looked about feeling tears running down his face it was still night the circle at his feet was gone the runes smeared with dirt they no longer shone with power before him knelt salaul his greataxe laid flat across his knee nothing remained of pat not even dust blessed be said salaul looking up to him with nothing but admiration i am honored to serve cyric lifted his hands and as he looked at them he felt the immense power dwelling within karaks strength flowed through him giving him a confidence he could hardly comprehend whatever he wished he could make it so he knew this somehow overcome with a desire to test it he told the paladin to stand how long was igone he asked him i do not know milord said salaul lord why do you call me lord salaul swallowed something had clearly shaken him but what you disappeared among the fire he said but karak spoke to me and told me to remain i did for many long hours i heard lions roaring and then you were here within the blink of an eye i heard karak speak one last timei heard him call you beloved salaul knelt once more you have been to the fires of the abyss and then returned i cannot imagine being worthy of such a gift but you are you are worthy in karaks eyes speak the word and i will obey cyric looked back to where the blood tower rose high above the river its lanterns shining bright amid the night let us earn their faith he said thinking of sir roberts soldiers let us show them miracles show them power as you wish milord lordyes there is no other lord but karak but you are right to call me that he is here isnt he cyricyour eyes cyric did not know what he saw but he assumed it was another sign returning to the river he saw their boat then chuckled take my hand salaul the paladin did so and together they walked across the river to the other side where the faithless waited to be converted despite what hed told jerico darius was in no hurry to reach sir robert at the blood tower he traveled east through the forest but spent plenty of time setting up traps and catching rabbits and squirrels for his meals he even found a bush of crimsonberries and stuffed himself to the edge of vomiting he kept several pocketfuls more and crushed them across the rabbit he cooked on the third night after leaving kaides village the stars were twinkling into existence and he watched them through the branches as he ate think i can just stay here awhile ashhur he asked then chuckled as nice as it might be hed grow bored with the solitude and lack of conflict he was a man of action always had been always would be hopefully his actions might lead to a bit more substance than they had before he closed his eyes to pray and immediately opened them an impulse echoed in his head new to him but he knew what it was ashhur crying out a warning darius stood and pulled his sword off his back the soft light shone across his meager campsite the stars were bright and in the distance he saw the approach of a man robed in black he felt his throat tighten and he prayed it be anyone other than him but the man looked at him from across the distance and his eyes shone like fire no darius whispered it cant be i killed you karaks most fanatical servanthow was he alive hed cut his head off watched his body burn no one was immortal it couldnt be him but who else was it the man in black drew nearer and with each step darius felt ashhur screaming warning it had to be him his face shifted each feature changing in the tiniest of ways his hood dipped low and then he smiled you failed me darius said velixar karaks prophet youre dead said darius you failed me and you failed your god darius shook his head karak is my god no longer velixar continued his approach he stood at the edge of the campfire the light shining over the black robes and pale white flesh that isnt true velixar insisted another step closer you can still turn back to him you can still accept my embrace and return to the one true faith no closer darius said pointing his sword toward the prophets throat you do not need to remain a failure you do not need to wallow in guilt lower your weapon and listen to my words i never lied to you i would never lie darius prayed for strength for courage his time in durham flashed back to him and he thought of the innocent family hed butchered in karaks name he used that anger that shame to keep his sword raised still velixar was there smiling stepping closer always there to discuss to speak his truth darius would not listen he would not do not be afraid velixar said his throat was mere inches from the tip of dariuss sword you have nothing to be afraid oftraitor velixar lunged his face locked in a horrific scowl darius started to thrust but saw that the prophet wielded daggers he almost didnt block for it made no sense his instincts ruled in the end and he pulled back his sword whirling he blocked the thrusts parried another and then retreated closer to the fire velixar remained back but he was no longer velixar and no longer smiling you could never just die could you asked valessa i could say the same for you darius said trying to remain confident the black robes were gone as was the everchanging face she wore her gray cloak and plain leather armor two wicked daggers twirled in her hands darius felt like he was trapped in a nightmare this hardly made any more sense than velixar returning to walk the lands you flung yourself against my blade he said you killed yourself rather than accept defeat what magic lets you live again magic she said this is no magic no blessing no curse this is vengeance when she moved it was as if she became a shadow her armor fading her flesh a blur of darkness her daggers shone red and he focused on them nothing else his greatsword had benefits of reach but it lacked in speed protecting himself from her barrage involved a constant retreat a step back for her every step forward she twisted and struck with inhuman speed could he hurt her he wondered at last he saw an opening his counterriposte slashed across her arm the blade passed right through her as if she were only smoke at first the lack of blood and flesh disheartened him but then he heard her scream she pulled back clutching at the wound which was a deep gray scar compared to the rest of her body he gave her no reprieve thrusting for her chest he thought her helpless for shed pressed against a large tree to avoid the thrust he swung wide a chop that would remove her head from her neckhe hoped but instead it thunked into wood before his very eyes shed sunk into the tree as if it had been nothing but a mirage he freed his sword just in time for valessa burst forth from the trunk daggers leading darius blocked both and he pressed against her crossed blades strength against strength what are you he asked through gritted teeth your better she said not a chance the light of his sword shone against her in such close contact the flesh of her face peeled away revealing the darkness beneath she let out a cry then retreated beyond the edge of the firelight darius did not chase he was too busy catching his breath i do not sleep she told him pacing along the camps edge i do not eat i do not tire walls mean nothing to me darius nothing what hope do you have your death is only a matter of time i will send you to karaks abyss and enjoy watching you burn youre wrong valessa darius said watching her his sword still held tight you wont kill me and even if you do karak wont have me you will go to the abyss if i have to drag you there myself she attacked her daggers arcing for gaps in his armor darius twisted so one scraped harmlessly against the platemail then smacked aside the other so he could counter his sword cut across her breast white light shining again she shrieked and fled out of his reach what was it youd do to me he asked her laughing despite his tired limbs at first valessa looked ready for another assault but she pulled back further shaking her head i endured death so i might kill you darius i can wait a few more hours you must sleep and when you do i will be watching i will always be watching valessa faded away into the darkness her voice lingering in the night darius lowered his sword and took a breath damn he thought to put his back to a tree then realized how foolish an idea that was given that he faced an opponent who moved through trees as if they were not there he stood in the open beside his fire and scanned his surroundings he didnt see her but that meant nothing his instincts told him to flee but where if he pressed hard he might reach the edge of the forest but what did that gain him where might he sleep in safety assuming she did not ambush him while he stumbled along not even castle walls could protect him no amount of guards might keep her away and she was right no matter how strong he was he had to sleep eventually could really use you here jerico darius said settling down beside the fire on his knees ashhur would warn him of any danger he knew but would it be enough if he were asleep if only jerico were there they could spend the night in shifts one awake one asleep but he was alone and days away from civilization this isnt how it should end he whispered it didnt seem fair didnt seem just he had but one idea left and that was to bait valessa into combat if he could kill her assuming she could be killed then that removed the threat of her ambush he stood again lifting his sword above his head is that it he cried to the darkness youre going to run youre going to play the coward what does that prove you were weaker than me in life and even with karaks strength youre weaker now with every moment you hide you accept ashhurs greatness darius tensed expecting her to launch at him with those blasted daggers but instead he heard her laughter from amid the trees do you think i am a fool to be baited she asked momentarily appearing at his right before vanishing a child to be made reckless you bear the gifts of ashhur and i of karak your training may be better your armor superiorbut we still bear our gifts and mine will send you to your grave lie down darius let ashhur protect you youre his beloved arent you well see how much he cherishes his childrenand make no mistake darius you are the last of his children you and jerico for such a victory i can wait and wait can you darius swallowed damn he stabbed his sword into the earth grabbed its hilt and knelt before it he was already tired from the several days journey and the fight with valessa had only worn him out further his eyelids felt heavy worse with each moment now that the excitement of battle was fading no solutions came to mind no matter how much he tried to think despair threatened him but he refused it this was the life he had chosen when jerico had offered his hand and a hope for something better hed taken it and he would not question the decision now you wont win darius said closing his eyes and trusting ashhur to warn him if she were to attack again even if you kill me you wont win the night droned on silent but for the crickets and the rustle of nocturnal birds he clutched his sword gripping the hilt hard enough to hurt his hands he couldnt sleep if he made it to daylight perhaps he would think of something retreat back to kaide no theyd only kill him as well his mind couldnt focus everything about him was too calm too quiet valessa no longer made her presence known did not speak to him part of him wanted to believe she was nothing but an illusion a terrible dream hed slipped into as he lay beside the fire maybe it wouldnt be so bad he thought maybe dying wouldnt hurt at all he slapped himself to push the thoughts away another hour passed dreadful in its tedium his nerves could no longer take the wait the constant anticipation of an attack from the shadows he had no ideas no solutions the metal was cool against his skin as he pressed his forehead against the hilt of his sword i have nothing left he prayed no way to go what do i do ashhur tell me and ill do it dont let me die here not like this surely i have something more something better to achieve tell me what to do just tell me expecting nothing he shuddered when he heard ashhurs voice sleep it said and he did v alessa watched from the branches of a tree always conscious of where her feet pressed against the bark she had to keep it solid lest she fall the hours passed but she did not tire everywhere within her she felt pain how could one sleep through that several times she thought darius had lost focus but knew that damned god of his would warn him of her approach the last thing she wanted to do was break the monotony to give his body a bit of danger to wake itself up again it doesnt matter the wait she whispered watching the way his eyes remained shut for longer with each closing and how his head drooped ever further she knew men could stay awake for lengthy periods of time but it usually involved actual combat arduous travel or constant danger shed give him nothing already she felt foolish for not waiting for him to be asleep before she attacked in the first place but her pride burned inside her belly she wanted to prove to karak she was the superior and dariuss challenge had stirred shame and fury still what would it matter if she beat him in combat or forced a dagger through his eye while he slept he was a traitor a coward and deserved an eternity of torment for his betrayal what did honor or fairness matter compared to that and then his eyes remained closed for too long her body tensed and she clutched the branch with a shadowy hand already hed fallen asleep already shed expected him to last the night and perhaps much of the following day how could someone so weak have defeated her accept this blessing my glorious karak she whispered slinking to the ground she passed over leaves without making a sound her daggers shook in her hands not from fear but from excitement this was it a single thrust and shed be free of her torment of a form that knew only cold and agony dariuss head dipped lower his hands still clutching the hilt his breathing was deep rhythmic forcing herself to be calm she waited watched she would not be tricked not so close to victory but another ten minutes passed and he did not stir lifting her daggers she stepped into the dim light of his fire the kill was hers and then the sword flared the pain overwhelmed her beyond words she could not even scream the bluewhite light around his blade shone brighter than any torch any sun any star it flooded the forest washing over it in waves valessa tried to flee but it held her prisoner the illusion of herself burned away until she was only darkness only pain her thoughts scrambled as her form weakened with every passing moment the abyss awaited her she knew and she would go there a failure her punishment would be beyond reckoning that terror gave her strength and she stepped away dimly aware of her frantic jerky movements and then the light diminished became once more the faint glow that barely lit up dariuss armor she fell to her hands and knees it was hard to describe but her body felt loose barely hanging together by threads of shadow every shift every twitch elicited pain far beyond the constant ache she had grown accustomed to shed felt the glare of jericos shield as it pressed against her but this was nothing compared to that whatever shed witnessed it wasnt the same she didnt want to imagine the torment if shed been beside the blade when the light erupted damn you darius she said struggling to stand youll bleed by my hands ashhur wont protect you forever deep down she could feel karaks anger growing thrice a failurehow long until he revoked his gift from her completely she didnt want to knowto ever knowbut glaring at the dimly glowing blade she feared for the first time that she might actually fail looking to the sky she hoped for comfort in the shining red star it was there but another star was beside it one she had never seen before the sight of it filled her with fear and she swore not to look on it again nor think on what it might mean jerico woke before sandra did both of them covered with a fine cold layer of dew he shivered then carefully pulled his arms free of her she stirred repositioned her head atop her hands and continued to sleep jerico rubbed his eyes glancing once at the rising sun the clouds were thick yet the sun burned a deep red a bad omen jerico knew had another of his brethren died in the night or perhaps karak moved again further sealing his victory in the end it didnt matter jericos task was to worry about himself and those with him glancing at sandra he felt hesitation building in his chest better to pray first he thought or prepare breakfast he knew that would be stalling though and let out a sigh he was hardly perfect and the last thing he wanted was to see what he feared most an angry red scar the skin about it darkening purple hed cured disease venom and wounds of battlebut could he defeat karaks own curse just normal skin he prayed while she still slept normal skin not too much to ask right knowing time was short and sandra would wake soon he carefully knelt beside her and grabbed the bottom of her shirt between his fingers he didnt want her to see his reaction if it was bad he needed to be strong at least thats what he thought she needed realizing he was stalling again he swallowed then slowly revealed the skin of her stomach the sight hit his gut like a club it was worse than hed expected the wound wasnt even scarred it looked like it was still trying to heal swollen flesh leaking pus the skin around it was a dark purple with red veins snaking through the bruises no he whispered jerico sandra was awake and lying very still her jaw trembled but there were no tears in her eyes its bad isnt it she asked jerico licked his lips and begged for strength yes he said it is she laid her head back on the grass and closed her eyes her hand clutched his and it held him tight i thought so she said softly it hurts so much jerico so much lie still he told her let me do what i can he prayed over the wound and watched the healing light about his hands plunge into the skin he did this again and again refusing to let anything of karaks defeat him not now not when a life was at stake the purple faded and the wound closed back to an angry scar each time drained him laid an extra layer of exhaustion across his mind hed endured worse especially after the wolfmen attacked durham but he knew there was little more he could do for her standing he let her examine the wound the pains mostly gone she said mostly it should be gone completely dark magic must have been in that dagger sandra it is the only way to explain why i cant heal it youre keeping it under control though right maybe it just needs time jerico bit his tongue and nodded it was getting harder every day to heal it but he didnt want to tell her that he could see the way she looked at him she was grasping at hope and if there was anything jerico was supposed to represent that was it arguing with her about it seemed beyond childish come on he said offering his hand lets get you something to eat after theyd eaten and prepared for travel jerico pondered their destination hed originally meant to go after lord arthur and do what he could to break the siege but now we need to find a stronger healer jerico said as he scattered their fire with his foot a priest maybe even a wizard whatever has infected that wound be it a curse or spell might be familiar to someone with a better background in the arcane sandra put her hands on her stomach and nodded hed wrapped it tight with clean bandages but it still looked like it bothered her he felt so helpless how was it he could heal broken bones but a single stab wound defeated him so i thought you were heading toward the castle of caves she said that was before i told you ill be fine i just need some time i promised to be no burden and i wont have you changing your plans now jerico shook his head i wont wont what she asked stepping face to face with him watch me die is that what you think will happen he looked away and that was answer enough we could go back the way we came he offered bellok might know a way she was crying but she let none of it affect her voice as she shook her head id be dead already if not for you she said im not going back you may doubt but i trust you ive seen what you can do whatever this is youre stronger were going on to where youre needed most all right yes milady she smiled stood on her toes so she could kiss his lips jerico smiled back but there was little joy in it hed seen the grimace that flashed across her face when she stepped away he saw how blood was already starting to seep through the bandages around her waist let her live jerico whispered as she led the way west otherwise youre going to have one pissed off paladin to deal with when i walk through your gates jerico followed sandra wondering what his teachers at the citadel would have said upon hearing him issuing threats to his own deity he had a feeling they would have been amused they walked for several hours often stopping to rest when they ate at midday sandra only nibbled on the hard bread the lack of appetite worried jerico but he said nothing they continued on their pace growing slower with each mile jerico prayed over sandras wound and when it showed only marginal improvement he said nothing only accepted her thanks with a smile the day wore on and they passed field after field when they saw a distant farmstead jerico led them there he saw many children working the fields and the first to see him bowed low his eyes nearly bugging out of his head are you a paladin the boy asked he looked like he was nine at most i am he said smiling is your pa about the boy nodded ill get him he ran off jerico took sandra by the hand and led her toward the farmhouse were fine on food she said but she sounded distant thats not why were here they reached the home but stopped when they heard a man call a greeting from the fields jerico turned then bowed low to a man who looked to be on the verge of his fiftieth birthday his skin was tanned from many hours spent in the sun and his back was stuck in a stoop but he moved easily enough and when he shook jericos hand his grip was strong welcome said the man his demeanor was friendly but jerico sensed the apprehension hidden behind it after all here he was a simple farmer greeting an armed stranger wearing platemail forgive us for intruding jerico said he kept his tone warm and hoped the farmer would realize he meant no harm no intrusion said the farmer my names cobb williams what can i do for you if it is food you want i have a bit to sell though im not in the way of much else this is sandra and my name is jerico he debated a moment then added of the citadel cobbs eyes widened a moment and then he grinned gods be good you telling the truth my oldest joined up with that bandit kaide and came limping back from the green gulch with fewer fingers and a lot more sense mind if i see that shield of yours hes always talking about it jerico obliged pulling his shield from his back and holding it before him light shone across its surface cobb reached out to touch it it safe he asked just before making contact depends how dark your heart is cobb laughed perhaps i better not he said pulling back his hand im a simple man working the fields but i know when not to press my luck please come inside i can get my wife to make you all a fine meal and perhaps you can tell me how the battle at the gulch really went never know if my sons speaking truth or telling tales if you get my meaning jerico glanced at sandra hed planned to buy a horse even a donkey so long as sandra would have something to ride no matter how much she might deny it he knew the lengthy walks were aggravating her wound yet her skin had grown pale and he doubted they could go much further that day perhaps eating some fresh food and sleeping in a comfortable bed would do her good our food has been poor and rationed jerico said returning his shield to its spot on his back i hope you understand what youre offering cobb grinned mister you wont eat more than what my debra can cook when you feed as many mouths as we do two more dont matter much they entered into a large family room which looked to take up more than half the house cobb left them there to talk with debra their furnishings were meager but sandra sat on a cushioned chair closed her eyes and slowly rocked are you all right jerico asked her thats a stupid question even for you she smiled and even with her eyes closed she looked so beautiful jericos hatred grew in his heart at what valessa had done he knew his hatred was wrong that it went against all he believedbut damn it sometimes it seemed so appropriate debra came to greet them wiping her hands on her apron she was as worn and tanned as her husband though she looked to be a good ten years younger jerico took her hand bowed on one knee and kissed her knuckles debra giggled as if she were but a young girl yet to leave her fathers home youre just like jeb described she said be honored if you stayed at least a night we dont hear much beyond our neighbors and theyd rather talk about the harvest than what the hemman brothers are up to she turned her attention to sandra and her giddiness vanished replaced with a distinctly motherly attitude are you feeling fine dear just a little ill that is all sandra said honest this is sandra goldflint jerico said kaide goldflints sister that raised some eyebrows but the couple held their questions as to why she was there traveling with jerico instead of her brother sandra kept silent and soon she slept it has been a long trek jerico said the road is hard on everyone cobb agreed and let the matter drop come dinner the whole family gathered the room was cramped but none were willing to eat outside or in a different room not with jerico there to entertain jerico counted four sons and one daughter the oldest looked to be in his late teens and was already married they also lived there on the farmland though cobb insisted the boy would soon have land and a house of his own hardly a year separated him from the second oldest brother jeb the one who had joined kaides army when the bandit leader had gone recruiting on his way to join arthur hemmans army truth be told jerico didnt recognize him at all hed been just one of many amid the battle i didnt get a chance to fight much jeb explained stayed near the back but i did help hold the line when you said you shoulda seen yourself that shield glowing as we fought even when i took a hit to my hand and lost half my damn fingers id still have gone on fighting we all thought you died when you stayed back after calling for a retreat im too stubborn for that jerico said earning a laugh from around the table when jerico brought up purchasing a mount cobb would hear none of it far as im concerned youre why my boys still alive he said i got an old ass that doesnt care too much for plowing anymore hell still let you ride him long as the burden isnt too much i dont think sandra will upset him none the food was delicious as promised particularly the bread jerico devoured slices until it was gone though the same could not be said for sandra she ate little nibbling at her food before pushing it away her skin had grown even more pale and he caught her staring at the table as if amid intense concentration sandra jerico asked hoping not to alarm his hosts she looked up at him with a blank expression then shook her head im sorry she said standing from the table i need some air is all just need she fell to one knee remaining upright only because one of cobbs sons grabbed her arm and held her jerico shot from his chair and hurried to her side whats the matter debra asked can we help its nothing sandra said weakly pushing jerico away im fine her forehead was slick with sweat when he touched her and it burned his hand like fire fever he told the couple i hate to ask but but nothing cobb said put her in our bed barely sleep as it is and the floor suits me just fine jerico scooped sandra into his arms and stood debra scattered the rest of the children as cobb led him into the small bedroom to the side laying her atop the blankets jerico brushed his hand against her forehead and tried to focus his thoughts for another lengthy bout of prayer cobb crossed his arms and nodded toward sandra sir i dont mean to pry but i know youre not telling me everything shes got more than a fever my old eyes can still see those bandages she was stabbed jerico said lifting sandras shirt normally i could handle it but somethings wrong its fighting me somehow those bandages need to be cleaned cobb said leaning closer to inspect them ill grab a knife and then well take a look he stepped out only for debra to replace him at sandras side she laid a cool cloth over sandras forehead then told her to hush when she protested ive got jeb heating some water over the fire she told jerico when it gets to boiling i have a few herbs that should help bring down her fever thank you cobb returned knife in hand debra scooted over to allow her husband access to the bed with slow deliberate movements he sliced off the bandages they smelled sickly sweet and were soaked with blood and pus jerico winced when he saw the first patch of flesh beneath more and more bandages fell to the floor cobb leaned in examining every inch close enough for his nose to nearly touch her skin when done he looked at jerico the wounds gone bad he said im not sure how shes even alive jerico nodded for hed thought the same thing her entire stomach was purple and in its center like a cats eye was a weeping cut its edges were yellow and the veins about it a violent red jerico couldnt begin to imagine the pain it caused her jeb said you can heal people debra said guarded optimism in her voice surely shes not too far gone for you no jerico said taking a deep breath but each day she gets worse and my prayers lessen in their effect somethings inside her fighting against every bit of healing maybe so cobb said but ive seen something like this before not so terrible of course we need to open her up or shell be dead soon the farmer leaned down so he could whisper to sandra i need you to lie still he said ill have jerico hold you down if i have to if you dont trust yourself just say so and we can go ahead and have him do it now her breathing had grown shallow and when she spoke it was too soft for jerico to hear cobb heard though and closed his eyes and sighed hold her down he said jerico took sandras hands lifted them over her head to the pillow and leaned his weight on her forearms debra left then came back with her oldest ordering him to help her hold down sandras legs im sorry i have nothing for the pain cobb told her wait said jerico he released sandras arms and placed his palm against her forehead he closed his eyes and tried not to tremble never the best when it came to the nonphysical aspects of being a paladin he still knew many useful prayers normally he focused on healing but for now numb the pain he prayed to ashhur numb the hurt give her strength a dim light shone across her eyes and then jerico nodded go ahead he held her wrists and watched as cobbs knife pressed against sandras skin it pierced drawing blood sandra tensed and let out a whimper but did not struggle much debra left her son to hold her legs and instead took out a second cloth and used it to mop away the blood and pus with grim determination cobb reopened the wound in a single smooth cut jerico watched wondering what the famer hoped to accomplish the foul smell in the room worsened as if by cutting into sandra theyd opened a rotten fruit cobb stepped back and let his wife wipe away at the blood so he could see he stared and stared and then grunted there you are you son of a bitch he reached his fingers into the wound sandra let out a cry jerico stroked her face and pressed his cheek against her burning forehead be strong he said closing his eyes youre strong youre stronger than this youre kaides sister and he only wishes he was as strong as you its almost over i promise hold on sandra hold on he heard a sound like metal scraping against bone when he looked up cobb held something aloft with his blood soaked hand it was smaller than a pebble metallic and shone a soft red that immediately made jerico feel ill in his stomach cobb looked around then wrapped it with a bloodied cloth can you handle the rest he asked otherwise debra has a way with stitches she needs more than stitches jerico said shaking his head leave me be ashhur will make her well the three left alone with her jerico knelt by the bed put his hands across her stomach and prayed healing light poured into her and strength out of him the minutes passed but he paid no heed his hands shook and they were stained with blood but he ignored that as well for over an hour he stood vigil watching as the vicious wound closed and the purple flesh and red veins faded away her fever lessened her eyes closed and sleep came to her at last jerico knew he could not continue his mind felt raw his throat dry he tried to stand and stumbled gripping the bed he rose slower took a deep breath and then left the room darkness had fallen and the family gathered in their thick blankets across the main room debra leaned back in the chair softly rocking cobb stood by the door and when he saw jerico exit he beckoned him over outside he said the cool night air felt good against jericos sweatsoaked skin he stretched his back then leaned against the side of the home standing was a chore but it felt good to no longer be on his knees cobb chewed on something tough and watched the stars after turning to spit he held out a small cloth bundle take it he said i dont feel right having it around jerico accepted the cloth then unwrapped it inside was the metal piece that had remained inside sandra poisoning her from within its red glow had dimmed as if it were losing power i believe its the tip of a dagger cobb said not looking at it but thats thick metal dont see how cutting through something soft as a womans belly would have broken it it was no ordinary dagger jerico said thinking of the strange magic that had possessed valessa hearing this cobb chuckled youre telling me things i already know theres something foul about it stuck in her it must have been killing her every moment its no wonder i couldnt heal her jerico said staring at the metal as if it were a sentient evil i feel so foolish for not thinking to check her as you did doubt youve ever needed to your abilities are amazing jerico you probably could have stuck my sons fingers right back on his hand if youd been there and had the time but sometimes a good knife and a pair of eyes have their uses too jerico put the metal piece into his palm and clenched his fist holy light shone through his fingers and he directed every bit of his anger toward the metal when he reopened his fist nothing but dust remained he lifted his hand and blew it on the wind let it carry far beyond the farm cobb nodded in approval silence stretched between them until cobb turned spat and began again forgive me if im prying he said but what is sandra doing with you and not her brother last we heard hes still fighting lord sebastian he set her out on a task are you some sort of bodyguard why she is with me is her own affair but im on no task from kaide then where are you headed to the castle of caves to help arthur cobb sighed not surprised though i was hoping a good man like you had seen the senselessness of it all all lords are the same i told jeb that when he rode off to fight kill and die like a bloody fool they all want their taxes all demand our worship and all see us as nothing but cattle the sooner this ends the sooner the north returns to peace ive spoken with arthur hes a good man a better man those not in power always seem so cobb said funny how all that fairness and honor vanishes once theyre the one sitting on a throne cobb turned and spat out whatever hed been chewing on then wiped his lips on his sleeve forgive me he said youre a good man yourself and im sure youre doing what you think is right ive got a few more years on you though and i think theyve hardened me like leather over a fire seeing jeb get caught up in it didnt help none either reason why i aski doubt sandras going to be ready to travel anytime soon if whatever youre doing is dangerousand it sounds like it isshe can stay here we could always use another if theyre willing to work hard and shes a pretty lady to boot if she wants a normal life im sure i could find a dozen men eager for her hand im not sure thats what she wants then what does she want jerico chuckled im not sure i know that either cobb shrugged just giving you the option it looks like shes already been hurt once traveling with you id hate for it to happen again promise me youll think on it i will cobb stretched and his back popped several times i should join my family ill sleep on the floor in sandras room if thats all right with you i thought you might cobb said and he smiled and jericoif its you shes wanting you might consider just how important taking down lord sebastian really is he went inside finally alone jerico looked to the stars he wanted to pray for guidance but he was too damn tired tomorrow he promised the stars and thank you jerico returned to sandras room he put his hand against the side of her face checking there was no fever she slept deeply with no appearance of pain for that he was thankful cobbs words came to him but he pushed them away he had no energy for that beside her bed he found a blanket laid out for him when and by whom he could only guess wrapping himself in it he closed his eyes and fell asleep within moments darius was stunned to be awake his back hurt like the abyss his left arm was asleep and the red mark on his forehead would probably never vanishbut somehow he was alive huh he muttered ill be damned well maybe not quite he thought with a chuckle that was after all the entire point of what he was fighting against he ate his meager breakfast always with an eye out for valessa it made no sense really why she hadnt killed him in his sleep how shed mocked him taunted him with that fate she could wait shed said yet ashhur had commanded him to sleep and no dagger had found his throat it was a miracle one he felt woefully unworthy of not that hed complain it was still vastly better than the alternative darius caught sight of her only once as he gathered his things watching from behind a distant tree she looked like herself plaingarbed and furious when she realized shed been spotted she vanished darius saluted her direction then continued east toward the gihon river once he reached it he could follow it north to the blood tower sir robert godley issuer of the bounty on his head would be there as hed told jerico hed explain everything and demand that the bounty be removed before anyone got hurt and if robert refused darius tried to not think about that valessa bothered him little as the next days passed several times darius felt a tingle in the back of his mind and hed turn readying his sword if shed been planning to attack she backed down at his reaction at no point did he feel safe nor relinquish his weapon even when he took a piss he held the hilt in one hand his dick in the other valessa might not think it honorable killing a man while he relieved himself but hed seen the madness in her eyes as long as he died he felt pretty sure shed be content every night he knelt in an open space or field for hed left the forest long behind him he stabbed his sword into the dirt before him closed his eyes and slept every night he expected death and prayed ashhur would take him every morning he awoke shaking his head and chuckling it wasnt until the fourth day that darius encountered another human being he walked a dirt path between great fields stretching north to south on either side gold wheat blew in the wind and he ran his hands across their stalks half a mile beyond the stronghold there had been a field and a long time ago darius used to play in it weaving hidden from the world through the wheat when he was supposed to be performing his daily prayers hed been caught once and that once was enough to ensure he never did it again his hand dropped to his side karak had stolen away his childhood surely that alone proved the destructiveness of the stronghold lost in memories of rigid canings forced prayers and constant reaffirming of the chaos in his heart he barely noticed the approaching wagon until it was right on top of him hold darius called out waving his arms at the approaching driver a wagon meant supplies and food both of which he was running low on what little coin he had should get him to the gihon and from there it was just a matter of time until he spotted one of their patrols along the river two men sat at the front of the covered wagon which was pulled by a pair of heavily panting oxen their clothes were the color of dirt and toil their faces unshaven they said something to one another then issued a command with the reins darius knew nothing of how to drive a wagon but he could tell when one wasnt slowing frowning he waved his arms again making sure to keep his sword sheathed hold i wish to trade he shouted i am a paladin and mean you no harm the men appeared unwilling to run over a champion of the gods and finally slowed close enough for darius to reach out and touch the noses of the oxen could you move the driver asked darius certainly darius said though id prefer we talk first ive run low on supplies and wonder if you have any to spare the men exchanged a look i can pay he insisted not got much to trade said the larger man beside the driver i suggest you move on towns not far back behind us buy your fill there darius tried to show no insult for their inhospitable nature while at times hed received preferential treatment for his allegiance to karak he also knew there were plenty who wished nothing to do with the gods champions or any matter of faith with dark paladins hunting those of ashhur all across dezrel they also might not wish to traffic with either side lest they be caught in the middle just a scrap of food darius said doing his best to show he posed no danger i will pay fair prices and be grateful for your kindness still they looked at one another neither saying a thing its that or you run me over darius said his patience wearing thin im not moving fine said the driver grick will see what we can spare if youll curl around to the back much appreciated darius said bowing he walked past the wagon smacking one of the oxen across its muscular side grick vanished into the covering for a brief moment darius thought the driver might resume now the road was clear but he did not at the rear of the wagon darius peered inside various bags and crates were stacked to either side many of them were already open grick wandered around them as if unsure of what he was looking for on the way to market darius asked huh grick looked over at him then shrugged yeah right been lean so me and gacy thought to take some things to sell down at murkland now where darius watched him search as a cold feeling settled in his stomach when grick turned aside darius stepped closer and peered at the visible boards of the wagon dried blood so are you and gacy brothers he asked swallowing hard brothers grick chuckled yeah were brothers aint we brothers gacy just shut up and sell him what he wants gacy shouted from the front a strange sensation hit darius though it was less of a sensation and more of a certainty he knew without a shred of doubt grick had just spoken a lie poor wagon looks like its been through plenty of hard winters darius said making casual conversation had it long yeah grick said pulling out two loaves of bread from a sack had it forever it seems another lie darius knew that jerico had always possessed the ability to detect truth and now it seemed ashhur had granted him the same gift darius slowly pulled his sword off his back and rested it across his shoulder whered you get it he asked grick was about to offer the bread but paused something in dariuss voice must have set him off for he pulled back asking a lot of questions mister grick said why you care about my wagon i dont i care about what you and gacy did to the original owners go grick shouted ducking further into the covering darius climbed after him on his knees amid stolen goods and atop wood stained red with blood he felt his anger rise before he could take to his feet grick was back knife in hand he lunged the small blade aimed for dariuss throat it was a meager weapon suitable for robbing peasants not combat with an armed professional darius smacked it aside with his gauntleted hand then kicked himself forward the headbutt knocked grick to his rear the ensuing kick sent the knife flying the wagon shuddered as it started to move and then gacy was there climbing over the divider between the front seat and the rest of the wagon he wielded a heavy club and swung it overhead with all his strength darius blocked it with his sword kicked grick again when he tried to get up and then swung his sword slashed across gacys arm severing tendons howling in pain gacy leapt at darius his hands reaching to strangle him darius reacted as hed been trained to a thousand times stepping back he put the tip of his sword between them and let the man impale himself on the blade gritting his teeth he kicked the man away and pulled his sword free the body collapsed on the floor beside grick arms and legs sprawled atop various crates gricks lower lip quivered and he pushed at the corpse dont kill me he pleaded take it take the wagon its yours all of it yours just dont kill me darius pressed the tip of his blade against gricks throat blood trickled down the sword obscuring the blue glow beneath his pulse pounding in his ears darius tried to think tried to decide what jerico would do youre thieves arent you he asked yes said grick you stole this wagon didnt you yes ii didnt want to it was gacys idea i swear shut up darius felt his jaw begin to tremble so he clenched it tighter he ground his teeth as he fought for calm what did you do to them he asked what did you do to some poor farmers on their way to market tell me grick we just roughed em up grick said i swear roughed them up but theyre alive we left them alive again came that certainty the man spoke a lie theyre dead darius whispered the tip of his sword pressed harder against gricks neck that makes you a thief and a murderer please no the man said barely understandable between his sobs he was a wretched man poor uneducated without a shred of courage his skin barely clung to his bones yet he had taken a life many lives most likely gacy was already dead and darius could only imagine jericos unhappiness at that but what was he to do turn them over to the law and risk capture himself let them go free with an easily broken promise to do no wrong mercy over vengeance jerico had said grace over condemnation but what of justice grick continued to sob and in dariuss mind he became the wounded stranger that karaks prophet velixar had brought him to on a dark night velixars lesson was that killing could be done for good that the ending of a life was a mercy how could darius reject karaks teachings yet desire nothing more than to shove his sword right through gricks throat he would not be a hypocrite darius would rather be a failureor a weaklingthan a hypocrite get up he said he saw a coil of rope in the corner and gestured to it grab it and step out of the wagon slowly if you run i will chase you down and make sure you get every scrap of pain you deserve have i made myself clear grick nodded good now do it the man slowly stepped out from the wagon wincing every time the tip of dariuss sword nudged his back when they were both out darius tied one end around gricks wrists then looped it about his neck always careful to keep an eye out for valessa in case she thought it an opportune moment to strike when finished he took the other end and held it while he replenished his store of food from the wagon were going to travel the way you came grick youll lead well find those bodies and if you and your bastard friend didnt bury them then well do that too after that we head to town find someone who knew the people you killed someone related theyll decide your fate but first he nodded toward the wagon grab gacy out of there you have a body to bury darius left him plenty of slack as grick climbed inside and dragged out gacys body by a leg in the field darius said when grick paused what am i going to dig with grick asked the gods gave you hands for a reason now start what about the wagon you just gonna leave it here someone will take it darius chuckled the irony was not lost on him then lets pray whoever finds it is much more deserving of it than you he watched grick dig as the sun crawled across the sky progress was slow in the hard ground darius did his best to feel no compassion no remorse as the cuts grew across gricks hands he was a murderer after all karak would have had him executed the old ways even calling for his sacrifice upon an altar glancing down at the scratched off lion on his chest darius reminded himself he was slave to those ways no longer blood dripped across the shallow groove that was gacys grave slide over darius said as he jammed his sword into the dirt still within arms reach i killed him this is my grave to dig too together they tore into the ground with their hands until at last there was enough space for a body darius dragged gacy into it and then covered it with what dirt they had it was not enough and darius knew wild animals would soon come to dig it up still there was little else he could do if not wild animals then the worms would have him but at least theyd done something come on darius said grabbing his sword walk darius had no desire to chat and thankfully grick picked up on it in silence they traveled down the dirt road grick ahead darius holding the rope like the other man was some sort of pet the hours spent digging the grave had killed much of the day and by the time they found a trio of trees growing beside the road the sun had begun to set there grick said pointing toward the trees thats where we hid bodies should be around here someplace it wasnt difficult to find where theyd been dumped darius just followed the blood there were three bodies two were husband and wife lying side by side as if they would stay together even in death at their feet face down was the body of a child darius rolled her over so he could see her face see the bugs crawling across her pale skin see the trickle of blood dripping from her nose to her mouth the paladin swallowed hard and he heard velixars voice in his head mocking him what say you now darius is this man worth the time the effort run your sword through him and make this world a better place or do you still see compassion as a virtue and not a weakness why darius asked turning to the thief why did you kill the child too you had their things you had their wagon grick stepped back reaching the extent of the rope it tightened about his neck and he winced it was a mercy he said mercy darius felt his fury swell mercy he rushed the man struck him with his fists the heavy gauntlets smashed into gricks nose and teeth darius flung him to the ground kicked and then fell upon him his hands clutching the front of his shirt mercy he shouted you killed a child and you call it mercy gacy woulda kept her grick said spitting out blood and a tooth so he could talk woulda taken her donewe didnt know she was in the wagon and the parents died fighting back shes just a little girl no ma no pa it was mercy please listen either that or gacy no warning this time no certainty from ashhur that he spoke a lie darius thought of the wounded man velixar had brought him to bleeding and in pain killing wasnt a punishment velixar had said it was a mercy staring down at the thief darius saw pieces of himself of what velixar had sought to create only in a far more terrible light i made sure she felt nothing grick said when darius said nothing his words broke the silence and darius stood we have no time for a burial he said well burn them just as you should have by the time the pyre was complete night was upon them darius felt tired his armor heavy on his body the fire burned and in it darius thought he saw a glimpse of the abyss and velixars mocking smile this was the world he defended these were the people darius had sworn to defend to save when he sided with jerico over karak how much farther is the town darius asked grick as the smell of burnt flesh and hair filled the air another four miles grick said too far then well stay here for the night they moved to the cluster of trees and built a small fire darius chewed on his lip then removed the rope from around gricks neck leaving only the tight cords about his wrists i wont leave you hogtied through the night darius said settling down opposite the fire and the trees youll want to run im sure but know that i can track you ive been trained for this grick i know where youd go how youd hide and i cant promise to control myself the next time i find you then what do you want me for grick asked pressing his hands against his neck and rubbing the raw flesh to deliver you to justice like i said well let the townspeople decide your fate then just kill me now you know thats what theyll do darius rubbed his thumb and forefinger against his eyelids yes he did know that what in the gods names was he doing what did he hope to accomplish you killed people darius said you know you must be punished you killed gacy dont see no one punishing you children darius said you killed children yeah i did and i did it to protect her you saying you never done something like that darius opened his mouth then closed it the praying family flashed before his eyes followed by velixars laughter echoing in his ears yes he had and jerico had forgiven him for all of it and now ashhur placed his trust in him damn it why couldnt things remain simple yes darius said quietly i have and then i flung myself to my knees and demanded that my friend deliver justice grick shifted against the tree he leaned against why didnt he kill you he asked darius chuckled because hes a better man than i he rolled over clutched the hilt of his sword when he spoke he did not look at grick did not want to see his reaction go if you wish thief i dont know what is right anymore you deserve death but then again so do i so go let someone who can sleep through the night decide your fate run away from your punishment when the gods one day find you on your deathbed may they possess greater wisdom than i he closed his eyes and tried to sleep he heard rustling several times but ashhur cried no warning in his ear at last sleep came for him and he dreamt of a little girl running through a field flowers in her hair her face lit with a smile when darius woke grick lay against the same tree his head lolled to one side his neck was slit and blood soaked the front of his clothes valessa stood beside him grinning darius grabbed his sword but valessa only laughed at him ashhur protected you from me she said but not him what does that mean darius can you answer she stepped through the tree and vanished what does it mean darius asked fighting away the lump in his throat it means i must bury him thats what it means he spent the morning digging the grave and the afternoon filling it back up with dirt he gave a quick prayer over it for he knew not what else to say i know nothing of him but his sins darius whispered to the cold evening air but he stayed i pray that meant something the grave went unmarked and traveling east darius did his best to think no more on it robert awoke before dawn as he often did but this time he felt unease the moment he opened his eyes something was awry but what with luthers departure along with the vast bulk of his private troops hed hoped things would return to normal of course the younger priest had remained the way cyric looked at him when they talked always put a queer twisting into his gut as he dressed robert felt certain the priest was to blame for his current unease it felt foolish to fear anything in his own tower surrounded by his own troops but he took his sword with him anyway dressed armed and finished with his predawn rituals he traveled down the stairs feeling particularly fat and old that morning two men guarded the doorway to his tower and by the way they saluted him robert knew something bothered them as well we werent sure if we should wake you one said when pressed for an explanation im awake now robert snapped tell me the priest said the other then shrugged best you follow me see for yourself robert followed the guard to the northern side toward where karaks followers had relocated their camp the cause of the guards apprehension was immediately apparent within the circular wall protecting the tower theyd begun building a structure of impressive size its center was of stone though where theyd found it robert couldnt begin to guess what looked like stairs were on either side built of thick slabs of wood four pits marked the corners each one already thick with flame what in karaks name is that robert wondered aloud its an altar said the guard an altar for what he had no answer and robert dismissed him back to his post the sun was just creeping above the horizon and it cast a red hue across the clouds together with the fires it gave a strange look to the altar that robert liked not one bit his eyes lingered on it as he approached and his attention shifted from it only when stopped by cyric himself welcome knight cyric said his smile ear to ear robert nodded just a curt greeting until he noticed the change that had overcome the priest he looked healthier stronger once hed been nothing but a child with his nose in a book but nowthere was an aura a glow now he appeared dangerous his skin was darker though perhaps that was just a trick of the poor light his eyes were different too he realized instead of a baby blue they were a deep red as if his irises had begun to bleed morning priest robert said not bothering to keep his tone civil what is this youve started building on my land you might rule this small patch of dirt but all of dezrel belongs to karak cyric said still smiling surely you do not mind karak taking such a tiny piece back for his own youre avoiding the damn question i do not mean to cyric said we are building an altar one worthy of such a momentous occasion come tonight we will celebrate our gods glorious return return where speak some sense or ill have my men tear this thing down and haul that chunk of rock into the gihon i wouldnt do that robert cyrics smile grew wider change comes upon the wind do you not feel it you should rejoice to be witness to this miracle he felt it all right it just wasnt inspiring any rejoicing what miracle he asked enough preaching tell me what you plan to do where has karak returned if thats even possible and what does this have to do with your altar karak has returned in me cyric said tonight upon that altar i will show all your men show all the world proof of that fact do not interfere it is no longer your place to stand in the way of gods and men robert felt too old to deal with shit like this the altar loomed before him the flat stone as tall as him over twenty men worked on it hauling in logs cut from distant trees others cut the logs into boards ready to be hammered in by five men who worked nonstop their muscular bodies slick with sweat they all moved like men possessed and he would have none of it tear it down he said karak has enough land as it is go build your altar elsewhere no the word entered his ears and then sunk down into his stomach like a brick cyric said it so casually so simply that it showed he held no fear of robert no respect at all robert swallowed and did his best to keep his temper in check pardon these old ears priest but i fear i heard you wrong you did not if you wish to destroy this altar you are welcome to try but you will fail im stronger now robert stronger than all of you dont throw away your mens lives not when they are so close to seeing the coming glory unfold before them roberts hand fell to the hilt of his sword and he almost drew it then and there he stared into the face of fanaticism and he saw no reason in those red eyes but he was surrounded by men loyal to karak nearby in particular was a dark paladin and he kept his axe ready at all times if robert struck at cyric the others would tear him to pieces long before any of his soldiers could protect him you have one night robert said releasing the hilt of his sword cyrics smile widened even more at the words but after tonight you tear it down you hear me come tomorrow you yourself will be kneeling before that altar said the priest fuck all i will robert muttered as he traveled back to his tower ignoring the guards questioning looks he returned to his room he found little solitude there for daniel barged in moments later sir he said sounding immensely relieved im glad youre here for a moment i feared feared what robert asked daniel stood up straight but it was clear he didnt want to answer robert shook his head motioned for his lieutenant to relax i feel it too he said slumping into his chair i thought with luther gone theyd be more obedient but while their numbers have shrunk their confidence has grown cyric outright refused an order of mine and threatened me in return daniel stood in the doorway his jaw clenched tightly against his trembling anger we need to strike he said before theyre prepared before they have that altar built whatever its purpose truly is hes a threat you know it i know it now lets do something about it to what end asked robert losing half my men all because im scared of a single priest their troops are wellarmed and you can tell by their scars alone theyve seen more combat than most see in a lifetime we cower and act like fools for no reason king baedan would never ever allow an attack by the priests to go unpunished if he hears daniel said if he believes it the truth that reaches his ears will be what the priests make of it were the ones so far away this is our land to protect and i say we not give a fuck what those in mordeina might think and just act and what of my men asked robert how many knelt in prayer yesterday before luthers departure tell me that fifty daniel said robert rubbed his forehead and swore that was a quarter of their current standing forces in the blood tower but they will surely not break their oaths to lord and king daniel said not because of some priest ive seen what men of faith will do robert said if cyric has his claws in the hearts of our men then any action we take risks defeat before the first swing whatever he plans well wait and well watch hes a young man foolish proud this may well bite him in the ass if things go awry this is a mistake daniel insisted yeah but its my mistake to make dismissed lieutenant daniel bowed and left without another word robert had plenty all of them foul he cursed stormed about his room and drank away the day waiting for nightfall as the sun began its descent one of his soldiers knocked on the door what is it he asked in no mood for courtesy the door swung open and the soldier stuck in his head sir cyric wishes me to give you a message youre invited to join him at tonights ceremony he says youll be given a place of honor robert snorted im sure i will tell him id rather fuck a goat the soldier blanched ill tell him you declined he said turning to leave no damn it robert said flinging the door open i gave you an order and i expect you to carry it out now what message are you to deliver the soldier stood erect and saluted that youd rather fuck a goat sir he made it sound so urgent so important robert grinned thats right now leave me be he slammed the door in the soldiers face and poured himself another glass of wine half an hour later the door reopened and daniel stepped inside what is it he asked cyrics extended an invitation to the rest of our soldiers daniel said many want to go what do i say robert scratched at his chin and looked out his window he couldnt see the altar from there but he could imagine it grand in size and surrounded by a large crowd much as i hate that bastard hes right i wont stand in the way of a man and his god whoever wants to go can go so long as their duties are completed daniel clearly felt otherwise but he held his tongue once hed left robert peered down from his window he might not be able to see the altar but he could see the path there he counted seventy men heading north a third of his men so much for king and country robert muttered he belted his sword to his waist flung on a heavy cloak and descended the stairs joining in the ceremony was out of the question but he would not remain in the dark about whatever cyric planned the altar was even more impressive than hed expected the stone slab had been painted a dark black though how he did not know fires burned at the corners in the thick pits while crisscrossing outward in seemingly random directions were tall torches whose fire gave off no smoke over a hundred men encircled the altar atop the stone were three men robert recognized cyric but the other two were unknown to him they were naked from the waist up their bodies covered with red paint they knelt with their heads bowed their eyes blindfolded and their hands bound behind their backs the crowd sang a song robert vaguely recognized though it lacked any joy just the sound of a droning litany of faith toward karak the chant made his skin crawl robert remained in the far back as close as possible to his tower while still able to hear the words cyric spoke as the last light of the sun dipped below the horizon cyric called for silence my friends my soldiers my faithful welcome to this glorious night beneath these stars you will witness the might of karak laid bare before you long have the gods fought over dezrel but at last we will find victory the blood moon approaches at last the true god returns to these lands at last the lion walks among us the lion cheered the fifty soldiers who had remained with cyric when luther left an ill feeling tightened roberts throat and he found his eyes drawn to the bound men who were they what was to be done with them any normal day he would have forced an answer but he was no fool he felt the electricity in the air if he protested or came back with armed men hed have a battle on his hands the lion has returned cyric cried all smiles all victory and he has returned in me but i know there are many here who are doubtful many who are not ready to believe i pray that you come to wisdom and quickly we are owed nothing not even our very next breath a sign im sure you cry in your hearts give me a sign and so i will this was it thought robert he couldnt imagine what sign cyric would produce he hoped it would be a meager one born of smoke and visions his men were better than that despite all the priests words they wanted action wanted something firm cyric had made many promises now it was time to see if he could deliver a cold wind blew over them as cyric motioned for someone to join him atop the altar robert recognized him as the dark paladin though he did not know his name the paladin knelt behind the first of the two bound men and lifted his axe these two men have given their lives to karak cyric told the crowd as a wave of unease stirred through them they are sinful wretched beings they stole they killed perfection will never be possible for them in this life but their faith is great and so comes their reward the paladin swung his axe tore through spine and flesh and showered the altar with gore karaks soldiers cheered and to roberts horror so did many of his men blood dripped across the stone and down its black sides praise be to karak cried the other bound man in a quivering voice the paladin went to his side no hesitation no preaching just another brutal chop and down he went more blood more cheers their bodies are destroyed cyric cried but they are not their souls burn in purifying fire changing becoming greater than ever before lift your voices lift your hearts i am karak i am your god now witness my power the red markings on the two bodies flared then suddenly burst into flame high above thunder rumbled wind blew and then red lightning struck in rapid succession hitting the center of the corpses cyric laughed as the altar split down its center the corpses exploded showering the crowd with blood and then from within those torn bodies the lions emerged they were enormous creatures easily the size of horses their skin cracked from the heat of their own bodies which were made of a rough dark stone along the cracks in their flesh shimmered the yellow glow of molten rock ones neck was bare the other with a thick mane of shadow which billowed in the wind their obsidian claws glimmered in unison they pulled back and roared the force of it knocking many to their knees deep in their throats robert saw liquid fire the two lions circled about cyric eyeing him with their red eyes robert thought he would bow show fear and respect to such amazing creatures but instead it was the lions that lowered their heads cyric turned to the crowd and lifted his arms now is the time said the priest make your choice serve the true god or be consumed by his fury kneel or know death all but twelve kneeled not counting robert who suddenly felt very exposed and very alone before they could react the lions leapt moving with speed that seemed impossible for creatures of such size they dove upon the men slicing open flesh with a swipe of their obsidian claws and snapping necks with a single bite of their jaws those who knelt remained perfectly still as if the slightest movement might bring the beasts bearing down upon them as well of the twelve only one managed to run and it was not far his blood boiled across the tongue of a lion robert had seen many horrors in his years as a soldier and a commander but hed never known such fear as when those lions turned their eyes to him he felt his legs go weak his stomach twist into his throat shit he ran as cyric lifted his arms to the sky and cried out his worship glory and power to our beloved karak arms my brethren take up your arms we follow the old ways now the way of sword and blood and faith kneel or be made pure in death robert heard a familiar sound that of many swords being simultaneously drawn from their scabbards his tower was not far but hed seen the speed of the lions he did not expect to make it but he didnt have to the two men standing guard at the door rushed to meet him their weapons ready inside they cried robert did not slow did not dare look back he heard the brief sound of combat and screams of pain then he was at the door slamming into it at full speed once inside he flung it closed shut the locks and leaned his forehead against the wood dear gods he whispered what have i allowed no time for that the makings of a battle were upon him and it was his task to lead his men he could not be afraid could not hesitate rushing up the stairs he searched the barracks perhaps they could hold the tower but how many were in there with him the second floor was empty but on the third he saw a dozen men gathered before the windows bows in hand sir one said seeing his entrance what word from daniel robert didnt understand so he pushed aside the archer and looked out at the battlefield below cyrics men had come pouring in from their camp already within the outer wall near the tower and stables daniel had formed a battle line a hundred of his men stood firm challenging the mercenaries sworn to karak despite their inferior gear the men seemed to be holding the archers rained arrows down upon the enemy ranks with perfect position from the windows daniel prepared for this robert said realizing what he was seeing he did said one of the archers forgive us sir we were told to say nothing in case he was wrong we can hold them robert said analyzing the fight karaks soldiers fought with religious fervor but his own men defended their homes their lives they also had greater numbers plus the advantage of the archers yes they could hold what the fuck is that asked the man at the northernmost window robert leaned out and there he saw the lions approaching flanking cyric at either side they seemed to be in no great hurry put every arrow you have into those things robert ordered and pray one pierces an eye the men changed their aim and let their arrows fly cyric stepped back as if sensing he was in danger but the lions continued on several struck true but they bounced off the dark skin as if hitting stone the archers showed no worry unleashing a second and third volley still the arrows hit and did nothing and then the lions burst forward the sudden change in speed horrifying to see they were too big to move that fast they had to be the lions crashed through their own ranks then leapt upon daniels men swords could not pierce their flesh shields could not deflect their strikes in seconds the rout was on robert could not see daniel but he hoped he made it out somehow someone needed to tell the world what happened there the lions gave chase but karaks men did not they turned their attention to the tower and the locked doors the archers continued firing at the men but they were hesitant and robert caught many glancing his way worse he saw cyric lift his arms darkness shimmering about his fingers get back he ordered two did not retreat in time arrows made of blood pierced their sides one slumped by the window the other fell through his skull cracking on the ground below silence filled the room as the men stood there looking to their leader robert knew they wanted hope wanted victory but he had none to offer them men you have served me well as you have your lords and your country he said i dont know how much your life is worth to you or what gods you believe in if any one of you wants to fall to your knees i wont blame you but as for me ill be in my room with my door barred when they break through i plan on killing as many as i can before tasting death any who still wish to fight grab a sword and follow me every man there took up arms and robert couldnt have been more proud at the top of the tower they put his desk chair and chest of clothing against the door two men stood at the far side bows in hand the rest waited swords drawn listening to the cries of pain intermixed with worship outside king baedan wont allow this said one rubbing his sword with an oiled cloth when he finds out hell send his whole army wish i could see the look on that priests face when he sees how doomed he is he aint going to hear shit said another whos going to tell the king what happened you daniel will he escaped i saw it enough robert said to them both justenough i wont spend what little time i have left listening to you two bicker then how will we spend it asked a third footsteps echoed from the stairs beyond the door and they heard scattered shouts like men robert said drawing his sword clear the door i wont have them starve us out and i wont wait for that priest to weaken us with his sorcery let those bastards in and well give them a proper blood tower welcome even facing death none there would disobey their commander they pushed away the barricade so far nothing heavier than a mans shoulder pressed the door from the outside so the locks still held robert held up his fingers counting down for them to fling open the bolt on three he let out a cry and raised his sword the door burst open and several men came barging in their armor painted with a red lion the first fell two arrows in his throat another tried and failed to block a trio of attacks as roberts men assaulted him from all sides more soldiers poured inside the archers abandoned their bows and at last robert joined in he parried and twisted but he felt none of the youth he had when he fought the wolfmen in durham mere months ago he felt old tired he was watching his men die before him and for what the whims of a mad priest they killed two for every one of their own but still they fell robert plunged himself into the gap drenching his sword with blood every time he watched the life fade out from those fanatical eyes he felt a smile stretch across his face a counterriposte and another died they were down to four but the mercenaries were beaten back to the door robert dared to think theyd hold that theyd build a wall of the dead across the stairs cyric stepped into the room robert felt both fear and hope fear for he knew the priests power hope because with one thrust he might end the entire conflict maybe even send those blasted lions back to the abyss where they belonged the paladin was with him but his attention was turned to the other men slashing and thrusting the way was clear robert held the hilt of his sword with both hands and swung with every last remnant of his strength cyric caught the blade with his bare hand his skin shone a dull red a few drops of blood trickled down his wrist hello robert cyric said smiling the priests other palm slammed against roberts chestplate and flung him backward as if hed been kicked by a giant crashing against his desk he rolled to one knee gasping for air his helmet had cracked and he tossed it aside blood poured down his face he didnt know the nature of the wound only that he was blind in his right eye oh have you finally found wisdom and kneeled cyric asked as the rest of roberts men died to the paladin robert struggled to his feet clutching his face with one hand go roast in the abyss he said cyric stepped closer he was smiling but there was no joy in those red irises i have i came back a bolt of shadow leapt from his palm robert blocked it with his sword only to find the power traveling up his blade and through his gloves he shrieked as the skin of his hand erupted with pain cyric grabbed him by the throat and with strength he couldnt possibly have lifted him into the air you wont die here robert said the priest i wont have a rebellion on my hands nor the king interfering so youll be a good little puppet wont you write all the right letters say all the right things fuckoff robert gasped through his crushed windpipe black electricity arced throughout his body hed have screamed if cyrics hand hadnt denied him breath the priest lowered him to his feet so they could stare eye to eye ill burn every last shred of resistance from you if i must he said his voice a cold whisper ill purify the chaos from your heart through fire through pain just like our forefathers once did do you understand me robert is that what you desire or would you rather save yourself the torment and kneel robert spat in his eye cyric wiped his face that smug smile finally gone from his lips so be it he said robert felt pain tremendous pain and then darkness they stayed at the williams home for three days letting sandra fully recover jerico repaid their kindness as best he could by working in their fields truth be told he enjoyed the simple work knowing that in planting a few seeds and yanking out some weeds he wasnt making a mistake he had no decisions to make no lives to endanger by the third night sandra could walk without a limp and shed clearly grown restless remaining indoors the air was fairly warm and jerico sat with her on their porch looking at the stars feel like im constantly in the way sandra said leaning her head back and sighing theyre good people but ill be happy to leave jerico chuckled well that answers the question i was going to ask she glanced his way raised an eyebrow which was what if i wanted to stay with them jerico shrugged its a good life calm even if it is a bit meager cobb says he could find you a husband without too much trouble the way her eyes bugged out jerico realized hed made a mistake though hed be damned to know what it was is that what you think i want you wanted a life away from your brother well this is one and cobb has offered sandra crossed her arms and sighed youre ready to leave arent you jerico stared at the sky instead of meeting her gaze only a few clouds dotted the horizon and they made the expanse of stars look that much larger i must arthur needs my help do you want me to come with you jerico knew he could not lie but what was he to say when the answer was both yes and no part of me does he said but what i doand with the dark paladins hunting meyoull never be safe sandra not ever im not sure youre ready for that life and i know for certain you dont deserve it they fell silent inwardly jerico berated himself for broaching the subject so poorly you said part of you sandra said breaking the silence that means part of you wants me with you why jerico ran a hand through his hair battling wolves and dark paladins was easier and made more sense i enjoy your company he said i feel happier around you i barely know you jerico what we haveim not sure its what you think it is jerico shifted feeling increasingly uncomfortable then consider me a dreamer as well as someone willing to find out but i cant see you hurt again ive lost nearly everyone dear to me my friends my teachers theyre all gone even darius rushes to his death at the towers i cant go back to durham the closest place ive had to a homefor fear of karaks paladins finding me there ill forever be on the run forever alone except for you and because of me you nearly died so for fear of losing meyoud rather give me up willingly to a plain life and then never see me again he shot her a look you make it sound so stupid maybe because it is he laughed then im getting good at doing stupid things perhaps thats why ive survived where others have fallen its always the idiot that lasts the longest sandra shifted over so their legs touched then wrapped her arm around him and laid her head against his shoulder youre not an idiot sure about that she kissed his cheek absolutely so what do we do now he gestured northwest assuming the situation remains unchanged arthurs still besieged at the castle of caves other than myself and your brother no one is coming to help him do you think you can really accomplish anything on your own jerico no he said smiling at her in fact i expect to do little more than die while trying to get inside then why do we go because i should because i think thats where ashhur wants me to go and because i cant let what happened to stonahm go unpunished not after what they did to beth she ran a hand lovingly across his face her touch like lightning well she said its a fools errand then good thing thats what you do best youre the one traveling with a fool what does that make you she kissed his lips figure it out she said before going inside d arius was torn between apprehension and relief when he finally reached the gihon river his journey was almost over and he would obtain an answer to his dilemma either theyd rescind the bounty or remove his head obviously darius preferred one over the other but he had no intention of spending the rest of his life as an outlaw if they decided to kill him then so be it theyd only perform the execution jerico had stayed he set up camp by the riverside night fell as darius waited for a boat patrol to pass when the stars reached their fullest he felt an itch in the back of his mind he shifted and pointed his sword toward the tree line valessa stepped out the smile on her face doing nothing to diminish the madness in her eyes where is it you go she asked as she paced before him darius kept ready in case she attacked a shiver ran through him as she passed through the trees he was haunted by a phantom but her daggers were so very real if i tell you itd ruin the surprise you know youll make a mistake eventually ashhur cannot protect you forever the paladin shrugged doing fine so far course im not eager to wait forever strike at me valessa lets have another go or would you rather skulk and hide until i die with gray hair on my head what will you then tell karak when you return to the fires of the abyss that you thought your revenge best served when i was so feeble i couldnt lift my sword at least you sent grick to your god im sure hell be a very impressive sacrifice darius thought hed finally goaded her into another fight but then he heard the sound of men from the water glancing back he saw torches burning in the hands of four men theyd seen the light of his campfire so far from civilization and were crying out in greeting you wont be safe with them she said as the boat drifted closer to shore theyll put you in chains without that damn sword of yours then ill have all the time in the world darius all the time i need to make you suffer for what youve done to me she fled back into the darkness of the forest you flung yourself against my blade he said sighing you not me he walked to the waters edge and waved to the four men well met he said his voice carrying i hoped i might come across one of your boats which tower do you hail from tower silver said the leader of the four extending his torch so its light reached darius tower silver was the closest tower to the blood tower which meant darius would not have to travel far for his meeting with sir robert he wasnt sure if this made him happier or more nervous as the light shone upon him the four men suddenly tensed i see you are a paladin said the leader but of what god things have not gone kindly between us and karak lately ashhur darius said wondering what business with karak they referred to he took a deep breath pushing that aside in his mind this was it but i have not always been my name is darius and i once hailed from the stronghold silence filled the air broken at last when one of the four looked to the others and muttered oh shit i did not come here to fight he said jamming his sword into the soft earth before him only to speak with sir robert godley so that i might tell my story and have him remove the bounty placed upon my life begging your pardon darius said their leader but there is no bounty for your life not anymore its only for your capture not execution robert changed it a few weeks back darius grunted well that was a pleasant surprise though he dared not let himself feel hopeful if it was still for capture that meant they wanted to interrogate him or even worse send him to the stronghold their torture rooms were the last place he wanted to be well said darius consider me captured the boat beached before him and he offered his sword the men held their weapons drawn and they looked at one another climb on board said the leader as he accepted the blade but dont get too eager about talking to robert just yet a lots happened at the blood tower and i think it best daniel be the one to explain it darius stepped into the boat and he accepted a seat at its center they pushed off and one by one the men sheathed their weapons with poles and paddles they traveled upriver toward the tower darius looked back many times always for a glimpse of valessa he saw her once standing at the water watching then no more hours later they reached the tower once it might have been impressive a great cylinder overlooking the savage lands beyond the river but now he saw the disrepair the moss growing on the stone and the cracks across its foundations windows that might have given killing room to archers were instead boarded up to hold in heat for the winter of all the towers it was the only one built across the gihon within the vile wedge this had been when their cavalry numbered in the hundreds and their lightning rides across the wedge had been legendary now darius hardly saw a single horse time hasnt been kind to the silver darius remarked aint nothing the wilderness is kind to said a soldier least of all those trying to keep order two men at the docks threw them ropes once they were looped about the boats front they pulled them in darius was led out first whos he asked one of the men on the dock a guest said the patrol leader wheres daniel the soldier jerked a thumb behind him to the tower hes asleep in his room where else would he be then go wake him and dont ask me why or how important it is thats an order now go the leader turned back to darius we have a small dungeon fit for only a man or two i plan on taking you there where no one else but daniel will know youve arrived will you come peacefully darius chuckled lead on just take care of my sword will you at the western side of the tower dug into the earth like a cellar was their dungeon darius stepped inside as the soldier locked him in the only light came between the bars of the slender window in the door the walls were cold stone and he could touch every side from where he stood in the center man or two no kidding he shuddered to think of sharing such a small space with another of course such tight walls meant little to valessa without his sword he had nothing to fend her off no light to burn her shadowed flesh he could only hope and pray she did not show until after his business with daniel was done time wore on and though the night was deep darius had no desire to sleep at last he heard a commotion on the other side of the door and then it opened holding his hand to block the torchlight hurting his eyes darius smiled and stood welcome to my humble abode he said bowing im darius who once hailed from the stronghold where do you hail from now asked the man he was slender but carried the scars of battle and his eyes sparkled with wary intelligence if the citadel still stood it might be from there darius said but for now i guess i am without home or country the man leaned against the door and crossed his arms im daniel coldmine lieutenant for sir robert godley do you remember me darius darius lowered his hand his eyes finally adjusting he better saw daniels face and then nodded you helped us fight the wolfmen at durham i did robert and i pushed our men night and day to reach you in time to save the life of that little town yet all thats left now is ruin and graves tell me why darius why would you turn on those you once protected darius saw that daniel held a knife barely concealed between his arms this was it darius realized no court no appearance before robert looking into daniels eyes he knew the man could not care less for the bounty either he gave daniel a worthy answer or kissed his life goodbye i was a fool darius said softly i was desperate and afraid i feared i had lived my entire life as a lie to karak and then a prophet came to me offering proof offering meaning he brought me back to durham and demanded they kneel in faith to karak or perish i was to execute all who refused daniel shifted his arms the blade glinted in the torchlight did you darius rubbed at his eyes as the horrible memories came back no he said i could not i dont know who lived who died but ask them if you must ask jeremy hangfield ask jacob wheatley i begged them to run the prophet would return and i couldnt stop him at the time i thought no one could he shook his head i see the anger in your eyes and i will not deny it please before you act tell me how many survived let me go to eternity be it fire or gold knowing at least that daniel remained silent for a very long time little over a hundred he said at last and theyve told me same as you that you begged them to run that doesnt make you innocent darius a boy who sets a house aflame then yells for those inside to flee the fire still deserves his lashes he moved to close the door then stopped that prophet he asked did anyone ever stop him i did darius said he knew he should feel proud but strangely did not i cut off his damn head again daniel fell silent he was working something out darius could tell but what things have changed since the battle at the green gulch daniel said leaning against the door two priests of karak arrived at the blood tower demanding that we hand you over to them they want the north to worship their god forever one of them a pissant named cyric led a revolt against us he sacrificed his own men to bring about strange creatures made of fire and hurled arrows of shadow from his palms few of us escaped and i dont know the fate of those we left behind daniel struck the door with his fist you say you killed this prophet he said the one who many of durham said wielded killing flame with his hands and whose eyes shone red like the abyss can you kill cyric release me and i will try my best to end his threat i dont need you to try i need a fucking promise will you help me reclaim my tower save robert and send that priest to the grave where he belongs darius fell to one knee and bowed his head for what i have done ive only begun to atone for if cyric wishes to continue what the prophet started then ill deliver him the same fate you have no reason to fear my blade daniel karak is my god no longer thatll do ive set up a second room for you which should be far more accommodating than this my guard will show you the way sleep well we have much to discuss come morning if were to retake the tower they left the farm the williams refusing to accept any coin jerico offered them youve helped enough cobb said you worked the fields and told my boys stories of lands theyll never ever see i just hope you think on what i told you no reason for you to get yourself killed for any man other than yourself my lifes not worth much jerico said in return not much need to be protective of it now safe days farmer you too paladin they traveled northwest following the road cobb had assured him it would lead to the castle of caves so long as he took every northern fork on his back jerico carried an impressive collection of provisions and sandra had a bag of traveling bread as well that first night they ate until both felt ready to burst then lay down on their bedrolls they camped in the open in a field not far from the road you dont have to do this sandra said as they stared up at the stars you dont owe beth nor my brother we all owe you if anything trying to convince me to turn tail sandra trying to convince you to live surely you have something better to do with your life someone better to spend it with jerico looked away not wanting her to see the confusion and doubt on his face its what i must do he whispered why because if i run now if i try to save myself instead of helping those who need it then what was the point of me surviving when all others have fallen he felt her hand brush against his arm his entire body stiffened i can think of several reasons jerico rolled over to face her and he took her hands in his you wont change my mind sandra the closer you get to me the more likely youll be hurt i have no home no place i will ever be safe ii dont think stop thinking she whispered as she slipped into his bedroll for tonight at least she stopped his next sentence with a kiss and despite his greater strength she held his arms down with little difficulty i just dont want you hurt he said as she removed her clothes shut up jerico i know but shut up jerico his clothes were next and he helped her even as he protested im just worried that she kissed him then held her hand over his mouth gods youre impossible she said then laughed despite herself after her wounding her many days of sickness he could not resist the warmth of her body against his she felt so vibrant so alive her hair hung low across her face lit by the moonlight as she hovered above him seeing her smile her happiness he gave in at last c ome the next day they traveled with a much brighter spring in their step for once jerico did not dwell on the fight that awaited him and sandra was in her best health since leaving her brothers camp it seemed even the weather matched their brightness they passed several couples and a large family of twelve heading toward the nearby villages to ply their trade one couple sought a suitor for their daughter another hoped his skills as a smith might be rewarded for a few weeks before moving on to the next town jerico wished them well and prayed with those who were glad to see a man of ashhur weather is fine jerico said on their fourth day makes it almost possible to forget that every paladin and priest of karak is trying to kill me theyre who knows where and were here sandra said try not to worry easier said than done its my head they want on a pike not yours id join you on a pike anyway you think id let them take you without a fight jerico laughed indeed and would you stop them im kaide goldflints sister damn right i would the paladin looked her up and down while they walked with what she smirked at him i keep a dagger on me at all times jerico well perhaps not at all times he blushed and she mocked him for it from behind they heard a distant shouting of orders jerico glanced back saw a wagon train about a quarter of a mile behind caravan heading toward the castle he wondered sebastian would never let them through the siege lines said sandra perhaps supplies for sebastians own men instead jerico stopped so he could see better the dirt path was mostly flat with but the slightest of bumps from the gently rolling hills they traveled across he saw groups of armed men but their banners were of no mercenary troop he recognized reinforcements for sebastians army sandra asked jerico i think we should get off the road jerico nodded starting to think she was right but the banners they almost looked like lions oh no jerico muttered this is bad he looked about seeing nothing but fields of grass in all directions very bad what sandra asked theyre pledged to karak which means theyll likely have priests or paladins with them all around were the flat fields of tall grass they could hide within them but if jerico could see the caravan then the caravan could see him what would they think of the couple who suddenly rushed off the road to hide and what if they recognized his armor realized he was a paladin of ashhur if only there was a hill a group of trees that they could vanish behind to hide the direction in which they fled not good not good not good jerico muttered as his mind raced have you no ideas sandra asked as she took his hand none then well do mine walk into the field slowly as if nothing were the matter what plan is this jerico asked sandra led the way pulling him along behind them the wagons rolled closer why else would a man and woman wander off a path for a moment alone fifty yards out from the road she turned so his back was to the road and she could peer over his shoulder almost she said then grabbed his face in her hands and kissed jerico was too stunned to kiss back when the kiss ended she pulled him down into the grass where they would not be seen will they believe it jerico asked as he huddled on his knees i dont know youre a terrible troubadour im no good at lying nor playing pretend a shame despite their situation she laughed and he blushed again are you so certain they are a danger sandra asked she also crouched on her knees ready to run at a moments notice jerico wanted to look but dared not for fear of revealing their farce for what it was i know of no one else who might carry such a banner he said what will you do if they come for us jerico pulled free his mace ill do what is necessary if they do come to inspect you run like the wind understand worry about yourself sandra crept higher peering through the slender stalks of grass whatever she saw startled her and she ducked back down and spoke in a whisper two men theyre almost here are they armed jerico asked yes but they havent drawn their blades yet they might have seen my armor jerico whispered get ready to run sandra looked again then shook her head jerico she said dont judge me for this his brow furrowed as he wondered what she meant and then she began to moan it started low at first and quiet but steadily grew louder jerico felt his neck flush and his jaw dropped open her eyes were closed and her face looked like she was in the midst of deep contemplation but it did not match the noises coming from her mouth shaking away his shock jerico peered through the grass two soldiers were near both with the symbol of a lion painted across their breastplates amused grins decorated their faces they were talking and jerico did his best to ignore sandras performance in order to listen sounds like hes giving her a solid go said the one on the right care to give em a startle go ahead if you want but i wont interrupting a kings knight while hes fucking is a good way to get yourself stabbed i aint scared of any knight said the man on the left then go on if youre so desperate to spy a tit or is it the mans dick youre after they struck one another with their fists then returned to the road glancing behind only once sandra quieted then stopped when jerico motioned they were gone are we safe she asked seems like it jerico said making sure one more time when he knelt back down sandra caught him giving her a funny look what she asked nothing no what he shrugged some of that sounded familiar thats all she punched him across the jaw it bruised his lip but he didnt complain he definitely deserved it once the wagons were far enough ahead jerico and sandra emerged from the grass feeling safer jerico counted their numbers and didnt like the estimate he came up with at least four hundred if not more given where they were and the direction they were headed there could only be one place they traveled theyre going to the castle of caves jerico said if they join sebastians army then arthur will have no chance sandra said and kaidehell still try to stop them my brother is too stubborn to know reason whatever hope arthur has is done no jerico said shaking his head dont think like that it isnt hopeless not yet we dont know the situation there perhaps a minor lord threw his lot in with arthur your brothers band might already be on its way ruining their supply lines and poisoning their water we might not stop them but at least we can try to stall how jerico gave her a mischievous grin wagons are such fragile things they stayed far back out of sight until nightfall when the caravan set up camp as the stars came out jerico and sandra made up the lost distance until at last they crouched at the far edges of the campfire light whoever ran the wagons showed no fear of bandits or marauders instead of circling them into a protective barrier they remained set in the middle of the road still in line the oxen pulling them had been tethered in the fields downwind from the camp sandra pointed to them but jerico shook his head perhaps after he whispered theyre tired and might not scatter plus i fear the noise noise asked sandra for men of faith they seem to share all the same noisy vices jerico shrugged while there were no camp followers it appeared every other vice was welcome in the camp the men drank sang and made a bawdy ruckus many brawled amongst themselves using only their fists and others gambled on the winners jerico saw no sign of priests or paladins and assumed them to be in the larger tents erected near the front of the wagon train fine after im done well go for the oxen but i want to hit the wagons first if i do this right they wont notice a thing until morning jerico removed his armor and the underpadding he needed speed and stealth not to rattle like a tin spatula in a kettlepot even his shield he left behind bringing only his mace buckled at his waistjust to aid his sabotage of course he had no intention of fighting if he could help it stay beyond the fires jerico said as he placed the last of his armor in a pile along with much of their supplies follow me from wagon to wagon as best you can if im spotted you need to know immediately and then run like karak himself is at your heels id rather you not get caught at all she said kissing him on the cheek for good luck but ill keep an eye out on you just the same swallowing his fear jerico approached the camp always watchful for a patrol the tall grass helped immensely but the wagons were on the bare dirt road getting to them would be no easy task he chose the one on the tail end first crawling between two campfires the soldiers had built in the grass they joked amongst themselves as they drank talking of the many heathens theyd kill upon reaching arthurs castle well see about that thought jerico as he reached the edge of the grass to the far left and right he saw campfires but no one patrolled the area too much arrogance jerico decided with a smile of course who would rob or attack a patrol of armed men sworn to karak no one sane but darius had always insisted jerico had a bit of madness in him or was it stupidity either way the path was clear and jerico ran with his body crouched as low as possible while still maintaining speed upon reaching the wagon he rolled underneath and then paused holding his breath for a long ten seconds while his heart hammered in his ears no calls no nearby footsteps he let out his breath then went to work the dirty base of the wagon was inches above him but the tight space was no bother at the rear of the wagon he stopped and unclipped his mace the cramped environment would limit his strength but he prayed to ashhur that it would be enough both hands grabbing the handle he swung for the rear axle his mace sank in with a heavy thunk and a long crack ran along the wood jerico pulled it free then waited the wagon would muffle much of the noise and the merriment would obscure it further once confident no one had heard he struck again the crack spread further all night thought jerico ive got all night if that is what it takes he waited another minute then struck again this time the wood split and the entire wagon groaned above him jerico waited a good five minutes before moving then slid toward the front axle to do the same they would have spares he knew but how many if he hit every single wagon replacing all the broken axles would take a long time longer if they ran out of spares without their food and supplies the army would go nowhere for all jerico knew that several day delay could make the difference at the siege further north the second axle taken care of he rolled onto his stomach and then judged the gap between him and the next wagon it too appeared unguarded though there was a campfire about ten yards to the west that might overhear his sabotage glancing the other way he looked for sandra to see if she watched the grass was thick so he could only hope praying to ashhur for safety he crawled out and then sprinted for the next wagon he nearly slid underneath then realized the scraping dirt and gravel might alert the nearby men calmly he dropped to his side and rolled the men at the nearby camp it turned out were gloriously drunk jerico sighed with relief there were twelve of them and they were taking turns armwrestling with their elbows atop a log from his low vantage point jerico watched timing his strikes against the wagon with the start and end of every new competition when the cheering was at its loudest the rear axle broke with ease appearing to have been well on its way toward doing so without his help the front one took longer but ten minutes later hed made a long enough crack that he trusted would break after a day or two of rough travel reaching the third wagon looked to be far more difficult this one had soldiers patrolling the area looking bored and unhappy to be saddled with such duty while the rest drank and gambled the night away a soldier watched each side and a third circled peering inside the wagon every other time watching for thieves of course but jerico had no interest in swiping supplies the men at the sides were just beyond the road standing amid the grass they feared an outside threat not one from within hopefully the distance would be enough after the circling guard vanished around the wagon jerico crawled out and ran his back ached and a spasm struck his side halfway there because of his low crouch clenching his teeth he stumbled the last few steps no time to be graceful he fell to his stomach and crawled he heard rocks scatter and dirt kick out from below him but did the guards hear it too holding his breath he listened and waited a pair of boots walked along then stopped at the rear of the wagon jerico slowly pulled his knees to his chest for his feet were in danger of poking out below he needed to get further underneath but dared not move any more than he must the boots shifted and he wondered what the soldier could be doing move on already jerico silently begged and then the guard knelt on one knee and peered underneath the wagon his eyes must not have been fully adjusted to the darkness for it took a full two seconds before he realized jerico was there the look on the soldiers face might have been amusing if not for jerico knowing his chances of survival had just dropped to nil what the jericos heel smashed the soldier in the face crushing his nose he fell backwards screaming through his hands as he tried to stem the blood jerico rolled out the side toward the field where sandra hid and lurched to his feet the man standing guard on that side turned and jerico took him down with a mace blow to the head what little surprise he had though was spent by then two groups of men stood from their campfires and reached for their weapons speed was all jerico could rely on now he knew he could run for hours if need be and ashhur could grant him the strength to continue but that involved getting out men rushed into his way from all sides jerico ducked underneath a swing rammed his shoulder into a guard to send him to the ground then continued on another man raced along then dove at his legs jerico leapt over him wishing he could have turned around and kicked him for such stupidity two more soldiers had an angle on him from the right he pumped his legs harder and shifted his direction if he could only gain a bit more distance get beyond the light of the campfires the men were fast though and their swords were long jerico parried the first swing but when the other thrust he had to fling himself to the left his momentum sent him rolling to the ground unable to keep his balance the tall grass helped cushion the landing but nothing cushioned the rock that cracked against his forehead he tried to stand but his stomach heaved and his vision tripled and spun the two men stood over him and when he took a swing they blocked it with ease still dumb enough to fight asked the one on the left jerico closed his eyes opened them just in time to see a boot it connected with his cheek jarring his head hard to the side spitting blood jerico again pushed to his feet he would not die without a fight one of the men grabbed his wrist preventing a swing of his mace and then the other held him by the throat choking him jerico kneed him in the groin and gasped in air as the mans hand released damn fool said the other striking jerico across the head with the hilt of his sword jerico dropped to his knees and he wished more than anything to have his shield in hand but he had no armor no shield and then the tip of a blade pressed against his throat stand up and die like a man said the soldier jerico had no time to obey the soldier jerked forward and the sword fell limply from his hand sandra shoved him aside a bloody dagger in her hand before the other man could recover she cut his throat as well sandra jerico murmured as warm blood ran down the side of his face he wanted to go to her but the rest of the camp was upon them sandra swung her dagger at one but her target parried it aside then returned the favor with the flat of his blade against her face another struck her from behind knocking her to the ground beside jerico you were supposed to run jerico told her as his hands were bound behind him with thick rope his voice sounded drunk in his ears youll forgive me sandra said her own hands bound the same quiet both of you said an older man who appeared to be in charge of the soldiers or youll what jerico asked giving him a halfcocked grin in answer the man struck him with his gauntlet hard enough to rattle his teeth fair enough thought jerico as his consciousness faded darius saw more familiar faces than he expected when he joined the meeting in daniel coldmines room two chairs had been pushed together to form a table a crinkled map unfurled across it and held down with rocks daniel stood over it arms crossed and looking miserable beside him was the young but sharpwitted soldier gregory darius and gregory had met in durham guarding what few survivors remained in the ruins of a mansion together theyd held a doorway until sir robert arrived with reinforcements chasing away the last of the wolfmen attackers darius had nodded in greeting but gregory gave him the cold shoulder it seemed he was not yet willing to forgive him for his part in velixars attack on the town in the corner making up the last of the group was an older man his face covered with a wispy gray beard his eyes were hard and he still bore enough muscle to show how dangerous he might have been in his youth his name was porter grayson and daniel introduced him as the man in charge of tower silver together the four planned the assault against the blood tower how many does that bastard have fighting for him asked porter leaning against the wall of the cramped room luther left him with fifty of their personal guard answered daniel i dont know how many we killed during our retreat but theres also another seventy of our own men that joined his betrayal surely they wont fight against you darius said not after killing robert roberts not dead gregory said he pointed toward daniels bed where several letters lay in a pile cyrics been sending orders down the gihon claiming hes merely advising robert every letter bears roberts signature and i dont believe it a forgery either cyric is keeping him alive using him to prevent the king from interfering if were to have any help from the capital we need to rescue him darius shook his head and looked at the parchment on the chairs it was an excellent replica of the blood tower drawn that morning by gregory the defenses were simple but effective an outer wall surrounded the tower thrice the height of any man within that was the tower itself and in between nothing but flat killing ground on the opposite side of the river was a single entrance through the wall its doors made of thick wood and reinforced with steel the only other entrance was the river itself a hundred men could easily hold the fortifications against a far larger group than what he and daniel had we dont have the supplies for a lengthy siege daniel said shaking his head and i helped build those doors we dont have the time to build a sufficient battering ram nor enough men to endure the archers as we try to pound through right now theres only a hundred or so and we need to retake it before reinforcements arrive are you sure they will asked porter what if the priests in mordeina deny any involvement for fear of angering king baedan theyll still send men even while they deny it darius said staring at the map as if he could bore a solution out of it with his eyes the priests always protect their own daniels right we have to retake it now before any more of karaks followers arrive if we cant retake the walls why not go around them gregory asked he tapped where the outer wall met the river if all our boats beach at once we might overwhelm them how many men are at your disposal asked darius weve got soldiers coming from the nearby towers and if we leave a skeleton crew in the rest that gives us about two hundred im not sure it is enough two hundred against one darius shrugged if we can get them on anything like open ground how could we not win the lions daniel said you didnt see them they tore through our ranks like we were children robert shot them with a hundred arrows from his tower and not one pierced their skin we try to push in with brute force theyll eat us alive no exaggeration there either gregory added darius frowned and thought of his teachings at the stronghold hed heard the occasional story of a priest summoning lions of the abyss but always it had been in the earliest days of history during the anarchy that had followed the gods war no mortal blade was supposed to be able to kill them no mere human fast or strong enough to defeat them if even a third of the stories were true two beasts guarding the river would be difficult to overcome and what did it mean that cyric could summon them how great was the power given to him by karak what keeps men from walking into the river and around the wall he asked pointing to the same spot on the diagram as gregory that wall goes out deep into the river daniel said we rake the bottom every year and add rocks when needed anyone trying to wade through will be in over their head and risk drowning even if they make it around theyd still be easy pickings for archers when they try to reach the shore again it looks like boats are the best way darius said you didnt see what i saw darius daniel insisted that priest wielded fire and lightning in his hands like it was nothing if they spot us coming and they will then what happens if he destroys our boats before we ever reach them and thats ignoring the regular arrows the men on the walls will bury us with on the passage over i wont have my retaking of the blood tower end with half my men drowning and the other half eaten by lions you three are too focused on the tower porter said turning and spitting out the window remember the man who rules it what does cyric hope to achieve whats he gain by owning some boats and a wall that guards nothing but empty fields and farmland gregory and daniel looked to each other and they both shrugged he spoke of the old ways gregory said im not sure what else or what that even means we were both preparing for battle when he performed his ritual that brought about the lions he turned his attention to darius do you know what he means by the old ways darius rubbed his forehead with his fingers and tried to remember study of such things is generally left to the priests he reminded them our lectures on the faith were more practical and devoted to winning over the hearts of the people but ive heard enough stories that i think i know what he means theres a lot of old practices that the priests have deemedno longer relevant too violent really they lasted as long as they did because the kings had not yet solidified their power over dezrel what type of practices are we talking about gregory asked darius shrugged ritual execution of murderers and thieves punishment of those who speak out against karak conversion by the sword that sort of thing shit all eyes turned to daniel who stood with his fists clenched the people of durham he said cyric wished to meet with them he insisted he only meant to talk but he was damn persistent he must want to get back at them for taking witness against the prophet of karak who attacked their village gregorys face paled and darius didnt like the way the menatarms looked at one another where are the survivors of durham he asked dreading the answer robert gave them land a few miles east of the tower daniel said theres a town there willshire we thought it best the people go there until we could be certain of durhams safety dariuss blood ran cold someone will talk he said one of the converted soldiers or maybe even robert himself and when he finds them the old ways the paladin kept thinking as the others stared him something nagged at the edge of his consciousness some tiny detail what would cyric do when he found them make them kneel or be put to the sword sacrifice them if he was so smitten with the old ways wanted them resurrected a calendar darius said startling them do any of you have a lunar calendar they looked at him as if he were crazy of course not daniel said were lucky enough to have food to feed our men i have the blood of farmers in me paladin porter said what is it you wish to know the blood moon darius said feeling feverish it happens once every four years do you know of it aye i do porter said its said to never lay with your lady on that night for nothing good ever comes of a child conceived during the blood moon it is this year isnt it how long until then porter scratched at his beard five days i believe then thats how much time we have darius said turning his attention back to the diagram of the tower even now karaks paladins will sacrifice a man guilty of murder at the steps of the stronghold that is how sacred the blood moon is to ourtheir god if cyric wishes to return to the old ways i can only imagine the tribute he has devised for that night im not sure i want to imagine it gregory said what do we do how do we stop him well darius said nodding toward porter now we know the man and i do know him or at least men like him young stubborn seeing history through diamond eyes yet seeing the lives of those around them through mud and contempt karaks gift of the lions will only increase his pride his certainty of his ways if he succeeds hell move on slowly increasing his numbers hell bring the old ways of faith to the north until someone stops him no one will daniel said his whole body trembled with rage at the thought arthur and sebastian are too busy killing each other to pay attention to the lands theyre sworn to protect then that leaves us darius said the tower might cause us problems but we know where cyric will be five days from now dont we we do porter said pushing off the wall and slowly walking over to the diagram and that means a far smaller guard at the tower too ive learned a few tricks in my time and my gut says if were to save roberts life well do it quick do it quiet and most importantly do it my way and what way is that darius asked him the old man grinned the least honorable way possible so long as it works j erico knew hed only been out a moment or two given that they were still dragging him toward the tents and wagons a man held each arm hoisting him from his armpits his toes dragged across the ground morning he told them still feeling groggy they ignored his remark jerico wondered why they didnt make him walk on his own then realized his ankles were also bound with rope not much likelihood for escape he looked to either side but the soldiers holding him blocked his view where was sandra he thought to call out to her but worried the guards might strike him again his head already felt like it had split in half adding another few bruises sounded like a terrible idea but he called out for her anyway since when did he let a little unconsciousness get in his way you still alive sandra he asked sure enough they beat him but he heard a muffled yes to his right and he smiled through the pain they took him to the blank space between the third and fourth wagon then looped another rope through his bindings and tied it to a wheel the soldiers guarding sandra placed her opposite him and bound her to the fourth wagon this one by the gate across the back a man slapped her face after she was tied and she spat at him in return jerico saw the fear in her eyes lurking behind the defiance and tried to comfort her best he could such kind hosts he said smiling at her knowing with his bleeding lip and bruised face he must have looked a wreck whyd you stay she smiled back and her lips trembled i didnt want to be alone the revelry resumed about them with even greater cheer theyd caught a paladin of ashhur perhaps the last of their kind seemed a rather pathetic end to his order hed rather have gone out in a blaze of glory slaughtering paladins of karak by the dozens while the common folk cheered his name dying without his armor in empty wilderness after failing his heroic task of breaking a few wagons felt a little too far from that for his tastes not that he had a choice in the matter jerico leaned against the wagon and closed his eyes good thing theres room for failures in the golden eternity he muttered to himself will they kill us sandra asked having heard him jerico started to answer when a dark paladin arrived his weapon remained sheathed but jerico could see his desire to draw it i thought we would have to scour all the dark corners of the world to find the last of your cowardly kind he said to think you came to us instead hate to be an inconvenience the paladin smirked then turned his attention to sandra he released her from the wagon then dragged her to her feet luther will speak with you once he is done said the dark paladin well see if your tongue is still so glib then sandra remained proud and said nothing even though she was clearly frightened jerico wanted to comfort her to prevent anything from harming her but his arms were bound and he had nothing but words we are here only a little while he told her as the paladin cut the cords about her ankles so she could walk close your eyes and pray the pain will pass i promise itll pass the dark paladin struck jerico across the face then grabbed sandras arm save your words for when you have something useful to say he said to jerico then led sandra away jerico spat a glob of blood leaned back against the wagon and looked up at the stars i messed up didnt i he asked them he didnt need ashhurs voice in his ears to know the answer to that one time crawled on and he prayed that sandra escaped torture and pain shed killed two of their soldiers though and traveled at his side whatever fate awaited her he did not trust it to be kind when she returned he sighed with relief he saw no marks across her hands or face and no blood on her clothes other than from the men she had killed death might await her still but at least she was not yet tortured on your feet paladin said the man escorting her luther would speak with you and if you have any sense youll treat him with respect jerico shifted onto his heels then pushed himself to a stand the dark paladin cut his ankles free then led him to a large tent at the front of the caravan luther sat atop several cushions in the center a small meal lay beside him on a plate hello jerico luther said smiling as the dark paladin cut the ropes around jericos wrists yes i know your name for sandra has told me much would you care for something to eat not much in the mood for poisons he said id ask if you truly thought i would stoop so low as to poison my own prisoner said luther setting aside the plate but then again i am the vile evil servant of karak i sacrifice infants and have sex with the dead is that not what youve been told your whole life jerico shrugged everything but the sex common knowledge at the citadel was that all your priests have their testicles removed the first time they say an ill word about karak luther dismissed the dark paladin and then gestured for jerico to have a seat indeed and at the stronghold the dark paladins talk often of the games your elders play with the orphans taken under their wing but surely you can understand the lack of truth in these insults the childish desire to turn a man with an opposing view into an inhuman enemy jerico sat trying to keep his guard up it felt odd having a priest of karak treat him sohumanely youre unlike most priests i have met jerico said and i think i will accept that plate luther handed it over on it was a potato already chopped into pieces and smothered with butter along with a small assortment of boiled vegetables no knife jerico asked try not to insult my intelligence paladin our meeting will progress better that way had to ask he popped a piece of potato in his mouth licked the butter off his fingers and then closed his eyes it tasted so good his hunger awoke with a fury you say i am unlike the priests you have known luther said as jerico wolfed down the food but how many is that jerico paused a moment to think the only priest of karak he had actually known for however brief a time was pheus just one he said i know thats not a lot but to be fair he did try to kill me one man yet you judge hundreds by him that is your way i suppose but yes there is a large portion of my sect that wishes nothing more than to eliminate your kind i feel it largely unnecessary for we were already taking the hearts and minds of dezrel away from you sadly i am in the minority youre not helping your argument much jerico said finishing the plate luther gave him a patronizing smile perhaps but i say this so you know i do not lie nor try to hide the failings of my order the north is ours now jerico and i will do everything in my power to keep it so lord sebastian will prevail over lord arthur you know this as well as i your presence here is simplyirrelevant then why capture me jerico asked why speak to me instead of putting a blade through my brain luther leaned closer his hands together as if he were to pray because i am one who lives by what he believes did i not just say i thought our hunting of you unnecessary i have no desire to create martyrs jerico it is a funny thing trying to eliminate any people or race no matter how weak as a whole they are the strong will emerge there comes the rare survivor who cannot stop even unto death and he is the most dangerous men who might have accomplished nothing in life are suddenly declared precious and heroic in death i have no desire to kill you nor do i fear for myself if i let you live perhaps youre right jerico said the tent suddenly feeling far colder but how do you know im not the strong that endures the rare survivor who cannot stop even unto death because my friends often tell me how stubborn i am luther shook his head just a little jerico sensed the mockery in it the superiority to the priest jerico was a child foolish and rash nothing more i think you just might be jerico but i also know i captured you with hardly a thought and only a few casualties to my men if you are the greatest threat ashhur poses to us then our war is already won like i said jericoyou are irrelevant you can stop nothing destroy nothing you hold faith in a dead god and that faith blinds you to what this world has become he stood and jerico did the same and what is that he asked what has this world become ours guards stepped in and took jerico by the arm stay away from arthur hemman luther said go anywhere else and try in vain to find meaning in the last years of your life the damage youve done to our wagons will delay us for a few days at most if you interfere again i will not be so kind as i am tonight a priest of karak threatening to kill me asked jerico will wonders never cease take him to the road luther told the guards kill him if he tries to return wait jerico said pushing against the guards as they tried to remove him from the tent what about sandra luther lifted an eyebrow she stays with us i know her full name jerico who she is kaide goldflint is the last player in this farce and with his sisters life on the line it should be easy to manipulate him as i so desire if you lay a finger on her ill youll what asked luther tilting his head to one side the corner of jericos mouth twitched into a dangerous smile ill be far less kind than tonight jerico flung aside the guards sliding free of their grasps with ease his fists struck one in the jaw the other in the kidney as they staggered back jerico turned to the priest lunging with all his speed it was not enough luther outstretched his fingers dark lightning shot from them spiking through jericos nerves his body arched his jaw clenched tight and every muscle stretched to its limit when the power faded he dropped to his knees completely exhausted get rid of him luther said to his guards and jerico should i see you again even hear rumors of your approach i will sacrifice that whore to karak shell die naked alone and screaming in pain think on that the next time you would play the hero more lightning arced across his body jerico endured as best he could when the guards reached underneath his arms and lifted he could not resist jerico glared at the priest and there was no amusement anymore no sarcasm ill kill you he said as he was led from the room a paladin of ashhur refusing to see reason asked luther as the tent flap closed between them will wonders never cease when darius flagged down the men in the boat valessa thought her moment of victory was finally at hand the paladin handed over his blade leaving him defenseless as he sat amid the soldiers valessa crept closer watching waiting she could pass through solid trees as if they were smoke so what protection could a boat be against her especially when she did not even need to breathe submerged beneath the waters surface the men would have no warning of her approach and then she tried to enter the river when moving when fighting valessa had to concentrate to become firm corporeal it came naturally with her feet for shed spent her whole life walking it wasnt much harder keeping her hands solid but the rest of her body was another matter wearing clothes or using her knee as a weapon was far more difficult but when her right foot dipped into the water her mind recoiled with a horrible sensation of cold emptiness the water was shifting swirling threatening to pull her away she was shadow and smoke she knew and while the wind was something she could resist the river was not pulling free she saw a shriveled stump where her leg should have been slowly feeling returned and while it hurt at least it was not as terrible as enduring ashhurs light fighting down her panic she told herself she still had all the time in the world darius would be their prisoner yet those walls would mean nothing to her racing along the waters edge she followed the boat as it traveled upstream toward one of their towers except the tower was on the wrong side they pulled their boat to shore and exited into the wedge while she remained in the opposite forest there was no bridge damn you she whispered trying to think perhaps she could not pass through water like she could wall or tree but what about atop it closing her eyes she gathered her concentration then stepped again her foot remained firm when pressed against the water which for the moment held light as air she thought i am as light as air light as a moths wing calm as a crows feather she stepped out now both feet atop the water her balance shifted and her concentration wavered no good the water was always in motion the surface never the same her ankle sank and as the water poured across her she screamed flinging herself to the shore she crawled free on her stomach she closed her eyes and waited for her body to heal again she wondered if her form were a blessing or a curse rolling onto her back she stared at the tower darius was inside she knew but how to get to him looking to the skies she saw the bright red star wafts of its light shining down on the tower yet there was something more and though she did not know why she trembled she had known its presence before just a subtle kiss in the back of her mind but now it was closer a black star shone in the sky darker than the night itself others might not see it but she could it pulsed in her mind swallowing all other light karaks presence was upon dezrel it was strong and it was near could she even go to it amid her failure when at last she could stand she knew she had no other choice it called to her even stronger than the red what is it you desire from me my god she asked who is it i am to meet that is so dear to you she ran careful not to stray too close to the water her eyes remained on the black star and she passed through tree and rock without thought her daggers itched in her hands if only she could give them blood to drink and life to take the moon dipped the sun rose yet even in the daylight the black star still shone a pockmark on the blue sky who might it be whose presence left her enslaved to its call she told herself it did not matter that she trusted karak fullybut the doubt still remained the day passed and she saw no signs of life even though she made not a sound the wild creatures sensed her approach and fled the sunlight burned but the trees were plentiful and mostly guarded her from it at last as sunset came again she reached where the black star shone down its darkness the garrison of the blood tower she thought to hide but decided it was unnecessary she could feel the presence of whomever the black star beckoned her to if he was truly so powerful she would not need to hide her allegiance assuming her normal form she approached the gate to the wall surrounding the tower it was shut and three soldiers stood above it on the wall calling for her to halt what is your name one asked and why do you come here i am to speak with he who is most faithful to karak valessa said this seemed to surprise them for no doubt it was far from the answer they expected cyric is the embodiment of karaks will here said another of the men his duties are many though and i must ask the reason you would speak with him cyricthe very name gave her chills i am valessa of the gray sisters i answer to none but the priests of karak let me through so i may speak to cyric the three debated with one another then gave her their answer wait here valessa we will find cyric and see if he will allow you to enter valessa rolled her eyes she didnt have the patience for this nonsense she walked right through the outer gate emerging on the other side as the men stared down at her their mouths agape she blew them a kiss escort me if you wish she told them but i will not be stopped one of them grabbed his bow and loosed an arrow which flew through her breast as if she were but an illusion another rushed down the steps his sword drawn growling like a feral animal she blocked the sword strike with a dagger then stepped forward and clutched the soldiers throat with her other hand i do not mean him harm she said but i will harm you if i so desire take me to cyric the soldier nodded his eyes wide with fear as you wish milady he said good she let him go and sent a glare to the man with the bow lead on they crossed the empty space to the tower then walked around it to the other side two soldiers with pikes guarded the door and they saluted at their arrival lady valessa of the gray sisters wishes a word with our master the soldier told them the guards exchanged a glance then opened the door for her valessa followed her guide inside they traversed the steps that wound along the inner walls until stopping at a room near the top the guard moved to knock but valessa pushed him aside and walked straight through the door the sight of cyric immediately sent her to her knees outwardly he was but a simple looking man wearing the garb of a priest he was only a pupil she realized given the chains he wore about his neck but her sight was not like that of mortals and as cyric turned to greet her a smile on his face she saw the ethereal fire it was a dark gray flickering violently across his clothes and skin it made no noise and gave forth no heat but the power within it would have taken her breath away if she had breath to take ii am valessa she said lowering her head she wasnt sure what else to say karak has guided me to your presence and i am but your humble servant servant asked cyric his voice was deep commanding i do not want servants i desire followers a servant obeys without thought or choice a follower obeys all the same but with a loyal heart you do not strike me as a slave gray sister i am a slave to our god she said for i would be a fool to think i could ever exist without his mercy then you are as wise as you are beautiful cyric said gesturing for her to stand as she did her body swirled with shadow and she knew he saw it his eyes widened for a moment and his smile thinned you have a gift about you valessa what is it valessa knew not how to answer so she closed her eyes and let the image of herself fade she became darkness then bowed as her skin returned along with her clothing when she looked into cyrics eyes his smile was gone i have read of your kind he said no charm remained in his voice no bemusement that is no blessing upon you how did you fail karak gray sister what is it you have done that would anger our god so greatly to hear her spoken of so poorly to hear her blessing from karak denied filled her with fear i was to kill a traitor to our order a paladin named darius she said i failed and died by his blade karak showed me mercy and gave me this form that i might bring his vengeance upon the traitor darius asked cyric howinteresting i am aware of him for his bounty was a disgrace against our faith if karak has given you a second chance at removing him then i will aid you if i can do you know where darius is now south along the river she said feeling shame at letting him slip away he was taken into the nearest tower but i could not cross the river to follow myformdoes not allow it that close then he is with daniel and the rest of roberts unfaithful lot cyric turned to the large map against a wall which showed much of the north and the many towers along the gihon river he rubbed at his smooth chin if he joins with that rabble then you will yet have your chance have patience valessa from what i have read of your curse none have ever failed karak in killing their target for now i would have you accompany me as i travel there is a village nearby and i think your talents might have use for me as you wish valessa said dipping her head the sight of that fire was so unearthly so unnatural that she wished for any chance to not look upon him he was a man most faithful to karak she knew she should feel comfortable in his presence but for some reason did not where is it we go she asked as he opened the door for her prudence kept her from mocking the unnecessary chivalrous act a small place of little importance other than who i believe hides there its called willshire and is not far exiting the tower cyric nodded to the guards but dismissed them when they tried to follow i will be safe with valessa at my side he said and i trust lilah to be close behind as well lilah valessa asked as he led her toward the gate you will see his smile only unnerved her further they crossed the compound exited the gate and then turned north waiting along the path fur bristling with embers was a creature valessa had never believed existed it was a lioness of the abyss fire burning deep within her throat her yellow eyes watching with frightening intelligence what dream is this valessa asked as cyric rubbed the creature across its back it turned and nipped at him once but he did not flinch no dream this is lilah karak sent her to me along with her brother kayne you named them i would never dishonor them so lilah is her name for she told me herself if you say so valessa said walking past the lioness who continued to watch her do you question me lilah asked her voice a deep feline growl the sound sent shivers down valessas nonexistent spine the force of it was like wind pushing against her being the lioness padded alongside her eyes never leaving hers valessas mind spun the creatures could talk ofof course not valessa stammered i onlyforgive me lilah you are truly a wondrous gift to this world the lioness growled and valessa feared she had somehow offended her further but then lilah stepped aside allowing her to pass cyrics eyes sparkled with amusement at her discomfort karak is power and fury he said these lions represent his strength and they serve me now for i am karak in this world his physical incarnation we shall bring the truth to this hollow wasteland valessa looked at him saw the fire burning hidden on his skin the black star shining down upon him and could not deny the possibility that he spoke truth could karak truly have found a way to break free of his prison and assume mortal form but why cyric why a young priest in the relatively empty north but the lion served him and lilah did not dispute his claim i will listen and learn so long as i may bring vengeance upon darius she said dipping her head in respect again that smile from cyric she tried to see wisdom in it to revel in his presence but only saw madness instead lilah we go to willshire the priest told the lioness do you know the way i have watched these lands bloom and fade over the centuries lilah said there are few corners of this dark earth that i have not looked upon yes i know the way lilah leapt ahead and cyric and valessa followed while there was no road valessa soon saw signs of wear along their path perhaps a farmer or two traveled from willshire to the tower every week just enough to beat down the grass ahead the cracks in lilahs skin burned deep like red embers every graceful step sent ripples through her muscular body valessa yearned to see the creature in combat yet feared it as well why do we go at night she asked as they passed over the gentle hills i am most comfortable at night cyric said as is lilah ashhur is slave to the sun let us find solace in the stars and moon the people of willshire will be asleep then we will wake them soon they reached worked fields in the distance she saw hints of smoke and tiny flickers of torches valessa kept silent as she wondered why they came had the village done something to earn karaks ire did they come as messengers or executioners at the edge of the village the lioness stopped cyric turned to her and he rubbed his chin as he thought i once read that the unfinished can change their appearance at will is that true unfinished thought valessa was that what she was unfinished was it because of her failed task or did the term refer to her faith her very form i can she said is my formunpleasing to you you are beautiful valessa but i do not ask for myself it is you you cloak yourself as if you were still a gray sister but you are not you have been granted a rare second chance accept it and be glad your very presence should inspire fear and awe you are not meant to hide in a crowd not anymore let the crowds bow to you i am karak come to this village let them see a mighty queen at my side valessa nodded and tried to picture herself as a queen why did cyric always make her so uncertain was it karaks presence she did not know and tried not to think on it instead thinking on how she should appear shed been in the presence of queen annabelle in mordeina once before and she thought of her regal dress her crimson cloak and the gold crown upon her head a bit garish for the wilderness but cyric demanded a queen opening her eyes she saw herself clothed in similar flowing robes and cloak turning to the priest for approval she instead saw disappointment a mortal queen he said shaking his head i ask for the bride of karak a mighty warrior for order is that how you would picture her no it wasnt valessa knew how she pictured a woman equal to her god but feared it might be blasphemous cyric demanded it of her though so she obeyed this time when she opened her eyes she wore dark platemail full of sharp edges and painted with the red lion across her chest a thin silver circlet rested upon her brow a single ruby in its center her cloak had shrunk and was now a deep violet her skin was the color of milk her eyes like sapphires she was a woman dressed for battle yet still bearing the trappings of a queen she crossed her daggers and curtseyed to cyric who to her relief was greatly pleased magnificent he said smiling right now you are but an illusion a form without substance serve me well and i will make you whole make you real do you understand me valessa never doubt never question only serve and darius his smile grew well sacrifice him together both our hands upon the dagger that pierces his heart his blood will flow and it will make you complete instead of unfinished the unspoken fact took whatever joy she might have felt at his words suddenly feeling foolish in her farcical armor protecting flesh that would not bleed she gestured to the rows of wood and straw homes full of sleeping villagers we are here and i am as you desire what are we to do bring them out from their homes the people of durham are here hiding i want to see them for myself to look upon those who would dare speak against karaks greatness they will run in fear lilah said glancing at them valessa tried not to shudder at the sound of her voice every time it startled her made her afraid let none escape said cyric but kill as few as possible i have greater plans for them than a quick death at your claws any mortal should feel blessed to suffer death by my claws lilah growled but did not object to his request cyric walked toward the village center and valessa kept at his side closing his eyes he whispered the words of a prayer then spoke aloud his voice thundered across the village magically enhanced people of willshire i am cyric the lion made flesh come to me for i await you do not run and do not be afraid those who give in to fear will die come to me for several long moments they heard little children cried from several of the scattered homes waking frightened at the sound of the priests voice valessa watched waited trying to harden her heart against their fear the faithful should show no fear in the presence of karak was not that what shed always been taught then why did she feel fear when lilah looked upon her as if she were one wrong word away from being a meal why did she shiver when cyric cast his smile upon her was he not karak were they not his most trusted servants doors opened and the first of many stepped out into the night dont run she thought unsure of the reason for her sympathy the lioness lurked at the village edge and despite cyrics request people would still die a creature of that size that strength could only do so much to subdue without killing the way lilah looked upon her she knew the idea of bloodless subjugation was nowhere in the lionesss nature the priests say they should kneel by choice cyric said as he waited for the villagers to gather my teacher luther always taught me that the common folk would resist if they felt otherwise little more than children he would say but i have read the words of the prophet i know karaks true desire for what reason does it benefit a man to let him burn in fire through his choice when he might be saved through the strength of others let them see the strength of karak let them cower in fear that fear will strip away their pride their selfishness and their delusion that somehow they have worth apart from karak the crowd was gathering about them now a few asked questions but cyric ignored them as if they were not there valessa stood tall trying to feel regal beautiful dangerousinstead of little more than an imposter her daggers yearned for blood she wanted to descend upon the crowd in a slaughter to lose herself in the flow of combat to rely on instinct in battle she could feel no doubts in life she had never known them either what was happening to her what cruel sort of penance led her to doubt her faith instead of reaffirming it as she rectified her failure in the distance lilah roared and valessa heard screams go to the priest or suffer my claws she heard the lioness say that terrifying voice booming throughout the village men and women cowered and children cried grief and terror all around her valessa realized and in the center cyric smiled and lifted his arms as if they were his beloved children i have come he said i hear your questions hush your babies listen and you shall hear your answers valessa my queenis it not right that you should introduce me valessa felt so many eyes upon her she tilted her head and spoke what was expected of her you stand in the presence of karak she said all with faith shall kneel only a scattered few did so valessa was last and she bowed her head unwilling to look at the accusing faces i see so many without faith cyric said sadly shaking his head of the several hundred gathered hardly more than twenty knelt a shame but this world is a shameful place people of willshire i come not for you but those whom you harbor the people of durham brought to you by sir robert at the blood tower let them come forth i wish to look upon their faces youll kill them a brave man said from amid the crowd i will kill you all if you do not obey said lilah stalking in from the outer edge of the village blood sizzled across her muzzle and jaw and do not presume to know the will of karak i will commit no murder cyric said no one will die tonight that i promise you as i saidi wish to look upon their faces still the gathered villagers did not move valessa glanced at cyric wondering how he would react would he unleash lilah upon them or would he expect his queen to do his bloody work perhaps neither perhaps she would see a display of the raw power that burned within him and consumed his soul with gray fire is this how you treat your god cyric asked as the painful silence stretched on you aint our god a different man valessa caught sight of him just a young redhead no older than twenty the crowd murmured along with him she looked to the priest waiting for the order to punish him for his insolence but instead cyric breathed in deep then let it out his shoulders sagged as if he were greatly disappointed yes he said his deep voice eerily quiet i am he lifted his arms and i said kneel the word rolled off his tongue like a shockwave men and women flung themselves to the ground it didnt matter if there was no room or if they held babes in their arms children even the elderly lurched to their hands and knees valessa was no exception as she quivered unable to resist the compulsion she listened to the sounds of the crowd abandoned babes sobbed the elderly cried out from broken bones and many whimpered from strained and torn muscles all throughout she smelled the stench of fear so palpable it was as if she could reach out and pluck strands of it from the air with great effort she forced her head up to look the only one in the entire village without knee bent to cyric was lilah i promised safety if obeyed cyric told them but i make no such promise to the disloyal karaks fire will burn the weak the foolish and the disobedient i would ask for those from durham to come forth but i know they hold no faith to karak so i ask the rest of you lift your fingers and reveal to me the outsiders to your village i can tell you who they are a ragged man offered cyric turned to him then beckoned him to rise he looked waferthin an uneven growth of beard on his face your name billy said the man lived here all my life i can show you who dont belong he turned to the rest of the village and he snapped at them as if he could sense their disdain and they dont belong they aint us no reason for us to die for them walk among them cyric said all emotion gone from his face touch them so i may know as for the rest of youare there any here who would serve their god the lion stands before you and your reward will be great eleven men lifted their arms and with a wave of cyrics hand they stood valessa knew she should view them as faithful converts but instead saw them as traitors to their village cyric bade them come to the front where he put his thumb against each of their foreheads it burned there for a moment then faded leaving only a black scar if any harm you or resist you i will know he told them now find me the people of durham and bring them here no doubt they knew as well as billy who the traitors were but they did not scatter amid the crowd instead they followed him as he walked and grabbed every man woman and child he touched some struggled only to be beaten by the eleven others burst into tears but most remained stoic saying not a word as they walked toward the front the minutes crawled along valessa felt the villagers grow restless and angry but lilahs presence was more than enough to keep them in check the lioness prowled around the perimeter of the crowd softly growling when nearly a hundred stood before them billy looped through the crowd a few more times then shrugged i think thats it he said very good cyric said kneel at my right hand as is your reward billy did so and valessa hated how pleased he looked cyric would give him no reward other than perhaps rule over the pathetic little village what hed done hed done out of fear not faith there was little to cherish in that cyric looked over the people of durham and valessa did the same there was nothing special about them they were just tired and frightened farmers herders mothers and their children they had a defiance to them that impressed her though it was foolish as she knew it would be who will speak for you cyric asked i will said a man stepping forward he was tall but heavyset and dressed in finer clothing than the others my name is jeremy hangfield i am the one who came to sir robert and told of the destruction karak brought to our village strike me down and get this over with you say karak brought destruction upon your village cyric said approaching jeremy but it wasnt karak was it jeremy shook his head a priest of his then he wore your robes and his eyes shone like fire darius told us to kneel or suffer and we suffered unjustly unfairly cyric laughed in his face unjustly unfairly you deserve nothing not even the breath that fills your lungs you were commanded to kneel and warned of the punishment that would ensue if you did not how is that unfair you spat in the face of your god the god who created you who demanded worship lest he revoke your gift of life did you think you might resist without consequence you are a spoiled child angry at the punishment after willfully committing the misdeed even so said jeremy we did nothing but tell sir robert the truth of what happened truth what truth is that karak destroyed our village we all know it cyric shook his head karak did not destroy your village he said prove it you were asked to kneel and you did not but i commanded the same tell me jeremy what did you then do jeremy glared but said nothing cyric knelt closer as if he were sharing a secret his voice was soft like a whisper but somehow the entire village still heard you knelt because while you refused a prophet and one of his paladins you cannot refuse me i am no paladin no priest no prophet i am karak and you will worship my might by the rise of the blood moon i was not there in durham but i am here now lilah roared and her power rolled over the villagers kneel cried the lioness those from willshire obeyed though the people of durham did not valessa my queen cyrics words startled valessa she felt like shed been lost in a dream unable to interfere yes cyric she asked go to the blood tower fetch me twenty of my guard and send them here i will need them to help keep order while we await the blood moon i am a stranger to them she said they may not listen go as you are he said no one will refuse you but for your peace of mind lilah will also accompany you and her presence will prove you speak my will valessa bowed her head then put her back to the spectacle she thought to ask him if he would be safe on his own but knew it a foolish question the power of karak was with him even if he wasnt karak made flesh must i lead the way lilah asked as they put the village behind them if you could valessa said in truth she knew the path but preferred to have the lioness farther ahead instead of traveling beside her at least then she might be alone with her thoughts she glanced back toward willshire and suppressed a shudder at least then she might not be afraid i will serve she whispered i will obey i am faithful i am faithful and all the while a soft voice in her head cried liar liar liar sandras wrists bled from struggling against her bonds yet she did not stop the blood only made them slicker gave her hope to pull free jerico had not returned from his meeting with luther and despite luthers act of kindness she still feared for her friends life or was he her lover now she didnt know didnt want to think about it morning was rapidly approaching and come daylight she knew escape would be nearly impossible come on she whispered as she pulled her hands were on fire now and she felt more skin scrape away as she worked her right arm no guard remained to watch her between the two wagons if only she couldif only she stopped for a moment biting her tongue to hold down her sobs her hands shook whether from pain blood loss or fear she didnt know she wanted to believe she was brave she wanted to believe that no matter how expertly tied her bonds were and make no mistake they were very expertly tied she would still be strong and escape but luther had only looked at her brushed away her hair from her face and asked for her full name that was all yet she had given it but it wasnt because she was afraid she told herself it wasnt because she saw a horrible evil lurking in those eyes it wasnt because she felt like little more than meat in his presence and that his touch had swirled with shadows most unnatural no shed just been foolish made a mistake and forgotten he might use her against her brother that was it better a fool than afraid tears running down her face she pulled once more against the ropes better bleeding and maimed than that mans prisoner hed told her he meant her no harm hed whispered that she was beautiful and he would protect her from his men so long as she told him what he wanted just her name that was all hed wanted what did it matter that she gave him her name jerico was the one they wanted jerico was the one they hunted and he might still be in there suffering at the hands of that sandra she screamed her right hand slipped free and she stood luther caught her fist with his hand and held it firm he said nothing only stared into her eyes she felt her stomach heave at the look do not strike at me again he said he glanced at the rope and her bloodied hands i must commend you despite this foolishness you are not in danger sandra i have use for you i wont help you she said where is jerico i sent him away luther said he still held her fist and her blood trickled across his fingers as he forced her hand downward i told him i would sacrifice you to karak if he interfered any further with karaks work in the north you said i was not in any i told him what he needed to hear luther interrupted i know him as much as he might try to deny it he loves you greatly and will be reluctant to put your life in danger you think you know him she asked she pulled her hand free then slipped out of the rope the two stood alone between the wagons in a darkness away from the light of any fire in the starlight luther looked healthier more alive than he had in the tent worse he looked far more dangerous i think i know him rather well he said do i not he wont run luther he knows me too he knows id rather he kill every single one of you than give in to your demands even if it costs me my life she expected him to argue or be angry but instead he let out a tired chuckle i know sandra right now i expect him to be running toward the castle of caves with every shred of strength left in his body hell hate himself yet still believe he honors yourfeisty spirit in refusing to give in to my threats foolish really but that stubbornness and sense of honor are why he has survived as long as he has i want him at the castle especially after the damage done to our wagons which has given us a delay we can ill afford as for you he took her bleeding wrists in his hands she told herself to run but again she saw the danger lurking in his eyes if she tried that shed be dead and that death would not be quick or painless i have a request involving your brother i wish you to take him a message i dont know where he is she insisted then youll find him there are many villages nearby and im sure all of them are loyal to the bandit he marches to lord arthurs aid if he is not there already can you carry my words to him and not just repeat them sandra but make him believe make him listen what is it she asked daring to hope tell him to pull back his men from the castle of caves and avoid any battle with lord sebastian do this if he wants to spare the lives of his men and ensure his safety i know of his rebellious desires and the grudge he bears against sebastianbut make him listen make him understand i ask this in his best interest should he listen well he grinned karaks mercy will smile down upon him for it the very notion of karaks mercy made sandra want to spit in the priests face but she did not he was letting her go quietly in the night he didnt want the rest of his men to know but why what game was he playing ill do it she said but i wont promise any more than that kaide will do as he desires regardless of what i say of course luther said releasing her wrists when she looked down the bleeding had stopped and the pain was gone if he did as he was told hed never have resisted sebastian in the first place but for the sake of his men for your sake too convince him now go to the east quickly there are no guards watching i made sure of that she glanced behind her fearing a trap but it didnt seem like it and furthermore it made no sense games she thought the priest was playing games and she didnt know the rules she looked at him almost thanked him then bit her tongue what insanity was that that he should have her thanks without a word she ran east off the road and into the fields the grass resisted but she pushed on her heart pounded and her lungs burned but still she ran until the fires of the wagons were out of sight falling to her knees she finally allowed herself to cry to tremble in fear please keep him safe she begged ashhur as her fingers clawed the earth hes done everything you asked now keep him safe damn you she didnt know if ashhur was even listening but she felt better for the demand sleep pulled at her limbs but she rose to her feet her back to the caravan she ran until dawns first light met her eyes then she found a flat space in the field curled her knees to her chest and slept t heyd left darius free to roam the grounds of the tower and he took advantage of it as often as he could to find some privacy at night he slept in the barracks with the rest of the men and though he had plenty of blankets nothing could keep away the chill that pervaded the air he felt it with every glare his way every shoulder turned when he dared speak no one struck him no one lifted a sword or even mentioned the word durham but he knew it was in their minds more men came north upon the gihon soldiers pulled in from the other towers the newcomers tended to treat him better at least for a while then the whispers would begin the conversations in the corners and the welcome smiles would become clenched teeth darius stopped trying by the end of the first day wandering beside the river he enjoyed the solace of the nighttime sky and the gentle mumble of the water across the rocks at least the fish wouldnt judge him what in the world am i doing he wondered aloud as he squatted beside the shore and tossed a rock at his reflection running away perhaps darius startled even though he knew it was only gregory patrolling around the grounds he must have spotted him at the waters edge when darius first heard his voice hed feared it was valessa come to make another attempt at removing his head from his shoulders i flagged down your boat willingly enough darius said slowly standing what makes you think id run now gregory gave a dismissive grunt and crossed his arms darius did not fail to notice the way his hand rested on the hilt of his sword the man was young and intelligent a dangerous combination darius knew especially if she should become emotional youd run if youd done everything you needed to do here gregory said a hard look in his eyes darius frowned and it took him a moment to realize what exactly the man was accusing him of you thinkyou think im leading us into a trap he asked he couldnt decide if he wanted to laugh cry or wallop the soldier upside the head well be split up gregory said our entire plan relies on surprise and if either willshire or the blood tower is ready daniel trusts me perhaps you should listen to your superior im tired of the cold looks i get from you and your men gregory stepped closer and his hand was a clenched fist the hilt firmly in his grasp he was an inch away from drawing darius knew his greatsword was strapped to his back but there was no way he could pull it free faster than gregorys longsword what sort of welcome does a traitor deserve then darius tell me traitor he asked who have i betrayed karak the people you swore to protect you protected them from the wolfmen you and me side by side we held when all seemed lost but then some priest or prophet of karak arrives and you stand by and let him kill i told you darius said feeling his temper rise the waters of the gihon were growing awfully tempting as if their mumble begged for him to toss gregory in headfirst i was confused i was lost i thought i was doing what was right by my faith dont you get it no gregory shouted no i dont get it dont you see every damn fool could tell that prophet had you twisted around inside and out how could you be so blind so stupid as to fall for any of that nonsense to think that killing simple farmers and their families could somehow be justified i know you have fought with you and know youre strong and wise it makes no sense to me you cant have been that foolish youre lying to us hiding something and i want to know what or what youll run me through the night turned deadly silent i will protect my friends my family gregory said but i guess you wouldnt understand that either would you darius felt his anger and pride rising but he closed his eyes and shook his head to force it away it would be too easy to get defensive to attack gregory for doubting him but he was right and darius would give the young man an honest answer not unearned ire im not sure you could ever understand he said looking away from the soldier and to the water imagine knowing something knowing it so well that it is burned deep into your gut youd question your own name before you questioned this and thenone daythe whole world changes and you know nothing every friend youve known since childhood has lied to you every mentor and teacher was nothing but a monster in a mask think of the wolfmen you slew and imagine pulling off their faces to find human children underneath what would you do to put the masks back on he breathed in deep then sighed if only gregory could hear velixars words feel the way they burrowed into the mind sounding so terrible so true i was a dying man in a desert gregory a man offered me poison and told me it was wine and gods help me i drank it he handed me a sword and bade me to save people with its blade and i did if you dont understand it dont see how i could have been so foolish then i am happy for you no one should walk in a valley so low darius looked back and his eyes met gregorys the disappointment was still there but the fury had abated his hand no longer clutched the hilt of his sword daniel says you pray to ashhur now are you so certain he is better than karak darius shrugged and he shifted feeling uncomfortable i did what i did to earn back the love of my god yet now jerico says i have the love of ashhur and will never need to earn it nor fear losing it i never knew my parents but id like to think that is how they should be how they would look upon one of their children and right now i feel i am little more than a child silence stretched between them until at last gregory picked up a stone and tossed it into the river i watched cyric slaughter my friends with a simple wave of his hand while i ran like a coward his lions tore apart armor and flesh like we were nothing im scared darius i look north and my stomach twists just thinking of him waiting there for us no matter what well have to face him if we hide here hell come for us i see no way out no real chance for victory as much as i hate to admit it youre the one hope we have we dont need a child we need a warrior for all our sakes i hope ashhurs paying attention with that said he returned to the tower leaving darius alone with his thoughts are you paying attention darius asked glancing up at the stars he drew his sword and the bluewhite glow shone across the blade he stared into it let it cast away his fear hed already given himself up to death once and jerico had denied him this time hed be doing it for others not for selfish cowardly reasons win or lose by gods he planned on giving it a damn good attempt good enough he told the cold night air still weak still just a fledgling faith but itd been enough to kill velixar and itd be enough for cyric he put his sword on his back and trudged to the tower when he entered the barracks he found a waterskin lying on his bed uncorking it he put it to his lips and drank wine he thought and despite the others sleeping about him he laughed until he cried wine for a man in the desert he drank it all and for the first time in what felt like months slept peacefully every step was painful but jerico pressed on for he did not have much farther to go blisters covered his feet everywhere that wasnt already callused his armor was heavy on his back but he refused to remove it luthers men had caught him unarmored and without his shield but he would not risk that again after the priest had let him go hed found where hed stashed his armor dressed and then flung his shield upon his back hed been tempted to go crashing back into the camp to rescue sandra theyd been so confident theyd even given him his mace but that wasnt what shed want he knew that a heroic but pointless death would not impress her no matter what luther had said he knew she would want him to go on to the castle of caves to help save arthur from sebastians men and so he ran along the path every aching step pulling him away from where he thought sandra remained imprisoned and one step closer to the next battle at hand hed run all through the night and then the day his mind was in a fog his stomach empty it hurt at times but he kept his legs moving kept his lungs filled with air he prayed ashhur would give him the strength to continue and despite the pain he never stopped come nightfall he could go no further it didnt even matter that he was in the center of the dirt road a nighttime rider might have clomped right over him but moving was no longer an option collapsing jerico hit the ground and passed out his dreams were of sandra lying in the dirt a great hole was in her chest where her heart had been black blood circled through her veins and spilled across his hands when he woke his eyes were red and his stomach heaved though he had nothing but bile to spit onto the dirt beside him not far he told himself not far not far at all of course getting to the castle was just the half of it getting inside would be an interesting endeavor much as he might like it he doubted whoever was in charge of sebastians troops would just let him walk right through their siege lines jerico resumed his trek toward the castle but this time at a walk he kept his eyes peeled and when he saw a small collection of bushes with overripe berries on them he nearly burst into tears he ate until he threw up the red berries sickly sweet on his tongue and then ate some more belly full he resumed his walk crossing the final few miles to the castle of caves it was midday when he first saw the smoke of the enemy encampment surrounding the walls deciding he could no longer be so careless he veered off the path and slowly wound through the hills eyes open for any scouts who might be watching atop the first hill he lay flat and scanned the area the castle was built upon a tall hill and surrounding it on all sides were tents with the yellow rose waving from their banners from what he could tell only a limited amount of siege works had been built it seemed sebastian was confident of starving arthur outor that their commander was hesitant to sacrifice so many lives on such an assault soldiers tents and more soldiers jerico muttered as he scratched his chin of course things couldnt be easy thatd be crazy the only time hed been at the castle before was with kaide and theyd not entered through the main gates instead theyd traveled through a tunnel built into the network of caves beneath the castle jerico wondered if he might use that same tunnel to bypass the army he had only a vague idea where the entrance was but he believed it to be outside the siege lines desperately praying he didnt go from being one mans prisoner to anothers he hurried down the hill and farther away from the path finding the entrance turned out to be easier than expected where it had once been carefully concealed now he found the entire ground worked over with dirt caved in and then covered with heavy rocks jerico stood before it and frowned it seemed sebastians men had discovered the tunnel and when they couldnt gain entrance to the castle that way they sealed it over jerico thought of the traps hed been shown including the narrow bridge across the chasm he and kaide had crossed kaide insisted it had been rigged to collapse he wondered how many had fallen to their deaths before they gave up and just sealed it jerico glanced about and saw another worked entrance a hundred yards to his south kaide had said there were about twenty tunnels dug throughout the area was it possible sebastian had found them all more importantly could he expect to find one that all the soldiers had missed oh no he muttered it just couldnt be easy could it an idea came to him and he sighed it might work but it could just as easily get him killed but really what else did he have to lose at least if he died sandra might be spared hed tried not to think of her often or of what continuing his fight might mean usually he failed jerico spent much of the day resting in the far hills having moved away from the siege lines he searched a bit for more berries but sadly found none he did find a stream and drank until his stomach hurt crawling along the day finally reached its end and night came jerico returned to the hill overlooking the siege he could see the faint outlines of men marching along the walls carrying torches looking like miniscule lightning bugs still tiny as they might be he could see them and that meant just maybe he stood took his shield in hand and lifted it high the front lit up and as he prayed it shone a strong bluewhite and then he waited to see who noticed him first the eyes of the enemy should have been on the castle while arthurs men looked out all it would take would be one of them to realize what it was and just one tunnel still intact a lot of ifs a lot of luck jerico tried not to think about that either come on he muttered watching the men patrol the walls come on come on see the big blue dot not a bug not a fire now turn and look he held it for ten more minutes then decided it was enough if they hadnt noticed his shield yet then they might never holding it aloft any longer just increased the odds of the wrong party spotting him sitting down he waited and waited when someone tapped him on the shoulder he nearly screamed jerico asked the man caked with dirt his hair was cut short and his clothes were ragged damn it man cant you make some noise when you walk jerico asked the man looked about clearly worried if he noticed jericos embarrassment he didnt show it follow me he said i saw a rider this way and we have little time now hurry the paladin thought hed been far enough from the castle that no cave entrance might be beyond him but he was wrong his guide beckoned him to follow and together they put their backs to sebastians army and ran there seemed to be nothing but hills and tall grass but it was dark and jerico knew firsthand how well arthurs men could hide both themselves and the cave entrances the man introduced himself as jerek wallace talking in hurried hush tones as they traveled i fought alongside you at the green gulch he said his furtive eyes always checking behind them not with the bandits men though arthurs it was our line you helped at the end before the call to withdraw never forgot that shield of yours a man swung at you with his sword and it hit that light he slapped his hands together then winced at the sound sword shattered like it was made of glass when degan saw that blue light out here in the hills i just knew it was you had to be flattered jerico said and he was though he also felt uncomfortable all that adulationdid jerek forget they actually lost that fight how far is the tunnel not far jerek said guiding him through a minor valley between two hills they all looked the same to him and the castle was growing disturbingly far away it certainly explained why no one had located the entrance like the others his guide glanced back then swore get down he said grabbing jericos shoulder the two fell to their bellies jerico shifted about so he could look two men on horses rode perpendicular to their path torches held aloft they looked like strange phantoms just black shapes outlined by fire can they track us jerico asked depends on how good they are jerek whispered its dark but youre not too light on your feet its the armor if you say so jericos hand drifted to the hilt of his mace for reassurance dont worry too much if were spotted he said two against me theyd need a lot more men like that many jerek asked pointing seven more riders joined with them and they crisscrossed the spaces between the hills yeah thatd do it looks like sebastians men remember you as well as i do jerek said getting to his feet he kept his back hunched and his body low we stay here theyll find us eventually follow me and for the love of the gods dont put so much weight on your heels when you step you an elven scoutmaster now jerico grumbled doing his best to stay low and follow the man jerek tapped the slender bow slung over his shoulder best hunter arthurs ever known said so himself now hurry they rushed on and this time jerico joined jerek in taking worried glances backward but true to his word they were not far though jerico could hardly believe it when they arrived here we go jerek said stopping at a strange circle of yellow mayflowers wheres the tunnel jerek gave him an amused grin right here he said standing in the flowers center by karaks bearded ghost the man dropped right through the ground and vanished jerico blinked and lifted an eyebrow youve got to be kidding me he said he stepped into the flowers and stomped a few times no give nothing loose sighing he shook his head and repeated the words foolish as they were by karaks bearded ghost he went from standing on grass to air and he dropped with a surprised yelp dirt passed over his eyes and then he was in pure darkness his feet hit ground and the landing jarred his knees he started to fall then his body halted as it struck stone a thousand curses ran through his mind and he wanted to yell all of them what was that he asked instead arthur had all our tunnels dug and worked by us jerek said his voice a few feet ahead of him all but this one jerico pulled his shield off his back at his touch it lit up revealing his surroundings he and jerek were in a cramped space cut out of dirt and stone before them was a small tunnel so long that his light could not reach its end a foot above his head were planks of wood and he pressed against them with his hand still surprised by their solidity magic he asked believe so this was back when he and his brother first had their fallout brought a wizard all the way over from veldaren if youd believe it some queer looking man in yellow arthur wanted someone not associated with the council the activation phrase jerek shrugged wizards idea most of the other tunnels have been found but not this one he frowned going to be a tight fit with all that armor im not taking it off you might get stuck jerico looked at the cramped tunnel ahead while he could currently stand going on ahead would involve crawling on his hands and knees he thought about what it might be like to be stuck in such a claustrophobic space ill manage he said trying not to sound worried he was the hero of the gulch after all hate to disappoint the hunter jerek shrugged then fell to his hands and knees and began crawling jerico swallowed took a deep breath then wondered where the air was coming from reminding himself others had used the tunnel plenty of times before he slung his shield onto his back returning them to darkness using his hands to feel ahead he crawled into the tunnel after jerek his armor scratched and creaked and he didnt want to imagine the damage he was doing to it probably take all day to bang out and polish the dents in the tight space the noise was tremendous hey jerek yeah he stopped a moment to catch his breath can anyone hear us above ground normally id say no but damn youre making a ruckus jerico laughed lets hope they have no shovels then progress was slow one hand after the other so far there seemed to be no turns but he feared banging his head against one when they reached it the tunnel had a very steady slope downward which helped a little often he had to shift his weight one way or the other as a piece of his armor or an edge of his shield caught a rock the ground itself was wet and cold which explained jereks appearance when they had first met as the minutes wore on jerico felt the weight of the earth above him growing more present in his mind and it seemed he could not catch his breath one of these days he muttered one of these days im going to enter your lords castle through the front door just to say i did whats that jerek called out his voice was disturbingly far away and jerico pushed himself along faster i asked how long does it normally take to get to the castle an hour but at your rate im thinking three jerico pressed his forehead against the back of his hands as he took another deep breath it wouldve been easier to fight my way through sebastians army more exciting too jereks laughter echoed from up ahead urging jerico on after what felt like an eternity his fingers brushed against the first turn following it his stomach lurched as the path downward steepened tremendously if youre covered with enough mud you can just push yourself down and slide jerek told him having waited there for his arrival jerico jumped at the sound of his voice so close and was glad the darkness hid the descent i dont think ill be doing much sliding he said i think youll be surprised he heard the sound of skittering rocks and then silence jerico followed crawling along his blood rushed to his head but movement was certainly easier he pulled himself along for ten more feet or so then found himself at an even steeper decline deciding to give it a shot he dug his fingers into the dirt and flung himself forward the following sensation of speeding down a drop in pitch black was something he never ever wanted to endure again at the bottom he heard steps and then an arm grabbed his to his surprise he was able to stand and removing his shield he lit the space up with its light welcome to the deepest cave jerek said gesturing it was about thrice their height though the stalactites were long enough that jerico could reach up and brush them with his fingers the walls floors and ceiling were wet and water dripped constantly from above i thought itd take an hour jerico said as he glanced behind him seeing that theyd emerged from a manmade tunnel into the natural cave it will never said wed be crawling the whole way though jerico clenched his teeth together theres many many things i want to call you right now he told his guide who only laughed come on he said and step lightly the ground is slick and with all that weight you might take a nasty tumble slick floor or not jerico was just glad to stand and have the light of his shield once more jerek led the way and he followed once more admiring the beauty of the cave he had no idea whether or not it connected to the others that he and kaide had used but it wouldnt have surprised him the minutes passed as they made their way carefully through the cave many times they encountered sections where the floor had been carved into steps or passageways had been widened the ugly marks of pickaxes and hammers ruined the beauty but at the same time after his weary crawl jerico felt glad to not have to do it again at last they reached the end above them was a tall ladder at least twenty feet high and above that a trapdoor guests first jerek said gesturing jerico put his shield on his back returning them to darkness grabbing the rungs of the ladder he tested their strength and found them thankfully strong without an ounce of give climbing until his head bumped against the top he felt against it with a free hand there a latch he asked the side closest to you youll find it push up jerico finally did and when cool fresh air blew against his face he felt happy enough to cry crawling out he found himself in the center of arthurs courtyard emerging from a hole rubbing his eyes he looked to his left and saw a bench and realized he and arthur had sat and talked mere feet from the tunnel exit if a siege ever went sour this is where arthur would flee isnt it he asked as he helped jerek up thats the idea jerek said closing the trapdoor behind him the top was covered with sod and grass and jerek did his best to smooth it out the two looked at one another both covered with mud jerek gave him a grin i think you look fit to meet a lord dont you jerico pointed at him his finger an inch from his nose one day he said justone day jerek smirked then led him into the castle he didnt make it far men in armor jerico had never met before waited in the next room and they slapped his back and congratulated him jerico couldnt tell if it was for surviving the green gulch or just the travel through the damn tunnel all of them looked tired their strength sapped by the controlled rations and constant stress his presence buoyed them and jerico did his best to smile and accept their greeting graciously at the door to arthurs room jerek knocked several times then stepped aside as it opened jerico knelt in respect and dipped his head his knee smeared mud across the floor and a chunk of dirt fell from his red hair and onto the carpet milord jerico said grinning up at arthurs stunned expression i heard you could use an extra shield on your walls and ive come to offer mine arthur embraced him either not noticing or not caring that he dirtied his expensive bedrobes and left his hands wet with mud that i could paladin arthur said that i could valessa walked through the walls surrounding the blood tower to the empty land beyond the silence was blessed to her with a sigh she let her armor and cloak vanish adopting the image of how she had always been plain clothes and all with cyric remaining in willshire along with half his men shed assumed his mantle of leadership not that the lions didnt have their say kayne and lilah were always about patrolling watching they spoke little but when they did they were obeyed without question night had fallen and while most guards slept valessa would not she looked to the clear sky and tried to ignore the burning red star shining in the distance mocking her always reminding her of her failure her unfinished mission soft footsteps padded behind her she looked back saw one of the lions there she held back her grimace over time she should have grown more comfortable in their presence but so far she had not her nocturnal visitor was kayne the male slightly larger and with a fiery mane about his neck you are troubled kayne said resting on his haunches beside her i am tired i was trained for stealth and assassination not preparing defenses and managing supplies kayne breathed out heavily through his nose you know that is not what i speak of i am of a world you do not know and my eyes glimpse what mortal eyes cannot i see the uncertainty of your faith i smell your doubt the rest sleep and we have solitude here tell me your fear valessa looked to the distance imagining the people of willshire watching cyrics preparations what would they think what would they believe he says he is karak she said to the lion not that he works his will or hears his voice but that he is karak returned in mortal flesh in my training to be a gray sister we heard of karaks return of his freedom from the elven whores prisonbut it was always a day of glory an ultimate defeat of chaos and false gods the world was to shake and a million voices cry out in triumph you doubt him kayne asked his voice even deeper than lilahs heat wafted over her from his mouth it felt like an inferno rumbled in the lions belly of course i doubt him how is what he says not blasphemy shouldnt karak strike him down for such claims kayne shook his head an odd motion to see from a creature so large and magnificent in many ways cyric is karak made flesh his power embodies him his presence fills him and he does speak our gods words in all matters of faith valessa frowned that wasnt good enough kayne was avoiding the question giving her excuses and explanations instead of real answers then hes wrong she said he isnt karak not in the way our prophets have foretold kayne looked at her and the intelligence in his eyes frightened her in a way no mortal weapon ever could no the lion said at last he is not then it is blasphemy it is a mere reflection of the truth there is only one truth karak cannot let this go on kayne leapt toward her his eyes met hers his teeth were bared and stopped just inches from her breasts would you tell a god what he can and cannot do asked the lion cyric will accomplish what none have done in ages he will bring back the old and true ways to the north and beyond the faithful will grow numerous honed with fire and blade so long as the priest serves and furthers the cause of our god then i am to protect him as should you she refused to back down to let the creature see her fear i will listen she told kayne and i will obey but i will not call him god nor call him karak tread carefully kayne said snarling my teeth can consume more than flesh you are not safe not from me do not think yourself forgiven for your failure i would never she said it took all her strength to walk past his bared teeth she had thought herself unable to feel worldly sensations but the creature was not of their world the heat of his body radiated across her made her feel alive for the first time since darius killed her but that only heightened the awareness of her pain made her realize how much had been taken from her at the entrance to the blood tower she stopped and looked up at the high window which was lit with a candle your home is overrun by a madman she whispered thinking of robert locked inside helpless as cyric as filled the heads of his men with promises of eternity when cyric spread his influence south when he conquered the priesthood in mordeina and began to travel east might she one day feel the same icy fear stung her nonbeating heart dangerous thoughts she realized far more dangerous than shed believed herself capable of cyric did karaks will she had to trust that she had to believe because the alternative was so much worse i n the first village sandra had come to walking on bleeding feet and with an empty stomach theyd fed her repaired her clothes and sent her on her way theyd known her supported her brother but did not know where hed been tombrook they told her go to tombrook and someone there would know and so she did carrying her dagger in one hand and a satchel of dried food in the other at tombrook when she mentioned kaides name they hushed her and took her to their village elder who summoned one of his grandsons hes a fast lad and knows many paths the old man said his eyes milky white and his teeth black i trust he might take you somewhere you want to go the grandson was a boy of fourteen and he carried a large sack of loaves over his shoulder will we need that much food she asked him food aint for you had been his reply and so she followed him out to the hills arthurs castle was close she knew and for much of the time they walked along the only road toward it after a time the boy veered off into a heavy patch of brush and thorns that seemed to stretch for miles briars pulled at her clothes and her skin bled from many cuts but the boy endured without complaint and so would she then they reached the camp a large clearing painstakingly cut into the brush they hadnt built any fires that might reveal their presence as they sat hidden yet so close to the road youre a godsend the first guard said to the boy grabbing the sack his eyes had swept over her without seeing her and she smiled at him with her arms crossed hello adam she said he froze as if hit by lightning the big mans grin grew and then he wrapped her in a bear hug sandra he cried and with that many hurried her way she greeted the men as best she could then pushed them away i must see my brother she said and i seek my sister kaide said pushing adam aside a smile was on his face and sandra immediately felt relief at seeing it he bore her no ill will no anger only an embrace she gladly returned is there somewhere we can talk she asked as the men returned to their posts kaide gestured to the sprawling camp no walls no tents no homes he said though theres a stream a bit farther in we can walk there and talk along the way the brush had been carefully cleared creating a pathway that weaved and curled so as to be unnoticeable from afar kaide led the way and sandra followed a step behind him so what has my little sister been up to he asked her she could tell he was dying to know but kept his tone gentle uninterested not near as much as you she said how goes the siege weve not been here long but weve assaulted nearly every supply wagon thats tried to slip past twice now weve even sneaked into gregs camp and stolen food greg sir gregane kaide said glancing back at her hes in charge of the troops you think sebastian would be brave enough to leave his castle her brother laughed not likely he wont venture out until both mine and arthurs heads are on stakes but it wont happen well only get bolder a hungry army poses little threat and if were lucky i can assault kaide sandra said grabbing his arm and stopping him ijerico and i were captured by a man named luther he leads an army to aid in the siege kaides jaw clenched tight and she could see the anger her words brought not at her but at the thought of all his plans crumbling in an instant how many he asked i dont know she said but at least four hundred maybe five he has paladins with him too whatever chance we had its gone now we must withdraw kaide nodded but she knew he was only thinking not necessarily agreeing with her her brothers hands clenched into fists then loosened you said you were captured how did you escape they let me go she said i was to bring you a message luther said for you to not interfere and if you left now wed be rewarded rewarded kaide snapped rewarded how will he give me sebastians head will he give us vengeance for ashvale of course not theyll keep their puppet lord alive and when arthurs hanging in a gibbet theyll come for me for us kaide shook his head if he wants me gone that means his victory is not so certain as you might think i will not run now not when greganes army is so close to breaking if arthur would just ride out jericos alive too she said i thought you might like to know being his friend and all kaide crossed his arms dont look at me like that of course he is my friend and im glad he lives where is he now i think hes with arthur how they have the castle surrounded do you think thatd stop him kaide laughed no i dont then let us hope we meet him on the field of battle as we crush sir gregane from both sides were not leaving sandra i fear no man no army when we break this siege arthur will rally the rest of his host and well march south to the castle of the yellow rose well hang luthers head next to sebastians how does that sound sounds like a fools hope sandra said and she did her best to smile a fools hope kaide agreed weve lived on that for years perhaps just once we might find something more if youre thirsty follow the path i must return to camp and send a rider to discover how much time we have before this luther fellow arrives sandra kissed his cheek then let him go amid the thorns and brush she watched him and thought of luthers words should he listen wellkaraks mercy will smile down upon him for it she would have to pray he was wrong sir gregane stood at the entrance of his tent and stared at the castle the sun was starting to set and from the high walls he watched one of arthurs men wave a loaf of bread then duck below the ramparts before someone shot him with an arrow gregane rolled his eyes and stepped back into his tent theyre still getting food he told his trusted advisor a seasoned knight named nicholls damned if i know how though how many of their tunnels have we collapsed eighteen if i remember correctly nicholls said though to be honest weve dug in so many ive lost track are you sure they arent waving the same loaf over and over again it might be tough as stone by now and theyre down to eating rats well be there soon ourselves gregane said walking over to his desk and glancing over his most recent tally of their supplies three wagons all raided and burned to the ground no survivors our private stores dwindle yet our guards see nothing what does it sound like to you nicholls sighed it sounds like kaide finally made his way here thats what i think too and it hasnt been for long either four days five at most yet look at what hes done with so little time ive already had to cut our rations in half morale wasnt great to begin with and now the men grumble behind my back when they think me too far to hear nicholls cleared his throat and clasped his hands behind his back gregane knew he was about to hear something he wouldnt like but demanded that his friend spit it out anyway what if we break siege nicholls asked weve already beaten arthur in the open field and he was damn lucky to escape then why not fall back resupply and catch him on the road south if we cannot deny them food and it is our men dying in the night instead of theirs what good is it if we stay gregane put his hand on the parchment before him and stared at the numbers as if he could make them grow through sheer force of will we cannot he said our lord gave us our orders and we must follow them the siege continues until victory or our deaths we have numbers supplies and time forgive me sir but time is not on our side and it seems everyone but our lord knows it gregane struck his desk with his fist do you think i dont know that he asked embarrassed by his outburst he looked away and took in a deep breath kaides only gotten better at thisdishonorable way of combat if we sit here hell starve us of supplies if i send out escorts hell pick off my men one by one and if i send too many i risk leaving us vulnerable to an attack from arthur no only one option remains is the battering ram finished nicholls blanched it is but weve yet to reinforce the top arthurs archers will not stop us gregane said is that understood come first light we smash open his gates and hang his soldiers from the ramparts along with their loaves of bread if they want to flee through those caves of theirs then so be it well claim the castle and arthur will have his second defeat the common folk will not consider him their savior after that if you say so sir i do now go nicholls left and in the following silence gregane felt his frustration boil over damn you sebastian he said scattering his reports to the dirt come morning he would end it all one way or another and if he failed then so be it at least then the better lord had a chance of victory first light he whispered first light arthur we settle this i pray you have the wisdom to surrender arthur wouldnt though not to him and not to his brother much as it saddened him their conflict was to the death and they all knew it buckling his sword to his waist he stepped out to observe the final preparations and ensure every last detail was set next morning hundreds of his men would die the best he could do now was minimize the loss a re you sure youre still up to this daniel asked him no darius said as he adjusted his plain shirt and slacks but we dont have much choice do we the blood moons tomorrow and im not expecting any knights to come riding in to the rescue they stood by the bank of the river on the opposite side of tower silver with darius and six other men dressed as common villagers the only things uncommon about them were the swords they held and dariuss greatsword strapped to his back the people of durham will recognize you even if cyric doesnt gregory said softly standing beside him in similar plain clothes are you so certain they will protect us no im not darius said but i have to trust them whatever fear they have of me i think theyll fear cyric more daniel paced before the men after shaking their hands you make me proud he told them every one of you deserves a song sung in your praise and well sing it nice and loud when we come back with that bastards head one of the seven said and the others laughed daniel smiled and clapped the man on the shoulder damn right he said and no one will be singing it louder than i my men will arrive on time dont you ever doubt it try not to die before then no promises darius said bowing low have fun at the blood tower he looked at the rest of men and the way they looked back he knew he was their leader now the one they put their faith in he prayed he wouldnt disappoint lets go he told them we have a village to save they traveled north keeping the gihon to their right at all times dariuss hand often reached for his sword and he kept expecting valessa to be behind every tree or lurking in every shadow each time nothing but his nerves remained on edge nonetheless the rest of the men said little even gregory falling silent as they marched they had many miles to cover so they saved their breath an hour in gregory spotted a road and they followed it away from the river it wound through the flatlands and fields of wild grass darius felt naked without his armor but was glad for the lack of weight as the miles passed dont look like theres any patrols said the oldest of the seven a longhaired man named zeke why would there be gregory asked why would cyric think we knew his plans he was an overconfident bastard the few times i met him and i doubt hes gotten any better now he thinks hes a god he aint a god said zeke he aint even much of a man just wait ill shove my sword in his gut and well see how proud he is then the rest laughed all nervous chuckles and sideways glances darius made sure to grin wide and let none know of his private fears a priest claiming he was karak returned in human form the rest of the priesthood would flay the flesh from his skin when they learned of such blasphemy so why hadnt karak denied him his power why send lions of the abyss was there a grain of truth to it darius had killed a prophet with his blade but could he kill a god the road widened as they neared the village and the ground was markedly flatter by now they could see torches mostly gathered around the village center close enough darius said time we split up darius with me gregory said darius could sense the young man assuming leadership and was glad to let him do it he knew the men better zeke go with reb and thomas stay at the farthest edge of town close to the road i want us to always know who leaves and who goes from willshire the three men saluted lowered their backs and ran toward one of the homes gregory turned to the final two lowborn brothers whod enlisted at the same time and been considered unworthy of anything other than a station at the towers darius had rarely spoken to them learning little more than their names they both had short red beards making them even more identical somethings going on in the center gregory said think you two can find a home close enough to see finding ones the easy part said gavin grinning its sneaking in unnoticed thatll be tricky can you we can said kris the younger and no tiny village door is going to be locked or barred not well enough to stop us you certain darius asked theres a reason daniel picked us for this gavin said we might have been a bit troublesome before being sent to the towers come on kris i promise come tomorrow night well be ready for cyrics little game stay low and dont do anything stupid gregory told them you mean besides our whole damn mission kris asked grinning darius looked at gregory and shrugged hes got a point thanks for the confidence gregory said gesturing to the quiet village where are we to go darius analyzed the homes then shook his head to the other side he said maybe we will see something from a new angle he led the way his body crouched and his head low so far they had yet to see soldiers or any sign of cyric but he refused to believe the priest had not begun preparations for the blood moon someone watched over the city and kept them in line as they circled willshire they reached a space where they could see through a gap of homes to the center both stopped and darius felt his heart stutter what is that gregory whispered its an altar darius whispered back it cant be its too big to be one the paladin shook his head blood will spill there he said trust me surrounded by torches and watched by soldiers bearing the standard of karak was a massive table built of five carved slabs of stone tied to the stone were twenty men and women they sat with their backs to it their heads sagging as they slept darius felt fury burn in his gut and time slowed as he saw the man lording over it all a priest dressed in black standing atop the stone with his head bowed and eyes closed we can attack them now he said we have surprise and i count only thirty or so guards no gregory said we follow the plan but the people will die if we fail gregory put a hand on his shoulder they will endure now come i think i see a place for us to stay he pointed to a large barn far from any torchlight the two of them could stay the night there and come the morning theyd just be two more villagers native to willshire eager to work the fields and participate in whatever ceremony cyric had planned darius gave one last look at the priest let his face burn into his memory and then followed the barn itself was not quite as empty as they had expected instead of silence they heard snores and shuffling peeking inside through a crack darius saw at least thirty people sleeping amid the hay gregory snuck around to the front then hurried back six men guard the entrance he said keeping his voice low those from durham must be inside cyric fears theyll flee i cant imagine why what do we do darius looked up saw a high window too tall to climb other than that there was the front entrance the paladin scratched his chin thinking he looked at gregory and frowned how good a liar are you he asked no one will play dice with me anymore that good enough darius pulled the sword off his back and lay on his stomach the wood on the barn was old and carefully he checked board after board until he found one that was loose it didnt have much give but when he pulled it opened up enough of a crack that they could slide their weapons inside gregory looked unhappy doing so but he trusted him that done darius stood wiped a bit of dirt into the sweat of his face then did the same to gregory the men at the front are just mercenaries darius explained in hurried whispers we at the stronghold never liked them nor respected their faith theyre in it for the money and power while they praise karak they think like men not priests and like men they assume other men are just like them what are you getting at just stay with me and say as little as possible were going to get ourselves some women what darius ignored him and stepped around the corner of the barn and into the light of the guards torches pretending to have come from further inside the village stay where you are one of them said upon seeing him several drew their blades and darius let a heavy drawl enter his voice as if hed downed too much liquor gregory stood behind him looking nervous which was exactly how darius wanted him to look them people in there he said pointing at the door theyre nothing but trouble no good thats what they are you should be in bed farmer said the man directly before the entrance darius saw the markings on his armor and knew him the highest ranked of the six so he focused his attention on him sunll rise no matter whether i sleep or not darius said and he grinned as if what hed said was the most brilliant thing ever but my friend here greg you see greg aint never been with a gal and thats a damn shame damn shame but im thinking some of them women in there well they aint too proud know what im saying durham girls theyre loose the guards shared a look and it took all of dariuss selfcontrol to hide his anger the soldiers knew what he asked and it amused them for they had done the same theyd taken the women inside no doubt while their husbands watched the question waswould they let them in those whores in there wont be much for a first time said the guard and he laughed whats wrong with your friend why aint he porked one of the local gals instead of harassing us in the dead of night darius tried to think of a reason but gregory beat him to it he opened his mouth closed it then made a slashing motion over his throat darius bit his tongue to prevent a reaction hed told the man to talk as little as possible leave it to him to pretend to be a mute cant sweet talk a lady when you got no tongue to do it said one of the other guards and they chuckled lots of things you cant do to a lady with no tongue said another least if the ladys got a tongue she can still be of use dariuss sword was inside that barn and it was probably a good thing too fantasies of cutting off all six of their heads turned his vision red but he smiled shifted side to side as if he were still drunk out of his mind so you fine men understand he said care to let us in anyone asks were just there to talk right talk said their leader grinning at mute gregory this sent him to laughing again aye well tell cyric we let a mute fucker inside to talk darius stretched his grin and acted as if he didnt understand why it was so funny let em in said the guard worth it for the damn laugh they stepped aside and darius grabbed gregory by the shirt and pulled him into the dark barn greg dont know what hes doing he said just before they shut it so well be ere all night fine by me said the guard but if they cut off your balls while youre asleep dont expect us to do shit about it the door closed sealing them in darkness the two stood there letting their eyes adjust to what little light streamed in through the cracks of the walls darius could hear people shuffling and knew their conversation had awakened many they might have overheard why they were there or deduced the reason so caution was of the utmost importance as his sight improved he saw many lying in piles of hay or under blankets staring at them with wary looks two thirds appeared to be women and many of the men looked old or frail one man looked healthy and darius recognized him all too well i dont see no sword said jacob wheatley standing before two young girls huddled behind him no armor neither you think youll have fun just like the others no i dont jacob darius said i expect to hide and pray and hope that come tomorrow night i cut off cyrics head and present it to you all in penance jacobs jaw dropped he took a step closer and squinted in the darkness darius he wondered aloud before darius could answer jacob clocked him across the face with his fist as darius dropped to his knees gregory flung himself in the way just barely keeping the farmer from latching about his throat enough gregory hissed trying to keep his voice down were sir roberts men and weve come to help help asked jacob he pushed gregory away then pulled at his shirt to fix it you got a lot of nerve coming here darius thought youd be out there with that fucking priest singing praises and sharpening your sword darius took a deep breath and rubbed his sore jaw he deserved worse he knew and did his best to keep his temper in check im not asking you to forgive me he said walking around him while giving him a wide berth im not going to explain myself for im getting tired of finding a thousand different ways to say im sorry i was a fool he reached the far wall found his greatsword and lifted it into the air soft light enveloped the blade and it shone upon the people of durham all of whom were now awake but im here to protect you darius said his voice falling will you let me jacob grunted and he sat down next to one of the women dont mean were even he said but if you can kill cyric i think it might be a damn fine way to start before they came for him that morning jerico already knew the battle had begun he stood before the bed arthur had given him wearing his armor on the bed lay his armaments his fingers ran along the symbol of the golden mountain painted across the front of his shield but his god was far from his mind at that point all he could think of was sandra held captive by the priest luther and what his promise had been should i see you again even hear rumors of your approach i will sacrifice that whore to karak he had no reason to doubt him no reason to believe he lied thered been such intensity in his eyes such loathing the door opened jerico kept his back to it his head low jerico asked a soldier he did not know yes theyretheyre rushing the gates we need you shell die naked alone and screaming in pain i know he said glancing back the soldier opened his mouth then closed it right arthur wished you to know that is all he closed the door as jerico picked up his mace the weight felt reassuring in his hands think on that the next time you would play the hero by aiding arthur he was killing sandra he picked up his shield slung it over his back by fighting sebastian he ended the life of the first woman hed ever loved closing his eyes he thought of her face her stubborn smile but this was what shed want he knew that she could have run but instead she killed the two men that had threatened him cowering to threats giving in to cruel demandsthat wasnt her wasnt something shed ever do but that didnt make it any easier he left his room and made his way to the courtyard soldiers lined the walls and formed rows before the rumbling gates from what hed learned there were a hundred stationed within and approximately six hundred outside the walls should they break through they couldnt hold he also knew that theyd die without hope of victory as the wood groaned and the battering ram slammed again and again he took up a position at the front of the defense where the tired men stood quiet nervous watching theyll hold one said to him as he stood at his side if not then we will jerico said and he smiled a smile he knew they all needed to see screams filled the air glancing up he saw the men on the walls pouring boiling oil on the attackers others shoved stones through murder holes the sharp rocks plentiful because of the caves arthurs archers were few but they loosed arrow after arrow while ducking behind the ramparts when sebastians men returned fire more oil and for a brief moment the slamming against the gates stopped jerico dared to hope perhaps something had broken the wheels of the battering ram or sebastians general had lost his taste for bloodshed facing such casualties it was a false hope and he knew it but the respite from that constant hammering was still welcome he took a step forward and looked to the men when the battering ram resumed its work despite the oil the arrows and the killing stones the archway is tight he told them two men abreast that is all they can send when it breaks ill be there my shield will block the way and unlike wood unlike stone i will not break stand with me at my side let our enemies see no fear see no doubt let them see a wall of swords silence greeted him but he saw the resolve hardening in their eyes as he turned to the gate he heard a single sarcastic clap from jerek upon the walls good show he shouted hope you meant it because theyre coming through jerico felt his own terror crawl up his throat and he choked it down play the hero he whispered the thickest of the boards snapped one half twisting and falling free to the ground the gates flung open violently upon the next smash revealing the carnage on the other side dead men lay slumped arrows in their bodies others were horribly burned by oil flesh charred and bubbling some were still alive moaning softly or shaking so many dead maybe fifty maybe a hundred but it didnt matter the gates had fallen time to play the hero with me he cried rushing forward as sebastians men poured into the archway jericos shield led the way and it shone with a vicious light he threw all his weight into the charge his head ducked low and his legs pumping a handful of men made it out of the archway as his charge met them smashing aside one as if he were a child jericos mace swung punching through chainmail to crack ribs and puncture lungs and then he spun striking down a third trying to rush past him without thinking he pushed his shield forward in the air though nothing pressed against it a sound filled the courtyard like that of a thunderclap the closest attackers jolted backward as if struck their weapons flailing their feet out of position jerico rushed ahead the flanged edges of his mace tearing flesh and splattering blood across the stone archway he stopped just before it so the men above could continue to hurl their stones and fire their arrows for a moment it seemed that time slowed and there was a pause in the attacks as the next wave of men prepared behind him the rest of arthurs soldiers cut down sebastians men who were scattered and few they took up positions beside him and they cheered at the victory jerico breathed in heavily knowing it was just a start but the delay in the attack wasnt a figment of his imagination or a quirk of battle he heard shouting and from what he could see through the gate the attackers were redirecting men away from the castle whats going on he asked jerek peered through the defenses then spun a grin on his face its kaide whatever effect the bandit leader had it wasnt enough jerico tried not to think of what hed say if he met the man odds were high neither would live and he found that comforting enough the next wave of men gathered shields raised to protect them from arthurs arrows they were nearly a hundred in number fresh in strength and with many reinforcements but jerico stood against them and as they charged he lifted his shield high and cried out the name of ashhur t heyd crept among the hills avoiding the road as much as possible they were only a hundred without armor or significant training but sandra knew her brother would steal every bit of advantage he could find their scouts had alerted them to the start of a frontal assault on the castle and within minutes they were out and ready a hundred men plus sandra traveling with an unnerving silence their leaders will be in the back watching the siege kaide had told them as they exited the camp if were lucky well smash their skulls in before they know were there might even get greg too if were lucky and bellok has a fine surprise for them as well the men had cheered the last bit of noise really before heading out bellok was their wizard his power minor compared to those trained and belonging to the council of mages but bellok had aided them before at the green gulch and the way he grumbled they all thought he had another trick up his long sleeves all of them held their weapons ready and sandra was no exception kaide realizing she would not stay away from the combat had given her a spear the tip freshly sharpened it isnt an easy thing killing hed told her handing it over ive seen people die she said in return and with jerico i also killed dont lecture me now she walked amid their meager army of rebels bandits farmers and criminals but they moved silently and toward an army unaware of their approach stay with me adam said keeping his deep voice low so it was no louder than the general sound of their movement fuck that griff said sliding up beside her youll be safer with me ill stay with you both she said smiling to hide her nervousness and ill stab anyone who tries at your backs sound like a plan the twins grinned at her the little goldflints got some teeth adam said and they both laughed far far too loud they crossed the final hill to see the army encampment at the bottom before kaide could give the order to charge a cry went up from a distant hill a combination of fear and swearing went through the army as they realized theyd been spotted by a scout charge kaide screamed surprise is lost so hit them now or die he turned to the wizard bellok bellok lifted his arms and as the bandit army charged downhill the wizard cast the strongest spell he could muster he was no expert at fire could not conjure boulders of ice or arrows of shadow but he could manipulate time sandra felt a strange tingling in her skin and then realized the whole world had come to a standstill it did not last for long maybe a heartbeat sebastians men turned trying to shift aside lines and pull in troops from the castle to guard their rear flank but they did so as if moving through molasses with each passing moment they moved faster closer to their original speed but that brief delay was all that mattered sandra followed adam and griff both wielding enormous clubs the spell was just starting to end when they met resistance the soldiers moving far too slow to avoid their attacks two clubs smashed either side of a mans head and sandra felt shock at how his face crumpled and blood shot from his mouth only sheer momentum kept her moving and when adam hit another hard enough in the stomach to double him over sandra thrust her spear through the exposed gap at his shoulder the tip pierced below his neck and into his lungs his limbs flailed as he died sandra pulled trying to free it as kaides men blasted through tents and leapt against disorganized lines stay calm adam said turning to see her struggling he yanked the spear out and kicked aside the body he grabbed her chin pulled her face up stay focused the two rushed to aid griff who was raging like a maniac at a group of knights his club swung with wild abandon one had been foolish enough to block it with his shield and it had popped his collarbone in half adam bellowed like a bull and he bowled into the group griff right at his heels in the chaos sandra stabbed another from behind wondering what jerico might say to that as she twisted it free she looked about saw that sebastians men were finally gathering together twice their number coming to face them we cant hold them off she shouted to the twins they glanced about saw what she saw then pointed toward the castle archway kaides pulling back adam shouted weve done what we can now get your ass out just as quick and unexpected as their attack had begun they turned and fled leaving a camp full of bodies in their wake halfway up the hill they stopped for a large number had given chase kaide led the counterattack his dirks moving with blinding speed sandra managed to link up with him as sebastians men fled back down the hill how did we do she asked kaide sheathed his blades and wiped a bit of blood from her cheek with his thumb killed far more than we lost he said maybe a hundred to our thirty she looked down the hill saw over a hundred soldiers organizing into defensive lines in case they made another charge unarmored and outnumbered they would shatter against that shield wall if they tried any last tricks kaide asked bellok as they met the wizard at the top of the hill that is the last i have the wizard said he pointed to the castle entrance they might hold though only the gods know how they have some good archers and whoever fights at the gate must be karak himself or ashhur sandra said glancing at her brother if jericos there and still not dead then greganes going to need he stopped for that was when they heard the drums l ost in the battle jerico let his primal sense take over let his body fight on instinct and training without doubts without fears there would be no consequences save death should his shield falter or his mace fail to block a sword strike in time there was no sandra with her life in a mad priests hands there was no citadel no war against his kind by the order of karak just him his foes and the glowing white of his shield his muscles ached and a wicked gash bled across his arm from a stab hed noticed too late but he stood before the archways exit and arthurs men stood with him kill by kill they built a wall of the dead and they gave no reprieve for it to be cleared away their foes had charged with renewed vigor when kaides attack began as if they knew victory needed to be soon but jerico would not let them have it he flung his shield forward again and again slamming aside soldiers as if they were nothing but hollow toys others died around him and it seemed sebastians army did its best to ignore him and take down the soldiers at his side as if they would bury him once they broke through the thought amused him darkly any who slipped past who tried to act as if his shield were his only threat found a mace eager and ready exhaustion threatened to overcome him but he fought on begging ashhur for strength sebastians men pulled back several times trying to drag away bodies so they had a clear path but the archers continued to fire their arrows and the stones rained down from the murder holes still breathing jerico asked the rest as their foes prepared for another charge still with me well be here to the end said one damn right jerek shouted from the wall to the end said a deep voice behind him jerico turned to see arthur there wearing his armor and brandishing a finely polished sword i wont be my brother hiding in hope of victory he said nodding toward the paladin give me a place to stand i still have the strength to swing a blade at my back jerico said and he grinned ill need you to take my place when i fall he turned lifted his shield that next wave was the worst heavily armored men charging at full speed they tripped and stumbled over the dead but still they came jerico smashed his mace through their armor and his shield flared its light a physical force that struck down his opponents and left them blind after a time he could not swing could not attack he only clutched his shield and braced his legs as he held against the attackers at either side he saw arthurs men come running with their own shields they pushed and yelled and all the while arthur thrust his sword over the top taking life after life at last the assault broke unable to maintain pressure with so many casualties frightened men fled and jerico fell to one knee gasping for air i hope i never have to do that again he said throughout the castle morale was growing arthur cheered his men on and they cheered back at their lord and his bloodied blade and then they heard the drums what is that arthur asked jericos heart sank he knew what it was but he looked to jerek anyway praying for any other news i see an army jerek said looking down at them with the defeat evident in his eyes their banners show the lion karaks men arthur said and it was a curse on his lips how many four hundred at the least whatever morale they had died jerico walked toward the bloody archway and peered through sebastians men had pulled back more than eager to wait for reinforcements before resuming the attack looking to the distance he saw kaides bandits were atop the far hill watching the proceedings would this loss be the end of kaides rebellion of course not even down to his dying days the man would resist now is the time to flee jerico said turning to arthur we will not survive not this take the secret ways im not fleeing arthur said i have already lost on the field of battle to lose my home my castle look all the archers were shouting not just jerek jerico turned back and his jaw dropped he couldnt believe what he saw his eyes were lying to him he thought they had to be like in a dream he walked through the archway and to the oilsoaked dirt beyond luthers army upon reaching sebastians had drawn their swords lifted their shields and attacked caught unaware they died like flies even those who had the presence of mind to fight dropped quickly for they lacked both the training and numbers to resist worse were the dark paladins their blades wreathed in black flame as they tore through the ranks but nothing came close to luther who walked amid the battle like a dark god shadows and fire leapt from his hands consuming all at last he reached the leaders tents jerico waited expecting more death but it seemed those there were allowed to live whats going on arthur asked calling from inside the castle jerico shook his head i dont know he said are they friendly jerico had no answer to that either it made no sense none at all sebastian was karaks friend and luther had made his intentions clearhadnt he the battle ended as abruptly as it had begun sebastians men flung down their blades and surrendered only a hundred in number from the original six they fled along the streets and even kaide was so stunned that he did not order his men to chase instead they tentatively descended the hill as if expecting an ambush at every step none came luthers army was already putting away weapons and preparing to leave jerico a voice cried out and he saw sandra rushing to him through the remnants of sebastians camp he couldnt believe it he laughed and his mace hung limp in his hand his legs went weak and he fell to his knees sandra flung her arms about him and he felt her lips kiss his forehead you lived she said all smiles buthow why just shut up she said kissing him again jerico forced himself to a stand he saw luther approaching surrounded by four dark paladins his insides turned would they still want his life given their war against his order but why let him go before just to kill him now i told you to stay away luther said just out of reach of their bows i told you to flee and not play the hero and you he looked at kaide who approached the entrance with his men watching luthers army i told you the same did i not warn you did i not say you would be denied karaks mercy jerico did not understand his actions his words they didnt connect didnt make sense and then luther lifted his arm pointed his finger at sandra and whispered the tip flared black lightning shot forward dark as midnight thunder roared sandra screamed and jerico screamed with her as she collapsed in his arms her eyes were wide and her mouth open her chest did not move clutching her jerico could only look at her body in shock he thought to heal her but she was dead already her heart burst by the spell her soul was gone with a shaking hand he touched her cheek brushed her lips with his fingers he heard shouting cries of rage and sorrow but they were distant muffled in his ears he looked at luther rage in his eyes you monster he gently put her down lifted his mace it didnt matter that he was outnumbered didnt matter all that luther had just done didnt matter what was right or wrong or if he died trying he would kill the priest the dark paladins leapt in the way he blocked their strikes with his shield but each one sent a jolt of pain through his arm his mace struck the armor of one but it could not penetrate fury gave him strength but he was still tired and vastly outnumbered swords hit his armor and the bruises swelled jerico continued on enduring them fighting them away he would reach luther would look upon sandras cruel murderer and then he was through beaten and weary luther lifted a hand and before jerico could strike a bolt of shadow struck him in the chest he gasped fighting for breath a second bolt followed this one hitting his throat the muscles in his neck tightened and spots swam before his eyes as his lungs threatened to burst unable to stand he collapsed to his knees once more luther stood over him and he leaned down so he could put a hand on jericos head and whisper at least you are wise enough to kneel he said now do you understand jerico you have done all that i wished and little more you are insignificant just a puppet to my desires go off into the wilderness and die there is no longer a place for you in this world luther pushed him onto his back when he hit it knocked the air from his chest fighting through the agonizing pain jerico drew a breath then another a heavy ringing filled his ears and he heard the priest call for the others to prepare for their march south rolling onto his stomach he tried to stand but could not tears blurring his vision he looked back to the castle saw kaide on his knees his little sisters body in his arms the bandit leader cried out wordlessly whatever rage that dwelt in his heart now magnified tenfold what little strength jerico had left drained away his fingers clawing the dirt he pressed his face into the grass and sobbed a broken man they pulled their boat off the gihon so they might walk the final mile porter led the way looking strangely spry and alive in the growing light of the blood moon daniel followed him content to let the man lead it was his plan after all stay low porter told them a single alarm and well all be dining in the abyss before the nights over there were only five of them a small enough force to slip in and out of the fortification without notice their true force marched for willshire where battle might be fought without towers and high walls if they took cyrics head most of their problems vanished but just in case they needed robert no matter how much the king might hate his family he couldnt sit idly by if the knight knelt before his throne and told of the usurpation of his tower treason was still treason even when committed by priests the trees thinned out the closer they came to the tower daniel felt his nerves rise and his heart quicken this was it the first major obstacle it all depended upon how numerous the guards were and how alert when they saw the torches and the handful of men upon the walls daniel let out a sigh of relief a skeleton crew he said cyric must be gone after all id be pissed to know if my tower were as lightly guarded in my absence porter said laziness and lack of discipline is what that is what it is is a lucky break said one of the other soldiers we ready to swim aye daniel said lets go the walls surrounding the tower went deep into the river but once around it the way was clear from their inspection of the defenses the few men guarding the walls were all stationed along the southern end they did not watch the opposite shore or the north they no longer guarded against the creatures of the wedge as was their purpose they watched for a human army daniel and his men were all smeared with mud wore no armor and brandished only short swords light and small enough for them to swim without difficulty plus a few extra supplies just in case things went terribly wrong beyond the reach of the towers torches the five circled around to the north nothing but black and brown shapes in the far distance when they reached the other side they slipped into the gihon submerging all but their heads damn thats cold muttered one no words porter said were too close now going limp they floated aiming for the wall within the river normal circumstances would have had a guard atop it and as they neared they saw a man sitting there his back to them his armor was that of karaks mercenaries watching the courtyard daniel realized and he pointed to make sure the other four saw boisterous sounds of cheers and song met their ears as they floated closer daniel clenched his jaw tight to keep his teeth from chattering carefully he swam toward the wall then went limp again letting the water bump him against it he lay flat until all five were gathered glancing up daniel waited for the light of a torch or even a single glance downward to show them as odd shapes in the reflected moonlight this was it the most vulnerable part of their plan porter lifted three fingers then counted down at one he alone pushed off and floated around the wall all they could do was wait and listen after several minutes they heard a soft gasp then the sound of armor hitting stone another minute later porter leaned over from atop the wall and beckoned them to come pushing off daniel led the others around and onto dry ground they kept their backs to the wall in the deep shadows cast by the scattered torches he could see the men on the opposite wall and he tried not to panic and convince himself he could not be seen one of the soldiers with him a young darkhaired man named slint tapped him on the shoulder lion the man mouthed lifting his shoulders to accentuate the question daniel shook his head they saw no sign of it yet if they were blessed the two horrible creatures would be in willshire or even better back in the abyss from whence they came daniel pointed to his eyes telling them to stay alert on the far side many tents filled the killing field they could all hear the ruckus it was a time of celebration just as darius had insisted they were gathered about bonfires roasting meat and drinking themselves stupid no wonder the few men on guard were inattentive and kept their attention focused toward the interior the fires would also ruin their vision something daniel was plenty thankful for besides the men on the walls the only other guards were two stationed at the doors of the tower both looking tired and leaning against the building daniel kept his anger in check when he saw they were both recruits of theirs men who had bowed the knee to karak and turned against their commander thered be no mercy not for them daniel drew his sword pressed his back to the wall and crept along above them porter did the same tracking their progress when they reached another guard they stopped and waited porter snuck behind him for the man watched the north daniel winced as he heard the mans body hit the ground on the opposite side of the wall too much noise but it seemed no one heard they continued on after porter gave them the go ahead once theyd crossed beyond the two guards line of sight they ensured no eyes watched and then made a break for the tower no time to waste daniel knew he hurried to the tower door no hesitation no commands he trusted his men to follow the closest of the two guards died before ever realizing he was under attack as daniel held his hand over the mans mouth and twisted the blade hed stuck in his back the other let out a soft yelp before two of his soldiers thrust their swords through his throat and belly the dying cry went unnoticed amidst the songs of the mercenaries testing the door daniel found it unlocked throwing it open he gestured for the other three to hurry they dragged the bodies inside and daniel quickly followed slamming the door shut behind him the sounds of revelry quieted once within knowing whatever time they had was dwindling fast daniel led the way toward the stairs the second anyone noticed the missing guards and was sober enough to look into the matter theyd be caught they needed to have rescued robert and vanished long before then i hear snores slint whispered into daniels ear daniel paused a moment then nodded men were sleeping in the adjacent rooms the three looked to him and he could tell they wanted orders kill them he whispered back ill get robert the three opened the door and like wraiths in the night they slipped inside with swords drawn as daniel climbed the circular steps leading to roberts chambers he heard a sound that made his heart freeze it was the roar of a lion and it was furious racing up the steps he found a window overlooking the wall porter hid upon there atop the stone was one of the lions of karak porters body flopping as the creature shook it in its jaws daniel forced himself to look away at the top of the steps daniel found a mercenary rushing down to investigate a quick stab underneath the ridge of his breastplate sent him toppling daniel yanked free the iron key attached to his belt then continued on stopping at roberts door he unlocked it and thrust it open time to go sir he said then froze his jaw dropped and his hands trembled no he whispered gods no robert sat in a chair his waist and legs strapped to it with chains before him was a table rows of parchment and a single candle he held a quill in his gray lifeless hand his eyes were open and his mouth hung limp his flesh was already rotting his tongue cut from his throat but he still livedif living was what it could be called a wicked cut remained open across his throat his clothes and skin below it stained red but the wound itself did not bleed what have they done to you daniel asked as he heard the lion roar once more robert dipped the quill into an inkwell then carefully wrote a message on the parchment before him daniel stepped forward and he read it with tears in his eyes kill me last order daniel swallowed are you sure he asked the undead mockery of his commander nodded daniel clenched his jaw and wiped away his tears so he might strong might be proud i understand he said it was an honor to serve you robert a true honor he cut off roberts head it fell to the floor rolled once then lay still the rest of the body sagged in the chair all strength vanishing from it daniel stared holding back his grief but not his anger sir daniel turned to see the other three gathered there looking at the corpse with wide eyes cyrics doing daniel said his voice croaking may the bastard suffer for an eternity when we find him we barred the door downstairs slint said the rest of the traitors are dead but the lion daniel said knowing what they feared porter had been found and the lion stalked the tower he looked out the window saw men hurrying to investigate whatever hope they had of escape was gone forgive me he told them i led you to your deaths save the apologies slint said pulling some rope off his back one of their emergency provisions he thrust it into daniels hands youre lord of the blood tower now and our commander any hope of honoring robert is now in your hands daniel looked to the rope then the window and shook his head i wont theyll find me before i ever set foot on the ground not if we distract them the three saluted him with their swords they were willing to die and appeared ready to carry out their plan whether he agreed with it or not taking a deep breath he saluted back i couldnt be more proud of you he told them take as many with you as you can damn right daniel tied the rope to roberts desk which he shifted closer to the window when the tower was built the entrance had faced the river but roberts window faced the gate to the walls so he might always see the arrival of any guests looking down he saw no one watching everyone gathering at the other side from down below he heard a loud banging as something smashed into the barred doors holding the rope in his hands he waited to throw it listening for what he also feared loud cracking then screams they were through daniel offered a prayer for his men then tossed the rope he climbed down fast as possible the rope burning his hands as he slid at a reckless pace hitting the ground he looked about knowing he had no time he wanted to run to the dark side theyd entered but his gut told him otherwise sprinting for the side with the tents he kept his head low whatever celebrations had been going on had clearly halted with nearly every armed man making their way to the walls and tower letting out confused cries and shouting questions about a surprise attack as he weaved through them he heard shouts from up top an arrow struck the ground beside him another just ahead daniel said another word of thanks this time for intoxicated archers a roar behind him curdled his blood he was almost to the river but he dared a glance back the lion chased far ahead of any soldiers still on the ground it barreled through the tents which burst into flame upon contact shit thought daniel shit shit shit he cast aside his sword every bit of his strength going into his pumping legs another roar this time closer the ground seemed to shake with every leap the lion took and it was so close so close something slashed at his back it tore through his clothes and his skin burned with fire but he continued on leaping into the river the pain in his back eased with the cool water and like a madman he swam toward the far side he glanced behind only once to see the lion snarling furiously as it thrashed about massive amounts of steam curled into the air from its skin and when it roared again it was clearly with pain the river might stop the lion but the rest would be in boats in no time reaching the other side daniel paused a moment to catch his breath then ran he knew well the lands of the wedge which grounds were safe and which were occupied by various monsters wishing hed kept his sword he ran deeper into the wedge his back to the tower let them chase but he would not be caught he couldnt be death would not take himnot yet not until he found vengeance for what theyd done to robert cyrics men brought food and water into the barn only once just after dawn darius reluctantly took his share the people of durham were clearly malnourished but if he were to protect them in battle it wouldnt help to do so on an empty stomach is there a way up to that window he asked jacob when he noticed the light streaming in through it the window was up in the loft and in answer jacob pointed to where a ladder had been they broke it when they locked us in here he said where are the rest gregory asked jacob shrugged theyve got plenty at whatever theyre building in the center dont know where the rest are maybe in a home or two locked up like we are time crawled and darius spent much of it pacing and wondering what was going on outside i trust my men to do their job gregory said relaxing in a pile of hay and if theyre noticed interrogated gregory shrugged least we have our weapons well get to die fighting darius chuckled and he leaned against a wall of the barn wishing he could see out youre right gregory that makes it so much better you whine like a child slowly so slowly but the day continued to pass as night approached a cold tension filled the air even locked away the two could sense it could hear it in the way the guards outside the barn talked and in how the noise of the village dwindled the many people around them started to fidget murmur or cry silently darius paced before the door eager for the night to start yet dreading it as well what if they dont come for us jacob asked as the sun began to set they will darius said and if they dont the paladin shrugged ill break the damn door down jacob gestured to where dariuss greatsword lay on the ground times running out if you want to hide it better get started darius looked about the men and women hed told them his plan but he still did not like it who would be best he asked ill do it said an elderly woman darius tried to remember her name ezre reedthat was it garys mother are you sure he asked i already walk with a limp she said no one will question an old woman hiding from the chill darius and gregory exchanged a look your decision said the soldier using some twine they tied his sword to her side the tip at her feet the hilt tucked underneath her armpit she took a few awkward steps a smile lit up her wrinkled face not so heavy as i feared carrying my children was worse darius smiled back good now lets get you protected from that cold cold wind another couple handed over their blanket and they wrapped her from head to toe her elbow hiding the bulge of the handle she clutched the two edges of it and walked again no sign of a weapon excellent gregory said but next time just bring a dagger stay with me near the very back if you can darius told her as she leaned against a wall unable to sit because of the sword when i draw it i might be in a hurry my apologies in advance if i hurt you my son died when that evil man came she told him you could never hurt me more than you did then her bitter words stung but whether that was her intent or not he didnt know looking to gregory he saw the man had hidden his shortsword by tying it against his inner thigh step carefully darius told him earning himself a rude gesture the door was flung open startling them all six soldiers stood there half holding torches the light stung their eyes and several let out cries on your feet all of you said one you all should be proud to bear witness to tonights miracle darius bit his tongue and offered his hand to ezre she took it then began limping along unable to bend her right knee she hobbled forward and put more and more weight against darius he helped her always careful that the blanket did not pull back to reveal the blade hurry it up one of cyrics mercenaries told him darius started to retort but ezre beat him to it hush you ill get there when i get there the soldier blinked for a moment stunned by the outburst then laughed remind me of my own ma he said then struck her across the face hated my ma darius caught her and his heart skipped as he felt the handle of his sword press against him ezre straightened herself out moaning only a little the blanket fell loose covering the blade again the guard did not notice instead turning his back to them and ushering others along im sorry darius whispered to her ill be fine ezre said took worse from my husband for saying less stay near the back when we take our place start untying the twine she lifted a curled hand as they walked toward the center of the village far behind the other people of durham my hands cant thread a needle like they used to she said youll have to do it he nodded not sure how he would do it but knowing he had little choice in the matter trying to fight his nerves he brought his attention to the spectacle at hand a great altar waited in the clearing and it looked like something out of his old lessons at the stronghold stone slabs joined together to form an enormous altar propped up by wood where necessary at least four men could lie flat on top of it but darius felt certain that cyric would do just one at a time he wanted this to last he wanted to revel in his return to the old ways darius hoped to ruin all his fun they stopped at the back of the crowd soldiers kept them separated from the original inhabitants of willshire who were lined up on the opposite side of the altar tied to it were the twenty hed seen the night before they looked haggard and tired and he knew many of them theyd endured the wolfmen survived velixars assault and now this it was amazing that any still clung to life given the horrors theyd faced if ashhur were kind hed make sure this was the last standing at the center of the altar was cyric the very sight of him twisted dariuss stomach his eyes were a deep red they werent the burning fire of velixars but his smile his robes were all eerily similar most remarkable was how young he was and how overwhelmed he was by his faith beside him was a paladin of karak steadfast and quiet as he protected his master an enormous ax strapped to his back darius vaguely recognized him from his time training in the stronghold an old veteran named salaul a joyous night cyric kept repeating such a joyous night gregory slipped through the crowd and took up a spot beside him see the others darius asked speaking low as if he were just muttering to himself behind cyric the house with two windows darius saw the building but the windows looked empty to him gavin and kris believe so lets pray their arrows are accurate the other three gregory nodded toward the large group of people from willshire hes in there spoke to him for a moment no one came in or out we should have themshit cyric had been speaking and then he gestured grandly toward the road marching in was a small group of mercenaries about fifteen in number in the center walked a woman wearing a silver crown upon her forehead a long violet cloak and armor that was both regal and deadly with its sleek lines and dark silver hue valessa darius whispered the crowd parted as if they were royalty cyric beckoned her to join him upon the altar and she did accepting his hand reluctantly her face was an emotionless mask and darius could not read it something about it didnt feel right though where was her smile where was that same triumphant faith that cyric exuberated with every movement he made and then came the lion fire burned across its molten skin and darius felt terror grip his heart it was like something out of the tales he used to listen to as a child when his teachers would lay them down to bed in the stronghold the ancient times when karak walked the land his armies of wolf bird and lion at his side welcome valessa my queen cyric said to her before turning his attention to the lion welcome kayne you two are my most honored guests let it all be done in the name of karak kayne said sending fear rippling through the gathered crowds indeed cyric said smiling in karaks name darius took in their numbers he counted about sixty in total not including the more dangerous players like valessa or the dark paladin the numbers would be in their favor for the most part but how many might kayne kill how great was cyrics power as for valessa she would have to be his first target he realized no one else could harm her and she would tear through their ranks welcome all of you cyric cried and as his voice thundered over them suddenly many times louder than before the crowd quieted but for the soft sobs of a few tied to the altar this night this most sacred night will be one for all of dezrel to remember consider yourselves blessed to bear witness consider yourselves beloved few look upon their god while still walking this world but you shall all of you shall he gestured to those at the altar these here spoke out against karak they spoke out against me they dared believe themselves wiser than gods they dared believe they could turn the worldly law to their side could ally with the imperfect structures of man to bring down the divine constructs of our priesthood they will atone for this for i am not here to destroy but to save the old ways will reignite true faith in dezrel that faith will preserve them purify them instead of eternal condemnation burning them away in karaks fire true order let it be known he reached his hand to valessa and she gave him one of her crimson daggers with a nod from cyric the dark paladin went to the first of the many tied to the altar he was a man darius knew well jeremy hangfield the wealthiest and most influential man in durham hed lost a lot of weight leaving him haggard and thin he didnt resist as they cut him free and dragged him to the wood steps the dark paladin held him down but cyric would not be satisfied his daughter too he said a stabbing pain hit dariuss gut all around him people stood frozen as if unwilling to believe it ezre turned away and she pressed herself against darius as if crying hurry now she whispered take your sword damn you darius reached his hand underneath her blanket and clutched the hilt there would be no time to untie the twine their walk over had loosened the ties enough that he could lift the sword straight up his fingers tightened and he stared at the altar drawing now would risk ruining their plan but how could he wait valessa was the one to get her slicing jessie hangfield free from the altar and tugging on her wrist jeremy struggled but the dark paladin kept him pinned the edge of his axe pressed against his neck a glorious night cyric cried a night to remember do not weep do not know fear let the blood spill upon the altar and with it cleanse away their failures their transgressions against the most holy and true we abide by the highest law what are you waiting for ezre asked him as darius watched are you a coward not yet darius gregory said beside him no longer needing to whisper because of the crowd damn it not yet hell kill her just a little girl i said not yet thats an order jessie lay flat against the stone and her sobs rent dariuss heart he felt ezre against him waiting for him to take the sword and gregorys hand on his shoulder his fingers digging into him with determined strength sixty soldiers stood between him and cyric not counting valessa and the lion revealing their presence now might doom them allbut why else were they there his indecision was enough his inaction all that was necessary he clenched his teeth and begged ashhur not to condemn him for it cyric lifted the dagger above his head as he stood over jeremy the dark paladin rolled him over to expose his heart darius swallowed the crowd went eerily silent as dark power swelled across the blade and then an arrow pierced cyrics hand sending the dagger clattering across the altar and to the ground gavin you idiot gregory said another arrow flew from the window of the home catching cyric in the shoulder the priest roared all his earlier joy and celebration replaced with mindless fury fire spread across his hands and the next few arrows exploded before reaching him the two men dove beneath the window as cyric waved his hand the arrow piercing it shattering the building rocked side to side as dark projectiles of fire struck across it bursting it into flame warriors of karak cried kayne suddenly pulling their attention south an army comes along the road thank ashhur darius whispered the sixty soldiers readied their weapons and rushed to meet the gathered might of those loyal to sir robert two hundred strong kayne led the way and darius hoped the greater numbers might help them endure his unholy might the path to the altar was clear darius carefully pulled his sword free and held it high casting its light across the altar from high above the blood moon shone upon him and he defied it with all his heart with me he cried and together he and gregory rushed the altar cyric had not yet seen for he was casting another spell which exploded the remnants of the home gavin and kris were inside people ran in all directions those from durham not tied were suddenly left unguarded and many of them fled for safety but not all dariuss heart swelled as he saw others rushing the altar yanking at the ropes to free their families and friends many died as the dark paladin swung his axe and valessa stabbed with her dagger but then darius was there his greatsword clashing against the axe and its dark fire a paladin salaul exclaimed stunned damn straight darius shoved the axe aside stepped forward and thrust his foe tried to block but then gregory lunged in his sword could not block but his body did as gregory died dariuss sword pierced the dark paladin through the belly blood spilled across the altar darius twisted the blade then yanked it free the motion sent salauls body tumbling off the side and he landed beside gregorys split corpse seeing the young man slain only increased his fury and he turned it on the remaining two atop the altar darius valessa asked stunned to see him there darius laughed and he attacked again and again his sword with greater reach versus her lone dagger cyric turned to help but then zeke and the others slashed and stabbed with their own weapons you heathens cyric cried to them falling from the altar to avoid their daggers they leapt upon him but he beat them back with fire and shadow darius saw only a little of it for valessa had jumped off the stone toward him and launched into a vicious series of attacks his sword shifted side to side parrying away her thrusts what is this he asked her a grin on his face despite his exhaustion and sorrow what good is that armor what good is that crown what kingdom do you rule with your death i will be redeemed she said youre wrong valessa youll be lady of the dead a princess of graves all hail her majesty he could see the desperation in her eyes and knew she could endure no more her thrust came in wild and he smacked it aside stepping in he swung his sword it passed straight through her waist the armor nothing but an illusion her flesh nothing but shadow the light of his blade burned and her form dwindled changed became only a beaten woman stumbling naked away from him in fear give karak my greetings he said to her thrusting for her neck she screamed dropped her dagger and fled his thrust missed by an inch she was nothing but a shapeless darkness as she ran to cyric who stood over the corpses of gregorys three men all of them were dead but theyd stopped the sacrifice darius lifted his sword determined to not let it all be in vain he pointed it at the priest who looked down at valessa with disgust a night to remember darius said no humor in his voice you were right about that cyric ill rip your heart from your chest cyric said ill crush it between my fingers before the altar cyric turned his blade to the side the light across it burning brighter try it the priest stretched out his hand and a beam of pure darkness shot from his palm darius blocked it with his sword bracing his legs to endure the blast he felt his arms jar felt the incredible strength beat against him but he held his ground he thought of the way jerico had endured far greater of how he had withstood the onslaught of wolfmen as if it were nothing darius would do the same the magic would not defeat him he would prove cyric wrong the night was theirs not karaks cyric ended the attack instead hurling a curse darius felt it latch onto his limbs like invisible chains but he shrugged it off breaking the magic with a plea to ashhur lightning followed but it swirled into the sword and died wheres your strength darius asked slowly approaching fire this time darius leapt to one side then slammed his sword into the dirt the light of his blade flared and the flames could not abide it drawing it free he resumed his approach wheres the awesome power cyric clapped his hands together summoning a thick wall of shadow darius cut through it like it was paper i thought you were a god cyrics eyes were full of fear his strength was insufficient hed been challenged and defeated to dariuss words he had no counter power swelled across his hands and darius prepared for one last barrage one last attempt to prove his might instead a dark portal emerged behind the priest swirling with stars as he leapt through valessa grabbed onto him shrieking for him to not abandon her together they vanished within the portal closed and with that they were gone darius fell to his knees and gasped for air the moment passed and his exhaustion returned he could hardly believe what hed done sounds of battle pierced his daze and he looked to the road leading into the village the soldiers still fought and worse the lion still roared the paladin forced himself to a stand clutching his greatsword with both hands that abomination needed to be returned to the abyss from whence it came blood pounding in his ears he ran toward the enemy flank most of karaks soldiers had died overwhelmed by their sheer numbers their bodies lay strewn across the road still in haphazard lines kayne however remained the lion tore through their ranks their chainmail nothing to his massive teeth and claws the soldiers struck at his side and thrust for his underbelly but to no avail kayne was too quick too strong a few pieces of rock had chipped off his side and strangely enough it appeared he bled liquid fire to me beast darius cried as he came running trying to sound braver than he felt do not waste your time with pups when you could fight a wolf kayne heard his voice and turned a deep snarl emitted from his throat traitor he rumbled to this darius laughed i was loyal to karak he said karak turned on me sent his followers to kill me and now would have a priest sacrifice hundreds in his name i dare say karaks the one who betrayed us kayne tensed and his claws dug into the hard earth you speak blasphemy and false truths he said ill tear your lying tongue from your head the lion leapt reaching his full speed in the blink of an eye darius fought his instincts to dodge aside for ashhurs voice did not cry retreat in his ear nor danger it told him to stand trusting it he thrust his greatsword to meet kaynes charge putting every ounce of his strength into the attack the lion filled dariuss vision throat full of fire roar rolling against him like a physical force but a light shone from his blade and it grew and grew kayne tried to bat the sword aside as he descended to clear the way for his kill his paws sliced clean off instead the sword remained unmoved mouth open charge in full kayne fell upon darius the paladins blade went up to the hilt inside his jaws the tip piercing out his back fire burned and darius felt its heat but the light enveloped him protected him rock cracked turned molten and rolled in all directions as the creature howled and broke in the center of the corpse darius stood sword held in hand as the fire slowly dwindled away he took a deep breath then smiled at his feet the grass was burned black but for where he stood thank you he whispered then lifted his sword high so all there might see its immaculate shine cyric had fled the lion was dead ashhur had not abandoned them just yet valessa did not know what to expect as she exited the shadow portal she could barely think through the pain that filled her stumbling out she fell to knees that became her arms then her hands then back again to her knees her form kept fighting twisting and she could barely remember who she once was her eyes opened and she looked about they were in rolling hills the grass a pale yellow glancing behind her she saw a river the wedge she asked was that where hed taken her it seems appropriate cyric said his voice was behind her and with great effort she turned to face him blood dripped from his hand and more stained his robe from where the arrow remained embedded in his shoulder his head dipped low as if he were humbled for the first time in his life most frightening were his eyes the wild angry loathing that grew with every word he spoke is this not where we trap the monsters and other frightening creatures no longer of use to us cyric valessa asked struggling to stand she felt herself coming together and pale skin started to form across the shadow that was her what are you doing ashhur has stolen away my victory but the blame is mine karak does not bestow mercy on those who deserve punishment he lifted his hand and from the center of his bleeding palm she saw stars swirling together amid a black void and then the pain hit it was different than when the light of dariuss sword or jericos shield touched her that burned from the outside dissolving away at her being this was so so much worse she felt the very center of her soul cracking from within her limbs shaking her mind breaking into pieces as the very substance holding her together was taken away i should have struck you down the moment i saw you he said as the pain increased the unfinished are all failures in karaks eyes unworthy of a place of honor at his side i gave you a chance yet now we suffer i suffer your burden was to kill darius and you did not you worthless faithless bitch what you feel that is karaks anger his words were becoming a jumble in her mind her skin burst and gray shadows bubbled to the ground to her knees she went clawing wildly at the earth this was how he would repay her she suffered in agony denied an eternity with her god and yet he would blame her for his own failures darius had defeated him as well where was karaks fury for him karak she whispered pleasekaraksave me she prayed for strength for escape from the torment for the mad priest to sufferbut heard only laughter her limbs were gone as were her legs she was nothing but a writhing puddle of shadow struggling to retain form still she could see cyric looming over her nothing but hatred and faith yes she saw it his faith burning bright his skin alive with ethereal fire karak loved him still but why then there was no love for her closing her eyes she cursed her god and fell through the world the rock and stone passed over her as she fell caverns and empty spaces flew past but still she fell she thought to fall forever to see if at the very bottom she might find the abyss her god ruled over but instead she felt water a great river rolling beneath the surface this time she did not fight it despite the horrible pain and discomfort it caused she didnt care for her form didnt care for her survival it carried her for a moment and then at last she slipped from its current and into stone something stopped her from falling further the pain was ebbing however little within the rock her heart hardened and with a tentative hand reaching upward barely more than a tendril of smoke she yearned for the surface it was strange the way it felt as she climbed melding parts of her body with the stone to lunge higher but she endured crawling crawling time meaningless in that darkness the hours passed higher and higher many times she thought herself confused and feared she crawled downward but she fought through the disorientation at last her hand burst through the grass and like a woman emerging from a deep river she crawled upon the surface she didnt know where she was saw nothing but trees and thorn bushes in all directions but it didnt matter the red star still burned in the sky and she followed it hours passed as she ran her form steadily regaining strength her surroundings grew familiar and she realized she was on the correct side of the gihon thankfully on and on to darius the night was young when she found daniels men camped at the outset of willshire darius was among them she knew but they would not let her pass not if they recognized her adopting the look and dress of a plain village woman she wandered through them smiling meekly at any who looked her way in the center she found dariuss tent him sitting within it his sword was at his side but so far it lacked its damnable glow darius she said stepping within he looked up from his bed confused but then she dropped the facade and stood naked before him her own body her own face with nothing to hide he reached for his sword but she did not move have you not had enough he asked his hand closing about the hilt i have she said even as her skin flaked away under the growing light of his sword i promise you nothing for the blood between us remains but that is not why i am here she hated doing so but she must valessa fell to one knee bowed her head then looked up into dariuss eyes so he might see the searing hatred in them help me she asked help me kill cyric epilogue cyric wandered further into the wild lands trapped between the rivers there were many creatures there he knew hed read the books seen the maps when the gods war had sundered the land ashhur and karak had given strength and form to the beasts so they might fight as soldiers but now the creatures had abandoned their gods or was it their gods who had abandoned them he didnt know he didnt care the camp of wolfmen was small but it would grow larger with time he trusted his strength the strength of karak darius was only a dying vessel one of the last paladins of ashhur that his enemy might throw at him desperate and wild in faith such a man would fall in time at the edge of their camp the weaker wolfmen slept cyric stopped just before them for he knew his scent would alert them soon growls confirmed this the first to see him snarled leapt from his sleep and attacked cyric waved his hand crushing his throat with a heavy stone made of shadow two more leapt at him and with a word he burst the blood from their eyes and nostrils i have not come to fight he told them as more and more gathered where is your leader i am pack leader said a large wolfman pushing through the rest his claws were sharp his whole body lean with muscle cyric smiled at him my name is cyric priest of your god karak the god you worshipped before you turned to the moon and in falseness gave her your faith you speak lies said their leader i will enjoy the taste of your blood on my tongue try if you wish the strongest leads the tribe after all the wolfman feinted a direct rush then circled to the side before leaping it was a clever move but cyric did not fall for it clapping his hands together he summoned manacles born of dark magic they broke through the dirt and wrapped about the wolfmans wrists and ankles slamming him to the ground all around him the rest of the tribe yipped with fear a small tribe maybe thirty at most cyric knew they would be the first of many and he also knew that as a human he could never inspire their complete loyalty he looked down at the captured wolfman then knelt mere inches from his snapping teeth i will give you great power cyric said all you must do is accept the love of karak and swear your life to me can you do that if you do i will help you make your tribe a thousand strong at my side you will fight as we retake the north in karaks name heathen men will die before you and your feasting will be great what do you say the wolfman looked up at him with startling intelligence in his eyes the tribe fell silent as they waited for an answer from their pack leader i will serve karak if karak will lead us to blood and battle he said excellent cyric banished the chains rise wolf and tell me your name the creature rose to his full height towering over him his voice deepened as he spoke a heavy growl eager for conflict redclaw said the wolf l uther knelt before his bed hands clasped in prayer they were not far from lord sebastians castle and he expected an envoy from him at any time not that it would matter his host marched beside him and sebastians army had been left tattered and in ribbons if sebastian wanted to retain power he would have to turn to them regardless of his own feelings all for you luther prayed all i have done i do for you the lawless shall be broken upon the immovable law in time the north will be yours not just in heart but in deed and law may i remain strong and break the will of sebastian we have left him nothing as you desired let him know his strength is in his loyalty to karak not his own might and men movement at the entrance of his large tent alerted him to a mans arrival luther turned saw one of his paladins holding a scroll my priest forgive me said the paladin yes grevus the paladin crossed his arms and he looked uneasy weve received disturbing reports from the towers its about cyric luther sighed and with a groan rose from his knees what has my pupil done now dont bother reading the message just tell me grevuss cheek twitched we hear hes overthrown sir robert at the blood tower and also assaulted the village of willshire worsei do not know what to make of this my priest perhaps the messenger lies or has heard wrong out with it luther said feeling anger growing in his breast luther among many other things it says cyric preaches that he is karak made flesh now free to walk the land and remake it in his image luther swallowed his throat suddenly dry he nodded to the lengthy message the paladin held in his hand tell me everything
