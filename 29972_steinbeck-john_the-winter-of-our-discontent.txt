ellen you spoil them rotten eth you know you do farewell o ship of state he said and slammed the screen door after him and went out into the greengold morning he looked back at the fine old house his fathers house and his greatgrandfathers whitepainted shiplap with a fanlight over the front door and adam decorations and a widows walk on the roof it was deepset in the greening garden among lilacs a hundred years old thick as your waist and swelling with buds the elms of elm street joined their tops and yellowed out in newcoming leaf the sun had just cleared the bank building and flashed on the silvery gas tower starting the kelp and salt smell from the old harbor only one person in early elm street mr bakers red setter the bankers dog red baker who moved with slow dignity pausing occasionally to sniff the passenger list on the elm trunks good morning sir my name is ethan allen hawley ive met you in pissing red baker stopped and acknowledged the greeting with a slow sway of his plumed tail ethan said i was just looking at my house they knew how to build in those days red cocked his head and reached with a hind foot to kick casually at his ribs and why not they had the money whale oil from the seven seas and spermaceti spermaceti mobydick or the whale by herman melville was one of steinbecks two favorite novels according to elaine steinbeck don quixote was the other spermaceti is mentioned in chapter the great heidelburgh tun do you know what spermaceti is red gave a whining sigh i see you dont a light lovely rosesmelling oil from the head cavity of the sperm whale read mobydick dog thats my advice to you the setter lifted his leg on the castiron hitching post at the gutter turning to walk away ethan said over his shoulder and make a book report you might teach my son he cant even spell spermaceti oror anything elm street runs at an angle into high street two blocks from the old ethan allen hawley house halfway down the first block a delinquent gang of english sparrows were fighting on the newcoming lawn of the elgar house not playing but rolling and picking and eyegouging with such ferocity and so noisily that they didnt see ethan approach he stopped to watch the battle birds in their little nests agree he said so why cant we now theres a bunch of horse crap for you you kids cant get along even on a pretty morning and youre the bastards saint francis was nice to screw he ran at them kicking and the sparrows rose with a whispered roar of wings complaining bitterly in doorsqueak voices let me tell you this ethan said after them at noon the sun will darken and a blackness will fall on the earth and you will be afraid he came back to the sidewalk and proceeded on his way the old phillips house in the second block is a boarding house now joey morphy teller at the first national came out of the front door he picked his teeth and straightened his tattersall waistcoat and said hi to ethan i was just going to call on you mr hawley he said why do they call it good friday its from the latin said joey goodus goodilius goodum meaning lousy joey looked like a horse and he smiled like a horse raising a long upper lip to show big square teeth joseph patrick morphy joey morphy joeyboythe morpha real popular guy for one only a few years at new baytown a joker who got off his gags veilyeyed like a poker player but he whinnied at other peoples jokes whether or not he had heard them a wise guy the morph had the inside dope on everythingand everybody from mafia to mountbattenbut he gave it out with a rising inflection almost like a question that took the smartaleck tone out of it made his listener a party to it so that he could repeat it as his own joey was a fascinating monkeya gambler but no one ever saw him lay down a bet a good bookkeeper and a wonderful bank teller mr baker first national president trusted joey so completely that he let the teller do most of the work the morph knew everyone intimately and never used a first name ethan was mr hawley margie younghunt was mrs younghunt to joey even though it was whispered that he was laying her he had no family no connections lived alone in two rooms and private bath in the old phillips house ate most of his meals at the foremaster grill and bar his banking past was known to mr baker and the bonding company and it was immaculate but joeyboy had a way of telling things that had happened to someone else in a way that made you suspect they had happened to joey and if that was so he had really been around not taking credit made people like him even more he kept his fingernails very clean dressed well and sharply and always had a clean shirt and a shoeshine the two men strolled together down elm street toward high ive been meaning to ask you you related to admiral hawley dont you mean admiral halsey admiral halsey william f bull halsey fleet commander in the south pacific during world war ii he took the title of fivestar fleet admiral after the war in the winter manuscript halsey was ethans last name when morphy asks if hes related to admiral halsey ethan responds this way not that i know of ethan said pleased but i guess all halseys are related if you go way back ethan asked weve had lots of captains but i never heard of an admiral in the family i heard your granddad was a whaling captain kind of connected up in my mind with the admiral i guess town like this has got myths said ethan like they say people on my dads side did some pirating way back and my mothers family came over in the mayflower ethan allen ethan allen hero of the american revolution and leader of the green mountain boys dedicated to keeping vermont free from new york control but in he was charged with treason for negotiating with canada to recognize vermont as a british province he wrote reason the only oracle of man a tract outlining his deist ideas ethan allen hawley notes that his ancestors the hawleys got mixed up with vermont allens p joey said my godyou related to him too might be must be said ethan what a dayever see a prettier what was it you wanted to see me about oh yes i guess youre closing the store twelve to three would you make me a couple of

if you dont like guineas you got to admire a guy can build a pushcart into all the property he owns hes pretty cute people dont know how much hes got salted away maybe i shouldnt say that bankers not supposed to tell you didnt tell they had come to the corner where elm angles into high street automatically they stopped and turned to look at the pink brick and plaster mess that was the old bay hotel now being wrecked to make room for the new woolworths the yellowpainted bulldozer and the big crane that swung the wrecking ball were silent like waiting predators in the early morning i always wanted to do that joey said must be a kick to swing that steel ball and see a wall go down i saw enough go down in france ethan said yeah your names on the monument down by the waterfront did they ever catch the robbers that stuck up your friend ethan was sure the friend was joey himself anyone would have been oh sure caught em like mice its lucky robbers arent smart if joeyboy wrote a book how to rob a bank the cops would never catch anybody ethan laughed howd you go about it i got a pipeline mr hawley i just read the papers and i used to know a guy pretty well was a cop you want the twodollar lecture bout six bits worth ive got to open the store ladies and gentlemen said joey i am here this morningno look how do they catch bank robbers number onerecord got caught before number twoget fighting over the profits and someone blows it number threedames cant let dames alone and that ties into number fourthey got to spend that money watch new spenders and you got them so whats your method professor sir simple as socks everything opposite never rob a bank if you ever got caught or booked for anything no confederatesdo it alone and dont tell a soul nobody forget dames and

covers his face and dont talk whos going to recognize him you ever read descriptions by eyewitnesses theyre nuts my cop friend says sometimes when theyd plant him in the lineup he got picked out over and over again people swore their eyes out he did whatever it was thatll be six bits please ethan put his hand in his pocket ill have to owe you ill take it out in sandwiches said joey the two crossed high street and entered the alley that rightangled from the other side joey went in the back door of the first national bank on his side of the alley and ethan unlocked the alley door of marullos fruit and fancy groceries on his side ham and cheese he called on ryelettuce and mayonnaise a little light grayed by the dusty ironbarred window came into the storeroom from the narrow alley ethan paused in the twilight place shelved to the ceiling and stacked with the cartons and wooden cases of canned fruits vegetables fish processed meats and cheese he sniffed for mice among the seminal smells of flour and dried beans and peas the paperandink odor of boxed cereals thick rich sourness of cheeses and sausage reek of hams and bacon ferment of cabbage trimmings lettuce and beet tops from the silvery garbage cans beside the back door perceiving no rusty must of mouse he opened the alley door again and rolled the covered garbage cans into the alley a gray cat darted to get in but he drove it away no you dont he remarked to the cat mice and rats are feed for cats but youre a sausage nibbler aroint aroint term of dismissal begone aroint thee witch from shakespeares macbeth aroint is inscribed in a cement slab outside steinbecks sag harbor retreat an octagonal writing house he called joyous garde you hear mearoint the seated cat was licking a curled pink paw but at the second aroint he hightailed away and scrambled over the board fence behind the bank that must be a magic word ethan said aloud he returned to the storeroom and closed the door after him now through the dusty room to the swinging door of the grocerybut at the cubicle of the toilet he heard the whispering of seeping water he opened the plywood door switched on the light and flushed the toilet then he pushed open the wide door with wirenetted glass peekhole and wedged it open kicking the wood block firmly in with his toe the store was greeny from the drawn shades over the big front windows again shelves to the ceiling filled neatly with gleaming canned and glassed foods a library for the stomach on one sidecounter cash register bags string and that glory in stainless steel and white enamel the cold cabinet in which the compressor whispered to itself ethan flipped a switch and flooded the cold cuts cheeses sausage chops steaks and fish with a cold bluish neon glare a reflected cathedral light filled the store a diffused cathedral light like that of chartres ethan paused to admire it the organ pipes of canned tomatoes the chapels of mustard and olives the hundred oval tombs of sardines unimum et unimorum unimum et joseph fontenrose classical scholar says ethan chants counterfeit latin in something like the black mass to translate malory steinbeck wrote to a california friend that he had to reactivate my limping latin anglosaxon and old french he intoned in a nasal litanic tone uni unimouse quod unibug in omnem unim domineahhhhhmen he sang and he could hear his wife commenting thats silly and besides it might hurt somebodys feelings you cant go around hurting feelings a clerk in a grocery storemarullos grocery storea man with a wife and two darling children when is he alone when can he be alone customers in the daytime wife and kiddies in the evening wife at night customers in the daytime wife and kiddies in the evening bathroomthats when ethan said loudly and right now before i open the sluice oh the dusky musky smellywelly sillybilly timethe slovenlylovely time now whose feelings can i hurt sugarfoot he said to his wife there aint nobody nor nobodys feelings here just me and my unimum unimorum untiluntil i open that goddam front door from a drawer behind the counter by the cash register he took a clean apron and unfolded it and straightened the tapes put it around his thin middle brought the tapes around and back again he reached behind his back with both hands and fumbled a bowknot the apron was long halfway down his shins he raised his right hand cupped loosely palm upward and he declaimed hear me o ye canned pears ye pickles and ye piccalillias soon as it was day as soon as it was day luke the elders of the people and the chief priests and the scribes came together and led him into their council as soon as it was day the buggers went to work early didnt they they didnt waste no time nohow lets see now and it was about the sixth hourthats maybe twelve oclockand there was a darkness over all the earth until the ninth hour and the sun was darkened now how do i remember that good god it took him a long time to diea dreadful long time he dropped his hand and looked wondering at the crowded shelves as though they might answer him you dont speak to me now mary my dumpling are you one of the daughters of jerusalem weep not for me he said weep for yourselves and for your children for if they do these things in a green tree what shall be done in the dry still breaks me up aunt deborah wrought better than she knew its not the sixth hour yetnot yet he raised the green shades on the big windows saying come in day and then he unlocked the front doors enter world he swung the ironbarred doors open and latched them open and the morning sun lay softly on the pavement as it should for in april the sun arose right where the high street ran into the bay ethan went back to the toilet for a broom to sweep the sidewalk a day a livelong day is not one thing but many it changes not only in growing light toward zenith and decline again but in texture and mood in tone and meaning warped by a thousand factors of season of heat or cold of still or multi winds torqued by odors tastes and the fabrics of ice or grass of bud or leaf or blackdrawn naked limbs and as a day changes so do its subjects bugs and birds cats dogs butterflies and people ethan allen hawleys quiet dim and inward day was done the man who swept the morning pavement with metronomic strokes was not the man who could sermonize to canned goods not a unimum unimorum man not even a sillybilly man he gathered cigarette ends and gum wrappers bud cases from the pollenizing trees and simple plain dust in the sweep of his broom and moved the windrow of derelict toward the gutter to await the town men with their silver truck mr baker took his measured decent way from his house on maple street toward the red brick basilica of a first national bank and if his steps were not of equal length who was to know that out of ancient habit he avoided breaking his mothers back good morning mr baker ethan said and held his stroke to save the bankers neat serge pants from dust morning ethan fine morning fine said ethan springs in mr baker groundhog was right again he was he was mr baker paused ive been wanting to talk to you ethan that money your wife got by her brothers willover five thousand isnt it sixtyfive hundred after taxes ethan said well its just lying in the bank ought to be invested like to talk to you about that your money should be working sixtyfive hundred dollars cant do much work sir it can only stand by for emergencies im not a believer in idle money ethan well this also servesjust standing and waiting well this also serves the final line of on his blindness a sonnet by john milton is they also serve who only stand and wait the bankers voice became frosty i dont understand his inflection said he did understand and found it stupid and his tone twisted a bitterness in ethan and the bitterness spawned a lie the broom traced a delicate curve against the pavement its this way sir that money is marys temporary security if anything should happen to me then you should use part of it to insure your life but its only temporary sir that money was marys brothers estate her mother is still living she may live many years i understand old people can be a burden they can also sit on their money ethan glanced at mr bakers face as he said his lie and he saw a trace of color rise out of the bankers collar you see sir if i invested marys money i might lose it the way i lost my own the way my father lost the pot water under the bridge ethanwater under the bridge i know you got burned but times are changing new opportunities opening up i had my opportunity mr baker more opportunity than good sense dont forget i owned this store right after the war had to sell half a block of real estate to stock itthe last of our business property i know ethan im your banker know your business the way your doctor knows your pulse sure you know took me less than two years to damn near go bankrupt had to sell everything but my house to pay my debts you cant take all the blame for that fresh out of the armyno business experience and dont forget you ran smack into a depression only we called it recession some pretty seasoned businessmen went under i went under all right its the first time in history a hawley was ever a clerk in a guinea grocery now thats what i dont understand ethan anybody can go broke what i dont see is why you stay broke a man of your family and background and education it doesnt have to be permanent unless your blood has lost its guts what knocked you out ethan what kept you knocked out ethan started an angry retortcourse you dont understand youve never had itand then he swept a small circle of gum wrappers and cigarette butts into a pyramid and moved the pyramid toward the gutter men dont get knocked out or i mean they can fight back against big things what kills them is erosion they get nudged into failure they get slowly scared im scared long island lighting company might turn off the lights my wife needs clothes my childrenshoes and fun and suppose they cant get an education and the monthly bills and the doctor and teeth and a tonsillectomy and beyond that suppose i get sick and cant sweep this goddam sidewalk course you dont understand its slow it rots out your guts i cant think beyond next months payment on the refrigerator i hate my job and im scared ill lose it how could you understand that how about marys mother i told you she sits on it shell die sitting on it i didnt know i thought mary came from a poor family but i know when youre sick you need medicine or maybe an operation or maybe a shock our people were daring men you know it they didnt let themselves get nibbled to death and now times are changing there are opportunities our ancestors never dreamed of and theyre being picked up by foreigners foreigners are taking us over wake up ethan and how about the refrigerator let it go if you have to and how about mary and the children forget them for a while theyll like you better if you climb out of the hole youre not helping them by worrying about them and marys money lose it if you have to but risk it with care and good advice you dont have to lose it risk isnt loss our people have always been calculatedrisk people and they didnt lose im going to shock you ethan youre letting down the memory of old capn hawley you owe his memory something why he and my daddy owned the belleadair together one of the last built and finest of all whaling bottoms get off your ass ethan you owe the belleadair something you havent paid in guts the hell with the finance company ethan coaxed a reluctant piece of cellophane over the gutters edge with his broom tip he said softly the belleadair burned to the waterline sir i know she did but did that stop us it did not she was insured of course she was well i wasnt i saved my house and nothing else youll have to forget that youre brooding on something past youve got to scrape up some courage some daring thats why i said you should invest marys money im trying to help you ethan thank you sir well get that apron off you you owe that to old capn hawley he wouldnt believe it i guess he wouldnt thats the way to talk well get that apron off if it wasnt for mary and the children forget them i tell youfor their own good theres some interesting things going to happen here in new baytown you can be part of it thank you sir just let me think about it mr morphy says hes going to work when you close at noon im making him some sandwiches want me to make you some no thanks im letting joey do the work hes a good man theres some property i want to look up in the county clerks office that is nice and private there from twelve till three might be something in that for you well talk soon so long he took a long first step to miss a crack and crossed the alley entrance to the front door of the first national bank and ethan smiled at his retreating back he finished his sweeping quickly for people were trickling and fresheting to work now he set the stands of fresh fruit at the entrance of the store then making sure no one was passing he removed three stacked cans of dog food and reaching behind brought out the grim little bag of currency replaced the dog food and ringing no sale on the cash register distributed the twenties tens fives and onedollar bills in their places under the small retaining wheels and in the oaken cups at the front of the cash drawer he segregated the halves quarters dimes nickels and pennies and slammed the drawer shut only a few customers showed up children sent for a loaf of bread or a carton of milk or a pound of forgotten coffee little girls with sleepmessy hair margie younghunt came in pertbreasted in a salmon sweater her tweed skirt clung lovingly in against her thighs and tucked up under her proud fanny but it was in her eyes her brown myopic eyes that ethan saw what his wife could never see because it wasnt there when wives were about this was a predator a huntress artemis artemis goddess of the hunt in greek mythology for pants old capn hawley called it a roving eye it was in her voice too a velvet growl that changed to a thin mellow confidence for wives morning eth margie said what a day for a picnic morning want to take a bet you ran out of coffee if you guess i ran out of alkaseltzer im going to avoid you big night in a small way travelingsalesman story a divorced womans safe brief case of free samples guess youd call him a drummer maybe you know him name of bigger or bogger travels for b b d and d reason i mention it is he said he was coming in to see you we buy from waylands mostly well maybe mr buggers just drumming up business if he feels better than i do this morning say could you give me a glass of water ill take a couple of fizzers now ethan went to the storeroom and brought back a dixie cup of water from the tap she dropped three of the flat tablets in and let them fizz then mud in your eye she said and tossed it back get to work you devils she said i hear youre going to read marys fortune today oh lord i nearly forgot i should go in the business i could made my own fortune mary loves it are you good at it nothing to be good at you let peoplewomen that istalk about themselves and then tell it back to them and they think youve got second sight and tall dark strangers theres that sure if i could read men i wouldnt have pulled the bellywhoppers i have brother did i misread a couple of characters didnt your first husband die no my second peace be to his ashes the son of a no let it ride peace be to his ashes ethan greeted the entering elderly mrs ezyzinski solicitously and lingered over the transference of a quarter of a pound of butter even passed a complimentary word or two about the weather but margie younghunt relaxed and smiling inspected the goldsealed cans of pâté de foie gras and the minuscule jewelcases of caviar in back of the counter by the cash register now said margie when the old lady tottered out muttering to herself in polish nowwhat i was just thinkingif i knew as much about men as i do about women id put out my shingle why dont you teach me about men ethan you know enough maybe too much oh come on dont you have a silly bone in your body want to start now maybe some evening good he said a group mary and you and the two kids subject mentheir weakness and stupidity and how to use them margie ignored his tone dont you ever work lateaccounts first of the month that stuff sure i take the work home she raised her arms over her head and her fingers moused in her hair why she asked cats why to make kittens britches see what you could teach me if you would ethan said and after that and after that matthew they had mocked him they took the robe off from him and put his own raiment on him and led him away to crucify him and as they came out they found a man of cyrene simon by name him they compelled to bear his cross and when they were come unto a place called golgothathat is to say a place of a skull oh for gods sake yesyesthat is correct do you know what a son of a bitch you are yes o daughter of jerusalem suddenly she smiled know what im going to do im going to read one hell of a fortune this morning youre going to be a big shot did you know everything you touch will turn to golda leader of men she walked quickly to the door and then turned back grinning i dare you to live up to it and i dare you not to so long savior how strange the sound of heeltaps on pavement striking in anger at ten oclock everything changed the big glass doors of the bank folded open and a river of people dipped in for money and brought the money to marullos and took away the fancy foods easter calls for ethan was busy as a water skater until the sixth hour struck the angry firebell from its cupola on the town hall clanged the sixth hour the customers drifted away with their bags of baked meats ethan brought in the fruit stands and closed the front doors and then for no reason except that a darkness fell on the world and on him he pulled down the thick green shades and the darkness fell on the store only the neon in the cold counter glared a ghostly blue behind the counter he cut four fat slices of rye bread and buttered them liberally he slid open the cold doors and picked out two slices of processed swiss cheese and three slices of ham lettuce and cheese he said lettuce and cheese when a man marries he lives in the trees he mortared the top slices of bread with mayonnaise from a jar pressed the lids down on the sandwiches and trimmed the bits of lettuce and ham fat from the edges now a carton of milk and a square of waxed paper for wrapping he was folding the ends of the paper neatly when a key rattled in the front door and marullo came in wide as a bear and sackchested so that his arms seemed short and stood out from his body his hat was on the back of his head so that his stiff irongray bangs showed like a cap marullos eyes were wet and sly and sleepy but the gold caps on his front teeth shone in the light from the cold counter two top buttons of his pants were open showing his heavy gray underwear he hooked little fat thumbs in the roll of his pants under his stomach and blinked in the halfdarkness morning mr marullo i guess its afternoon hi kid you shut up good and quick whole towns shut i thought youd be at mass no mass today only day in the year with no mass that so i didnt know that anything i can do for you the short fat arms stretched and rocked back and forth on the elbows

whats wrong well if youll wait a minute ill just take these sandwiches to the bank mr morphy asked for them youre a smart kid you give service thats good ethan went through the storeroom crossed the alley and knocked on the back door of the bank he passed the milk and sandwiches in to joey thanks you didnt need to its service marullo told me keep a couple of cokes cold will you i got dry zeros in my mouth when ethan returned he found marullo peering into a garbage can where do you want to talk mr marullo start here kid he picked cauliflower leaves from the can you cutting off too much just to make them neat cauliflower is by weight you throwing money in the garbage i know a smart greek fella owns maybe twenty restaurants he says the big secret is watch the garbage cans what you throw out

it whats two hundred years you dont come from here two hundred years ago you dont neither now ethan his rage all leaked away saw something that makes a man doubtful of the constancy of the realities outside himself he saw the immigrant guinea fruitpeddler change under his eyes saw the dome of forehead the strong beak nose deepset fierce and fearless eyes saw the head supported on pillared muscles saw pride so deep and sure that it could play at humility it was the shocking discovery that makes a man wonder if ive missed this what else have i failed to see you dont have to talk dago talk he

kid with no reply he said ill let myself out see you soon then suddenly he came close to ethan dont be a fool everybody does it he said everybody and he went rapidly out the door and closed it quietly after him in the darkened silence ethan could hear the low hum of the transformer for the neon light in the cold counter he turned slowly to the piled and tiered audience on the shelves i thought you were my friends you didnt raise a hand for me fairweather oysters fairweather pickles fairweather cakemix no more unimus for you wonder what saint francis would say if a dog bit him or a bird crapped on him would he say thank you mr dog grazie tanto signora bird he turned his head toward a rattling and a knocking and a pounding on the alley door went quickly through the storeroom muttering more customers than if we were open joey morphy staggered in clutching his throat for gods sake he groaned succoror at least pepsicola for i dieth of dryth why is it so dark in here are mine eyes failething too shades pulled down trying to discourage thirsty bankers he led the way to the cold counter and dug out a frosted bottle uncapped it and reached for another guess ill have one too

drifted quietly out through the storeroom and eased the alley door shut ethan raised the shades and opened the store again but there wasnt much tradea few bottleofmilk and loafofbread kids a small lamb chop and can of peas for miss borcher for her hotplate supper people were just not moving about in the street during the halfhour before six oclock while ethan was getting things ready to close up not a soul came in and he locked up and started away before he remembered the groceries for homehad to go back and assemble them in two big bags and lock up over again he had wanted to walk down to the bayside and watch the gray waves among the pilings of the dock and smell the sea water and speak to a seagull standing beak into the wind on a mooring float he remembered a ladypoem written long ago by someone whipped to frenzy by the gliding spiral of a gulls flight the poem began oh happy fowl what thrills thee so and the lady poet had never found out probably didnt want to know the heavy bags of groceries for the holidays discouraged the walk ethan moved wearily across the high street and took his way slowly along elm toward the old hawley house chapter two mary came from the stove and took one of the big grocery bags from him ive got so much to tell you cant wait he kissed her and she felt the texture of his lips whats the matter she asked little tired but you were closed three hours plenty to do i hope you arent gloomy its a gloomy day its been a wonderful day wait till you hear where are the kids upstairs with the radio theyve got something to tell you too trouble now why

light after once it burned for a week you left it on ethan when the children had gone mary said arent you glad theyre in the contest sure if they do it right i cant wait to tell youmargie read me in cards today three times because she said she never saw anything like it three times i saw the cards come up myself oh lord you wont be so suspicious when you hear you always poke fun about tall dark strangers you cant guess what it was about wellyou want to guess he said mary i want to warn you warn me why you dont even know my fortune is you he spoke a harsh bitter word under his breath what did you say i said slim pickings thats what you think but thats not what the cards think three times she threw them cards think they know said mary here she read my cards and it was all about you youre going to be one of the most important men in this townthats what i said most important and its not going to be long either its very soon every card she turned showed money and more money youre going

know what youre doing i know im a good wife and shes a good friend and i dont want to quarrel with the children hearing margie young is the best friend ive got i know you dont like her what i think is youre jealous of my friendsthats what i think i had a happy afternoon and you want to spoil it thats not nice marys face was mottled with angry disappointment and vengeful toward this obstacle to her daydreaming you just sit there mr smart and tear people down you think margie made it all up she didnt because i cut the cards three timesbut even supposing she did why would she do it except to be kind and friendly and offer a little help you tell me that mr smart you find some nasty reason i wish i knew he said it might be pure mischief she hasnt a man or a job it might be mischief mary lowered her voice and spoke with scorn you talk about mischiefyou wouldnt know mischief if it slapped you in the face you dont know what margie goes through why there are men in this town after her all the time big men married men whispering and urgingnasty sometimes she dont know where to turn thats why she needs me a woman friend oh she told me thingsmen you just wouldnt believe why some of them even pretend they dont like her in public and then they sneak to her house or call her up and try to get her to meet themsanctimonious men always preaching morals and then doing like that you talk about mischief did she say who they were no she didnt and thats another proof margie dont want to hurt anybody even if they hurt her but she said there was one i just wouldnt believe she said it would turn my hair gray if i knew ethan took a deep breath and held it and let it out as a huge sigh wonder who it could be mary said the way she said it was like it was somebody we know well and just couldnt believe but she would tell under certain circumstances ethan said softly only if she was forced she said that herself only if she had to if like herhonor or her good name you know who do you spose it could be i think i know you know who me her mouth fell open oh you fool she said if i dont watch you you trap me every time well its better than gloomy a pretty kettle man confesses to sins of the flesh with wifes best friend is laughed to scorn thats not nice talk perhaps man should have denied it then at least his wife would have honored him with suspicion my darling i swear to you by all thats holy that never by word or deed have i ever made a pass at margie younghunt now will you believe im guilty you you dont think im good enough desirable enough in other words you dont think i could make the grade i like jokes you know itbut thats not something to joke about i hope the children havent got into the trunks up there they never put anything back ill try once more fair wife a certain woman initials m yh has surrounded me with traps for reasons known only to herself i am in grave danger of falling into one or more of them why dont you think of your fortune the cards said july and they said it three timesi saw it you are going to get money and lots of money think about that do you love money so much cottontail love money what do you mean do you want money enough so that even necromancy thaumaturgy juju or any other dark practices are justified you said it you started it im not going to let you hide in your words do i love money no i dont love money but i dont love worry either id like to be able to hold up my head in this town i dont like the children to be hangdog because they cant dress as goodas wellas some others id love to hold up my head and money would prop up your head it would wipe the sneers off the faces of your holy ladedas no one sneers at hawley thats what you think you just dont see it maybe because i dont look for it are you throwing your holy hawleys up at me no my darling its not much of a weapon any more well im glad you found it out in this town or any other town a hawley grocery clerk is still a grocery clerk do you blame me for my failure no of course i dont but i do blame you for sitting wallowing in it you could climb out of it if you didnt have your oldfashioned fancypants ideas everybodys laughing at you a grand gentleman without money is a bum the word exploded in her head and she was silent and ashamed im sorry ethan said you have taught me somethingmaybe three things rabbit footling mine three things will never be believedthe true the probable and the logical i know now where to get the money to start my fortune where ill rob a bank the little bell of the timer on the stove took up a slowspaced pinging mary said go call the children the casseroles ready tell them to turn out the light she listened to his tread chapter three my wife my mary goes to her sleep the way you would close the door of a closet so many times i have watched her with envy her lovely body squirms a moment as though she fitted herself into a cocoon she sighs once and at the end of it her eyes close and her lips untroubled fall into that wise and remote smile of the ancient greek gods she smiles all night in her sleep her breath purrs in her throat not a snore a kittens purr for a moment her temperature leaps up so that i can feel the glow of it beside me in the bed then drops and she has gone away i dont know where she says she does not dream she must of course that simply means her dreams do not trouble her or trouble her so much that she forgets them before awakening she loves to sleep and sleep welcomes her i wish it were so with me i fight off sleep at the same time craving it i have thought the difference might be that my mary knows she will live forever that she will step from the living into another life as easily as she slips from sleep to wakefulness she knows this with her whole body so completely that she does not think of it any more than she thinks to breathe thus she has time to sleep time to rest time to cease to exist for a little on the other hand i know in my bones and my tissue that i will one day soon or late stop living and so i fight against sleep and beseech it even try to trick it into coming my moment of sleep is a great wrench an agony i know this because i have awakened at this second still feeling the crushing blow and once in sleep i have a very busy time my dreams are the problems of the day stepped up to absurdity a little like men dancing wearing the horns and masks of animals i sleep much less in time than mary does she says she needs a great deal of sleep and i agree that i need less but i am far from believing that there is only so much energy stored in a body augmented of course by foods one can use it up quickly the way some children gobble candy or unwrap it slowly theres always a little girl who saves part of her candy and so has it when the gobblers have long since finished i think my mary will live much longer than i she will have saved some of her life for later come to think of it most women live longer than men good friday has always troubled me even as a child i was deep taken with sorrow not at the agony of the crucifixion but feeling the blighting loneliness of the crucified and i have never lost the sorrow planted by matthew and read to me in the clipped tight speech of my new england greataunt deborah perhaps it was worse this year we do take the story to ourselves and identify with it today marullo instructed me so that for the first time i understood it in the nature of business right afterward i was offered my first bribe thats an odd thing to say at my age but i dont remember any other i must think about margie younghunt is she an evil thing what is her purpose i know she has promised me something and threatened me if i dont accept it can a man think out his life or must he just tag along so many nights i have lain awake hearing my marys little purring beside me if you stare into darkness red spots start swimming on your eyes and the time is long mary so loves her sleep that i have tried to protect her in it even when the electric itch burned on my skin she wakens if i leave the bed it worries her because her only experience with sleeplessness has been in illness she thinks i am not well this night i had to get up and out her breath purred gently and i could see the archaic smile on her mouth maybe she dreamed of good fortune of the money i was about to make mary wants to be proud it is odd how a man believes he can think better in a special place i have such a place have always had it but i know it isnt thinking i do there but feeling and experiencing and remembering its a safety placeeveryone must have one although i never heard a man tell of it secret quiet movement often awakens a sleeper when a deliberate normal action does not also i am convinced that sleeping minds wander into the thoughts of other people i caused myself to need the bathroom and when it was so got up and went and afterward i went quietly downstairs carrying my clothes and dressed in the kitchen mary says i share other peoples troubles that dont exist maybe that is so but i did see a little possible scene play out in the dimlighted kitchenmary awakening and searching the house for me and her face troubled i wrote a note on the grocery pad saying darlingim restless have gone for a walk be back soon i think i left it squarely in the center of the kitchen table so that if the light was turned on at the wall switch it would be the first thing seen then i eased the back door open and tasted the air it was chilly smelled of a crusting of white frost i muffled up in a heavy coat and pulled a knitted sailors cap down over my ears the electric kitchen clock growled it said quarter of three i had been lying watching the red spots in the dark since eleven our town of new baytown is a handsome town an old town one of the first clear and defined whole towns in america its first settlers and my ancestors i believe were sons of those restless treacherous quarrelsome avaricious seafaring men who were a headache to europe under elizabeth took the west indies for their own under cromwell and came finally to roost on the northern coast holding charters from the returned charles stuart elizabeth cromwell charles stuart elizabeth i daughter of king henry viii and his second wife anne boleyn ruled as queen of england and ireland from oliver cromwell helped defeat the royalists in the english civil war and ruled as lord protector from until his death charles stuart charles ii restored the monarchy after the english interregnum they successfully combined piracy and puritanism which arent so unalike when you come right down to it both had a strong dislike for opposition and both had a roving eye for other peoples property where they merged they produced a hardbitten surviving bunch of monkeys i know about them because my father made me know he was a kind of high amateur ancestor man and ive always noticed that ancestor people usually lack the qualities of the ones they celebrate my father was a gentle wellinformed illadvised sometimes brilliant fool singlehanded he lost the land money prestige and future in fact he lost nearly everything allens and hawleys had accumulated over several hundred years lost everything but the nameswhich was all my father was interested in anyway father used to give me what he called heritage lessons thats why i know so much about the old boys maybe thats also why im a clerk in a sicilian grocery on a block hawleys used to own i wish i didnt resent it so much it wasnt depression or hard times that wiped us out all that came from starting to say new baytown is a pretty town i turned right on elm street instead of left and walked fast up to porlock which is a cockeyed parallel with high wee willie our fat constable would be dozing in his police car on the high and i didnt want to pass the time of night with him what you doing up so late eth got yourself a little piece of something wee willie gets lonesome and loves to talk and then later he talks about what he talked about quite a few small but nasty scandals have grown out of willies loneliness the day constable is stonewall jackson smith thats not a nickname he was christened stonewall jackson and it does set him apart from all the other smiths i dont know why town cops have to be opposites but they usually are stoney smith is a man who wouldnt give away what day it is unless he were on the stand under oath chief smith runs the police work of the town and hes dedicated studies the latest methods and has taken the fbi training in washington i guess hes as good a policeman as you are likely to find tall and quiet and with eyes like little gleams of metal if you were going in for crime the chief would be a man to avoid all this came from my going over to porlock street to avoid talking to wee willie its on porlock that the beautiful houses of new baytown are you see in the early eighteen hundreds we had over a hundred whaling bottoms when the ships came back from a year or two out as far as the antarctic or the china sea they would be loaded with oil and very rich but they would have touched at foreign ports and picked up things as well as ideas thats why you see so many chinese things in the houses on porlock street some of those old captainowners had good taste too with all their money they brought in english architects to build their houses thats why you see so much adam influence and greek revival adam influence and greek revival robert adam was a renowned neoclassical scottish architect and interior designer greek revival is a late neoclassical movement in architecture inspired by greek design architecture on porlock street it was that period in england but with all the fanlights and fluted columns and greek keys they never neglected to put a widows walk on the roof the idea was that the faithful homebound wives could go up there to watch for returning ships and maybe some of them did my family the hawleys and the phillipses and the elgars and the bakers were older they stayed put on elm street and their houses were what is called early american peak roofs and shiplap siding thats the way my house the old hawley house is and the giant elms are as old as the houses porlock street has kept its gas street lamps only there are electric globes in them now in the summer tourists come to see the architecture and what they call the oldworld charm of our town why does charm have to be oldworld i forget how the vermont allens got mixed up with the hawleys it happened pretty soon after the revolution i could find out of course up in the attic somewhere there will be a record by the time father died my mary was pretty tired of hawley family history so when she suggested that we store all the things in the attic i understood how she felt you can get pretty tired of other peoples family history mary isnt even new baytown born she came from a family of irish extraction but not catholic she always makes a point of that ulster family she calls them she came from boston no she didnt either i got her in boston i can see both of us maybe more clearly now than then a nervous frightened second lieutenant hawley with a weekend pass and the soft petalcheeked sweetsmelling darling of a girl and triply all of those because of war and textbooks how serious we were how deadly serious i was going to be killed and she was prepared to devote her life to my heroic memory it was one of a million identical dreams of a million olive uniforms and cotton prints and it might well have ended with the traditional dear john letter except that she devoted her life to her warrior her letters sweet with steadfastness followed me everywhere round clear handwriting in dark blue ink on light blue paper so that my whole company recognized her letters and every man was curiously glad for me even if i hadnt wanted to marry mary her constancy would have forced me to for the perpetuation of the world dream of fair and faithful women she has not wavered not in the transplanting from boston irish tenancy to the old hawley house on elm street and she never wavered in the slow despondency of my failing business in the birth of our children or in the paralysis of my long clerkship she is a waiteri can see that now and i guess she had at lengthy last grown weary of waiting never before had the iron of her wishes showed through for my mary is no mocker and contempt is not her tool she has been too busy making the best of too many situations it only seemed remarkable that the poison came to a head because it had not before how quickly the pictures formed against the sound of frostcrunching footsteps on the night street theres no reason to feel furtive walking in the early morning in new baytown wee willie makes little jokes about it but most people seeing me walking toward the bay at three in the morning would suppose i was going fishing and not give it another thought our people have all sorts of fishing theories some of them secret like family recipes and such things are respected and respectable the street lights made the hard white frost on the lawns and sidewalks glint like millions of tiny diamonds such a frost takes a footprint and there were none ahead i have always from the time i was a child felt a curious excitement walking in new unmarked snow or frost it is like being first in a new world a deep satisfying sense of discovery of something clean and new unused undirtied the usual nightfolk the cats dont like to walk on frost i remember once on a dare i stepped out barefoot on a frosty path and it felt like a burn to my feet but now in galoshes and thick socks i put the first scars on the glittering newness where porlock crosses torquay thats where the bicycle factory is just off hicks street the clean frost was scarred with long footdragged tracks danny taylor a restless unsteady ghost wanting to be somewhere else and dragging there and wanting to be somewhere else danny the town drunk every town has one i guess danny taylorso many town heads shook slowly from side to sidegood family old family last of the line good education didnt he have some trouble at the academy why doesnt he straighten up hes killing himself with booze and thats wrong because dannys a gentleman its a shame begging money for booze its a comfort that his parents arent alive to see it it would kill thembut theyre dead already but thats new baytown talking in me danny is a raw sorrow and out of that a guilt i should be able to help him ive tried but he wont let me danny is as near to a brother as i ever had same age and growing up same weight and strength maybe my guilt comes because i am my brothers keeper and i have not saved him with a feeling that deep down excuseseven valid onesgive no relief taylorsas old a family as hawleys or bakers or any of the others in childhood i can remember no picnic no circus no competition no christmas without danny beside me as close as my own right arm maybe if we had gone to college together this wouldnt have happened i went to harvardluxuriated in languages bathed in the humanities lodged in the old the beautiful the obscure indulged myself with knowledge utterly useless in running a grocery store as it developed and always i wished danny could be with me on that bright and excited pilgrimage but danny was bred for the sea his appointment to the naval academy was planned and verified and certain even when we were kids his father sewed up the appointment every time we got a new congressman three years with honors and then expelled it killed his parents they say and it killed most of danny all that remained was this shuffling sorrowthis wandering night sorrow cadging dimes for a pint of skullbuster i think the english would say hes let the side down and that always wounds the letdowner more than the side dannys a night wanderer now an earlymorning man a lonely dragging thing when he asks for a quarter for skullbuster his eyes beg you to forgive him because he cant forgive himself he sleeps in a shack in back of the boat works where wilburs used to be shipbuilders i stooped over his track to see whether he was headed home or away by the scuff of the frost he was going out and i might meet him any place wee willie wouldnt lock him up what would be the good there was no question where i was going i had seen and felt and smelled it before i got out of bed the old harbor is pretty far gone now after the new breakwater went in and the municipal pier sand and silt crept in and shallowed that once great anchorage sheltered by the jagged teeth of whitsun reef and where once were shipways and ropewalks and warehouses and whole families of coopers to make the whaleoil casks and docks too over which the bowsprits of whalers could project to their chain stays and figure or fiddleheads threemasters they were usually squarerigged the after mast carried square sails as well as boomandgaff spankerdeephulled ships built to suffer the years at sea in any weather the flying jib boom was a separate spar and the double dolphinstriker served as spritsail gaffs as well i have a steel engraving of the old harbor chockablock with ships and some faded photographs on tin but i dont really need them i know the harbor and i know the ships grandfather rebuilt it for me with his stick made from a narwhals horn and he drilled me in the nomenclature rapping out the terms with his stick against a tidebared stump of a pile of what was once the hawley dock a fierce old man with a white whisker fringe i loved him so much i ached from it all right hed say in a voice that needed no megaphone from the bridge sing out the full rig and sing it loud i hate whispering and i would sing out and hed whack the pile with his narwhal stick at every beat flying jib id sing whack outer jib whack inner jib jib whack whack sing out youre whispering fore skysl fore royal fore topgalnt sl fore upper topsl fore lower topsl foresland every one a whack main sing out main skyslwhack but sometimes as he got older he would tire belay the main he would shout get to the mizzen sing out now aye sir mizzen skysl mizzen royal mizzen tgalnt mizzen upper topsl mizzen lower topsl crossjack and spanker how rigged boom and gaff sir whackwhackwhacknarwhal stick against the waterlogged pile as his hearing got fuzzier he accused more and more people of whispering if a things true or even if it aint true and you mean it sing out he would cry old capns ears may have gone wonky toward the end of his life but not his memory he could recite you the tonnage and career of every ship it seemed like that ever sailed out of the bay and what she brought back and how it was divided and the odd thing was that the great whaling days were nearly over before he was master kerosene he called skunk oil and kerosene lamps were stinkpots by the time electric lights came he didnt care much or maybe was content just to remember his death didnt shock me the old man had drilled me in his death as he had in ships i knew what to do inside myself and out on the edge of the silted and sanded up old harbor right where the hawley dock had been the stone foundation is still there it comes right down to the lowtide level and high water laps against its square masonry ten feet from the end there is a little passage about four feet wide and four feet high and five feet deep its top is vaulted maybe it was a drain one time but the landward entrance is cemented in with sand and broken rock that is my place the place everybody needs inside it you are out of sight except from seaward theres nothing at old harbor now but a few clammers shacks rattlety things mostly deserted in the winter but clammers are a quiet lot anyway they hardly speak from days end to end and they walk with their heads down and their shoulders bowed that was the place i was headed for i spent nighttide there before i went in the service and the nighttide before i married my mary and part of the night ellen was born that hurt her so bad i was compelled to go and sit inside there and hear the little waves slap the stone and look out at the sawtooth whitsun rocks i saw it lying in bed watching the dance of the red spots and i knew i had to sit there its big changes take me therebig changes south devon runs along the shore and there are lights aimed at the beach put there by good people to keep lovers from getting in trouble they have to go somewhere else a town ordinance says that wee willie has to patrol once an hour there wasnt a soul on the beachnot a soul and that was odd because someone is going fishing or fishing or coming in nearly all the time i lowered myself over the edge and found the outcrop stone and doubled into the little cave and i had hardly settled myself before i heard wee willies car go by thats twice i had avoided passing the time of night with him it sounds uncomfortable and silly sitting crosslegged in a niche like a blinking buddha but some way the stone fits me or i fit maybe ive been going there so long that my behind has conformed to the stones as for its being silly i dont mind that sometimes its great fun to be silly like children playing statues and dying of laughter and sometimes being silly breaks the even pace and lets you get a new start when i am troubled i play a game of silly so that my dear will not catch trouble from me she hasnt found me out yet or if she has ill never know it so many things i dont know about my mary and among them how much she knows about me i dont think she knows about the place how would she ive never told anyone it has no name in my mind except the placeno ritual or formula or anything its a spot in which to wonder about things no man really knows about other human beings the best he can do is to suppose that they are like himself now sitting in the place out of the wind seeing under the guardian lights the tide creep in black from the dark sky i wondered whether all men have a place or need a place or want one and have none sometimes ive seen a look in eyes a frenzied animal look as of need for a quiet secret place where soulshivers can abate where a man is one and can take stock of it of course i know of the theories of back to the womb and the deathwish and these may be true of some men but i dont think they are true of me except as easy ways of saying something that isnt easy i call whatever happens in the place taking stock some others might call it prayer and maybe it would be the same thing i dont believe its thought if i wanted to make a picture of it for myself it would be a wet sheet turning and flapping in a lovely wind and drying and sweetening the white what happens is right for me whether or not it is good there were plenty of matters to consider and they were jumping and waving their hands for attention like kids in school then i heard the slow puttering of a boat engine a onelunger a fishing craft her masthead light moved south beyond the whitsun rocks i had to put everything aside until she turned her red and green lights safe in the channel a local boat to have found the entrance so easily she dropped anchor in the shallows and two men came ashore in her skiff little wavelets brushed the beach and the disturbed gulls took time to settle back on the mooring floats item there was mary my dear to think of asleep with the smile of mystery on her lips i hoped she wouldnt awaken and look for me but if she did would she ever tell me i doubt it i think that mary for all that she seems to tell everything tells very little there was the fortune to consider did mary want a fortune or did she want it for me the fact that it was a fake fortune rigged by margie younghunt for reasons i didnt know made no difference at all a fake fortune was just as good as any and it is possible that all fortunes are a little fake any man of reasonable intelligence can make money if thats what he wants mostly its women or clothes or admiration he really wants and they deflect him the great artists of finance like morgan and rockefeller werent deflected they wanted and got money just simple money what they did with it afterward is another matter ive always felt they got scared of the ghost they raised and tried to buy it off item by money mary meant new curtains and sure education for the kids and holding her head a little higher and face it being proud rather than a little ashamed of me she had said it in anger and it was true item did i want money well no something in me hated being a grocery clerk in the army i made captain but i know what got me into o t c it was family and connections i wasnt picked for my pretty eyes but i did make a good officer a good officer but if i had really liked command imposing my will on others and seeing them jump i might have stayed in the army and id have been a colonel by now but i didnt i wanted to get it over they say a good soldier fights a battle never a war thats for civilians item marullo was telling me the truth about business business being the process of getting money and joey morphy was telling it straight and mr baker and the drummer they all told it straight why did it revolt me and leave a taste like a spoiled egg am i so good or so kind or so just i dont think so am i so proud well theres some of that am i lazy too lazy to be involved theres an awful lot of inactive kindness which is nothing but laziness not wanting any trouble confusion or effort there is a smell and a feel of dawn long before the light it was in the air now a tempering of the wind a new star or a planet cleared the horizon to eastward i should know what star or planet but i dont the wind freshens or steadies in the false dawn it really does and i would have to be going back soon this rising star was too late to have much of a go before daylight what is the sayingthe stars incline they do not command the stars incline they do not command in latin astra inclinant non necessitant a common elizabethan astrological notion well ive heard that a good many serious financiers go to astrologers for instruction in stock purchase do the stars incline toward a bull market is a t and t influenced by the stars nothing as sweet and remote in my fortune as a star a beatup tarot deck of fortunetelling cards in the hands of an idle mischievous woman and she had rigged the cards do the cards incline but not command well the cards inclined me out to the place in the middle of the night and they inclined me to give more thought than i wanted to to a subject i detested thats quite a bit of inclining right there could they incline me to a business cleverness i never had to acquisitiveness foreign to me could i incline to want what i didnt want there are the eaters and the eaten thats a good rule to start with are the eaters more immoral than the eaten in the end all are eatenallgobbled up by the earth even the fiercest and the most crafty the roosters up on clam hill had been crowing for a long time and i had heard and not heard i wished i could stay to see the sun rise straight out from the place i said there was no ritual involved with the place but that is not entirely true sometime on each visit i reconstruct old harbor for my minds pleasurethe docks the warehouses the forests of masts and underbrush of rigging and canvas and my ancestors my bloodthe young ones on the deck the fully grown aloft the mature on the bridge no nonsense of madison avenue then or trimming too many leaves from cauliflowers some dignity was then for a man some stature a man could breathe that was my father talking the fool old capn remembered the fights over shares the quibbling with stores suspicion of every plank and keelson the lawsuits yes and the killingsover women glory adventure not at all over money it was a rare partnership he said that lasted more than one voyage and blistering feuds ever afterward continuing after the cause was forgotten there was one bitterness old capn hawley did not forget a crime he could not forgive he must have told me about it many times standing or sitting on the rim of old harbor we spent a goodly time there he and i i remember him pointing with his narwhal stick take that third rock on whitsun reef he said got her now line her up with the tip of porty point at high water see it there nowhalf a cablelength out on that line is where she lies at least her keel the belleadair the belleadair our ship half ours a partnership she burned at anchorburned to the waterline i never believed it was an accident you think she was fired sir i do butbut you cant do that i couldnt who did i dont know why insurance then its no different now no different there must be some difference only in a single man aloneonly in one man alone theres the only powerone man alone cant depend on anything else he never spoke to capn baker again my father told me but he didnt carry it to his son mr banker baker he wouldnt do that any more than he would burn a ship good god ive got to get home and i got i almost ran and i went up the high street without thinking it was still dark enough but a rim of lightness lay on the edge of the sea and made the waves gray iron i rounded the war memorial and passed the post office in a doorway danny taylor stood as i knew he must hands in pockets collar of his ragged coat turned up and his old peaked shooters cap with the earflaps turned down his face was bluegray with cold and sickness eth he said im sorry to bother you sorry ive got to have some skullbuster you know i wouldnt ask if i didnt have to i know i mean i dont know but i believe you i gave him a dollar bill will that do it his lips were trembling the way a childs lips do when its about to cry thank you eth he said yesthat will put me away all day and maybe all night he began to look better just thinking of it dannyyouve got to stop this think ive forgotten you were my brother danny you still are ill do anything in the world to help you a little color came into his thin cheeks he looked at the money in his hand and it was as though he had taken his first gulp of skullbuster then he looked at me with hard cold eyes in the first place its nobodys goddam business and in the second place you havent got a bean eth youre as blind as i am only its a different kind of blindness listen to me danny what for why im better off than you are ive got my ace in the hole remember our country place where the house burned down where we used to play in the cellar hole you remember it all right its mine danny you could sell it and get a new start i wont sell it the county takes a little bit of it for taxes every year the big meadow is still mine why wont you sell it because its me its daniel taylor long as i have it no christy sons of bitches can tell me what to do and no bastards can lock me up for my own good do you get it listen danny i wont listen if you think this dollar gives you the right to preach to mehere take it back keep it i will you dont know what youre talking about youve never been adrunk i dont tell you how to wrap bacon do i now if youll go your own way ill knock on a window and get some skullbuster and dont forgetim better off than you are im not a clerk he turned around and put his head in the corner of the closed doorway like a child who abolishes the world by looking away from it and he stayed there until i gave up and walked on wee willie parked in front of the hotel stirred out of his nap and rolled down the window of his chevrolet morning ethan he said you up early or out late both must have found yourself a fancy piece sure did willie an houri now eth dont tell me youd take up with no streetwalker i swear it cant believe nothing no more i bet you was fishing hows missus asleep thats where ill be come shift i went on without reminding him thats where hed been i walked quietly up my back steps and switched on the kitchen light my note was on the table a little left of center id swear i left it right in the middle i put the coffee on and sat waiting for it to perk and it had just begun to bounce when mary came down my darling looks like a little girl when she awakens you couldnt think she is the mother of two big brats and her skin has a lovely smell like newcut grass the most cozy and comforting odor i know what are you doing up so early well may you ask please to know i have been up most of the night regard my galoshes there by the door feel them for wetness where did you go down by the sea there is a little cave my rumpled duck i crawled inside and i studied the night now wait and i saw a star come out of the sea and since it had no owner i took it for our star i tamed it and turned it back to fatten youre being silly i think you just got up and that woke me if you dont believe me ask wee willie i spoke to him ask danny taylor i gave him a dollar you shouldnt hell just get drunk i know that was his wish where can our star sleep sweet fern doesnt coffee smell good im glad youre silly again its awful when youre gloomy im sorry about that fortune thing i dont want you to think im not happy dont give it a worry its in the cards what no joke im going to make our fortune im going to make our fortune what steinbeck wrote in sea of cortez provides a gloss to ethans decision and to the ethical issues of this novel there is a strange duality in the human which makes for an ethical paradox we have definitions of good qualities and of bad not changing things but generally considered good and bad throughout the ages and throughout the species of the good we think always of wisdom tolerance kindliness generosity humility and the qualities of cruelty greed selfinterest graspingness and rapacity are universally considered undesirable and yet in our structure of society the socalled and considered good qualities are invariable concomitants of failure while the bad ones are the cornerstones of success perhaps no other animal is so torn between alternatives man might be described fairly adequately if simply as a twolegged paradox i never know what youre thinking thats the greatest difficulty with telling the truth can i beat the children a little to celebrate the day before resurrection i promise to break no bones i havent washed my face she said i couldnt imagine who was rattling around in the kitchen when she had gone up to the bathroom i put my note to her in my pocket and i still didnt know does anyone ever know even the outer fringe of another what are you like in there marydo you hear who are you in there chapter four that saturday morning seemed to have a pattern i wonder whether all days have it was a withdrawn day the little gray whisper of my aunt deborah came to me of course jesus is dead this is the only day in the worlds days when he is dead and all men and women are dead too jesus is in hell but tomorrow just wait until tomorrow then youll see something i dont remember her very clearly the way you dont remember someone too close to look at but she read the scripture to me like a daily newspaper and i suppose thats the way she thought of it as something going on happening eternally but always exciting and new every easter jesus really rose from the dead an explosion expected but nonetheless new it wasnt two thousand years ago to her it was now and she planted something of that in me i cant remember wanting to open the store before i think i hated every sluggish sloven of a morning but this day i wanted to go i love my mary with all my heart in some ways much better than myself but it is also true that i do not always listen to her with complete attention when she tells the chronicle of clothes and health and conversations which please and enlighten her i do not listen at all so that sometimes she exclaims but you should have known i told you i remember very clearly telling you on thursday morning and theres no doubt at all about that she did tell me she tells me everything in certain areas this morning i not only didnt listen i wanted to get away from it maybe i wanted to talk myself and i didnt have anything to saybecause to give her fair due she doesnt listen to me either and a good thing sometimes she listens to tones and intonations and from them gathers her facts about health and how my mood is and am i tired or gay and thats as good a way as any now that i think of it she doesnt listen to me because i am not talking to her but to some dark listener within myself and she doesnt really talk to me either of course when the children or some other hellraising crises are concerned all that changes ive thought so often how telling changes with the nature of the listener much of my talk is addressed to people who are dead like my little plymouth rock aunt deborah or old capn i find myself arguing with them i remember once in weary dusty combat i called out to old capn do i have to and he replied very clearly course you do and dont whisper he didnt arguenever did just said i must and so i did nothing mysterious or mystic about that its asking for advice or an excuse from the inner part of you that is formed and certain for pure telling which is another way of saying asking my mute and articulate canned and bottled goods in the grocery serve very well so does any passing animal or bird they dont argue and they dont repeat mary said youre not going already why you have half an hour thats what comes of getting up so early whole flock of crates to open i said things to put on the shelves before i open great decisions should pickles and tomatoes go on the same shelf do canned apricots quarrel with peaches you know how important color relations are on a dress youd make a joke about anything mary said but im glad its better than grumping so many men grump and i was early red baker wasnt out yet you can set your watch by that dog or any dog hed start his stately tour in exactly half an hour and joey morphy wouldnt didnt show the bank wouldnt be open for business but that didnt mean joey wouldnt be there working on the books the town was very quiet but of course a lot of people had gone away for the easter weekend that and the fourth of july and labor day are the biggest holidays people go away even when they dont want to i believe even the sparrows on elm street were away i did see stonewall jackson smith on duty he was just coming from a cup of coffee in the foremaster coffee shop he was so lean and brittle that his pistols and handcuffs seemed outsize he wears his officers cap at an angle jaunty and picks his teeth with a sharpened goose quill big business stoney long hard day making money huh he said nobodys in town what he meant was that he wished he werent any murders stoney or other grisly delights its pretty quiet he said some kids wrecked a car at the bridge but hell it was their own car judgell make em pay for repairing the bridge you heard about the bank job at floodhampton no not even on television we dont have one yet did they get much thirteen thousand they say yesterday just before closing three fellas fourstate alarm willies out on the highway now bitching his head off he gets plenty of sleep i know but i dont i was out all night think theyll catch them oh i guess so if its money they usually do insurance companies keep nagging never let up it would be nice work if they didnt catch you sure would he said stoney i wish youd look in on danny taylor he looks awful sick just a question of time stoney said but ill go by its a shame nice fella nice family it kills me i like him well you cant do nothing with him its going to rain eth willie hates to get wet for the first time in my memory i went into the alley with pleasure and opened the back door with excitement the cat was by the door waiting i cant remember a morning when that lean and efficient cat hasnt been waiting to try to get in the back door and i have never failed to throw a stick at him or run him off to the best of my knowledge he has never got in i call the cat he because his ears are torn up from fighting are cats strange animals or do they so resemble us that we find them curious as we do monkeys perhaps six or eight hundred times that cat has tried to get in and he has never made it youre due for a cruel surprise i told the cat he was sitting in a circle of his tail and the tip flicked up between his front feet i went into the dark store took a can of milk from the shelf punched it open and squirted it into a cup then i carried the cup to the storeroom and set it just inside and left the door open he watched me gravely looked at the milk and then walked away and slid over the fence in back of the bank i was watching him go when joey morphy came into the alley with the key to the banks back door ready in his hand he looked seedygrainyas though he hadnt been to bed hi mr hawley i thought you were closed today looks like i never close thirtysixdollar mistake in the books i worked till midnight last night short noover that should be good well it aint i got to find it are banks that honest banks are its only some men that arent if im going to get any holiday ive got to find it wish i knew something about business i can tell you all i know in one sentence money gets money that doesnt do me much good me either but i can sure give advice like what like never take the first offer and like if somebody wants to sell hes got a reason and like a thing is only as valuable as who wants it that the quick course thats it but it dont mean nothing without the first money gets money that cuts a lot of us out dont some people borrow yeah but you have to have credit and thats a kind of money guess i better stick to groceries looks like hear about the floodhampton bank stoney told me funny we were just talking about it yesterday remember ive got a friend there three guysone talked with an accent one with a limp three guys sure theyll get them maybe a week maybe two tough oh i dont know they arent smart theres a law against not being smart im sorry about yesterday forget it i talk too much thats another ruledont talk ill never learn that say you look good i shouldnt didnt get much sleep somebody sick no just one of those nights dont i know i swept out the store and raised the shades and didnt know i was doing it or hating it joeys rules popped around and around in my head and i discussed matters with my friends on the shelves perhaps aloud perhaps not i dont know dear associates i said if its that simple why dont more people do it why does nearly everyone make the same mistakes over and over is there always something forgotten maybe the real basic weakness might be some form of kindness marullo said money has no heart wouldnt it be true then that any kindness in a money man would be a weakness how do you get nice ordinary joes to slaughter people in a war well it helps if the enemy looks different or talks different but then how about civil war well the yankees ate babies and the rebs starved prisoners that helps ill get around to you sliced beets and tinned button mushrooms in a moment i know you want me to talk about you everyone does but im on the verge of itpoint of reference thats it if the laws of thinking are the laws of things if the laws of thinking are the laws of things john elof boodin a realistic universe an introduction to metaphysics somehow the laws of thought must be the laws of things if we are going to attempt a science of reality in november steinbeck asked pascal covici to send him five of boodins philosophical works he and ricketts discussed boodins ideas on the sea of cortez trip then morals are relative too and manner and sinthats relative too in a relative universe has to be no getting away from it point of reference you dry cereal with the mickey mouse mask on the box and a ventriloquism gadget for the label and ten cents ill have to take you home but right now you sit up and listen what i told dear mary as a joke is true my ancestors those highly revered shipowners and captains surely had commissions to raid commerce in the revolution and again in very patriotic and virtuous but to the british they were pirates and what they took they kept thats how the family fortune started that was lost by my father thats where the money that makes money came from we can be proud of it i brought in a carton of tomato paste slashed it open and stacked the charming slender little cans on their depleted shelf maybe you dont know because youre kind of foreigners money not only has no heart but no honor nor any memory money is respectable automatically if you keep it a while you must not think i am denouncing money i admire it very much gentlemen may i introduce some newcomers to our community lets see ill put them here beside you catsups make these breadandbutter pickles welcome in their new home new yorkers born and sliced and bottled i was discussing money with my friends here one of your finest familiesoh youd know the name everybody in the world does i guess well they got their big start selling beef to the british when our country was at war with the british and their money is as admired as any and so is the family and another dynasty probably the greatest bankers of them all the founder bought three hundred rifles from the army the army had rejected them as dangerously defective and so he got them very cheap maybe fifty cents apiece pretty soon general frémont general frémont military officer and explorer who took part in numerous expeditions to the west was ready to start his heroic trek to the west and he bought the rifles sight unseen for twenty dollars apiece no one ever heard whether they blew up in the troopers hands and that was the money that makes money it doesnt matter how you get it just as long as you get it and use it to make more im not being cynical our lord and master marullo of the ancient roman name is quite right where money is concerned the ordinary rules of conduct take a holiday why do i talk to groceries perhaps because you are discreet you do not repeat my words or gossip money is a crass and ungracious subject only when you have it the poor find it fascinating but dont you agree that if one becomes actively interested in money he should know something of its nature and character and tendencies im afraid that very few men and they great artists or misers are interested in money for itself and you can kick out those misers who are conditioned by fear by now there was a large pile of empty cartons on the floor i carried them to the storeroom to be trimmed and kept lots of people carry supplies home in them and as marullo would say it saves bags kid theres that kid again i dont mind it any more i want him to call me kid even to think of me as kid while i was stacking the cartons there came a battering on the front door i looked at my big old silver railroad watch and do you know for the first time in my life i had not opened on the moment of nine here it was plainly quarter after nine all that discussion with the groceries had thrown me through the glassandiron screen of the door i could see it was margie younghunt i had never really looked at her had never inspected her maybe thats why she did the fortunejust to make sure i knew she existed i shouldnt change too quickly i threw open the doors didnt mean to rout you out but im late are you sure its after nine she sauntered in her behind stuck out nice and round and bounced slowly one up and one down with each step she was well enough stacked in front so she didnt have to emphasize them they were there margie is what joeyboy would call a dish and my own son allen too maybe perhaps i was seeing her for the first time her features regular nose a little long lips outlined fuller than they were the lower particularly her hair dyed a rich chestnut brown that doesnt occur in nature but pretty her chin was fragile and deepcut but there was plenty of muscle in the cheeks and very wide cheekbones margies eyes had had care they were that hazel to blue to steel color that changes with the light it was a durable face that had taken it and could take it even violence even punching her eyes flicked about to me to the groceries and back to me i imagined she was a very close observer and a good rememberer too i hope you dont have the same problem as yesterday she laughed nono i dont get a drummer every day this time i really ran out of coffee most people do what do you mean well the first ten people every morning ran out of coffee is that true sure say i want to thank you for sending your drummer in it was his idea but you did it what kind of coffee doesnt matter i make lousy coffee no matter what kind i get do you measure sure and its still lousy coffee just isnti nearly said my cup of tea you did say it try this blend i picked a can from the shelf and as she reached to take it from mejust that little gestureevery part of her body moved shifted announced itself quietly im here the leg me the thigh not better than me the soft belly everything was new newly seen i caught my breath mary says a woman can put out signals or not just as she wishes and if thats so margie had a communications system that ran from her pointed patentleather toe to her curving soft chestnut hair you seem to have got over your mullygrubs i had em bad yesterday dont know where they come from dont i know sometimes with me not for the usual reason you did quite a job with that fortune sore about it no id just like to know how you did it you dont believe in that stuff its not belief you hit some things right on the nose things id been thinking and things ive been doing like what like its time for a change you think i rigged the cards dont you doesnt matter if you didwhat made you have you thought of that she looked me full in the eyes suspicious probing questioning yeah she said softly i mean no i never thought of that if i rigged them what made me that would be like unrigging the rig mr baker looked in the door morning margie he said ethan have you given any thought to my suggestion i sure have and id like to talk to you any time at all ethan well i cant get out during the week you know marullos hardly ever here going to be home tomorrow after church sure thats an idea you bring mary about four while the ladies jaw about easter hats well slip off and ive got a hundred things i want to ask guess i better write them down anything i know youre welcome to see you then morning margie when he went out margie said youre beginning fast maybe just limbering up sayknow what would be interesting how about if you turned the cards blindfolded or something and see how close they come to yesterday no she said that wouldnt work you kidding me or do you really go for it way i look at it it doesnt matter about believing i dont believe in extrasensory perception or lightning or the hydrogen bomb or even violets or schools of fishbut i know they exist i dont believe in ghosts but ive seen them now youre kidding im not you dont seem like the same man im not maybe nobody is for long what caused it eth i dont know maybe im sick of being a grocery clerk its about time do you really like mary sure i do why would you ask that you just dont seem to be the same kind ofwell youre so different from her i see what you mean but i do like her i love her so do i lucky i know i am i meant her well ill go make my lousy coffee ill think about that card deal sooner the better before it cools she tapped out her neat buttocks jumping like live rubber i had never seen her before i wonder how many people ive looked at all my life and never seen its scary to think about point of reference again when two people meet each one is changed by the other so youve got two new people maybe that means hell its complicated i agreed with myself to think about such things at night when i couldnt sleep forgetting to open on time scared me thats like dropping your handkerchief at the scene of the murder or your glasses like those whatyoucallems in chicago what does that mean what crime what murder at noon i made four sandwiches cheese and ham with lettuce and mayonnaise ham and cheese ham and cheesewhen a man marries he lives in the trees i took two of the sandwiches and a bottle of coke to the back door of the bank and handed them in to joeyboy find the mistake not yet you know im so close to it im blind why not lay off till monday cant banks are a screwy lot sometimes if you dont think about something it comes to you i know thanks for the sandwiches he looked inside to make sure there was lettuce and mayonnaise saturday afternoon before easter in the grocery business is what my august and illiterate son would call for the birds but two things did happen that proved to me at least that some deepdown underwater change was going on in me i mean that yesterday or any yesterday before that i wouldnt have done what i did its like looking at wallpaper samples i guess i had unrolled a new pattern the first thing was marullo coming in his arthritis was hurting him pretty bad he kept flexing his arms like a weightlifter how it goes slow alfio i had never called him by his first name before nobody in town i like it better when you call me kid i thought you dont like it i find i do alfio everybody gone away his shoulders must have been burning as though there were hot sand in the joints how long ago did you come from sicily fortyseven years long time ever been back no why dont you go on a visit what for everything changed dont you get curious about it not much any relatives alive sure my brother and his kids and they got kids id think youd want to see them he looked at me i guess as id looked at margie saw me for the first time what you got on your mind kid hurts me to see your arthritis i thought how its warm in sicily might knock the pain out he looked at me suspiciously whats with you how do you mean you look different oh i got a little bit of good news not going to quit

but i didnt go on why do it you cant buck a national instinct shed been to the chicken bargain day at the safe rite store cheaper than marullos of course i got them wholesale and i have explained to mary the comeon bargains at the chain stores the bargain draws you in and you pick up a dozen other things that arent bargains just because theyre under your hand everyone knows it and everyone does it my lecture to mary manyflowers died afoaling the new ethan allen hawley goes along with the national follies and uses them when he can mary said i hope you dont think i was disloyal my darling what can be virtuous or sinful about a chicken it was awful cheap i think you did the wisethe wifely thing youre making fun allen was in my bedroom waiting for me can i look at your knight templar knight templar western christian military order during the middle ages founded after first crusade of knights templars were protectors of pilgrims on the road to jerusalem the modern organization is international and focuses on education human rights and humanitarian aid sword sure its in the corner of the closet he knew perfectly well where it was while i skinned off my clothes he got it out of the leather case and unsheathed it and held the shiny plated blade up in the light and looked at his noble posture in the mirror hows the essay going huh dont you mean i beg your pardon sir yes sir i said hows the essay oh fine you going to do it sure sure sure sir you can look at the hat too in that big leather case on the shelf feathers kind of yellowy i got in the big old widebottomed tub with the lions feet they made them big enough to luxuriate in in those days i scrubbed marullo and the whole day off my skin with a brush and i shaved in the tub without looking feeling for the whiskers with my fingertips everyone would agree thats pretty roman and decadent while i combed my hair i looked in the mirror i hadnt seen my face in a long time its quite possible to shave every day and never really to see your face particularly if you dont care much for it beauty is only skin deep and also beauty must come from inside it better be the second if i was to get anywhere it isnt that i have an ugly face to me it just isnt interesting i made a few expressions and gave it up they werent noble or menacing or proud or funny it was just the same damn face making faces when i came back to the bedroom allen had the plumed knight templar hat on and if it makes me look that silly i must resign the leather hatbox was open on the floor it has a supportmade of velvetcovered cardboard like an upsidedown porridge bowl i wonder if they can bleach that ostrich plume or do i have to get a new one if you get a new one can i have this why not wheres ellen i havent heard her young screechy voice shes writing on her i love america essay and you im thinking about it will you bring some peeks home ill probably forget it why dont you drop in at the store and pick it up someday okay mind if i ask somethingsir id be flattered did we use to own all high street for two blocks we did and did we have whaling ships yep well why dont we now we lost them how come just up and lost them thats a joke its a pretty darned serious joke if you dissect it were dissecting a frog at school good for you not so good for the frog which of these beautyties shall i wear the blue one he said without interest say when you get dressed can youhave you got time to come up in the attic ill make time if its important will you come i will all right ill go up now and turn on the light be with you in a couple of tietying moments his footsteps sounded hollowly on the uncarpeted attic stairs if i think about it while i tie a bow the tie has a rotating tendency but if i let my fingers take their own way they do it perfectly i commissioned my fingers and thought about the attic of the old hawley house my house my attic it is not a dark and spidery prison for the broken and the abandoned it has windows with small panes so old that the light comes through lavender and the outside is waverylike a world seen through water the books stored there are not waiting to be thrown out or given to the seamens institute they sit comfortably on their shelves waiting to be rediscovered and the chairs some unfashionable for a time some rumpsprung are large and soft it is not a dusty place either housecleaning is atticcleaning also and since it is mostly closed away dust does not enter i remember as a child scrambling among the brilliants of books or battered with agonies or in the spectral halflife that requires loneliness retiring to the attic to lie curled in a great bodymolded chair in the violetlavender light from the window there i could study the big adzesquared beams that support the roofsee how they are mortised one into another and pinned in place with oaken dowels when it rains from rustling drip to roar on the roof it is a fine secure place then the books tinted with light the picture books of children grown seeded and gone chatterboxes and the rollo series a thousand acts of godfire flood tidal waves earthquakesall fully illustrated the gustave doré hell with dantes squared cantos like bricks between and the heartbreaking stories of hans christian andersen the bloodchilling violence and cruelty of the grimm brothers the morte darthur chatterboxes and the rollo series the gustave doré hell hans christian andersen the grimm brothers the morte darthur chatterbox was a juvenile magazine published in boston and in england from until the late s the rollo books by jacob abbot pastor and educator were concerned with moral instruction european travel and philosophy the gustave doré hell an illustration for an edition of dantes inferno became a standard vision of hell hans christian andersen and the brothers grimm compiled fairy tales for children the aubrey beardsley illustrations for malorys morte darthur appeared in an edition published by j m dent in london of majesty with drawings by aubrey beardsley a sickly warped creature a strange choice to illustrate great manly malory i remember thinking how wise a man was h c andersen the king told his secrets down a well and his secrets were safe a man who tells secrets or stories must think of who is hearing or reading for a story has as many versions as it has readers everyone takes what he wants or can from it and thus changes it to his measure some pick out parts and reject the rest some strain the story through their mesh of prejudice some paint it with their own delight a story must have some points of contact with the reader to make him feel at home in it only then can he accept wonders the tale i may tell to allen must be differently built from the same tale told to my mary and that in turn shaped to fit marullo if marullo is to join it but perhaps the well of hosay andersen is best it only receives and the echo it gives back is quiet and soon over i guess were all or most of us the wards of that nineteenthcentury science which denied existence to anything it could not measure or explain the things we couldnt explain went right on but surely not with our blessing we did not see what we couldnt explain and meanwhile a great part of the world was abandoned to children insane people fools and mystics who were more interested in what is than in why it is so many old and lovely things are stored in the worlds attic because we dont want them around us and we dont dare throw them out a single unshaded light hung from a roof beam the attic is floored with handhewn pine planks twenty inches wide and two inches thick ample support for the neat stacks of trunks and boxes of paperwrapped lamps and vases and all manner of exiled finery and the light glowed softly on the generations of books in open bookcasesall clean and dustless my mary is a stern and uncompromising dust harrier and she is neat as a top sergeant the books are arranged by size and color allen rested his forehead on the top of a bookcase and glared down at the books his right hand was on the pommel of the knight templar sword point downward like a cane you make a symbolic picture my son call it youth war and learning i want to ask youyou said there was books to look up stuff what kind of stuff patriotic jazz for the essay i see patriotic jazz hows this for beat is life so dear or peace so sweet as to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery forbid it almighty god i know not what course others may take but as for me give me liberty or give me death is life so dear give me death from a speech by patrick henry delivered before the virginia convention on march great thats the berries sure is there were giants on the earth in those days i wisht i lived then pirate ships oh boy bangbang strike your colors pots of gold and ladies in silk dresses and jewels i sure wisht i lived then some of our folks donedid it you said so yourself kind of genteel piracythey called them privateers i guess it wasnt as sweet as it sounds from a distance salt beef and biscuit there was scurvy on the earth in those days too i wouldnt mind that id get the gold and bring it home i guess they wont let you do it any more noits bigger and better organized now they call it diplomacy theres a boy in our school that won two television prizesfifty dollars and two hundred dollars hows that he must be smart him course not its a trick he says you got to learn the trick and then you get a gimmick gimmick surelike youre a cripple or you support your old mother raising frogs that gives you audience interest so they choose you hes got a magazine with every contest in the whole country in it can i get one of those magazines pop well piracy is out but i guess the impulse lingers how do you mean something for nothing wealth without effort can i get that magazine i thought such things were in disrepute since the payola scandals payola scandals although record companies had for decades paid radio stations to play their songs payola became widespread in the s with the burgeoning popularity of rock n roll and single rpm records in november congress held hearings on payola and in amended the federal communications act to outlaw underthetable payments hell no i mean no sir they just changed it around a little id sure like to cut in on some of that loot it is loot isnt it its all dough no matter how you get it i dont believe that it doesnt hurt the money to get it that way but it hurts the one who gets it i dont see how its not against the law why some of the biggest people in this country charles my son my son charles my son my son as john ditsky notes steinbeck converts the biblical into the secular woe by means of a reference to the unfortunate van doren how do you mean charles do you have to be rich allen do you have to do you think i like to live without no motorbike must be twenty kids with motorbikes and how you think it is if your family hasnt even got a car leave alone no television im deeply shocked you dont know how it is dad one day in class i did a theme how my greatgranddad was a whaling captain he was whole class bust out laughing know what they call me whaley howd you like that pretty bad it wouldnt be so bad if you were a lawyer or in a bank or like that know what im going to do with the first chunk of loot i win no what im going to buy you an automobile so you wont feel so lousy when other people all got one i said thank you allen my throat was dry oh thats all right i cant get a license yet anyway youll find all the great speeches of our nation in that case allen i hope youll read some of them i will i need to you surely do good hunting i went quietly down the stairs and moistened my lips as i went and allen was right i felt lousy when i sat down in my big chair under the reading light mary brought the paper to me what a comfort you are wiggles that suit looks real nice youre a good loser and a good cook the tie matches your eyes youre up to something i can tell ill trade you a secret for a secret but i dont have one she said make one up i cant come on ethan tell me any eary children listening in no well margie younghunt came in today out of coffee so she said i think shes carrying a torch for me come on tell well we were talking about the fortune and i said it would be interesting to do it again and see if it was the same you didnt i did so and she said it would be interesting but you dont like things like that i do when theyre good think shell do it tonight if you care to offer me a penny for my thoughts i think thats why shes coming oh no i asked her after she set you up for it you dont like her on the contraryim beginning to like her very much and to respect her i wish i could tell when youre joking ellen came in then quietly so that you couldnt tell whether she had been listening but i suspect she had ellen is a girlgirlgirl and thirteen to boot sweet and sad gay and delicate sickly when she needs it she is in that stage like dough beginning to set she may be pretty or not she is a leaner leans on me breathes on me too but her breath is sweet like a cows breath shes a toucher too ellen leaned on the arm of my chair and her thin little shoulder touched mine she ran one pink finger down my coat sleeve and onto the hairs on my wrist and it tickled the blond hairs on her arm shone like gold dust under the lamp a devious one she is but then i guess all girlgirlgirls are nail polish i said mama lets me if its only pink your nails are rough arent they but theyre clean i scrubbed them i hate dirty nails like allens maybe you just hate allen lock stock and bobtail i do good for you why dont you kill him youre silly she crawled her fingers behind my ear shes probably making some boy kids very nervous already i hear you are working on your essay stinker told you is it good oh yes very good ill let you read it when its done honored i see youre dressed for the occasion this old thing im saving my new dress for tomorrow good idea therell be boys i hate boys i do hate boys i know you do hostility is your motto i dont like em much myself now lean off me a minute i want to read the paper she flounced like a s movie star and instantly took her revenge when are you going to be rich yes shell give some man a bad time my instinct was to grab her and paddle her but thats exactly what she wanted i do believe she had eye shadow on there was as little pity in her eyes as youll find in a panthers eyes next friday i said well i wish youd hurry up im sick of being poor and she slipped quickly out a listener at doors too i do love her and thats odd because she is everything i detest in anyone elseand i adore her no newspaper for me i hadnt even unfolded it when margie younghunt arrived she was done uphairdresser done up i guess mary would know how its done but i dont in the morning the outofcoffee margie was set for me like a bear trap the same evening she drew a bead on mary if her behind bounced i couldnt see it if anything was under her neat suit it was hiding she was a perfect guestfor another womanhelpful charming complimentary thoughtful modest she treated me as though i had taken on forty years since the morning what a wonderful thing a woman is i can admire what they do even if i dont understand why while margie and mary went through their pleasant litany what have you done with your hair i like it thats your color you should always wear itthe harmless recognition signals of womeni thought of the most feminine story the most feminine story steinbeck loved corny little jokes recalled one of his agents shirley fisher the joke about two women with a wig was one of those i ever heard two women meet one cries what have you done with your hair it looks like a wig it is a wig well youd never know it maybe these are deeper responses than we know or have any right to know dinner was a series of exclamations about the excellence of the roast chicken and denials that it was edible ellen studied our guest with a recording eye every detail of hairdress and makeup and i knew then how young they start the minute examination on which they base what is called their intuition ellen avoided my eyes she knew she had shot to kill and she expected revenge very well my savage daughter i shall revenge myself in the cruelest way you can imagine i shall forget it and it was a good dinner overrich and too much of it as company dinners must be and a mountain of dishes not ordinarily used and coffee afterward which we do not ordinarily have doesnt it keep you awake nothing keeps me awake not even me ethan and then the silent deadly war of the dishes let me help not at all youre the guest well let me carry them marys eyes sought out the children and her spirit moved on them with fixed bayonet they knew what was coming but they were helpless mary said the children always do it they love to and they do it so well im proud of them well isnt that nice you dont see it much any more i know we feel very fortunate that they want to help i could read their ferrety little minds looking for an escape thinking of making a fuss getting sick dropping the beautiful old dishes mary must have read their evil little minds also she said the remarkable thing is that they never break anything dont even chip a glass well you are blessed margie said how did you teach them i didnt its just natural with them you know some people are just naturally clumsy well allen and ellen are just naturally clever with their hands i glanced at the kids to see how they were handling it they knew they were being taken i think they wondered whether margie younghunt knew it they were still looking for an escape i dropped the beam full on them of course they like to hear compliments i said but were holding them up theyll miss the movie if we dont let them get to it margie had the grace not to laugh and mary gave me a quick and startled look of admiration they hadnt even asked to go to the movie even if teenage children arent making a sound its quieter when theyre gone they put a boiling in the air around them as they left the whole house seemed to sigh and settle no wonder poltergeists infest only houses with adolescent children the three of us circled warily around the subject each one knew was coming i went to the glassfronted cabinet and took out three longstemmed lilyshaped glasses cotton twist brought home from england heaven knows how long ago and i poured from a basketcovered gallon jug dark and discolored with age jamaica rum i said hawleys were seamen must be very old said margie younghunt older than you or me or my father itll take the top of your head off mary said well this must be a party ethan only gets it out for weddings and funerals do you think its all right dear just before easter i mean the sacrament isnt cocacola my darling mary ive never seen your husband so gay its the fortune you read said mary its changed him overnight what a frightening thing is the human a mass of gauges and dials and registers and we can read only a few and those perhaps not accurately a flare of searing red pain formed in my bowels and moved upward until it speared and tore at the place just under my ribs a great wind roared in my ears and drove me like a helpless ship dismasted before it could shorten sail i tasted bitter salt and i saw a pulsing heaving room every warning signal screamed danger screamed havoc screamed shock it caught me as i passed behind my ladies chairs and doubled me over in quaking agony and just as suddenly it was gone i straightened up and moved on and they didnt even know it had happened i understand how people once believed the devil could take possession im not sure i dont believe it possession the seething birth of something foreign with every nerve resisting and losing the fight and settling back beaten to make peace with the invader violationthats the word if you can think of the sound of a word edged with blue flame like a blowtorch my dears voice came through it doesnt really harm to hear nice things she said i tried my voice and it was strong and good a little hope even hopeless hope never hurt anybody i said and i put the jug away in its cabinet and went back to my chair and drank half the glass of ancient fragrant rum and sat down and crossed my knees and locked my fingers in my lap i dont understand him mary said hes always hated fortunetelling made jokes about it i just dont understand my nerve ends were rustling like dry windblown winter grass and my laced fingers had whitened from pressure ill try to explain it to mrs youngto margie i said mary comes from a noble but poor irish family we werent all that poor cant you hear it in her speech well now that you mention it well marys sainted or should be grandmother was a good christian wasnt she mary it seemed to me a little hostility was growing in my dear i went on but she had no trouble believing in fairy people although in strict unbending christian theology the two dont mix but thats different of course it is darling nearly everythings different can you disbelieve in something you dont know about look out for him mary said hell catch you in a word trap i will not i dont know about fortunes or fortunetelling how can i not believe in it i believe it exists because it happens but you dont believe its true whats true is that people get it done millions of them and pay for it thats enough to know to be interested isnt it but you dont wait it isnt that i dont believe but that i dont know theyre not the same thing i dont know which comes firstthe fortune or the fortunetelling i think i know what he means you do mary was not pleased suppose the fortuneteller was sensitive to things that are going to happen anyway is that what you mean thats different but how can cards know i said the cards cant even move without someone turning them margie did not look at me but i knew she sensed marys growing unease and she wanted instructions couldnt we work out a test i asked well thats a funny thing these things seem to resent a test and go away but theres no harm trying can you think of a test you havent touched your rum they lifted their glasses together and sipped and put them down i finished mine and got out the bottle ethan do you think you should yes dearling i filled my glass why cant you turn the cards blindfolded they have to be read how would it be if mary turned them or i did and you read them theres supposed to be a closeness between the reader and the cards but i dont knowwe could try mary said i think if we do it at all we ought to do it the right way shes always that way she doesnt like changelittle change i mean the big ones she can handle better than anyone blows up at a cut finger but would be calm and efficient with a cut throat i had a throb of unease because i had told mary we discussed this and here we were seeming to think of it for the first time we talked about it this morning yes when i came in for coffee ive been thinking about it all day i brought the cards it is marys tendency to confuse intentness with anger and anger with violence and she is terrified of violence some drinking uncles put that fear on her and its a shame i could feel her fear rising lets not fool with it i said lets play some cassino instead margie saw the tactic knew it had probably used it all right with me my fortunes set im going to be rich let it go at that you see i told you he didnt believe in it he leads you all around the bush and then he wont play he makes me so mad sometimes i do you never show it you are always my darling wife isnt it strange how sometimes you can feel currents and crosscurrentsnot always but sometimes mary doesnt use her mind for organized thought and maybe this makes her more receptive of impressions a tension was growing in the room it crossed my mind that she might not be best friends with margie any moremight never feel easy with her id really like to know about the cards i said im ignorant i always heard that gypsies do it are you a gypsy i dont think i ever knew one mary said her maiden name was russian but shes from alaska then that accounted for the wide cheekbones margie said i have a guilty secret ive never told you mary how we came to be in alaska the russians owned it i said we bought it from them yes but did you know it was a prison like siberia only for worse crimes what kind of crimes the worst my greatgrandmother was sentenced to alaska for witchcraft what did she do she raised storms i laughed i see you come by it naturally raising storms reading cardssame thing maybe mary said youre joking that isnt true it may be joking mary but its true that was the worst crime worse than murder ive still got her papersonly of course theyre in russian can you speak russian only a little now i said maybe witchcraft still is the worst crime see what i mean said mary he jumps this side and that side you never know what hes thinking last night hehe got up before daylight this morning went for a walk im a scoundrel i said an unmitigated unredeemable rascal well i would like to see margie turn the cardsbut her own way without you mixing in if we keep talking the children will be home and then we cant excuse me a moment i said i climbed the stairs to our bedroom the sword was on the bed and the hatbox open on the floor i went to the bathroom and flushed the toilet you can hear the water rushing all over the house i wet a cloth in cold water and pressed it against my forehead and particularly against my eyes they seemed to bulge from inside pressure the cold water felt good i sat on the toilet seat and put my face down against the damp washcloth and when it warmed up i wet it again going through the bedroom i picked the plumed knight templars hat from its box and marched down the stairs wearing it oh you fool said mary and she looked glad and relieved the ache went out of the air can they bleach ostrich feathers i asked its turned yellow i think so ask mr schultz ill take it down monday i wish margie would turn the cards said mary i would dearly love that i put the hat on the newel post of the banister and it looked like a drunken admiral if there is such a thing get the card table eth it takes lots of room i brought it from the hall closet and snapped the legs open margie likes a straight chair i set a dining chair do we have to do anything concentrate said margie on what as near as possible on nothing the cards are in my purse over on the couch id always thought of fortunetelling cards as greasy and thick and bent but these were clean and shining as though they were coated with plastic they were longer and narrower than playing cards and many more than fiftytwo margie sat straight at the table and fanned thembrightcolored pictures and intricate suits the names were in french lempereur lermite le chariot la justice le mat le diableearth sun moon and stars and suits of swords cups batons and money i guess if deniero means money but the symbol was shaped like a heraldic rose and each suit with its roi reine and chevalier then i saw strange cardsdisturbing cardsa tower riven by lightning a wheel of fortune a man hanging by his feet from a gallows called le pendu and deathla mort lempereur lermite le chariot la justice le mat le diable le pendu la mort tarot cards used for divination its how they fall in relation the emperor wisdom and authority to achieve goals the hermit mysteries of inner life the chariot focus energy justice balance scales to serve the greater good the fool trust your instincts the devil empower your passionate nature the hanged man one of the most complex cards in the deck suggesting lifes paradoxes death shed old identities to express new ones a skeleton with a scythe kind of gloomy i said do the pictures mean what they seem to its how they fall in relation if they fall upside down they reverse their meaning is there a variation in meaning yes thats the interpretation the moment she had the cards margie became formal under the lights her hands showed what i had seen before that she was older than she looked where did you learn it i asked i used to watch my grandmother and later i took it up as a trick for partiesi suppose a way of getting attention do you believe in it i dont know sometimes remarkable things come out i dont know could the cards be a concentration ritualpsychic exercise sometimes i think thats true when i find i give a value to a card it didnt have before thats when it is usually accurate her hands were like living things as they shuffled and cut and shuffled and cut again and passed them to me to cut who am i doing read ethan mary cried see if it matches yesterdays margie looked at me light hair she said blue eyes are you under forty just the king of batons the king of batons tarot card suggesting that one remain balanced and use power wisely to set a good example she found it in the deck this is youa picture of a crowned and robed king holding a huge red and blue scepter and roi de bâton printed under him she laid it out face up and reshuffled the deck then she turned the cards rapidly speaking in a singsong voice as she did a card on top of my cardthis covers you crosswise on topthis crosses you one abovethis crowns you one belowthis is your foundation this before this behind you she had formed a cross of cards on the table then rapidly she turned up four in a line to the left of the cross saying yourself your house your hopes your future the last card was the man hanged upside down le pendu but from where i sat across the table he was right side up so much for my future it can mean salvation she said her forefinger traced the line of her lower lip mary demanded is the money there yesits there she said absently and suddenly she gathered the cards shuffled them over and over and laid them out again muttering her ritual under her breath she didnt seem to study individual cards but to see the whole group at once and her eyes were misty and remote a good trick i thought a killer at ladies clubsor anywhere else so must the pythoness have looked cool and composed and confusing if you can hold people tense hardly breathing expectant for a long time theyll believe anythingnot acting so much as technique timing this woman was wasting her talent on traveling salesmen but what did she want of us or of me suddenly she gathered the cards patted them square and put them in the red box which said i muller cie fabrique de cartes cant do it she said happens sometimes mary said breathlessly did you see something you dont want to tell oh ill tell all right once when i was a little girl i saw a snake change its skin a rocky mountain rattler i watched the whole thing well looking at the cards they disappeared and i saw that snake changing its skin part dusty and ragged and part fresh and new you figure it out i said sounds like a trance state ever have it happen before three times before make any sense the other times not that i know of always the snake oh no other things but just as crazy mary said enthusiastically maybe its a symbol of the change in fortune thats coming to ethan is he a rattlesnake oh i see what you mean makes me feel crawly margie said once i kind of liked snakes and then when i grew up i hated them they give me the willies id better be going ethan can see you home wouldnt think of it id be glad to margie smiled at mary you keep him right here with you she said you dont know what its like to be without one nonsense said mary you could get a husband by crooking your finger thats what i did before its no good if they come that easy theyre not worth having keep him home someone might grab him she got into her coat as she talkeda fast scrammer lovely dinner i hope youll ask me back sorry about the fortune ethan will we see you in church tomorrow no im going up to montauk tonight but its too cold and wet i love the mornings on the sea up there good night she was out before i could even hold the door for her out as though something was after her mary said i didnt know she was going up there tonight and i couldnt tell her neither did she ethanwhat do you make of that fortune tonight she didnt tell one you forget she said there would be money but what do you make of it i think she saw something she didnt want to tell something that scared her maybe she once saw the snake and it stayed in her mind you dont think it had ameaning honey roll youre the fortune expert how would i know well anyway im glad you dont hate her i thought you did im tricky i said i conceal my thoughts not from me you dont theyll stay right through the second show come again the children they always do i thought you were wonderful about the dishes im devious i said and in due course i have designs on your honor chapter six it has been my experience to put aside a decision for future pondering then one day fencing a piece of time to face the problem i have found it already completed solved and the verdict taken this must happen to everyone but i have no way of knowing that its as though in the dark and desolate caves of the mind a faceless jury had met and decided this secret and sleepless area in me i have always thought of as black deep waveless water a spawning place from which only a few forms ever rise to the surface or maybe its a great library where is recorded everything that has ever happened to living matter back to the first moment when it began to live i think some people have closer access to this place than otherspoets for example once when i had a paper route and no alarm clock i worked out a way to send a signal and to get a reply lying in bed at night i would see myself standing on the edge of the black water i pictured a white stone held in my hand a circular stone i would write on its surface in very black letters oclock then drop the stone and watch it sink turning over and over until it disappeared it worked for me on the second of four i awakened later i could use it to arouse me at ten minutes of four or quarter after and it never failed me and then sometimes a strange sometimes hideous thing thrusts up to the surface as though a sea serpent or a kraken emerged from the great depths only a year ago marys brother dennis died in our house died dreadfully of an infection of the thyroid that forced the juices of fear through him so that he was violent and terrified and fierce his kindly irish horseface grew bestial i helped to hold him down to pacify and reassure him in his deathdreaming and it went on for a week before his lungs began to fill i didnt want mary to see him die she had never seen death and this one i knew might wipe out her sweet memory of a kindly man who was her brother then as i sat waiting by his bed a monster swam up out of my dark water i hated him i wanted to kill him to bite out his throat my jaw muscles tightened and i think my lips fleered back like a wolfs at the kill when it was over in panic guilt i confessed what i had felt to old doc peele who signed the death certificate i dont think its unusual he said ive seen it on peoples faces but few admit it but what causes it i liked him maybe an old memory he said maybe a return to the time of the pack when a sick or hurt member was a danger some animals and most fish tear down and eat a weakened brother but im not an animalor a fish no youre not and perhaps thats why you find it foreign but its there its all there hes a good old man doc peele a tired old man hes birthed and buried us for fifty years back to that congress in the darkit must have been working overtime sometimes a man seems to reverse himself so that you would say he cant do that its out of character maybe its not it could be just another angle or it might be that the pressures above or below have changed his shape you see it in war a lota coward turning hero and a brave man crashing in flames or you read in the morning paper about a nice kind family man who cuts down wife and children with an ax i think i believe that a man is changing all the time but there are certain moments when the change becomes noticeable if i wanted to dig deep enough i could probably trace the seeds of my change right back to my birth or before recently many little things had begun to form a pattern of larger things its as though events and experiences nudged and jostled me in a direction contrary to my normal one or the one i had come to think was normalthe direction of the grocery clerk the failure the man without real hope or drive barred in by responsibilities for filling the bellies and clothing the bodies of his family caged by habits and attitudes i thought of as being moral even virtuous and it may be that i had a smugness about being what i called a good man and surely i knew what was going on around me marullo didnt have to tell me you cant live in a town the size of new baytown and not know i didnt think about it much judge dorcas fixed traffic tickets for favors it wasnt even secret and favors call for favors the town manager who was also budd building supplies sold equipment to the township at a high price and some of it not needed if a new paved street went in it usually turned out that mr baker and marullo and half a dozen other business leaders had bought up the lots before the plan was announced these were just facts of nature but i had always believed they werent facts of my nature marullo and mr baker and the drummer and margie younghunt and joey morphy in a concentration had been nudging me and altogether it amounted to a push so that ive got to put aside a little time to think it out my darling was purring in her sleep with the archaic smile on her lips and she had the extra glow of comfort and solace she gets after love a calm fulfilledness i should have been sleepy after wandering around the night before but i wasnt ive noticed that i am rarely sleepy if i know i can sleep long in the morning the red dots were swimming on my eyes and the street light threw the shadows of naked elm branches on the ceiling where they made slow and stately cats cradles because the spring wind was blowing the window was open halfway and the white curtains swelled and filled like sails on an anchored boat mary must have white curtains and often washed they give her a sense of decency and security she pretends a little anger when i tell her its her lacecurtain irish soul i felt good and fulfilled too but whereas mary dives for sleep i didnt want to go to sleep i wanted to go on fully tasting how good i felt i wanted to think about the i love america essay contest my offspring were entering but behind these and others i wanted to consider what was happening to me and what to do about it so naturally i got out the last thing first and i found that the dark jury of the deep had already decided for me there it was laid out and certain it was like training for a race and preparing and finally being down at start with your spikes set in their holes no choice then you go when the pistol cracks i found i was ready with my spikes set waiting only for the shot and apparently i was the last to know all day people had remarked that i looked well by that meaning i looked different more confident changed that drummer had a look of shock in the afternoon marullo had inspected me uneasily and joeyboy felt the need to apologize for something i had done then margie younghuntmaybe she was the sharpest with her rattlesnake dream some way she had penetrated and discovered a certainty about me before i was certain of it and the symbol was a rattlesnake i found i was grinning in the dark and afterward confused she used the oldest trickthe threat of infidelity a bait cast in a flowing tide to find what fish are feeding there i didnt remember the secret whisper of her hidden bodyno the picture was of her clawed hands that showed age and nervousness and the cruelty that comes to one when control of a situation is lost sometimes i wish i knew the nature of night thoughts theyre close kin to dreams sometimes i can direct them and other times they take their head and come rushing over me like strong unmanaged horses danny taylor came in i didnt want to think about him and be sad but he came anyway i had to use a trick a tough old sergeant taught me once and it works there was a day and a night and a day in the war that was all one piece one unit of which the parts were just about all the dirty dreadfulness that can happen in that sick business while it was going on im not sure i knew its agony because i was busy and unutterably tired but afterward that unit of a day and a night and a day came back to me over and over again in my night thoughts until it was like that insanity they call battle fatigue and once named shellshock i used every trick i could not to think of it but it crept back in spite of me it waited through the day to get at me in the dark once mawkish with whisky i told it to my top sergeant an old pro who had been in wars we have forgotten ever happened if he had worn his ribbons thered have been no room for buttonsmike pulaski a polack from chicago no relation to the hero by good fortune he was decently drunk or he might have clammed up out of a conditioned conviction about fraternizing with an officer mike heard me out staring at a spot between my eyes yeah he said i know about that trouble is a guy tries to shove it out of his head that dont work what you got to do is kind of welcome it how do you mean mike take its something kind of longyou start at the beginning and remember everything you can right to the end every time it comes back you do that from the first right through the finish pretty soon itll get tired and pieces of it will go and before long the whole thing will go i tried it and it worked i dont know whether the headshrinkers know this but they should when danny taylor came into my night i gave him sergeant mikes treatment when we were kids together when we were kids together inserted in this paragraph later deleted was this passage i dont know what sadness made a drunk of him and i dont want to know it would be a kind of invasion of his privacy ive always felt that a man has a right to kill himself if he wants to and thats what danny was doing but it takes a long time same age same size same weight we used to go to the grain and feed store on high street and get on the scales one week id be half a pound heavier and the next danny would catch up with me we used to fish and hunt and swim together and go out with the same girls dannys family was well fixed like most of the old families of new baytown the taylor house is that white one with the tall fluted columns on porlock street once the taylors had a country house tooabout three miles from town the country all around us is rolling hills covered with trees some scrub pine and some with secondgrowth oak and hickory and some cedars once long before i was born the oaks were monsters so big that the localbuilt ships had cut their keels and ribs and planking within a short distance of the shipyards until it was all gone in this rolypoly country the taylors once had a house set in the middle of a big meadow the only level place for miles around it must once have been a lake bottom because it was flat as a table and surrounded by low hills maybe sixty years ago the taylor house burned down and was never rebuilt as kids danny and i used to ride out there on bicycles we played in the stone cellar and built a hunting lodge of bricks from the old foundation the gardens must have been wonderful we could see avenues of trees and a suggestion of formal hedges and borders among the scrabble of the returned forest here and there would be a stretch of stone balustrade and once we found a bust of pan on a tapering stand it had fallen on its face and buried its horns and beard in the sandy loam we stood it up and cleaned it and celebrated it for a time but greed and girls got the better of us we finally carted it into floodhampton and sold it to a junk man for five dollars it must have been a good piece maybe an old one danny and i were friends as all boys must have friends then his appointment to the naval academy came through i saw him once in uniform and not again for years new baytown was and is a tight closemade town everyone knew danny was expelled and no one discussed it taylors died out well just as hawleys died out im the only one left and of course allen my son danny didnt come back until they were all dead and he came back a drunk at first i tried to help but he didnt want me he didnt want anybody but in spite of it we were closevery close i went over everything i could remember right up to that very morning when i gave him the dollar to let him find his local oblivion the structure of my change was feeling pressures from without marys wish allens desires ellens anger mr bakers help only at the last when the move is mounted and prepared does thought place a roof on the building and bring in words to explain and to justify suppose my humble and interminable clerkship was not virtue at all but a moral laziness for any success boldness is required perhaps i was simply timid fearful of consequencesin a word lazy successful business in our town is not complicated or obscure and it is not widely successful either because its practicers have set artificial limits for their activities their crimes are little crimes and so their success is small success if the town government and the business complex of new baytown were ever deeply investigated it would be found that a hundred legal and a thousand moral rules were broken but they were small violationspetty larceny they abolished part of the decalogue decalogue the ten commandments and kept the rest and when one of our successful men had what he needed or wanted he reassumed his virtue as easily as changing his shirt and for all one could see he took no hurt from his derelictions always assuming that he didnt get caught did any of them think about this i dont know and if small crimes could be condoned by self why not a quick harsh brave one is murder by slow steady pressure any less murder than a quick and merciful knifethrust i dont feel guilt for the german lives i took suppose for a limited time i abolished all the rules not just some of them once the objective was reached could they not all be reassumed there is no doubt that business is a kind of war why not then make it allout war in pursuit of peace mr baker and his friends did not shoot my father but they advised him and when his structure collapsed they inherited and isnt that a kind of murder have any of the great fortunes we admire been put together without ruthlessness i cant think of any and if i should put the rules aside for a time i knew i would wear scars but would they be worse than the scars of failure i was wearing to be alive at all is to have scars all this wondering was the weather vane on top of the building of unrest and of discontent it could be done because it had been done but if i opened up that door could i ever get it closed again i did not know i could not know until i had opened it did mr baker know had mr baker even thought of it old capn thought the bakers burned the belleadair for the insurance could that and my fathers misfortune be the reason mr baker wanted to help me were these his scars what was happening could be described as a great ship being turned and bunted and shoved about and pulled around by many small tugs once turned by tide and tugs it must set a new course and start its engines turning on the bridge which is the planning center the question must be asked all right i know now where i want to go how do i get there and where are lurking rocks and what will the weather be one fatal reef i knew was talk so many betray themselves before they are betrayed with a kind of wistful hunger for glory even the glory of punishment andersens well is the only confidant to trustandersens well i called out to old capn shall i set the course sir is it a good course will it get me there and for the first time he denied me his command youll have to work it out yourself whats good for one is bad for another and you wont know till after the old bastard might have helped me then but perhaps it wouldnt have made any difference no one wants adviceonly corroboration chapter seven when i awakened old sleepy mary was up and gone and coffee and bacon were afoot i could smell them and youd have to search for a better day for a resurrection a green and blue and yellow day from the bedroom window i could see that everything was resurrecting grass trees they chose a proper season for it i put on my christmas dressing gown and my birthday slippers in the bathroom i found some of allens hair goo and slicked it on so that my combed and brushed scalp felt tight like a cap easter sunday breakfast is an orgy of eggs and pancakes and bacon curling about everything i crept up on mary and patted her silkcovered fanny and said kyrie eleison kyrie eleison lord have mercy oh she said i didnt hear you coming she regarded my dressing gown paisley pattern nice she said you dont wear it enough i havent time i havent had time well its nice she said ought to be you picked it are the kids sleeping through these wonderful smells oh no theyre out back hiding eggs i wonder what mr baker wants the quick jump never fails to startle me mr baker mr baker oh he probably wants to help me start my fortune did you tell him about the cards course not darling but maybe he guessed then i said seriously look cheesecake you do think i have a great business brain dont you what do you mean she had a pancake up for turning and it stayed up mr baker thinks i should invest your brothers legacy well if mr baker now wait i dont want to do it thats your money and your safety doesnt mr baker know more about that than you do dear im not sure all i know is my father thought he knew thats why im working for marullo still i think mr baker will you be guided by me sweetheart well of course in everything are you being silly im dead seriousdead i believe you are but you cant go around doubting mr baker why heshes hes mr baker well listen to what he has to say and theni still will want that money right in the bank where it is allen shot through the back door as though fired by a slingshot marullo he said mr marullos outside he wants to see you now what mary demanded well ask him in i did he wants to see you outside ethan what is it you cant go out in your robe its easter sunday allen i said you tell mr marullo im not dressed tell him he can come back later but if hes in a hurry he can come in the front door if he wants to see me alone he dashed i dont know what he wants maybe the stores been robbed allen shot back hes going around front now dear dont you let him spoil your breakfast you hear me i went through the house and opened the front door marullo was on the porch dressed in his best for easter mass and his best was black broadcloth and big gold watch chain he held his black hat in his hand and he smiled at me nervously like a dog out of bounds come in no he said i just got one word to say i heard how that fella offered you a kickback yes i heard how you threw him out who told you i cant tell he smiled again well what about it you trying to say i should have taken it he stepped forward and shook my hand pumped it up and down twice very formally youre a good fella he said maybe he didnt offer enough you kidding youre a good fella thats all youre a good fella he reached in his bulging side pocket and brought out a bag you take this he patted my shoulder and then in a welter of embarrassment turned and fled his short legs pumped him away and his fat neck flamed where it bulged over his stiff white collar what was it i looked in the bagcolored candy easter eggs we had a big square glass jar of them at the store he brought a present for the kids i said marullo brought a present i cant believe it well he did why he never did anything like that i guess he just plain loves me is there something i dont know duck blossom there are eight million things none of us know the children were staring in from the open back door i held out the bag to them a present from an admirer dont get into them until after breakfast as we were getting dressed for church mary said i wish i knew what that was all about marullo ill have to admit darling i wish i knew what it was all about too but a bag of cheap candy do you suppose it might be a grave simplicity i dont understand his wife is dead he has neither chick nor child hes getting old maybewell maybe hes lonely he never has been here before while hes lonesome you should ask him for a raise he doesnt drop in on mr baker it makes me nervous i gauded myself like the flowers of the field decent dark suit my burying black shirt and collar so starchly white they threw the suns light back in the suns face cerulean tie with cautious polka dots was mrs margie younghunt whomping up ancestral storms where did marullo get his information it could only be mr bugger to mrs younghunt to mr marullo i do not trust thee margie young the reason why i cannot tongue but this i know and know right spung i do not trust thee mrs young and with that singing in my head i delved in the garden for a white flower for my easter buttonhole in the angle made by the foundation and the sloping cellar door there is a protected place the earth warmed by the furnace and exposed to every scrap of winter sunlight there white violets grow brought from the cemetery where they grow wild over the graves of my ancestors i picked three tiny lionfaced blossoms for my buttonhole and gathered a round dozen for my darling set their own pale leaves about them for a nosegay and bound them tight with a bit of aluminum foil from the kitchen why theyre lovely mary said wait till i get a pin ill wear them theyre the firstthe very first my creamy fowl i am your slave christ is risen alls right with the world please dont be silly about sacred things dear what in the world have you done with your hair do you like it i love it always wear it that way i wasnt sure youd like it margie said youd never notice wait till i tell her you did she set a bowl of flowers on her head the yearly vernal offering to eostre like it i love it now the young got their inspection ears nostrils shoeshines every detail and they resisted every moment of it allens hair was so plastered that he could hardly blink the heels of his shoes were unpolished but with infinite care he had trained a line of hair to roll on his crested brow like a summer wave ellen was girl of a girlness all in sight was in order i tried my luck again ellen i said youre doing something different with your hair it becomes you mary darling dont you like it oh shes beginning to take pride mary said we formed a procession down our path to elm street then left to porlock where our church is our old whitesteepled church stolen intact from christopher wren christopher wren renowned english architect who designed st pauls cathedral in london as well as many other churches and secular buildings and we were part of a growing stream and every woman in passing had delight of other womens hats i have designed an easter hat i said a simple offtheface crown of thorns in gold with real ruby droplets on the forehead ethan said mary sternly suppose someone should hear you no i guess it couldnt be popular i think youre horrid mary said and so did i worse than horrid but i did wonder how mr baker would respond to comment on his hair our family rivulet joined other streams and passed stately greetings and the stream was a river pouring into st thomass episcopal church a mediumhigh church maybe a little higher than center when the time comes that i must impart the mysteries of life to my son which i have no doubt he knows i must remember to inform him about hair armed with a kindly word for hair he will go as far as his concupiscent little heart desires i must warn him however he may kick beat drop tousle or bump them but he must nevernevermess their hair with this knowledge he can be king the bakers were just ahead of us going up the steps and we passed decorous greetings i believe were seeing you at tea yes indeed a very happy easter to you can that be allen how hes grown and mary ellen well i cant keep trackthey shoot up so theres something very dear about a church you grew in i know every secret corner secret odor of st thomass in that font i was christened at that rail confirmed in that pew hawleys have sat for god knows how long and that is no figure of speech i must have been deeply printed with the sacredness because i remember every desecration and there were plenty of them i think i can go to every place where my initials are scratched with a nail when danny taylor and i punched the letters of a singularly dirty word with a pin in the book of common prayer mr wheeler caught us and we were punished but they had to go through all the prayerbooks and the hymnals to make sure there werent more once in that chair stall under the lectern a dreadful thing happened i wore the lace and carried the cross i wore the lace and carried the cross true story from steinbecks childhood in salinas and sang a beefy soprano once the bishop was officiating a nice old man hairless as a boiled onion but to me glowing with rays of holiness so it was that stunned with inspiration i set the cross in its socket at the end of processional and forgot to throw the brass latch that held it in at the reading of the second lesson i saw with horror the heavy brass cross sway and crash on that holy hairless head the bishop went down like a poleaxed cow and i lost the lace to a boy who couldnt sing as well a boy named skunkfoot hill hes an anthropologist now somewhere in the west the incident seemed to prove to me that intentions good or bad are not enough theres luck or fate or something else that takes over accidents we sat the service through and heard the news announced that christ was risen indeed it ran shivers up my spine as always i took communion with a good heart allen and mary ellen werent yet confirmed and they got pretty restless and had to be given the iron eye to stop their jittering when marys eyes are hostile they can pierce even the armor plate of adolescence then in the drenching sunshine we shook hands and greeted and shook hands and wished the seasons best to the community of our neighbors all those we had spoken to coming in we regreeted going outa continuation of the litany of a continuous litany in the form of decorous good manners a quiet supplication to be noticed and to be respected good morning and how are you this fine day very well thank you how is your mother shes getting oldgetting oldthe aches and daggers of getting old ill tell her you asked for her the words are meaningless except in terms of feeling does anyone act as the result of thought or does feeling stimulate action and sometimes thought implement it ahead of our small parade in the sun went mr baker avoiding stepping on cracks his mother dead these twenty years was safe from a broken back and mrs baker amelia tripping along beside him trying to match his uneven stride with her fluttering feet a small brighteyed bird of a woman but a seedeating bird allen my son walked beside his sister but each of them tried to give the impression that they were total strangers i think she despises him and he detests her this may last all their lives while they learn to conceal it in a rose cloud of loving words give them their lunches my sister my wifetheir hardboiled eggs and pickles their jellyandpeanutbutter sandwiches their red barrelsmelling apples and turn them free in the world to spawn and thats just what she did they walked away carrying their paper bags each one to a separate private world did you enjoy the service my darling oh yes i always do but yousometimes i wonder if you believeno i mean it well your jokessometimes pull up your chair my dimpsy darling i have to get lunch on bugger lunch thats what i mean your jokes lunch is not sacred if it were warmer i could carry you to a rowboat and we would go out past the breakwater and fish for porgies were going to the bakers do you know whether you believe in the church or not ethan why do you call me silly names you hardly ever use my name to avoid being repetitious and tiresome but in my heart your name rings like a bell do i believe what a question do i lift out each shining phrase from the nicene creed loaded like a shotgun shell and inspect it no it isnt necessary its a singular thing mary if my mind and soul and body were as dry of faith as a navy bean the words the lord is my shepherd i shall not want he maketh me to lie down in green pastures would still make my stomach turn over and put a flutter in my chest and light a fire in my brain i dont understand good girl neither do i lets say that when i was a little baby and all my bones soft and malleable i was put in a small episcopal cruciform box and so took my shape then when i broke out of the box the way a baby chick escapes an egg is it strange that i had the shape of a cross have you ever noticed that chickens are roughly eggshaped you say such dreadful things even to the children and they to me ellen only last night asked daddy when will we be rich but i did not say to her what i know we will be rich soon and you who handle poverty badly will handle riches equally badly and that is true in poverty she is envious in riches she may be a snob money does not change the sickness only the symptoms you talk this way about your own children what must you say of me i say you are a blessing a dearling the brightness in a foggy life you sound drunkanyway intoxicated i am you arent i could smell it you are smelling it sweetheart whats come over you ah you do know dont you a changea bloody big storm of a change you are only feeling the outmost waves you worry me ethan you really do youre wild do you remember my decorations your medalsfrom the war they were awarded for wildnessfor wilderness no man on earth ever had less murder in his heart than i but they made another box and crammed me in it the times the moment demanded that i slaughter human beings and i did that was wartime and for your country its always some kind of time so far i have avoided my own time i was a goddam good soldier potkinclever and quick and merciless an effective unit for wartime maybe i could be an equally efficient unit in this time youre trying to tell me something sadly enough i am and it sounds in my ears like an apology i hope it is not im going to set out lunch not hungry after that noreaster of a breakfast well you can nibble something did you see mrs bakers hat she must have got it in new york what has she done with her hair you noticed that its almost strawberry to be a light to lighten the gentiles and to be the glory of thy people israel why would margie want to go to montauk this time of year she loves the early morning shes not an early riser i joke with her about that and dont you think it was queer marullo bringing candy eggs do you connect the two events margie gets up early and marullo brings eggs dont be silly im not for once im not if i tell you a secret will you promise not to tell its a joke no well i promise i think marullo is going to make a trip to italy how do you know did he tell you not exactly i put things together i put things together but thatll leave you alone in the store youll have to get someone to help you i can handle it you do practically everything now youll have to get someone in to help rememberit isnt sure and its a secret oh i never forget a promise but youll hint ethan i will not do you know what you are a dear little baby rabbit with flowers on your head you help yourself in the kitchen im going to freshen up when she was gone i sprawled out in my chair and i heard in my secret ears lord now lettest thou thy servant depart in peeace according to thy word and darned if i didnt go to sleep dropped off a cliff into the dark right there in the living room i dont do that often and because i had been thinking of danny taylor i dreamed of danny taylor we were not small or great but grown and we were at the flat dry lakebottom with the old house foundations and cellar hole and it was early summer for i remarked the fatness of the leaves and the grass so heavy that it bent of its weight the kind of day that makes you feel fat and crazy too danny went behind a young juniper straight and slender as a column i heard his voice distorted and thick like words spoken under water then i was with him and he was melting and running down over his frame with my palms i tried to smooth him upward back in place the way you try to smooth wet cement when it runs out of the form but i couldnt his essence ran between my fingers they say a dream is a moment this one went on and on and the more i tried the more he melted when mary awakened me i was panting with effort spring fever she said thats the first sign when i was a growing girl i slept so much my mother sent for doctor grady she thought i had sleeping sickness but i was only growing in the spring i had a daymare i wouldnt wish a dream like that on anyone its all the confusion go up and comb your hair and wash your face you look tired dear are you all right its nearly time to go you slept two hours you must have needed it i wish i knew whats on mr bakers mind you will darling and promise me you will listen to every word but he might want a word alone with you businessmen dont like ladies listening well he cant have it that way i want you there you know i have no experience in business i knowbut its your money hell be talking about you cant know people like the bakers unless you are born knowing them acquaintance even friendship is a different matter i know them because hawleys and bakers were alike in blood place of origin experience and past fortune this makes for a kind of nucleus walled and moated against outsiders when my father lost our money i was not edged completely out i am still acceptable as a hawley to bakers for perhaps my lifetime because they feel related to me but i am a poor relation gentry without money gradually cease to be gentry without money allen my son will not know bakers and his son will be an outsider no matter what his name and antecedents we have become ranchers without land commanders without troops horsemen on foot we cant survive perhaps that is one reason why the change was taking place in me i do not want never have wanted money for itself but money is necessary to keep my place in a category i am used to and comfortable in all this must have worked itself out in the dark place below my thinking level it emerged not as a thought but as a conviction good afternoon mrs baker said so glad you could come youve neglected us mary hasnt it been a glorious day did you enjoy the service for a clergyman i think hes such an interesting man we dont see you nearly often enough mr baker said i remember your grandfather sitting in that very chair and reporting that the dirty spaniards had sunk the maine spaniards had sunk the maine on february the battleship uss maine was destroyed by an explosion in havana harbor that killed on board precipitating the spanishamerican war and popularizing the phrase remember the maine he spilled his tea only it wasnt tea old capn hawley used to lace his rum with a little tea he was a truculent man some thought a quarrelsome man i could see that mary was first shaken and then pleased at this warmth of course she didnt know i had promoted her to be an heiress a reputation for money is almost as negotiable as money itself mrs baker her head jerking with some nervous disorder poured tea into cups as thin and fragile as magnolia petals and her pouring hand was the only steady part of her mr baker stirred with a thoughtful spoon i dont know whether i love tea or the ceremony of it he said i like all ceremonieseven the silly ones i think i understand i said this morning i felt comfortable in the service because it had no surprises i knew the words before they were said during the war ethanlisten to this ladies and see if you can remember anything like itduring the war i served as a consultant to the secretary of war i spent some time in washington i hated it said mrs baker well there was a big military tea a real doozer maybe five hundred guests the ranking lady was the wife of a fivestar general and next in importance was the lady of a lieutenant general mrs secretary the hostess asked the fivestar lady to pour the tea and mrs threestars to pour coffee well the top lady refused because and i quote her everyone knows coffee outranks tea now did you ever hear that he chuckled as it turned out whisky outranked everybody it was such a restless place mrs baker said people moved before they had time to gather a set of habits or manners mary told her story of an irish tea in boston with the water boiling in round tubs over an open fire and served with tin ladles and they dont steep they boil she said that tea will unsettle varnish on a table there must be ritual preliminaries to a serious discussion or action and the sharper the matter is the longer and lighter must the singing be each person must add a bit of feather or a colored patch if mary and mrs baker were not to be a part of the serious matter they would long since have set up their own pattern of exchange mr baker had poured wine on the earth of conversation and so had my mary and she was pleased and excited by their attentiveness it remained for mrs baker and for me to contribute and i felt it only decent to be last she took her turn and drew her source from the teapot as the others had i remember when there were dozens of kinds of tea she offered brightly why everyone had recipes for nearly everything i guess there wasnt a weed or a leaf or a flower that wasnt made into some kind of tea now there are only two india and china and not much china remember tansy and camomile and orangeleaf and flowerandand cambric whats cambric mary asked equal parts hot water and hot milk children love it it doesnt taste like milk and water that accounted for mrs baker it was my turn and i intended to make a few carefully meaningless remarks about the boston tea party but you cant always do what you intended surprises slip out not waiting for permission i went to sleep after service i heard me say i dreamed of danny taylor a dreadful dream you remember danny poor chap said mr baker once we were closer than brothers i had no brother i guess we were brothers in a way i dont carry it out of course but i feel i should be my brother dannys keeper mary was annoyed with me for breaking the pattern of the conversation she took a small revenge ethan gives him money i dont think its right he just uses it to get drunk wellll said mr baker i wonderanyway the dream was a noonmare i give him so littlea dollar now and then what else can he do with a dollar but get drunk maybe with a decent amount he could get well no one would dare do that mary cried that would be after killing him isnt that so mr baker poor chap mr baker said a fine family the taylors were it makes me sick to see him this way but marys right hed probably drink himself to death he is anyway but hes safe from me i dont have a decent amount to give him its the principle mr baker said mrs baker contributed a feminine savagery he should be in an institution where they could look after him all three were annoyed with me i should have stayed with the boston tea party strange how the mind goes romping playing blindmans buff or pinthetailonthedonkey when it should be using every observation to find a path through the minefield of secret plans and submerged obstacles i understood the house of baker and the house of hawley the dark walls and curtains the funereal rubber plants unacquainted with sun the portraits and prints and remembrances of other times in pottery and scrimshaw in fabrics and wood which bolt it to reality and to permanence chairs change with style and comfort but chests and tables bookcases and desks relate to a solid past hawley was more than a family it was a house and that was why poor danny held onto taylor meadow without it no familyand soon not even a name by tone and inflection and desire the three sitting there had canceled him it may be that some men require a house and a history to reassure themselves that they existits a slim enough connection at most in the store i was a failure and a clerk in my house i was hawley so i too must be unsure baker could offer a hand to hawley without my house i too would have been canceled it was not man to man but house to house i resented the removal from real of danny taylor but i couldnt stop it and this thought sharpened and tempered me baker was going to try to refurbish hawley for bakers participation in marys fancied inheritance now i was on the edge of the minefield my heart hardened against my selfless benefactor i felt it harden and grow wary and dangerous and with its direction came the feeling of combat and the laws of controlled savagery and the first law is let even your defense have the appearance of attack i said mr baker we dont need to go over the background you know better than i do the slow precise way in which my father lost the hawley substance i was away at war how did it happen it wasnt his intention but his judgment i know he was unworldlybut how did it happen well it was a time of wild investment he invested wildly did he have any advice he put money in munitions that were already obsolete then when the contracts were canceled he lost you were in washington did you know about the contracts only in a general way but enough so you didnt invest no i didnt did you advise my father about investments i was in washington but you knew he had borrowed the money on the hawley property the money to invest yes i knew that did you advise against it i was in washington but your bank foreclosed a bank doesnt have any choice ethan you know that yes i know only its a shame you couldnt have advised him you shouldnt blame him ethan now that i understand it i dont i didnt mean to blame him but i never quite knew what happened i think mr baker had prepared an opening having lost his chance he had to grope about for his next move he coughed blew his nose and wiped it with a paper handkerchief from a flat pocket package wiped his eyes with a second sheet polished his glasses with a third everyone has his own method for gaining time ive known a man to take five minutes to fill and light a pipe when he was ready again i said i know i have no right in myself to ask you for help but you yourself brought up the long partnership of our families good people he said and usually men of excellent judgment conservative but not blindly so sir i believe that once they decided on a course they drove through that they did even if it came to sinking an enemyor burning a ship they were commissioned of course in i believe sir they were questioned about what constituted an enemy theres always some readjustment after a war surely but im not taking up old scores for talk frankly mr baker i want toto rehabilitate my fortunes thats the spirit ethan for a time i thought youd lost the old hawley touch i had or maybe id not developed it youve offered help where do i start the trouble is you need capital to start i know that but if i had some capital where would i start this must be tiresome for the ladies he said maybe we should go into the library business is dull to ladies mrs baker stood up i was just about to ask mary to help me select some wallpaper for the big bedroom the samples are upstairs mary id like mary to hear but she went along with them as i knew she would i dont know a thing about business she said but i do know about wallpaper but youre concerned darling i just get mixed up ethan you know i do maybe ill get more mixed up without you darling mr baker had probably suggested the wallpaper bit i think his wife does not choose the paper surely no woman picked the dark and geometric paper in the room where we sat now he said when they were gone your problem is capital ethan your house is clear you can mortgage it i wont do that well i can respect that but its the only collateral you have there is also marys money its not much but with some money you can get more money i dont want to touch her money thats her safety its in a joint account and its not earning anything lets say i overcame my scruples what have you in mind have you any idea what her mothers worth nobut it seems substantial he cleaned his glasses with great care what i say is bound to be in confidence of course fortunately i know you are not a talker no hawley ever was except perhaps your father now i know as a businessman that new baytown is going to grow it has everything to make it growa harbor beaches inland waters once it starts nothing can stop it a good businessman owes it to his town to help it develop and take a profit naturally why hasnt it developed i think you know thatthe mossbacks on the council theyre living in the past they hold back progress it always interested me to hear how philanthropic the taking of a profit can be stripped of its forwardlooking goodofthecommunity clothing mr bakers place was just what it had to be he and a few others a very few would support the towns present administrations until they had bought or controlled all the future facilities then they would turn the council and the town manager out and let progress reign and only then would it be discovered that they owned every avenue through which it could come from pure sentiment he was willing to cut me in for a small share i dont know whether or not he had intended to let me know the timetable or whether his enthusiasm got the better of him but it did come through the generalities the town election is july seventh by that time the forwardlooking group must have the wheels of progress under control i dont suppose there is a man in the world who doesnt love to give advice as i maintained a small reluctance my teacher grew more vehement and more specific ill have to think about it sir i said whats easy for you is a mystery to me and of course ill have to discuss it with mary now thats where i think youre wrong he said theres too much petticoat in business today but its her inheritance best thing you can do for her is make her some money for a surprise they like it better that way i hope i dont sound ungrateful mr baker i think slowly ill just have to mull it over did you hear marullo is going to italy his eyes sharpened for good no just a visit well i hope he makes some arrangement to protect you in case something happened to him hes not a young man has he made a will i dont know if a bunch of his wop relations moved in you might find yourself out of a job i retired into a protective vagueness youve given me a lot to chew on i said but i wonder if you can give me some little idea of when you will start i can tell you this development is pretty much dependent on transportation well the big thruways are moving out still a long way to come the kind of men with the kind of money we want to attract will want to come by air and we have no airport thats right furthermore we have no place for an airport without pushing hills around an expensive operation the cost of labor would be prohibitive then what is your plan ethan youll have to trust me and forgive me i cant tell you that at this time but i do promise that if you can raise some capital ill see that you get in on the ground floor and i can tell you that there is a very definite situation but it has to be solved well i guess thats better than i deserve the old families must stick together is marullo part of the group certainly not he goes his own way with his own crowd they do pretty well dont they better than i think is healthy i dont like to see these foreigners creeping in and july seventh is the soundoff did i say that no i guess i just imagined it you must have and with that mary came back from the wallpaper we did our courteous duties and walked slowly toward home they just couldnt have been nicer what did he say same old thing i should use your money to get a start and i wont do it i know youre thinking of me dear but i say if you dont take his advice youre a fool i dont like it mary suppose hes wrong youd be without protection i tell you this ethan if you dont do it ill take the money and hand it over to him i promise you i will let me think about it i dont want to involve you in business you dont have to that moneys in a joint account you know what the fortune said oh lordthe fortune again well i believe it if i lost your money youd hate me i wouldnt you are my fortune thats what margie said what margie said is in my head in letters red until im dead dont make a joke maybe im not dont let fortune spoil the sweetness of our failure i dont see how a little money could spoil anything not a lot of moneyjust enough i didnt answer welldo you i said o princes daughter there is no such thing as just enough money only two measures no money and not enough money why thats not true that is true remember the texas billionaire who died recentlyhe lived in a hotel room and out of a suitcase he left no will no heirs but he didnt have enough money the more you have the less enough it is she said sarcastically i suppose you find it sinful for me to want new livingroom curtains and a water heater big enough so four people can bathe the same day and i can wash dishes too i was not reporting on sin you juggins i was stating a fact a law of nature you seem to have no respect for human nature not human nature my marynature squirrels bank ten times as many hickory nuts as they can ever use the pocket gopher with a stomach full to bursting still loads his cheeks like sacks and how much of the honey the clever bees collect do the clever bees eat when mary is confused or perplexed she spurts anger the way an octopus spurts ink and hides in the dark cloud of it you make me sick she said you cant let anyone have a little happiness my darling it isnt that its a despairing unhappiness im afraid of the panic money brings the protectiveness and the envy she must have been unconsciously fearful of the same thing she struck at me probed for a hurting place and found it and twisted the jagged words heres a grocery clerk without a bean worried about how bad it will be when hes rich you act as though you could pick up a fortune any time you want to i think i can how thats the worry you dont know how or youd have done it before youre just bluffing you always bluff the intent to wound raises rage i could feel the fever rise in me ugly desperate words moved up like venom i felt a sour hatefulness mary said look there it goes did you see it where what went right past the tree there and into our yard what was it mary tell me what did you see in the dusk i saw her smile that incredible female smile it is called wisdom but it isnt that but rather an understanding that makes wisdom unnecessary you didnt see anything mary i saw a quarrelbut it got away i put my arm about her and turned her lets go around the block before we go in we strolled in the tunnel of the night and we didnt speak again or need to chapter eight as a child i hunted and killed small creatures with energy and joy rabbits and squirrels small birds and later ducks and wild geese came crashing down rumpled distortions of bone and blood and fur and feathers there was a savage creativeness about it without hatred or rancor or guilt the war retired my appetite for destruction perhaps i was like a child overindulged in sweets a shotguns blast was no longer a shout of fierce happiness in this first spring a bouncing pair of rabbits paid daily visits to our garden they loved best my marys carnations ate them down to raw crowns youll have to get rid of them mary said i brought out my bore sticky with grease and found some old thickened shells with number five shot in the evening i sat on the back steps and when the rabbits were in line i blasted both of them with one shot then i buried the furry ruins under the big lilac and i was miserable in the stomach it was simply that i had grown unused to killing things a man can get used to anything slaughtering or undertaking or even execution rack and pincers must be just a job when one gets used to it when the children had gone to bed i said im going out for a while mary didnt ask where or why as she would have a few days ago shall you be late no not late i wont wait up im sleepy she said and it seemed that having accepted a direction she was farther along than i i still had the rabbit misery perhaps it is natural for a man who has destroyed something to try to restore a balance by creating something but was that my impulse i fumbled my way into the stinking kennel where danny taylor lived a lighted candle burned in a saucer beside his army cot danny was in bad shape blue and gaunt and sick his skin had a pewter sheen it was hard not to be sick at the smell of the dirty place and the dirty man under a filthy comforter his eyes were open and glazed i expected him to babble in delirium it was a shock when he spoke clearly and in the tone and manner of danny taylor what do you want here eth i want to help you you know better than that youre sick think i dont know it i know it better than anyone he groped behind his cot and brought out a bottle of old forester onethird full have a shot no danny thats expensive whisky i have friends who gave it to you thats none of your business eth he took a drink and kept it down but for a moment it was not easy and then his color came back he laughed my friend wanted to talk business but i fooled him i passed out before he could get it said he didnt know how little it takes do you want to talk business eth cause i can pass out again quick do you have any feeling about me danny any trust anywell feeling sure i do but when it comes right down to it i am a drunk and a drunk feels strongest about liquor if i could raise the money would you go for a cure the frightening thing was how quickly he had become normal and easy andlike himself i might say i would eth but you dont know drunks id take the money and drink it up well suppose i paid it right to the hospital or wherever im trying to tell you id go with the best intentions and in a few days id get out you cant trust a drunk eth thats what you cant understand no matter what i did or saidid still get out dont you want to come out of it danny i guess i dont i guess you know what i want he hoisted the bottle again and again i was astonished at the speed of the reaction not only did he become the old danny i knew but his senses and perceptions were sharpened so clear in fact that he read my thought dont trust it he said its only for a little time alcohol stimulates and then depresses i hope you wont stay around to see that right now i dont believe it will happen i never do when im up then his eyes wet and shining in the candlelight looked into me ethan he said you offered to pay for a cure for me you havent the money ethan i could get it mary inherited some from her brother and you would give me that yes even though i tell you never to trust a drunk even if i assure you i would take your money and break your heart youre breaking my heart now danny i had a dream about you we were out at the old placeremember he raised the bottle and then put it down saying no not yetnot yet ethnevernever trust a drunk when hewhen imhorriblea dead thingtheres still a clever secret mind at work and its not a friendly mind right now right at this moment im a man who was your friend i lied to you about passing out oh i passed out all right but i know about the bottle wait i said before you go any further else it will lookwell you might suspect me it was baker brought the bottle wasnt it yes he wanted you to sign something yes but i passed out he chuckled to himself and again lifted the bottle to his lips but in the candlelight i saw the smallest bubble he had taken only a drop thats one of the things i wanted to tell you danny was it the old place he wanted yes how does it happen you havent sold it i thought i told you it makes me a gentleman lacking only the conduct of a gentleman dont sell it danny hold onto it whats it to you why not for your pride i dont have any pride left only position yes you have when you asked me for money you were ashamed that means pride no i told you that was a trick drunks are clever i tell you it embarrassed you and you gave me a buck because you thought i was ashamed i wasnt ashamed i just wanted a drink dont sell it danny its valuable baker knows it he doesnt buy anything without value whats valuable about it its the only place nearby level enough for an airfield i see if youll hold out it can be a whole new start for you danny hold onto it you could take the cure and when you came out youd have a nest egg but no nest maybe id rather sell it and drink it up andwhen the bough breaks the cradle will fall and down will come baby cradle and all he sang shrilly and laughed do you want the place eth is that why you came here i want you to be well i am well i want to explain danny if you were a bum you could be free to do whatever you want but you have something a group of forwardlooking citizens want and need taylor meadow and im going to hold onto it im forwardlooking too he glanced affectionately at the bottle danny i told you its the only place for an airport its a key place they have to have iteither that or level the hills and they cant afford that then i have them by the yingyang and im going to twist youve forgotten danny a man of property is a precious vessel already ive heard that the kindest thing would be to put you in an institution where you would get the care you need they wouldnt dare oh yes they wouldand feel virtuous about it you know the process the judge you know him would rule you incompetent to handle property he would appoint a guardian and i can guess which one and all this would be expensive so of course your property would have to be sold to pay the costs and guess who would be there to buy it his eyes were shiny and he listened with his mouth parted now he looked away youre trying to scare me eth you picked the wrong time catch me in the morning when im cold and the world is green vomit right nowmy strength it is the strength of ten because the bottles here he waved it like a sword and his eyes went to slits gleaming in the candlelight did i tell you eth i think i dida drunk has a special evil kind of intelligence but ive told you what will happen i agree with you i know its true youve made your point but instead of scaring me youve roused my imp whoever thinks a drunk is helpless is crazy a drunk is a very special vehicle with special abilities i can fight back and right now i seem to want to good boy thats what i want to hear he sighted at me over the neck of the whisky bottle as though it were the bead on the end of a rifle youd loan me marys money yes without security yes knowing the chance of getting it back is a thousand to one against yes theres an ugly thing in a drunk eth i dont believe you he licked his dry lips would you put the money in my hands whenever you say ive told you not to but i will this time he tipped the bottle back and the big bubble rose inside the glass when he stopped drinking his eyes were even shinier but they were cold and impersonal as a snakes eyes can you get the money this week eth yes wednesday yes have you got a couple of bucks now i had just thata dollar bill a half a quarter two dimes and a nickel and three pennies i poured them into his outstretched hand he finished the bottle and dropped it on the floor somehow i never put you down for clever eth do you know even a basic cure would cost about a thousand dollars all right this is fun eth this isnt chess its poker i used to be pretty good at pokertoo good youre betting ill put up my meadow as collateral and youre betting that a thousand dollars worth of booze will kill me and there youll be with an airport in your lap thats a nasty thing danny i warned you i was nasty couldnt you think i meant it the way i said it no but ive got a way tokeep it the way you said it you remember me in the old days eth do you think i dont remember you youre the kid with the builtin judge okay im getting dry the bottles empty im going out my price is one thousand bucks all right in cash on wednesday ill bring it no note no signature no nothing and dont think you remember me ethan from the old days my friend here has changed all that i have no loyalty no fairness what youll get is nothing but hearty laughter i would only ask you to try sure ill promise eth but i hope ive convinced you what a drunks promise is worth just bring the cash stay as long as you like my house is your house im going out see you wednesday eth he eased himself up out of the old army cot flung the comforter behind it and walked out with a rolling gait his pants were not zipped up i sat for a while watching the candle gutter down into the grease of the saucer everything he had said was true except one thing on which i placed my bet he hadnt changed that much somewhere in the wreckage was danny taylor i didnt believe he could amputate danny i loved danny and i was prepared todo just what he said i was from a distance i heard him singing in a clear high falsetto speed bonnie boat like a bird on the wing onward the sailors cry carry the lad thats born to be king over the sea to skye speed bonnie boat chorus of skye boat a ballad that commemorates the crossing of bonnie prince charles jacobite pretender to the british throne to the isle of skye after his defeat at the battle of culloden april after a lonely while i blew out the candle and walked home by way of high street willie wasnt asleep yet in the police car seems to me youre out a lot eth he said you know how it is sure spring young mans fancy mary was asleep smiling but when i slipped in beside her she half awakened the misery was in my stomachthe cold hurting misery mary turned on her side and gathered me into her warm grasssmelling body and i needed her i knew the misery would get less but right now i needed her i dont know whether she really awakened but even sleeping she knew my need and afterward she was awake and she said i suppose youre hungry yes helen what do you want onion sandwichno two onion sandwiches on rye bread ill have to have one to stand you dont you want one of course she padded down the stairs and came back in a little while with sandwiches and a carton of milk and two glasses it was a pretty hot onion mary muldoon i began wait till you swallow did you mean that about not wanting to know about business whyyes well i have a lead i want a thousand dollars was it something mr baker told you in a way but private too well you just write a check no darling i want you to get it in cash and you might pass the word at the bank that youre getting new furniture or rugs or something but im not you will is it a secret you said you wanted it that way yeswelli do yes its better that way this is a burny onion would mr baker approve he would if he did it when do you want it tomorrow i cant eat this onion i guess i smell bad enough now though youre my darling i cant get over marullo how do you mean coming to the house bringing candy god works in a mysterious way now dont be sacrilegious easter isnt over yes tis its onefifteen good lord we better get to sleep ah theres the rubshakespeare theres the rub hamlet iiii youd make a joke about anything but it was no joke the misery stayed not thought about but aching away and sometimes i would have to ask myself why do i ache men can get used to anything but it takes time once long ago i took a job wheeling nitroglycerin in a dynamite plant the pay was high because the stuff is tricky at first i worried with every step i took but in a week or so it was only a job why id even got used to being a grocery clerk theres something desirable about anything youre used to as opposed to something youre not in the dark with the red spots swimming in my eyes i inquired of myself concerning what they used to call matters of conscience and i could find no wound i asked whether having set my course i could change direction or even reverse the compass ninety degrees and i thought i could but i didnt want to i had a new dimension and i was fascinated with it it was like discovering an unused set of muscles or having come true the childs dream that i could fly often i can replay events scenes conversations and pick up from the repeat details which escaped me at first showing mary found strangeness in marullos coming to the house with candy eggs and i trust marys sense of strangeness i had thought of it as a thanks offering because i had not cheated him but marys question made me reinspect for something i knew but had passed by marullo did not reward for things past he bribed for things to come he was not interested in me except in so far as i could be of use to him i went back over his business instruction and the talk about sicily somewhere he had lost his certainty in some way he wanted something of me or needed something there was a way to find out if i should ask for something he would ordinarily refuse and get it from him then i would know that he was off balance and deeply troubled i put marullo aside and went to margie margiethat gives you an idea of her age margie im always dreaming of you margie id give the world to i replayed the margie scenes against the swimming spots on the ceiling trying to add no more than was really there for a long time maybe two years there had been a mrs younghunt who was a friend of my wife part of the conversations i did not listen to then suddenly margie younghunt had emerged and then margie she must have come to the store before good friday but i could not remember it on that day it was as though she announced herself before that it is possible that she didnt see me any more than i saw her but from that time on she was presenta mover and a shaker what did she want could it be pure mischief of a woman with too little to do or did she move to a plan it did seem to me that she had announced herself to memade me conscious of her and kept me aware of her it seemed to me that she started the second fortunetelling in good faith intending it to be the usual performance polished and professional then something happened something that tore it up mary had said nothing to cause her tension nor had i had she really seen the vision of the snake that would be the simplest explanation and probably the true one maybe she was truly intuitive an intruder into the minds of others the fact that she had caught me midway in a metamorphosis made me likely to believe this but it could have been an accident but what made her run to montauk when she had not intended to go join up with the drummer spill the beans to marullo somehow i didnt believe she spilled things she didnt intend to spill somewhere in the attic bookcases there was an account of the life ofwas it bering no baranov alexander baranov bering alexander baranov vitus bering was a danish navigator and explorer in the service of the russian navy charting much of the siberian and alaskan coasts baranov established trading centers in alaska and served as the first russian governor of alaska from to the russian governor somewhere near maybe there would be some reference to alaska as a prison for witches it was too unlikely a story to be made up i must look i thought maybe i could creep up there now without waking mary then i heard a creak of the old oak stair treads then a second and a third so i knew it was not a settling of the house from a change of temperature it had to be ellen walking in her sleep of course i love my daughter but sometimes she frightens me for she seems to have been born clever at once jealous and loving she was always jealous of her brother and often i feel she is jealous of me it seemed to me that her preoccupation with sex began very early maybe fathers always feel this when she was a very little girl her uninhibited interest in male genitalia was embarrassing then she went into the secrecy of change here was no angelic innocent girlhood of the magazines the house boiled with nervousness the walls vibrated with unease ive read that in the middle ages pubescent girls were thought to be susceptible to witchcraft and im not sure it is not so for a time we had what we called as a joke a poltergeist pictures fell from their hangings dishes crashed to the floor there were poundings in the attic and thumpings in the cellar i dont know what caused it but i was interested enough to keep my eye on ellen on her secret comings and goings she was like a night cat i satisfied myself that she was not responsible for the fallings and crashings and thumpings but also i found they never happened when she was out of the house she might be sitting staring into space when the poltergeist came but she was always there as a child i remember hearing that the old hawley house was haunted long ago by the ghost of one of the puritanpirate ancestors but according to accounts he was a decent ghost who walked and wandered and groaned as he should the stairs creaked under his invisible weight and he rapped on the wall when a death was imminent all proper and in good taste the poltergeist was something quite differentmalicious malignant and mischievous and vengeful he never broke a valueless thing then he went away i never really believed in him he was a family joke except that there he was and there were the broken pictures and shattered china when he left ellen began walking in her sleep as she was now i could hear her slow but certain footsteps going downstairs and at the same time my mary sighed deeply and murmured beside me and a breeze sprang up and moved the shadows of leafing limbs on the ceiling i slipped quietly from bed and slid into my bathrobe for i like everyone else believed that a sleepwalker should not be startled awake this sounds as though i didnt like my daughter but i do i love her but i am somewhat in fear of her because i dont understand her if you use our stairs near the edge on the side of the wall they do not creak i discovered that as a tomcatting boy coming home from the back fences of the town i still use the knowledge if i do not want to disturb mary i used it nowmoved silently down the staircase trailing my fingers against the wall for guidance a dim and lacy sublight penetrated from the streetlamp side and dissipated to semidarkness away from the window but i could see ellen she seemed to have a glow perhaps her white nightgown her face was shadowed but her arms and hands picked up light she was standing at the glassfronted cabinet where the worthless family treasures are kept the carved scrimshaw the sperm whales and boats complete with oars and irons and crews harpooner in the bowall carved from whales bonelike teeth and the curved tusks of walrus a small model of the belleadair shiny with varnish her furled sails and cordage brown and dusty there were bits of the chinoiserie the old captains brought from the orient after they had stripped the china area of sperm whales bits and pieces ebony and ivory laughing and serious gods buddhas serene and dirty carved flowers in rose quartz and soapstone and some jadeyes some good jadeand thin cups translucent and lovely some of the things might be valuablelike the small shapeless horses which yet had lifebut if they were valuable it was an accident must have been how would those sailing whalekilling men know good from bador would they or did they the cabinet had always been the holy place of the parenti to meroman masks of the ancestors or the lares and penates back to a stone fallen from the moon we even had a mandrake roota perfect little man sprouted from the deathejected sperm of a hanged man and also we had a veritable mermaid pretty ratty by now but cleverly made by sewing the front end of a monkey and the after end of a fish together it had shrunk with the years and the stitches showed but its little teeth still showed in a ferocious smile i presume that every family has a magic thing a continuity thing that inflames and comforts and inspires from generation to generation ours was ahow shall i saya kind of mound of translucent stone perhaps quartz or jadeite or even soapstone it was circular four inches in diameter and an inch and a half at its rounded peak and carved on its surface was an endless interweaving shape that seemed to move and yet went no place it was living but had no head or tail nor beginning or end the polished stone was not slick to the touch but slightly tacky like flesh and it was always warm to the touch you could see into it and yet not through it i guess some old seaman of my blood had brought it back from china it was magicgood to see to touch to rub against your cheek or to caress with your fingers this strange and magic mound lived in the glass cabinet as child and boy and man i was allowed to touch it to handle it but never to carry it away and its color and convolutions and texture changed as my needs changed once i supposed it was a breast to me as a boy it became yoni inflamed and aching perhaps later it evolved to brain or even enigma the headless endless moving thingthe question which is whole within itself needing no answer to destroy it no beginning or end to limit it the glass case had a brass lock from colonial times and a square brass key always in the lock my sleeping daughter had the magic mound in her hands caressing it with her fingers petting it as though it were alive she pressed it against her unformed breast placed it on her cheek below her ear nuzzled it like a suckling puppy and she hummed a low song like a moan of pleasure and of longing there was destruction in her i had been afraid at first that she might want to crash it to bits or hide it away but now i saw that it was mother lover child in her hands i wondered how i might awaken her without fright but why are sleepwalkers awakened is it for fear that they may hurt themselves ive never heard of injury in this state except through awakening why should i interfere this was no nightmare full of pain or fear but rather pleasure and association beyond waking understanding what call had i to spoil it i moved quietly back and sat down in my big chair to wait the dim room seemed swarming with particles of brilliant light moving and whirling like clouds of gnats i guess they were not really there but only prickles of weariness swimming in the fluid of my eyes but they were very convincing and it did seem true that a glow came from my daughter ellen not only from the white of her gown but from her skin as well i could see her face and i should not have been able to in the darkened room it seemed to me that it was not a little girls face at allnor was it old but it was mature and complete and formed her lips closed firmly which they did not normally do after a time ellen put the talisman firmly and precisely back in its place and she closed the glassfronted case and twisted the brass key that kept it closed then she turned and walked past my chair and up the stairs two things i may have imaginedone that she did not walk like a child but like a fulfilled woman and second that as she went the luminescence drained away from her these may be impressions children of my mind but a third thing is not as she ascended the stairs there was no creak of wood she must have been walking near to the wall where the treads do not complain in a few moments i followed her and found her in her bed asleep and properly covered she breathed through her mouth and her face was a sleeping childs face on compulsion i went down the stairs again and opened the glass case i took the mound in my hands it was warm from ellens body as i had done in childhood i traced the endless flowing form with my forefingertip and i took comfort in it i felt close to ellen because of it i wonder did the stone bring her somehow close to meto the hawleys chapter nine on monday perfidious spring dodged back toward winter with cold rain and raw gusty wind that shredded the tender leaves of too trusting trees the bold and concupiscent bull sparrows on the lawns intent on lechery got blown about like rags off course and off target and they chattered wrathfully against the inconstant weather i greeted mr red baker on his tour his tail blown sideways like a battle flag he was an old acquaintance squinting his eyes against the rain i said from now on you and i can be friends on the surface but i feel it only right to tell you that our smiles conceal a savage contest a conflict of interests i could have said more but he was anxious to finish his chores and get under cover the morph was on time he may have been waiting for meprobably was hell of a day he said and his oiledsilk raincoat flapped and billowed around his legs i hear you did a social turn with my boss i needed some advice he gave me tea too hell do that you know how advice is you only want it if it agrees with what you wanted to do anyway sounds like investment my mary wants some new furniture when a woman wants something she first dresses it up as a good investment not only women either said morph i do it myself well its her money she wants to shop around for bargains at the corner of high street we watched a tin sign tear loose from rapps toy store and go skidding and screeching along sounding like a traffic accident say i heard your boss is going to make a trip home to italy i dont know seems odd to me he never went before those families are awful close got time for a cup of coffee i ought to get swept out should be a busy morning after the holiday oh come on live big the personal friend of mr baker can afford time for a cup of coffee he didnt say it meanly the way it looks in print he could make anything sound innocent and wellintentioned in all the years i had never gone into the foremaster grill for a cup of coffee in the morning and i was probably the only man in town who didnt it was a custom a habit and a club we climbed on stools at the counter and miss lynch i went to school with her slid coffee to us without spilling any in the saucer a tiny bottle of cream leaned against the cup but she rolled two paperwrapped cubes of sugar like dice so that morph cried out snake eyes miss lynchmiss lynch the miss was part of her name by now and part of herself i guess she will never be able to excise it her nose gets redder every year but its sinus not booze morning ethan she said you celebrating something he dragged me in i said and then as an experiment in kindness annie her head snapped around as though at a pistol shot and then as the idea got through she smiled and do you know she looked exactly as she had in the fifth grade red nose and all its good to see you ethan she said and wiped her nose on a paper napkin when i heard it i was surprised morph said he picked at the paper on the sugar cube his nails were polished you get an idea and then its fixed and you think its true gives you a turn when its not i dont know what youre talking about i guess i dont either goddam these wrappers why cant they just put it loose in a bowl maybe because people might use more i guess so i knew a guy once lived on sugar for a while hed go in the automat ten cents for a cup of coffee drink half fill it up with sugar at least he didnt starve to death as usual i wondered if that guy wasnt morpha strange one tough ageless man with a manicure i think he was a fairly welleducated man but only because of his processes his technique of thinking his erudition hid in a demiworld dialect a language of the bright hard brassy illiterate is that why you use one lump of sugar i asked he grinned everybodys got a theory he said i dont care how beat a guy is hell have a theory why hes beat a theory can lead you down the garden path cause youll follow it in spite of road signs i guess thats what fooled me about your boss i hadnt had coffee away from home in a long time it wasnt very good it didnt taste like coffee at all but it was hot and i spilled some on my shirt so i know it was also brown i guess i dont know what you mean i been trying to track where i got the idea i guess its because he says hes been here forty years thirtyfive years or thirtyseven years okay but not forty years i guess im not too bright that would make it you still dont dig it well in a bank youve got to case people quick check hustlers you know pretty soon you get a builtin set of rules you dont even think about it it just clicks into placeand you can be wrong maybe he did come in i could be wrong i finished my coffee time to sweep out i said you fool me too morph said if you asked questions id be hard to get but you dont so i got to tell you nineteen twentyone was the first emergency immigration law first emergency immigration law in the emergency quota act restricted us immigration by setting the number to be admitted from any country at percent of those from that country who lived in the united states in this act established a nationality quota system and in he could come in in he probably couldnt and soanyway my weasel brain sayshe came in after by the back door so he cant go home because he cant get a passport to get back god im glad im not a banker youd probably be better than i am i talk too much if hes going back im real wrong wait upim coming coffees on me by annie i said come in again eth you never come in i will as we crossed the street morph said dont let on to his guinea eminence that i pulled a blooper about him being deportation bait will you why should i why did i whats in that jewel case knight templars hat feathers yellow going to see if it can be whited up you belong to that its in the family we been masons masons freemasonry is the oldest and largest worldwide fraternity dedicated to the brotherhood of man under the fatherhood of a supreme being steinbecks father was a lifelong mason since before george washington was grand master he was does mr baker belong its in his family too we were in the alley now morph fished for the key to the banks back door maybe thats why we open the safe like a lodge meeting might as well be holding candles its kind of holy morph i said youre full of bull this morning easter didnt clean you up at all ill know in eight days he said no i mean it comes nine oclock on the nose we stand uncovered in front of the holy of holies then the time lock springs and father baker genuflects and opens the safe and we all bow down to the great god currency youre nuts morph maybe so goddam this old lock you could open it with an ice pick but not with the key he jiggled the key and kicked at the door until it finally burst open he took a piece of kleenex from his pocket and jammed it into the spring locks seat i caught myself about to ask isnt that dangerous he answered without the question damn thing wont lock itself open course baker checks to see its locked after the safes open dont blow my dirty suspicions to marullo will you hes too solvent okay morph i said and turned to my own door on my own side of the alley and looked around for the cat that always tried to get in but he wasnt there inside the store looked changed and new to me i saw things i had never seen before and didnt see things that had worried and irritated me and why not bring new eyes to a world or even new lenses and prestonew world the leaky valve of the old box toilet hissed softly marullo wouldnt get a new valve because the water wasnt metered and who cared i went to the front of the store and lifted a slotted twopound weight from the oldfashioned balance scale in the toilet i hung the weight on the chain above the oaken tassel the toilet flushed and kept on flushing i went back to the front of the store to listen and could hear it bubbling and scolding in the bowl its a sound you cant mistake for anything else then i returned the weight to its bar on the scale and took my place in my pulpit behind the counter my congregation in the shelves stood waiting poor devils they couldnt get away i particularly noticed the mickey mouse mask smiling down from its box in the pew of breakfast foods that reminded me of my promise to allen i found the extension hand for grabbing things from top shelves and took a box down and stood it under my coat in the storeroom when i was back in the pulpit the next mickey mouse in line smiled down at me i reached behind the canned goods and brought out the gray linen sack of small change for the cash register then remembering something reached farther until my hand found the old greasy caliber revolver that had been there ever since i can remember it was a silvered iver johnson iver johnson suicide special pocket pistol produced between and the early twentieth century with most of the silver peeled off i broke it and saw the cartridges green with verdigris the cylinder was so sluggish with ancient grease that it turned with difficulty i put the disreputable and probably dangerous piece in the drawer below the cash register pulled out a clean apron and wrapped it around my middle folding the top over neatly to conceal the strings is there anyone who has not wondered about the decisions and acts and campaigns of the mighty of the earth are they born in reasoning and dictated by virtue or can some of them be the products of accidents of daydreaming of imagining of the stories we tell ourselves i know exactly how long i had been playing a game of imagining because i know it started with the morphs rules for successful bank robbery i had gone over his words with a childish pleasure adults ordinarily will not admit it was a play game that ran parallel with the stores life and everything that happened seemed to fall into place in the game the leaking toilet the mickey mouse mask allen wanted the account of the opening of the safe new curves and angles dropped into place the kleenex nudged in the door lock in the alley little by little the game grew but entirely in the mind until this morning putting the scale weight on the toilet chain was the first physical contribution i had made to the mental ballet getting the old pistol out was the second and now i began to wonder about the timing the game was growing in precision i still carry my fathers big silver hamilton railroad watch with thick hands and big black numbers a wonderful watch for timetelling if not for beauty this morning i put it in my shirt pocket before i swept out the store and i checked the time so that at five minutes to nine i had the front doors open and had just taken the first deliberate broom strokes at the sidewalk its amazing how much dirt accumulates over a weekend and what with the rain the dirt was slush what a wonderful precision instrument is our banklike my fathers railroad watch at five minutes of nine mr baker came into the wind from elm street harry robbit and edith alden must have been watching they backed out of the foremaster grill and joined him midstreet morning mr baker i called morning edith morning harry good morning ethan youre going to need a hose for that they entered the bank i leaned my broom in the store entrance took the weight from the scale went behind the cash register opened the drawer and went through fast but deliberate pantomime i walked to the storeroom hung the weight on the toilet chain hooked the skirt of my apron over the belly band put on my raincoat and stepped to the back door and opened it a crack as the black minute hand of my watch crossed twelve the clock bell of the firehouse began bonging i counted eight steps across the alley and then in my mind twenty steps i moved my hand but not my lipsallowed ten seconds moved my hand again all this i saw in my mindi counted while my hands made certain movementstwenty steps quick but deliberate then eight more steps i closed the alley door took off my raincoat unhooked my apron went into the toilet took the weight off the chain and stopped the flushing moved back of the counter opened the drawer opened my hatbox and closed and strapped it went back to the entrance took up my broom and looked at the watch it was two minutes and twenty seconds past nine oclock pretty good but with a little practice it could be cut under two minutes i was only half finished with the sidewalk when stoney the chief constable came across from the foremaster grill morning eth gimme a quick halfpound of butter pound of bacon bottle of milk and a dozen eggs my wife run out of everything sure thing chief hows everything i got the things together and snapped open a bag okay he said i come by a minute ago but i heard you was in the can itll take me a week to get over all those hardboiled eggs thats the truth said stoney mans got to go hes got to go so that was all right as he was about to leave he said whats with your friend danny taylor i dont knowis he on one no he looked pretty good fairly clean i was sitting in the car he had me witness his signature for what i dont know had two papers but turned back so i couldnt see two papers yeah two he signed twice and i witnessed twice was he sober seemed like had his hair cut and a necktie on i wish i could believe it chief so do i poor fella i guess they never stop trying i got to get home and he galloped away stoneys wife is twenty years younger than he is i went back and brushed the larger pieces of filth off the sidewalk i felt lousy maybe the first time is always hard i was right about the heavy custom it seemed to me that everybody in town had run out of everything and since our deliveries of fruits and vegetables didnt come in until about noon the pickings were pretty slim but even with what we had the customers kept me jumping marullo came in about ten oclock and for a wonder he gave me a hand weighing and wrapping and ringing up money on the cash register he hadnt helped around the store for a long time mostly he just wandered in and looked around and went outlike an absentee landlord but this morning he helped to open the crates and boxes of fresh stuff when it came in it seemed to me that he was uneasy and that he studied me when i wasnt looking we didnt have time to talk but i could feel his eyes on me i thought it must be hearing that i had refused the bribe maybe morph was right a certain kind of man if he hears you have been honest probes for the dishonesty that prompted it the whatshegettingoutofit attitude must be particularly strong in men who play their own lives like a poker hand the thought gave me a little chuckle but a deep one that didnt even raise a bubble to the surface about eleven oclock my mary came in shining in a new cotton print she looked pretty and happy and a little breathless as though she had done a pleasant but dangerous thingand she had she gave me a brown manila envelope i thought you might be wanting this she said she smiled at marullo the bright birdlike way she does when she doesnt really like someone and she didnt like or trust marullonever had i always put it down to the fact that a wife never likes her husbands boss or his secretary i said thank you dear youre very thoughtful sorry i cant take you for a boat ride on the nile right now you are busy she said well didnt you run out of everything sure i did here ive got a list will you bring things home tonight i know youre too rushed to put them up now but no hardboiled eggs no darling not for a whole year those easter bunnies were sure busy margie wants to take us to dinner at the foremaster tonight she says she never gets to entertain us fine i said she says her place is too small is it im keeping you from your work she said marullos eyes were on the brown envelope in my hand i put it up under my apron and stuffed it in my pocket he knew it was a bank envelope and i could feel his mind hunting like a terrier after rats in a city dump mary said i didnt get a chance to thank you for the candy mr marullo the children loved it just good wishes of the easter he said you dress like springtime why thank you i got wet too i thought the rain was over but it came back take my raincoat mary i wouldnt think of it its just a shower now you get back to your customers the pace got worse mr baker looked in and saw the line of people waiting and went out ill come back later he called and still they came right up until noon and then as usually happens all custom stopped people were eating lunch the traffic died out in the street for the first time all morning no one was wanting something i drank more milk from the carton i had opened anything i took from the store i marked down and just deducted it from my pay marullo let me have things wholesale it makes a big difference i dont think we could have lived on my pay if he hadnt he leaned back against the counter and folded his arms and that hurt so he shoved his hands in his pockets until that hurt i said im sure glad you helped out never saw such a rush but i guess they cant go on living on leftover potato salad you do a nice job kid i do a job no they come back they like you theyre just used to me ive been here forever and then i tried a little tiny probe ill bet youre looking forward to that hot sicilian sun it is hot in sicily i was there in the war marullo looked away i dont make my mind yet why not well i been away so long timeforty years i dont know nobody there but you have relatives they dont know me neither i sure wish i could take a vacation in italywithout a rifle and a field pack forty years is a long time though what year did you come over nineteen twentylong time ago morph seemed to have hit it on the nose maybe bankers and cops and customs men get an instinct then another maybe a little deeper probe came to my mind i opened the drawer and took out the old revolver and tossed it on the counter marullo put his hands behind him what you got there kid i just thought you ought to get a permit for it if you havent got one the sullivan act is a tough one whered it come from its been here all along i never saw it it dont belong to me its yours not mine i never saw it before either its got to belong to somebody long as its here dont you think you better apply for a permit you sure its not yours i tell you i never saw it i dont like guns thats funny i thought all big mafia men loved em how you mean mafia you trying to say im mafia i made a big innocent joke about it the way i heard it all sicilians belong to mafia thats crazy i dont even know no mafia i tossed the gun into the drawer live and learn i said well i sure dont want it maybe i better turn it over to stoney tell him i just came on it behind something because thats what i did you do that said marullo i never saw it in my life i dont want it its not mine okay i said out it goes it takes quite a few documents to get a sullivan act permitalmost as many as to get a passport my boss had ants maybe too many small things had happened too close together the elderly miss elgar the princess royal of new baytown came in closehauled with a set jib between miss elgar and the world were two plates of safety glass a space between she negotiated for a dozen eggs having known me as a little boy she never thought of me as anything else i could see that she was amazed and pleased that i could make change i thank you ethan she said her eyes slid over the coffeegrinder and over marullo and gave equal attention to each hows your father ethan fine miss elgar i said give him my greetings thats a good boy yes maam i surely will maam i wasnt about to reregulate her time sense they say she still winds the grandfather clock every sunday night and it has been electrified for years it wouldnt be bad to be that way suspended in timenot bad at all an endless afternoon of now she nodded gravely to the coffeegrinder before she left crazy in the head marullo said and screwed his forefinger into his temple nobody changes nobody gets hurt your father is dead why dont you tell her hes dead if shed believed me shed forget it she always asks after him its not so long ago she stopped inquiring after my grandfather she was his friend they say the old goat crazy in the head marullo observed but for some reason having to do with miss elgars unusual feeling about time he had got hold of himself its hard to know how simple or complicated a man is when you become too sure youre usually wrong i think from habit and practice marullo had reduced his approaches to men to three command flattery and purchase and the three must have worked often enough to allow him to depend on them somewhere in his dealing with me he had lost the first youre a good kid he said youre a good friend too old capn he was my grandfather used to say if you want to keep a friend never test him thats smart he was smart all over sunday i been thinking kideven in church i was thinking i knew he had been worried about the kickback at least i thought he had so i jumped it out to save him time about that fine present huh yeah he looked at me with admiration youre smart too not smart enough to be working for myself you been here how longtwelve years thats ittoo long bout time for a change dont you think and you never took none of the petty cash and you never took nothing home without you wrote it down honesty is a racket with me dont make no joke what i say is true i check i know you may pin the medal on my left lapel everybody stealssome more some lessbut not you i know maybe im waiting to steal the whole thing dont make jokes what i say is true alfio youve got a jewel dont polish me too much the paste may show through why dont you be partners with me on what my salary we work it out some way then i couldnt steal from you without robbing myself he laughed appreciatively youre smart kid but you dont steal you didnt listen maybe i plan to take it all youre honest kid thats what im telling you when im most honest nobody believes me i tell you alfio to conceal your motives tell the truth what kind of talk you do ars est celare artem ars est celare artem latin for it is art to conceal art ovid ars amatoria the art of love ad he moved his lips over that and then broke into a laugh ho he cried ho ho hic erat demonstrandum hic erat demonstrandum latin for the thing that has to be demonstrated want a cold coke no good for here he flung his arms across his abdomen you arent old enough for a bad stomach not over fifty fiftytwo and i got a bad stomach okay i said then you came over at twelve if it was i guess they start latin early in sicily i was choirboy he said i used to carry the cross in the choir myself im going to have a coke alfio i said you work out a way for me to buy in here and ill look at it but i warn you i dont have money we work it out but im going to have money his eyes were on my face and couldnt seem to remove themselves and marullo said softly io lo credo io lo credo latin for i believe it power but not of glory surged through me i opened a coke and tipping it back looked down its brown barrel at marullos eyes youre a good kid he said and he shook my hand and wandered away out of the store on an impulse i called after him how does your arm feel he turned with a look of astonishment it dont hurt no more he said and he went on and repeated the words to himself it dont hurt no more he came back excitedly you got to take that dough what dough that five per cent why you got to take it you can buy in with me a little and a little only hold out for six per cent no what you mean no if i say yes i wont need it alfio id take it if i needed to but i dont need it he sighed deeply the afternoon wasnt as busy as the morning but it wasnt light either theres always a slack time between three and fourusually twenty minutes to half an hour i dont know why then it picks up again but thats people going home from work and wives whomping up a lastditch dinner in the slack period mr baker came in he waited regarding the cheese and sausage in the cold chamber until the store was clear of two customers both sloppy shoppers the kind who dont know what they want the kind who pick up and put down hoping that something will jump into their arms and demand to be bought at last the shoppers were finished and gone ethan he said did you know mary drew out a thousand dollars yes sir she told me she was going to do you know what she wants it for sure sir shes been talking about it for months you know how women are the furniture gets a little worn but just the minute they decide to get new the old stuff is just impossible dont you think its foolish to spend it now on that kind of stuff i told you yesterday there was going to be an opening its her money sir i wasnt talking about gambling ethan i was talking about surefire investment i believe with that thousand she could get her furniture in a year and still have a thousand mr baker i cant very well forbid her to spend her own money couldnt you persuade her couldnt you reason with her it never occurred to me that sounds like your father ethan that sounds wishywashy if im going to help you get on your feet i cant have you wishywashy well sir and it isnt like she was going to spend it locally no shes going to wander around the discount houses and pay cash theres no telling what shell pick up local man might charge more but hed be here if she got a lemon you should put your foot down ethan try to get her to redeposit it or you tell her to put the money in my hands shell never regret it its money her brother left her sir i know that i tried to reason with her when she drew it she just turned blueeyed vaguesaid she wanted to look around cant she look around without a thousand dollars in her pocket you ought to know better if she doesnt i guess im out of practice mr baker we havent had any money since we were married well youd better learn and learn quick or you wont have any very long the spending habit is like a dope with some women mary hasnt had a chance to develop the habit sir well she will just let her taste blood and shell turn killer mr baker i dont think you mean that i do too theres never been a more careful wife with money shes had to be for some reason he had worked up a storm its you im disappointed in ethan if youre going to get any place youve got to be the boss in your own house you could hold off new furniture another little while i could but she cant the thought came to me that maybe bankers develop xray eyes for money that maybe he could see the envelope through my clothes ill try to reason with her mr baker if she hasnt spent it already is she home now she said she was going to get a bus to ridgehampton good god there goes a thousand bucks well she still has some capital thats not the point your only entrance is money money gets money i said softly thats right lose sight of that and youre a gone goose a clerk for the rest of your life im sorry it happened well you better lay down the law women are funny sir maybe your talking about making money yesterday gave her the idea it was easy to get well you disabuse her because without it you cant get any would you like a cold coke sir yes i would he couldnt drink it out of the bottle i had to open a package of paper picnic cups but it cooled him a little he muttered like retreating thunder two negro ladies from the crossing came in and he had to swallow his coke and his rage you talk to her he said savagely and he strode out and crossed the street to go home i wondered if he was mad because he was suspicious but i didnt think so no i think he was mad because he felt hed lost his habit of command you can get furious at someone who doesnt take your advice the negro ladies were pleasant theres a community of colored at the crossing very nice people they dont trade with us much because they have their own store only now and then they do some comparative shopping to see if their racial loyalty isnt costing them too much they did more pricing than buying and i understand whypretty women too such long straight slender legs its a wonder what a lack of malnutrition in childhood can do for the human body or the human spirit for that matter just before closing time i telephoned mary pigeonflake im going to be a little late dont forget were having dinner with margie at the foremaster i remember how late are you going to be ten or fifteen minutes i want to walk down and look at the dredger in the harbor why im thinking of buying it oh want me to pick up some fish well if you see some nice flounder thats about all thats running all rightim running now dont dawdle youll have to bathe and change the foremaster you know i wont my fair my lovely mr baker gave me hell for letting you spend a thousand dollars why that old goat marymary the walls have ears you tell him what he can do but he cant besides he thinks youre a nitwit what and im a wishywashy a washywishya you know how i am she was laughing her lovely trill something that raises goose lumps of pleasure on my soul hurry home darling she said hurry home and hows that for a man to have when i hung up i stood by the phone all weak and leaky and happy if there is such a condition i tried to think how it had been before mary and i couldnt remember or how it would be without her and i could not imagine it except that it would be a condition bordered in black i guess everyone at some time or other writes his epitaph mine would be goodby charley the sun was below the western hills but a great powdery cloud scooped its light and threw it on the harbor and the breakwater and the sea beyond so that the whitecaps were pink as roses the piles in the water by the city pier are triple logs ironbanded at the top and sloping like pylons to shear the winter ice on top of each one a gull stood motionless usually a male with white immaculate vest and clean gray wings i wonder if each one owns his place and can sell or rent it at will a few fishing boats were in i know all the fishermen have known them all my life and mary was right they only had flounder i bought four nice ones from joe logan and stood by while he filleted them for me his knife slipping along the spine as easily as it would through water in the spring there is one sure subjectwhen will the weakfish come we used to say when lilacs bloom the weakfish coome but you cant depend on it seems to me that all my life the weaks have not arrived or have just left and what beautiful fish they are when you get one slender as trout clean silver assilver they smell good well they werent running joe logan hadnt taken a single one me i like blowfish joe said funny thing when you call them blowfish nobody will touch them but call them sea chicken and customers fight for them hows your daughter joe oh she seems to get better and then she fades off its killing me too bad im sorry if there was anything to do i knowpoor kid heres a bag just drop the flounders in it give her my love joe he looked me long in the eyes as though he hoped to draw something out of me some medicine ill do that eth he said ill tell her back of the breakwater the county dredger was working its giant screw augering up mud and shells and the pumps pushing the junk through pipe on pontoons and flinging it behind the blacktarred bulkheads on the shore its running lights were on and its riding lights too and two red balls were hoisted to show that it was working a pale cook in white cap and apron leaned his bare arms on the rail and looked down into the troubled water and occasionally he spat into the roil the wind was inshore it brought from the dredger the stink of mud and longdead shells and tarnished weed together with the sweet smell of baking cinnamon in apple pie the great auger turned with majesty boring out the channel then with a flash of pink the sails of a lithe yacht caught the afterglow and came about and lost the light i wandered back and turned left past the new marina and the old yacht club and the american legion hall with brownpainted machine guns mounted beside its steps at the boatyard they were working late trying to get the stored craft painted and ready against the coming summer the unusual cold of the early spring had set them back with the painting and varnishing i walked well past the boat works and then down through the weedgrown lot to the harbors edge and then slowly back toward dannys leanto shack and i whistled an old tune against his wishing me to and it seemed he did his shack was empty but i knew as surely as if i saw him that danny was lying hidden in the weeds perhaps between the huge square timbers that were scattered about and since i knew he would come back as soon as i was gone i took the brown envelope from my pocket and propped it on his dirty bed and i went away still whistling except for one moment when i called softly goodby danny good luck and i went on whistling back to the street and over to porlock and past the great houses to elm and so to my ownthe hawley house i found my mary in the eye of a storm quiet and slowly rotating herself with debris and great winds surging around her she directed the devastation in her white nylon slip and slippers her newwashed hair clustered on curlers on her head like a large litter of suckling sausages i cant remember when we had been out to dinner at a restaurant we couldnt afford it and had lost the habit marys wild excitement fluttered the children on the edges of her personal hurricane she fed them washed them issued orders rescinded orders the ironing board was standing in the kitchen with my dear and valued clothing pressed and hanging on the backs of chairs mary would pause in her gallop to swipe the iron at a dress she was pressing the children were almost too excited to eat but they had their orders i have five suits called besta good number for a grocery clerk to have i fingered them on the chair backs they were called old blue sweet george brown dorian gray burying black and old dobbin which one shall i wear cuddles cuddles oh well its not formal and its monday night id say it would be sweet george or dorian yes dorian thats formal enough without being formal and my polkadot bow tie of course ellen broke in papa youre not going to wear a bow tie youre too old i am not im young and gay and giddy youll be a laughing stork im glad im not going i am too where do you get the idea that im an old stork well you arent old but youre too old for a bow tie youre a nasty little conformist well if you want to be a laughing stork thats what i want to be mary dont you want me to be a laughing stork let your father alone he has to bathe i laid a shirt out on the bed allen said im halfway through my i love america essay thats good because come summer im going to put you to work work in the store oh he didnt seem too enthusiastic ellen gave an opening gasp but when she had our attention she didnt say anything mary repeated the eightyfive things the children were to do and not to do while we were gone and i went upstairs for my tub i was tying my dear blue polkadot my only blue polkadot tie when ellen leaned in against the door it wouldnt be so bad if you were younger she said with dreadful femininity youre going to give some happy husband a rough time my dear even the seniors in high school wouldnt wear it prime minister macmillan prime minister macmillan harold macmillan was prime minister of england from to does thats different daddy is it cheating to copy something out of a book explain well if a person if i was writing my essay and i took stuff out of a bookhow about that it would depend on how you did it like you saidexplain dont you mean as i said yes well if you put quotation marks around it and a footnote telling who wrote it it could add dignity and authority i guess half the writing in america is quotations if it isnt anthologies now do you like my tie spose you didnt put those marks then it would be stealing like any other kind of stealing you didnt do that did you no then what is your problem could they put you in jail mightif you got money for it dont do it my girl now what do you think about my tie i guess youre just impossible she said if you plan to join the others you might tell your blinking brother that i brought him his bleeding mickey mouse mask and shame on him you never listen really listen i do too no you dont youll be sorry goodby leda say hello to the swan leda swan in greek mythology leda wife of the king of sparta is seduced by zeus in the form of a swan she lounged away a babyfatted volupt girls kill me they turn out to be girls my mary was just beautiful just beautiful and shining a light from inside her oozed out of her pores she took my arm as we walked down elm street under the arching trees with the street lights playing on us and i swear our legs moved with the proud and tender steps of thoroughbreds coming to the barrier you must come to rome egypt isnt big enough for you the great world calls she giggled i swear she giggled as would have done honor to our daughter were going to go out more often my darling when when we are rich when is that soon im going to teach you to wear shoes will you light your cigars with tendollar bills twenties i like you shucks maam you oughten to say that you plumb embarrass me not long ago the owners of the foremaster installed bow windows on the street with small square panes of bottle glass designed to make the place look old and authenticand it did so lookbut people sitting inside at the tables had their faces altered by the warping glass one face would be all jaw another one big vacant eye but it all added to the age and the authenticity of the old foremaster and so did the geraniums and lobelias in the window boxes margie was waiting for us hostess to her fingertips she introduced her companion a mr hartog of new york sunlamp tanned and set with teeth like an ear of country gentleman mr hartog looked wrapped and shellacked but he answered all sentences with an appreciative laugh that was his contribution and it wasnt a bad one how dyou do said mary mr hartog laughed i said i hope you know your companion is a witch mr hartog laughed we all felt good margie said ive asked for a table by the window that one there you also had them put special flowers margie mary i have to do something to repay all your kindness they went on like this during and after margie had seated us and mr hartog laughed at every period clearly a brilliant man i made a plan to get a word from him but later the set table seemed fine and very white and the silver which wasnt silver looked extra silvery margie said im the hostess and that means im the boss and i say martinis whether you want them or not mr hartog laughed the martinis came not in little glasses but big as bird baths with twists of lemon peel the first taste bit like a vampire bat made its little anesthesia and after that the drink mellowed and toward the bottom turned downright good were going to have two said margie the foods pretty good here but not that good then i told how i had always planned to open a bar where you could only get your second martini i would make a fortune mr hartog laughed and four more bird baths appeared at our table while i was still chewing the first lemon peel with the first taste of his second drink mr hartog developed the power of speech he had a low vibrant voice like that of an actor or a singer or a salesman of some product people dont want you might even call it a bedside voice mrs younghunt tells me youre in business here he said its a fascinating townunspoiled i was about to tell him exactly what my business consisted in when margie took the ball mr hawley is the coming power of this county she said so what line are you in mr hawley everything said margie absolutely everything but not openly you understand her eyes had a liquor shine i looked at marys eyes and they were just beginning to surface so i judged the others had had a couple before we came or at least margie had well that saves me from denying it i said mr hartog came back to his laugh you have a lovely wife thats half the battle thats the whole battle ethan youll make him think we fight oh we do i gulped half the glass and felt the warmth spring up behind my eyes and i was looking at the bottle end of one of the tiny window panes it caught the candlelight and seemed to revolve slowly maybe it was selfhypnosis for i heard my own voice go on listened to myself from outside myself mrs margie is the witch of the east witch of the east ozma in the wonderful wizard of oz by l frank baum the wicked witch of the west ruler of the munchkins is killed when dorothys house falls on her princess ozma daughter of the king of oz appears in every other oz book a martini is not a drink its a potion the gleaming glass still held me oh dear i always thought of myself as ozma wasnt the witch of the east a wicked witch she was indeed and didnt she melt through the crooked glass i saw a mans figure walking past on the sidewalk he was all misshaped by the distortion but he carried his head a little to the left and walked curiously on the outsides of his feet danny did that i saw myself leap up and run after him i saw myself run to the corner of elm street but he had disappeared perhaps in the back garden of the second house i called danny danny give me back the money please danny give it to me dont take it its poisoned i poisoned it i heard a laugh it was mr hartogs laugh margie said well i would rather be ozma i wiped the tears from my eyes with my napkin and explained i should drink it not bathe my eyes in it it burns your eyes are all red mary said i couldnt get back to the party but i heard myself talk and tell stories and i heard my mary laugh like golden glory so i guess i was funny and even charming but i couldnt ever get back to the table and i think margie knew it she kept looking at me with a concealed question damn her she was a witch i dont know what we had to eat i remember white wine so perhaps it was fish the brittle glass revolved like a propeller and there was brandy so i must have had coffeeand then it was over going out when mary and mr hartog had gone ahead margie asked where did you go i dont know what you mean you went away you were only part here aroint ye witch okay bud she said on our way home i searched the shadows of the gardens mary clung to my arm and her footsteps were a little jerky what a nice time she said i never had a better time it was nice margies a perfect hostess i dont know how ill match that dinner she surely is and you ethan i knew you could be funny but you had us laughing all the time mr hartog said he was weak from laughing about mr red baker had i told that which one i must have oh dannygive back the money please youre better than a show my mary said and in our own doorway i grabbed her so tight that she whimpered youre tipped darling youre hurting please dont lets wake the children it was my intention to wait until she slept and then to creep out to go to his shack to look for him even to put the police on him but i knew better danny was gone i knew danny was gone and i lay in the darkness and watched the little red and yellow spots swimming in the water of my eyes i knew what i had done and danny knew it too i thought of my small rabbit slaughter maybe its only the first time thats miserable it has to be faced in business and in politics a man must carve and maul his way through men to get to be king of the mountain once there he can be great and kindbut he must get there first chapter ten the templeton airfield is only about forty miles from new baytown and thats about five minutes flying time for the jets they come over with increasing regularity swarms of deadly gnats i wish i could admire them even love them the way my son allen does if they had more than one purpose maybe i could but their only function is killing and ive had a bellyful of that i havent learned as allen has to locate them by looking ahead of the sound they make they go through the sound barrier with a boom that makes me think the furnace has exploded when they go over at night they get into my dreams and i awaken with a sad sick feeling as though my soul had an ulcer early in the morning a flight of them boomed through and i jumped awake a little trembly they must have made me dream of those german millimeter allpurpose rifles we used to admire and fear so much my body was prickly with fear sweat as i lay in the gathering morning light and listened to the slender spindles of malice whining away in the distance i thought how that shudder was under the skin of everybody in the world not in the mind deep under the skin its not the jets so much as what their purpose is when a condition or a problem becomes too great humans have the protection of not thinking about it but it goes inward and minces up with a lot of other things already there and what comes out is discontent and uneasiness guilt and a compulsion to get somethinganythingbefore it is all gone maybe the assemblyline psychoanalysts arent dealing with complexes at all but with those warheads that may one day be mushroom clouds it does seem to me that nearly everyone i see is nervous and restless and a little loud and gaily crazy like people getting drunk on new years eve should auld acquaintance be forgot and kiss your neighbors wife i turned my head toward mine she was not smiling in her sleep her mouth was drawn down and there were lines of weariness around her squinchedshut eyes and so she was sick because thats the way she looks when she is sick she is the wellest wife in the world until she is sick which isnt often and then she is the sickest wife in the world another flight of jets exploded through sound we had maybe a halfmillion years to get used to fire and less than fifteen to build thinking about this force so extravagantly more fierce than fire would we ever have the chance to make a tool of this if the laws of thinking are the laws of things can fission be happening in the soul is that what is happening to me to us i remember a story aunt deborah told me long ago early in the last century some of my people were cambellites cambellites church founded in by a scotchirish clergyman and his son the cambellites stressed the importance of the new testament individual spiritual renewal education and the unification of all christians in christ aunt deborah was a child then but she remembered how the end of the world was coming at a certain time her parents gave everything away everything they owned but the bed sheets those they put on and at the predicted time they went to the hills to meet the end of the world dressed in sheets hundreds of people prayed and sang the night came and they sang louder and danced and as it got near time there was a shooting star she said and everybody screamed she could still remember the screaming like wolves she said like hyenas although she had never heard a hyena then the moment came whitedressed men and women and children held their breaths the moment went on and on the children got blue in the faceand then it passed it was done and they were cheated out of their destruction in the dawn they crept down the hill and tried to get back the clothes they had given away and the pots and pans and their ox and their ass and i remember knowing how bad they must have felt i think what brought that back was the jetsall that enormous effort and time and money to stockpile all that death would we feel cheated if we never used it we can shoot rockets into space but we cant cure anger or discontent my mary opened her eyes ethan she said youre talking in your mind i dont know what its about but its loud stop thinking ethan i was going to suggest that she give up drink but she looked too miserable i dont always know when not to joke but this time i said head yes stomach yes all over all over ill get you something get me a grave stay down i cant ive got to get the children off to school ill do it youve got to go to work ill do it i tell you after a moment she said ethan i dont think i can get up i feel too bad doctor no i cant leave you alone can ellen stay with you no she has examinations could i call up margie younghunt to come over her phone is out shes getting a new thingamabob i can go by and ask her shed kill anybody that waked her this early i could slip a note under her door no i dont want you to nothing to it no no i dont want you to i dont want you to i cant leave you alone thats funny i feel better i guess it was shouting at you that did it well its true she said and to prove it she got up and put on her dressing gown she did look better youre wonderful my darling i cut myself shaving and went down to breakfast with a red tatter of toilet paper sticking to my face no morph standing on the porch picking his teeth when i went by i was glad i didnt want to see him i hurried just in case he might try to catch up with me when i opened the alley door i saw the brown bank envelope that had been pushed under it it was sealed and bank envelopes are tough i had to get out my pocket knife to slit it open three sheets of paper from a fivecent lined school pad written on with a soft lead pencil a will i being in my right mind and in consideration i a note of hand i agree to repay and pledge my both papers signed the writing neat and precise dear eth this is what you want the skin on my face felt as hard as a crabs back i closed the alley door slowly as youd close a vault the first two sheets of paper i folded carefully and placed in my wallet and the other i crumpled it and put it in the toilet and pulled the chain its a high box toilet with a kind of step in the bowl the balled paper resisted going over the edge but finally it did the alley door was a little open when i emerged from the cubicle i thought i had closed it going toward it i heard a small sound and looking up i saw that damn cat on one of the top storage shelves hooking out with its claws for a hanging side of bacon it took a longhandled broom and quite a chase to drive it out into the alley as it streaked past me i swiped at it and missed and broke the broom handle against the doorjamb there was no sermon for the canned goods that morning i couldnt raise a text but i did get out a hose to wash down the front sidewalk and the gutter too afterward i cleaned the whole store even corners long neglected and choked with flug and i sang too now is the winter of our discontent made glorious summer by this sun of york i know its not a song but i sang it part two chapter eleven new baytown is a lovely place its harbor once a great one is sheltered from the northeast screamers by an offshore island the village is strewn about a complex of inland waters fed by the tides which at ebb and flow drive wild races through narrow channels from the harbor and the sea it is not a crowded or an urban town except for the great houses of the longgone whalers the dwellings are small and neat distributed among fine old trees oaks of several kinds maples and elms hickory and some cypresses but except for the old planted elms on the original streets the native timber is largely oak once the virgin oaks were so many and so large that several shipyards drew planks and knees keels and keelsons from nearby communities like people have periods of health and times of sicknesseven youth and age hope and despondency there was a time when a few towns like new baytown furnished the whale oil that lighted the western world student lamps of oxford and cambridge drew fuel from this american outpost and then petroleum rock oil gushed out in pennsylvania and cheap kerosene called coal oil took the place of whale oil and retired most of the sea hunters sickness or despair fell on new baytownperhaps an attitude from which it did not recover other towns not too far away grew and prospered on other products and energies but new baytown whose whole living force had been in squarerigged ships and whales sank into torpor the snake of population crawling out from new york passed new baytown by leaving it to its memories and as usually happens new baytown people persuaded themselves that they liked it that way they were spared the noise and litter of summer people the garish glow of neon signs the spending of tourist money and tourist razzledazzle only a few new houses were built around the fine inland waters but the snake of population continued to writhe out and everyone knew that sooner or later it would engulf the village of new baytown the local people longed for that and hated the idea of it at the same time the neighboring towns were rich spilled over with loot from tourists puffed with spoils gleamed with the great houses of the new rich old baytown spawned art and ceramics and pansies and the damn broadfooted brood of lesbos wove handmade fabrics and small domestic intrigues new baytown talked of the old days and of flounder and when the weakfish would start running in the reedy edges of the inner waters the mallards nested and brought out their young flotillas muskrats dug communities and swam lithely in the early morning the ospreys hung aimed and plummeted on fish and sea gulls carried clams and scallops high in the air and dropped them to break them open for eating some otters still clove the water like secret furry whispers rabbits poached in the gardens and gray squirrels moved like little waves in the streets of the village cock pheasants flapped and coughed their crowing blue herons poised in the shallow water like leggy rapiers and at night the bitterns cried out like lonesome ghosts spring is late and summer late at new baytown but when it comes it has a soft wild and special sound and smell and feeling in early june the world of leaf and blade and flowers explodes and every sunset is different then in the evening the bobwhites state their crisp names and after dark there is a wall of sound of whippoorwill the oaks grow fat with leaf and fling their longtasseled blossoms in the grass then dogs from various houses meet and go on picnics wandering bemused and happy in the woods and sometimes they do not come home for days in june man hustled by instinct mows grass riffles the earth with seeds and locks in combat with mole and rabbit ant beetle bird and all others who gather to take his garden from him woman looks at the curlingedge petals of a rose and melts a little and sighs and her skin becomes a petal and her eyes are stamens june is gaycool and warm wet and shouting with growth and reproduction of the sweet and the noxious the builder and the spoiler the girls in bodyform slacks wander the high street with locked hands while small transistor radios sit on their shoulders and whine love songs in their ears the young boys bleeding with sap sit on the stools of tangers drugstore ingesting future pimples through straws they watch the girls with level goateyes and make disparaging remarks to one another while their insides whimper with longing in june businessmen drop by al n sues or the foremaster for a beer and stay for whisky and get sweatily drunk in the afternoon even in the afternoon the dusty cars creep to the desolate dooryard of the remote and paintless house with every blind drawn at the end of mill street where alice the village whore receives the afternoon problems of junebitten men and all day long the rowboats anchor off the breakwater and happy men and women coax up their dinners from the sea june is painting and clipping plans and projects its a rare man who doesnt bring home cement blocks and twobyfours and on the backs of envelopes rough out drawings of taj mahals a hundred little boats lie belly down and keel up on the shore their bottoms gleaming with copper paint and their owners straighten up and smile at the slow unmoving windrows still school grips the intransigent children until near to the end of the month and when examination time comes rebellion foams up and the common cold becomes epidemic a plague which disappears on closing day in june the happy seed of summer germinates where shall we go over the glorious fourth of july its getting on time we should be planning our vacation june is the mother of potentials ducklings swim bravely perhaps to the submarine jaws of snapping turtles lettuces lunge toward drought tomatoes rear defiant stems toward cutworms and families match the merits of sand and sunburn over fretful mountain nights loud with mosquito symphonies this year im going to rest i wont get so tired this year i wont allow the kids to make my free two weeks a hell on wheels i work all year this is my time i work all year vacation planning triumphs over memory and alls right with the world alls right with the world robert browning pippa passes part new baytown had slept for a long time the men who governed it politically morally economically had so long continued that their ways were set the town manager the council the judges the police were eternal the town manager sold equipment to the township and the judges fixed traffic tickets as they had for so long that they did not remember it as illegal practiceat least the books said it was being normal men they surely did not consider it immoral all men are moral only their neighbors are not the yellow afternoon had the warm breath of summer a few early season people those without children to hold them glued until school was out were moving in the streets strangers some cars came through towing small boats and big outboard motors on trailers ethan would have known with his eyes closed that they were summer people by what they boughtcold cuts and process cheese crackers and tinned sardines joey morphy came in

spurt between five and six came on schedule the sun held back by daylightsaving was still high and the streets light as midafternoon when he brought in the fruit bins and closed the front doors and drew the green shades then reading from a list he gathered the supplies to carry home and put them all in one big bag with his apron off and his coat and hat on he boosted up and sat on the counter and stared at the shelves of the congregation no message he said only remember the words of satchel paige i guess i have to learn about not looking back he took the folded lined pages from his wallet made a little envelope for them of waxed paper then opening the enamel door to the works of the cold counter he slipped the waxy envelope in a corner behind the compressor and closed the metal door on it under the cash register on a shelf he found the dusty and dogeared manhattan telephone book kept there for emergency orders to the supply house under u under united states under justice dept of his finger moved down the column past antitrust div us court house customs div detention hdqtrs fed bur of investgatn and under it immigration naturalization svce w bway ba nights sat sun holidays ol he

carried his bag of groceries across the street to the foremaster hotel and grill the grill was noisy with cocktailers but the tiny lobby where the public phone booth stood was deserted even by the room clerk he closed the glass door put his groceries on the floor spread his change on the shelf inserted a dime and dialed operator oh operatori want to call new york will you dial the number please

dont take your bad temper out on him all right but it would help if i could ethan pushed through the living room where allen was squawking vaguely recognizable words from a vibrating reed held on his tongue what in the world is that allen spat it into his palm from that box of peeks its ventriloquism did you eat the peeks no i dont like it ive got to practice dad hold up a moment ethan sat down what do you plan to do with your life huh the future havent they told you in school the future is in your hands ellen slithered into the room and draped herself on the couch like a knobkneed cat she

may i go to my room sir you may allen walked up the stairs slowly when he had disappeared ellen whirled her legs like propellers she sat up and pulled down her skirt like a young lady ive been reading the speeches of henry clay speeches of henry clay american statesman and persuasive orator whose speeches were often more fervent than carefully documented he sure was good yes he was do you remember them not really i guess its been a long time since i read them hes great somehow it doesnt seem schoolgirl reading hes just great ethan got up from his chair with a whole long and weary day pushing him back in the kitchen he found mary redeyed and angry i heard you she said i dont know what you think youre doing hes just a little boy thats the time to start my darling dont darling me i wont

world he was building a false one who are you to know what the world is ethan walked past her and out the back door where are you going to cut the lawn i thought you were tired i ami was he looked over his shoulder and up at her standing inside the screened door a man is a lonely thing he said and he smiled at her a moment before he got out the lawnmower mary heard the whirring blades tearing through the soft and supple grass the sound stopped by the doorstep ethan called mary mary my darling i love you and the whirling blades raged on through the overgrown grass chapter twelve margie younghunt was an attractive woman informed clever so clever that she knew when and how to mask her cleverness her marriages had failed the men had failed one by being weak and the second weakerhe died dates did not come to her she created them mended her fences by frequent telephone calls by letters getwell cards and arranged accidental meetings she carried homemade soup to the sick and remembered birthdays by these means she kept people aware of her existence more than any woman in town she kept her stomach flat her skin clean and glowing her teeth bright and her chinline taut a goodly part of her income went to hair nails massage creams and unguents other women said she must be older than she looks when supporting muscles of her breasts no longer responded to creams massage and exercise she placed them in shapely forms that rode high and jauntily her makeup took increasing time her hair had all the sheen luster wave the television products promise on a date dining dancing laughing amusing drawing her escort with a net of small magnets who could know her cold sense of repetition after a decent interval and an outlay of money she usually went to bed with him if she discreetly could then back to her fencemending sooner or later the shared bed must be the trap to catch her future security and ease but the prospective game leaped clear of the quilted jaws more and more of her dates were the married the infirm or the cautious and margie knew better than anyone that her time was running out the tarot cards did not respond when she sought help for herself margie had known many men most of them guilty wounded in their vanity or despairing so that she had developed a contempt for her quarry as a professional hunter of vermin does it was easy to move such men through their fears and their vanities they ached so to be fooled that she no longer felt triumphonly a kind of disgusted pity these were her friends and associates she protected them even from the discovery that they were her friends she gave them the best of herself because they demanded nothing of her she kept them secret because at the bottom she did not admire herself danny taylor was one of these and alfio marullo another and chief stonewall jackson smith a third and there were others they trusted her and she them and their secret existence was the one warm honesty to which she could retire to restore herself these friends talked freely and without fear to her for to them she was a kind of andersens wellreceptive unjudging and silent as most people have secret vices margie younghunt concealed a secret virtue and because of this quiet thing it is probable that she knew more about new baytown and even wessex county than anyone and her knowledge was unwarped because she would notcould notuse it for her own profit but in other fields everything that came to her hand was usable her project ethan allen hawley began casually and out of idleness in a way he was correct in thinking it was mischievous a testing of her power many of the sad men who came to her for comfort and reassurance were hogtied with impotence bound and helpless in sexual traumas that infected all other areas of their lives and she found it easy by small flatteries and reassurances to set them free to fight again against their whiparmed wives she was genuinely fond of mary hawley and through her she gradually became aware of ethan bound in another kind of trauma a socialeconomic bind that had robbed him of strength and certainty having no work no love no children she wondered whether she could release and direct this crippled man toward some new end it was a game a kind of puzzle a test a product not of kindness but simply of curiosity and idleness this was a superior man to direct him would prove her superiority and this she needed increasingly probably she was the only one who knew the depth of the change in ethan and it frightened her because she thought it was her doing the mouse was growing a lions mane she saw the muscles under his clothes felt ruthlessness growing behind his eyes so must the gentle einstein have felt when his dreamed concept of the nature of matter flashed over hiroshima margie liked mary hawley very much and she had little sympathy and no pity for her misfortune is a fact of nature acceptable to women especially when it falls on other women in her tiny immaculate house set in a large overgrown garden very near to old harbor she leaned toward the makeup mirror to inspect her tools and her eyes saw through cream powder eyeshadowing and lashes sheathed in black saw the hidden wrinkles the inelasticity of skin she felt the years creep up like the rising tide about a rock in a calm sea there is an arsenal of maturity of middle age but these require training and technique she did not yet have she must learn them before her structure of youth and excitement crumbled and left her naked rotten ridiculous her success had been that she never let down even alone now as an experiment she allowed her mouth to droop as it wanted to her eyelids to fall halfstaff she lowered her highheld chin and a plaited rope came into being before her in the mirror she saw twenty years clamber over her and she shuddered as the icy whispering told her what lay waiting she had delayed too long a woman must have a showcase in which to grow old lights props black velvet children graying and fattening snickering and pilfering love protection and small change a serene and undemanding husband or his even more serene and less demanding will and trust fund a woman growing old alone is useless castoff trash a wrinkled obscenity with no hobbled retainers to cluck and mutter over her aches and to rub her pains a hot spot of fear formed in her stomach she had been lucky in her first husband he was weak and she soon found the valve of his weakness he was hopelessly in love with her so much so that when she needed a divorce he did not ask for a remarriage clause in his alimony settlement her second husband thought she had a private fortune and so she had he didnt leave her much when he died but with the alimony from her first husband she could live decently dress well and cast about at leisure suppose her first husband should die there was the fear spot there was the nightor daymarethe monthlycheckmare in january she had seen him at that great wide cross of madison avenue and fiftyseventh street he looked old and gaunt she was haunted with his mortality if the bastard died the money would stop she thought she might be the only person in the world who wholeheartedly prayed for his health his lean silent face and dead eyes came on her memory screen now and touched off the hot spot in her stomach if the son of a bitch should die margie leaning toward the mirror paused and hurled her will like a javelin her chin rose the ropes dropped back her eyes shone the skin snuggled close to her skull her shoulders squared she stood up and waltzed in a deft circle on the deeppiled red carpet her feet were bare with gleaming pinkened toenails she must rush she must hurry before it was too late she flung open her closet and laid hands on the sweet provocative dress she had been saving for the fourth of july weekend the shoes with pencil heels the stockings more sheer than no stockings at all there was no languor in her now she dressed as quickly and efficiently as a butcher whets his knife and she checked against a fulllength mirror the way that same butcher tests his blade against his thumb speed but no rush speed for the man who will not wait and thenthe casual slowness of the informed the smart the chic the confident the lady with pretty legs and immaculate white gloves no man she passed failed to look after her miller

his name when he wasnt present marullohes sicker than he was hes gray sick marullos eyes were those of a man shot in the stomach with a he had walked past the doorway of his own store without going in margie entered the store bouncing her neat buttocks ethan was talking to a stranger a youngish darkhaired man ivy league pants and hat with a narrow brim fortyish hard tough and devoted to whatever he was doing he leaned over the counter and seemed about to inspect ethans tonsils margie said hi youre busy ill come back later there are endless idle but legitimate things a strolling woman can do in a bank margie crossed the alley mouth and went into the marble and brushedsteel temple joey morphy lighted up the whole barred square of his tellers window when he saw her what a smile what a character what a good playmate and what a lousy prospect as a husband margie properly appraised him as a born bachelor who would die fighting to remain one no double grave for joey she said please sir do you have any fresh unsalted money excuse me maam ill see im almost positive i saw some somewhere how much of it would you like to have about six ounces msieur she took a folding book from her white kid bag and wrote a check for twenty dollars joey laughed he liked margie once in a while not too often he took her out to dinner and laid her but he also liked her company and her sense of play joey said mrs younghunt that reminds me of a friend i had who was in mexico with pancho villa pancho villa mexican revolutionary leader and folk hero who advocated agrarian reform remember him never knew him no jazz its a story the guy told me he said when pancho was in the north he worked the mint printing twentypeso notes made so many his men stopped counting them they werent so hot at counting anyway got to weighing them on a balance scale margie said joey you cant resist autobiography hell no mrs younghunt id have been about five years old its a story seems a fine stacked dame injun but stacked came in and said my general you have executed my husband and left me a poor widow with five children and is that any way to run a popular revolution pancho went over her assets the way im doing now you got no mortgage joey i know its a story pancho said to an aidedecamp weigh out five kilos of money for her well thats quite a bundle they tied it together with a piece of wire and the woman went out dangling the bale of kale then a lieutenant stepped out and saluted and he said my general they say it mi grallike hral we did not shoot her husband he was drunk we put him in the jail around the corner pancho had never taken his eyes off the dame walking away with the bundle he said go out and shoot him we cannot disappoint that poor widow joey youre impossible its a true story i believe it he turned her check around do you want this in twenties fifties or hundreds give it to me in twobitses they enjoyed each other mr baker looked out of his frostedglass office now there was a bet baker had made a grammatically correct but obscure pass at her once mr baker was mr money sure he had a wife but margie knew the bakers of this world they could always raise a moral reason for doing what they wanted to do anyway she was glad she had turned him down it left him still in the book she gathered the four fivedollar bills joey had given her and moved toward the gray banker but at that moment the man she had seen talking to ethan came in quietly passed in front of her presented a card and was taken into mr bakers office and the door closed well kiss my foot she said to joey prettiest foot in wessex county joey said want to go out tonight dance eat all that cant she said who is that never saw him before looks like a bankexaminer type its times like this im glad im honest and even gladder i can add and subtract you know joey youre going to make some faithful woman a hell of a fine fugitive that is my prayerful hope maam see you she went out crossed the alley and entered marullos grocery again hi eth hello margie who was the handsome stranger dont you carry your crystal ball secret agent worse than that margie is everybody afraid of cops even if i havent done anything im scared of cops was that curlyhaired piece of the true cross a dick not exactly said he was a federal man what you been up to ethan up to me why up to what did he want i only know what he

him when i came back he was here when i went broke he took over the store and gave me a job what do you suppose its about god knows margie had been trying to look past his eyes she thought hes pretending to be a simpleton i wonder what the guy really wanted he said it so quietly it frightened her you dont believe me you know margie no one ever believes the truth the whole truth when you

he slid the door of the cold cabinet open took out a coke which instantly grew a jacket of frost opened it and handed the bottle to her while he opened a second what is it you want of me ive never known a man like that perhaps i want to see what its like to be loved or hated that much youre a witch why dont you whistle up a wind i cant whistle i can raise a puny little storm in most men with my

college oxford and winchester college well thats changed now tailors make men in any image they want the trouble with a wellmade suit it lasts too long this is ten years old i cant believe it mr baker

said it its the motto of winchester college she turned to ethan you show me another american banker who knows that mr baker grew ruddy my wife subscribed to great books shes a great reader please call on her id love to put my things in a bag mr hawley ill pick them up on my way home right maam thats quite a remarkable young woman mr baker said she and mary hit it off ethan did that government man come here yes what does he want i dont know he asked some questions about mr marullo i didnt know the answers mr baker released the image of margie as slowly as an anemone opens and casts out the shell of a suckedclean crab ethan have you seen danny taylor no i havent do you know where he is no i dont i have to get in touch with him cant you think where he might be i havent seen him forwell since may he was going to try the cure again do you know where he didnt say but he wanted to try was it a public institution i dont think so sir he borrowed some money from me what i loaned him a little money how much i beg your pardon sorry ethan you are old friends sorry did he have other money i think so you dont know how much no sir i just had a feeling he had more if you know where he is please tell me i would if i knew mr baker maybe you could make a list of the places and phone did he borrow cash yes then thats no good hed change his name why they always do from good families ethan did you get the money from mary yes she didnt mind she didnt know now youre being smart i learned from you sir well dont forget it maybe im learning little by little mostly im learning how much i dont know well thats healthy is mary well oh shes strong and tough wish i could take her on a little vacation we havent been out of town in years that will come ethan i think ill go to maine over the fourth of july i cant take the noise any more i guess you bankers are the lucky ones werent you in albany lately what gave you that idea i dont knowheard it someplace maybe mrs baker told mary she couldnt she didnt know it try to think where you heard it maybe i only imagined it this troubles me ethan think hard where you heard it i cant sir what does it matter if it isnt true ill tell you in confidence why im worried its because it is true the governor called me in its a serious matter i wonder where the leak could be anyone see you there not that i know of i flew in and out this is serious im going to tell you something if it gets out ill know where it came from then i dont want to hear it you havent any choice now that you know about albany the state is looking into county and town affairs why i guess because the smell has got as far as albany no politics i guess anything the governor does can be called politics mr baker why cant it be in the open ill tell you why upstate the word got out and by the time the examiners got to work most of the records had disappeared i see i wish you hadnt told me im not a talker but i wish i didnt know for that matter i wish the same thing ethan the election is july seventh will it break before that i dont know thats up to the state do you suppose marullo is mixed in it i cant afford to lose my job i dont think so that was a federal man department of justice didnt you ask for his credentials didnt think of it he flashed them but i didnt look well you should you always should i wouldnt think youd want to go away oh that doesnt matter nothing happens over fourth of july weekend why the japs attacked pearl harbor on a weekend they knew everyone would be away i wish i could take mary someplace maybe you can later i want you to whip your brains and try to find where taylor is why is it so important it is i cant tell you why right now i sure wish i could find him then well if you could turn him up maybe you wouldnt need this job if its that way ill sure try sir thats the boy ethan im sure you will and if you do locate him you call meany time day or night chapter thirteen i wonder about people who say they havent time to think for myself i can double think i find that weighing vegetables passing the time of day with customers fighting or loving mary coping with the childrennone of these prevents a second and continuing layer of thinking wondering conjecturing surely this must be true of everyone maybe not having time to think is not having the wish to think in the strange uncharted country i had entered perhaps i had no choice questions boiled up demanding to be noticed and it was a world so new to me that i puzzled over matters old residents probably solved and put away when they were children i had thought i could put a process in motion and control it at every turneven stop it when i wanted to and now the frightening conviction grew in me that such a process may become a thing in itself a person almost having its own ends and means and quite independent of its creator and another troublesome thought came in did i really start it or did i simply not resist it i may have been the mover but was i not also the moved once on the long street there seemed to be no crossroads no forked paths no choice the choice was in the first evaluation what are morals are they simply words was it honorable to assess my fathers weakness which was a generous mind and the illfounded dream that other men were equally generous no it was simply good business to dig the pit for him he fell into it himself no one pushed him was it immoral to strip him when he was down apparently not now a slow deliberate encirclement was moving on new baytown and it was set in motion by honorable men if it succeeded they would be thought not crooked but clever and if a factor they had overlooked moved in would that be immoral or dishonorable i think that would depend on whether or not it was successful to most of the world success is never bad i remember how when hitler moved unchecked and triumphant many honorable men sought and found virtues in him and mussolini made the trains run on time and vichy collaborated for the good of france and whatever else stalin was he was strong strength and successthey are above morality above criticism it seems then that it is not what you do but how you do it and what you call it is there a check in men deep in them that stops or punishes there doesnt seem to be the only punishment is for failure in effect no crime is committed unless a criminal is caught in the move designed for new baytown some men had to get hurt some even destroyed but this in no way deterred the movement i could not call this a struggle with my conscience once i perceived the pattern and accepted it the path was clearly marked and the dangers apparent what amazed me most was that it seemed to plan itself one thing grew out of another and everything fitted together i watched it grow and only guided it with the lightest touch what i had done and planned to do was undertaken with full knowledge that it was foreign to me but necessary as a stirrup is to mount a tall horse but once i had mounted the stirrup would not be needed maybe i could not stop this process but i need never start another i did not need or want to be a citizen of this gray and dangerous country i had nothing to do with the coming tragedy of july it was not my process but i could anticipate and i could use it one of our oldest and most often disproved myths is that a mans thoughts show in his face that the eyes are the windows of the soul it isnt so only sickness shows or defeat or despair which are different kinds of sickness some rare people can feel beneath can sense a change or hear a secret signal i think my mary felt a change but she misinterpreted it and i think margie younghunt knewbut she was a witch and that is a worrisome thing it seemed to me that she was intelligent as well as magicand thats even more worrisome i felt sure that mr baker would go on a holiday probably on friday afternoon of the fourth of july weekend the storm would have to break friday or saturday to give it time to take effect before election and it was logical to suppose that mr baker would want to be away when the shock came of course that didnt matter much to me it was more an exercise in anticipation but it did make several moves necessary on thursday just in case he left that night my saturday matter was so finely practical that i could move through it in my sleep if i had any fear of that it was more like a small stage fright on monday june marullo came in soon after i had opened up he walked about looking strangely at the shelves the cash register the cold counter and he walked back to the storeroom and looked about you would have thought from his expression that he was seeing it for the first time i said going to take a trip over the fourth why do you say that well everybody does who can afford it oh where would i go wheres anybody go catskills even out to montauk and fish school tuna running the very thought of fighting a thirtypound plunging fish drove arthritic pains up his arms so that he flexed them and winced i very nearly asked him when he planned to go to italy but that seemed too much instead i moved over to him and took him gently by his right elbow alfio i said i think youre nuts why dont you go into new york to the best specialist there must be something to stop that pain i dont believe it what have you got to lose go ahead try it what do you care i dont but ive worked here a long time for a stupid son of a bitch dago if a yellow dog hurt that much id get to feeling it myself you come in here and move your arms and its half an hour before i can straighten up you like me hell no im buttering you up for a raise he looked at me with hounds eyes rimmed with red and dark brown iris and pupil all one piece he seemed about to say something but changed his mind about it youre a good kid he said dont depend on it a good kid he said explosively and as though shocked by his show of emotion he went out of the store and walked away i was weighing out two pounds of string beans for mrs davidson when marullo came charging back he stood in the doorway and shouted at me you take my pontiac what go someplace sunday and monday i cant afford it you take the kids i told the garage for you to get my pontiac tank full of gas wait a minute you go to hell take the kids he tossed something like a spitball at me and it fell among the string beans mrs davidson watched him plunge away again down the street i picked the green wad from the string beansthree twentydollar bills folded in a tight square whats the matter with him hes an excitable italian he must be throwing money he didnt show up the rest of the week so that was all right hed never gone away before without telling me it was like watching a parade go by just standing and watching it go by and knowing what the next float would be but watching for it just the same i hadnt expected the pontiac he never loaned his car to anybody it was a strange time some outside force or design seemed to have taken control of events so that they were crowded close the way cattle are in a loading chute i know the opposite can be true sometimes the force or design deflects and destroys no matter how careful and deep the planning i guess thats why we believe in luck and unluck on thursday the thirtieth of june i awakened as usual in the black pearl light of the dawn and that was early now in the lap of midsummer chair and bureau were dark blobs and pictures only lighter suggestions the white window curtains seemed to sigh in and out as though they breathed because its a rare dawn that does not wave a small wind over the land coming out of sleep i had the advantage of two worlds the layered firmament of dream and the temporal fixtures of the mind awake i stretched luxuriouslya good and tingling sensation its as though the skin has shrunk in the night and one must push it out to daytime size by bulging the muscles and theres an itching pleasure in it first i referred to my remembered dreams as i would glance through a newspaper to see if there was anything of interest or import then i explored the coming day for events that had not happened next i followed a practice learned from the best officer i ever had he was charley edwards a major of middling age perhaps a little too far along to be a combat officer but he was a good one he had a large family a pretty wife and four children in steps and his heart could ache with love and longing for them if he allowed it to he told me about it in his deadly business he could not afford to have his attention warped and split by love and so he had arrived at a method in the morning that is if he were not jerked from sleep by an alert he opened his mind and heart to his family he went over each one in turn how they looked what they were like he caressed them and reassured them of his love it was as though he picked precious things one by one from a cabinet looked at each felt it kissed it and put it back and last he gave them a small goodby and shut the door of the cabinet the whole thing took half an hour if he could get it and then he didnt have to think of them again all day he could devote his full capacity untwisted by conflicting thought and feeling to the job he had to dothe killing of men he was the best officer i ever knew i asked his permission to use his method and he gave it to me when he was killed all i could think was that his had been a good and effective life he had taken his pleasure savored his love and paid his debts and how many people even approached that i didnt always use major charleys method but on a day like this thursday when i knew my attention should be as uninterrupted as possible i awakened when the day opened its door a crack and i visited my family as major charley had i visited them in chronological order bowed to aunt deborah she was named for deborah the judge of israel deborah the judge of israel judges deborah a prophetess the only woman judge mentioned in the bible with her guidance and aid the israelite general barak conquered sisera captain of the canaanite army and delivered israel from canaanite rule and i have read that a judge was a military leader perhaps she responded to her name my greataunt could have led armies she did marshal the cohorts of thought my joy in learning for no visible profit came from her stern though she was she was charged with curiosity and had little use for anyone who was not i gave her my obeisance i offered a spectral toast to old capn and ducked my head to my father i even made my duty to the untenanted hole in the past i knew as my mother i never knew her she died before i could and left only a hole in the past where she should be one thing troubled me aunt deborah and old capn and my father would not come clear their outlines were vague and wavery where they should have been sharp as photographs well perhaps the mind fades in its memories as old tintypes dothe background reaching out to engulf the subjects i couldnt hold them forever mary should have been next but i laid her aside for later i raised allen i could not find his early face the face of joy and excitement that made me sure of the perfectability of man he appeared what he had becomesullen conceited resentful remote and secret in the pain and perplexity of his pubescence a dreadful harrowing time when he must bite everyone near even himself like a dog in a trap even in my minds picture he could not come out of his miserable discontent and i put him aside only saying to him i know i remember how bad it is and i cant help no one can i can only tell you it will be over but you cant believe that go in peacego with my love even though during this time we cant stand each other ellen brought a surge of pleasure she will be pretty prettier even than her mother because when her little face jells into its final shape she will have the strange authority of aunt deborah her moods her cruelties her nervousness are the ingredients of a being quite beautiful and dear i know because i saw her standing in her sleep holding the pink talisman to her little breast and looking a woman fulfilled and as the talisman was important and still is to me so it is to ellen maybe it is ellen who will carry and pass on whatever is immortal in me and in my greeting i put my arms around her and she true to form tickled my ear and giggled my ellen my daughter i turned my head to mary sleeping and smiling on my right that is her place so that when it is good and right and ready she can shelter her head on my right arm leaving my left hand free for caressing a few days before i snicked my forefinger with the curved banana knife at the store and a callusy scab toughened the ball of my fingertip and so i stroked the lovely line from ear to shoulder with my second finger but gently enough not to startle and firmly enough not to tickle she sighed as she always does a deep gathered breath and a low release of luxury some people resent awakening but not mary she comes to a day with expectancy that it will be good and knowing this i try to offer some small gift to justify her conviction and i try to hold back gifts for occasions such as the one i now produced from my minds purse her eyes opened hazed with sleep already she asked and she glanced at the window to see how near the day had come over the bureau the picture hangstrees and a lake and a small cow standing in the water of the lake i made out the cows tail from my bed and knew the day had come i bring you tidings of great joy my flying squirrel crazy have i ever lied to you maybe are you awake enough to hear the tidings of great joy no then i will withhold them she turned on her left shoulder and made a deep crease in her soft flesh you joke so much if its like youre going to cement over the lawn i am not or youre starting a cricket farm no but you do remember old discarded plans is it a joke well its a thing so strange and magic that you are going to have to buttress your belief her eyes were clear and wakeful now and i could see the little trembles around her lips preparing for laughter tell me do you know a man of eyetalian extraction named marullo crazyyoure being silly you will find it so said marullo has gone from here for a time where he didnt say when will he be back stop confusing me he didnt say that either what he did say and when i protested what he ordered was that we should take his car and go on a happy trip over the holiday youre joking me would i tell a lie that would make you sad but why that i cant tell you what i can swear to from boy scout oath to papal oath is that the minklined pontiac with a tank full of virgin gasoline awaits your highnesss pleasure but where shall we go that my lovely insectwife is what you are going to decide and take all day today tomorrow and saturday to plan it but mondays a holiday thats two full days thats correct can we afford it it might mean a motel or something can or not we will i have a secret purse silly i know your purse i cant imagine him lending his car neither can i but he did dont forget he brought candy easter perhaps it is senility i wonder what he wants thats not worthy of my wife perhaps he wants us to love him ill have to do a thousand things i know you will i could see her mind plowing into the possibilities like a bulldozer i knew i had lost her attention and probably couldnt get it back and that was good at breakfast before my second cup of coffee she had picked up and discarded half the pleasure areas of eastern america poor darling hadnt had much fun these last few years i said chloe i know im going to have trouble getting your attention a very important investment is offered i want some more of your money the first is doing well does mr baker know about it its his idea then take it you sign a check dont you want to know how much i guess so dont you want to know what the investment is the figures the flotage the graphs the probable return the fiscal dinkum and all that i wouldnt understand it oh yes you would well i wouldnt want to understand it no wonder they call you the vixen of wall street that icecold diamondsharp business mindits frightening were going on a trip she said were going on a trip for two days and how the hell could a man not love her not adore her who is marywhat is she i sang and collected the empty milk bottles and went to work i felt the need to catch up with joey just to get the feel of him but i must have been a moment late or he a moment early he was entering the coffee shop when i turned into the high street i followed him in and took the stool beside him you got me into this habit joey hi mr hawley its pretty good coffee i greeted my old school girl friend morning annie you going to be a regular eth looks like one cuppa and black black it is black as the eye of despair what black you see any white in that eth ill give you another how are things morph just the same only worse want to trade jobs i would just before a long weekend youre not the only one with problems people stock up on food too i guess they do i hadnt thought of that picnic stuff pickles sausages and god help us marshmallows this a big one for you with the fourth on monday and nice weather you kidding and what makes it worse god almighty feels the need of rest and recreation in the mountains mr baker not james g blaine james g blaine prominent american politician who served as congressman senator and secretary of state famous for maneuvering behind the scenes in his later life he wrote twenty years of congress i want to see him i need to see him well try to catch him if you can hes jumping like a quarter in a tambourine i can bring sandwiches to your battle station joey i might just ask you to i pay this time i said okay we crossed the street together and went into the alley you sound lowy joey i am i get pretty tired of other peoples money i got a hot date for the weekend and ill probably be too pooped to warm up to it he nudged a gum wrapper into the lock went in saying see you and closed the door i pushed the back door open joey you want a sandwich today no thanks he called out of the dim flooroilsmelling interior maybe friday saturday sure dont you close at noon i told you the bank closes but morphy dont just call on me thanksthanks mr hawley i had nothing to say to my forces on the shelves that morning except good morning gentlemenat ease at a few moments before nine aproned and broomed i was out front sweeping the sidewalk mr baker is so regular you can hear him tick and im sure theres a hairspring in his chest eight fiftysix fiftyseven there he came down elm street eight fiftyeight he crossed eight fiftyninehe was at the glass doors where i with broom at carry arms intercepted him mr baker i want to talk to you morning ethan can you wait a minute come on in i followed him and it was just as joey saidlike a religious ceremony they practically stood at attention as the clock hand crossed nine there came a click and buzzing from the great steel safe door then joey dialed the mystic numbers and turned the wheel that drew the bolts the holy of holies swung stately open and mr baker took the salute of the assembled money i stood outside the rail like a humble communicant waiting for the sacrament mr baker turned now ethan what can i do for you i said softly i want to talk to you privately and i cant leave the store wont it wait fraid not you ought to have some help i know it if i get a moment ill drop over any word about taylor not yet but ive put out some lines ill try to get over thank you sir but i knew he would come and he did in less than an hour and stood about until the present customers were gone nowwhat is it ethan mr baker with a doctor or a lawyer or a priest theres a rule of secrecy is there such a thing with a banker he smiled have you ever heard a banker discuss a clients interests ethan no well ask sometime and see how far you get and besides that custom im your friend ethan i know i guess im a little jumpy its been a long time since ive had a break a break ill lay them out face up mr baker marullos in trouble he moved close to me what kind of trouble i dont know exactly sir i think it might be illegal entry how do you know he told menot in so many words you know how he is i could almost see his mind leaping about picking up pieces and fitting them together go on he said thats deportation im afraid so hes been good to me mr baker i wouldnt do anything to hurt him you owe yourself something ethan what was his proposition its not merely a proposition i had to put it together out of a lot of excited gobbledegook but i gathered that if i had a quick five thousand in cash i could own the store that sounds as if hes going to run for itbut you dont know that i dont know anything really so theres no chance of a collusion charge he didnt tell you anything specific no sir then how did you arrive at that figure easy sir thats all weve got but you might get it for less maybe his quick eye went over the store and valued it if you are right in your assumption youre in a good bargaining position im not much good at that you know i dont favor underthetable deals maybe i could talk to him hes out of town when will he be back i dont know sir remember its only my impression he might drop in and if i had cash he might deal he likes me you know i know he does id hate to think i was taking advantage he can always get it from someone else he could get ten thousand easy fromanybody then maybe im overhopeful now dont think small you have to look after number one number two its marys money so it is well what did you have in mind well i thought you could maybe draw some papers up and leave the date and the amount blank then i thought id draw the money friday why friday well again its only a guess but he did say something about how everybodys away over the holiday i kind of figured he might show up then dont you have his account no by god he drew it out just recently buying stocks he said i didnt think anything of it because hes done that before and always brought back more than he took out he looked full in the eyes of a highcolored miss rheingold highcolored miss rheingold rheingold beer popular in new york held the venerable miss rheingold contest each year starting in with beer drinkers voting for their favorite of several young women in total votes for miss rheingold exceeded million on the cold counter but he didnt respond to her laughing invitation you know you could take a terrible beating on this how do you mean for one thing he could sell it to half a dozen different people and for another it might be neckdeep in mortgage and no title search i could maybe find out in the county clerks office i know how busy you are mr baker im taking advantage of your friendship for my family besides youre the only friend i have who knows about such things ill call tom watson about the title deed damn it ethan its a bad time i want to take a little trip tomorrow night if its true and hes a crook you could be taken taken to the cleaners maybe i better give it up then but good god mr baker im tired of being a grocery clerk i didnt say give it up i said youre taking a chance mary would be so happy if i owned the store but i guess youre right i shouldnt gamble with her money i suppose what i should do is call up the federal men that would lose you any advantage you have how if he is deported he can sell his holdings through an agent and this store will bring a lot more than you can pay you dont know hes going to jump how could you tell them he is if you dont know you dont even know hes picked up thats true as a matter of fact you dont know anything about himreally know all youve told me is vague suspicions isnt that so yes and youd better forget those wouldnt it look badpaying in cash with no record you could write on the checkoh something like for investment in grocery business with a marullo that would be a record of your intention suppose none of this works then redeposit the money you think its worth the risk welleverythings a risk ethan its a risk to carry that much money around ill take care of that i wish i didnt have to be out of town what i said about timing still held in all that time nobody came into the store but half a dozen came in nowthree women an old man and two kids mr baker moved close and spoke softly ill make it in hundreddollar bills and note the numbers then if they catch him you can get it back he nodded gravely to the three women said good morning george to the old man and roughed his fingers through the kids coarse hair mr baker is a very clever man chapter fourteen july first it parts the year like the part in a head of hair i had foreseen it as a boundary marker for meyesterday one kind of me tomorrow a different kind i had made my moves that could not be recalled time and incidents had played along had seemed to collaborate with me i did not ever draw virtue down to hide what i was doing from myself no one made me take the course i had chosen temporarily i traded a habit of conduct and attitude for comfort and dignity and a cushion of security it would be too easy to agree that i did it for my family because i knew that in their comfort and security i would find my dignity but my objective was limited and once achieved i could take back my habit of conduct i knew i could war did not make a killer of me although for a time i killed men sending out patrols knowing some of the men would die aroused no joy in sacrifice in me as it did in some and i could never joy in what i had done nor excuse or condone it the main thing was to know the limited objective for what it was and once it was achieved to stop the process in its tracks but that could only be if i knew what i was doing and did not fool myselfsecurity and dignity and then stop the process in its tracks i knew from combat that casualties are the victims of a process not of anger nor of hate or cruelty and i believe that in the moment of acceptance between winner and loser between killer and killed there is love but dannys scribbled papers hurt like a sorrow and marullos grateful eyes i had not lain awake as men are said to do on the eve of battle sleep came quickly heavily completely and released me just as freely in the predawn refreshed i did not lie in the darkness as usual my urge was to visit my life as it had been i slipped quietly from bed dressed in the bathroom and went down the stairs walking near to the wall it did surprise me when i went to the cabinet unlocked it and recognized the rosy mound by touch i put it in my pocket and closed and locked the cabinet in my whole life i had never carried it away and i had not known i would do it this morning memory directed me through the dark kitchen and out the back door into the graying yard the arching elms were fat with leaves a true black cave if i had then had marullos pontiac i would have driven out of new baytown to the awakening world of my first memory my finger traced the endless sinuous design on the fleshwarm talisman in my pockettalisman that deborah who sent me as a child to golgotha golgotha hill on which jesus was crucified was a precise machine with words she took no nonsense from them nor permitted me a laxity what power she had that old woman if she wanted immortality she had it in my brain seeing me trace the puzzle with my finger she said ethan that outlandish thing could well become your talisman whats a talisman if i tell you your halfattention will only half learn look it up so many words are mine because aunt deborah first aroused my curiosity and then forced me to satisfy it by my own effort of course i replied who cares but she knew i would creep to it alone and she spelled it so i could track it down talisman she cared deeply about words and she hated their misuse as she would hate the clumsy handling of any fine thing now so many cycles later i can see the pagecan see myself misspelling talisman the arabic was only a squiggly line with a bulb on the end of it the greek i could pronounce because of the blade of that old woman a stone or other object engraved with figures or characters to which are attributed the occult powers of the planetary influences and celestial configurations under which it was made usually worn as an amulet to avert evil from or bring fortune to the bearer i had then to look for occult planetary celestial and amulet it was always that way one word set off others like a string of firecrackers when later i asked her do you believe in talismans she replied what has my belief to do with it i put it in her hands what does this figure or character mean its your talisman not mine it means what you want it to mean put it back in the cabinet it will wait for you now as i walked in the cavern of the elms she was as alive as ever she had been and thats true immortality over and under itself the carving went and around and over and under a serpent with neither head nor tail nor beginning nor ending and i had taken it away with me for the first timeto avert evil to bring fortune i dont believe in fortunetelling either and immortality has always felt to me like a sickly promise for the disappointed the lightrimmed boundary of the east was july for june had gone away in the night july is brass where june is gold and lead where june is silver july leaves are heavy and fat and crowding birdsong of july is a flatulent refrain without passion for the nests are empty now and dumpy fledglings teeter clumsily no july is not a month of promise or of fulfillment fruit is growing but unsweet and uncolored corn is a limp green bundle with a young and yellow tassel the squashes still wear umbilical crowns of dry blossom i walked to porlock street porlock the plump and satisfied the gathering brass of dawn showed rosebushes heavy with middleaged blooms like women whose corseting no longer conceals a thickening stomach no matter how pretty their legs may remain walking slowly i found myself not saying but feeling goodbynot farewell farewell has a sweet sound of reluctance goodby is short and final a word with teeth sharp to bite through the string that ties past to the future i came to the old harbor goodby to what i dont know i couldnt remember i think i wanted to go to the place but man commensal with the sea would know that the tide was at flood and the place under dark water last night i saw the moon only four days grown like a thickened curved surgeons needle but strong enough to pull the tide into the cave mouth of the place no need to visit dannys shack in hope the light had come enough to see the grasses standing upright in the path where dannys feet had stumbled them flat old harbor was flecked with summer craft slim hulls with sails covered in grommeted coats of canvas and here and there a morning man made ready clearing boom and coiling jib and mainsheets unbagging his genoa like a great white rumpled nest the new harbor was busier charter boats tied close for boarding passengers the frantic summer fishermen who pay a price and glut the decks with fish and in the afternoon wonder vaguely what to do with them sacks and baskets and mountains of porgies and blows and blackfish sea robins and even slender dogfish all to be torn up greedily to die and to be thrown back for the waiting gulls the gulls swarm and wait knowing the summer fishermen will sicken of their plenty who wants to clean and scale a sack of fish its harder to give away fish than it is to catch them the bay was oilsmooth now and the brass light poured over it the cans and nuns stood unswaying on the channel edge each one with its mirror twin upside down below it in the water i turned at the flagpole and war memorial and found my name among the surviving heroes the letters picked out in silvercapt e a hawleyand below in gold the names of the eighteen new baytown men who didnt make it home i knew the names of most of them and once i knew the menno different then from the rest but different now in gold for a brief moment i wished i could be with them in the lower files capt e a hawley in gold the slobs and malingerers the cowards and the heroes all lumped together in gold not only the brave get killed but the brave have a better chance at it fat willie drove up and parked beside the monument and took the flag from the seat beside him hi eth he said he shackled the brass grommets and raised the flag slowly to the top of the staff where it slumped limp as a hanged man she barely made it willie said pantinga little look at her two more days for her and then the new one goes up the fiftystar the fiftystar with the admission of hawaii as the fiftieth state in the fiftystar flag became the official us flag on july you bet we got a nylon big devil twice as big as this and dont weigh no more than half hows tricks willie i cant complainbut i do this glorious fourth is always a mess coming on a monday therell be just that much more accidents and fights and drunksoutoftown drunks want a lift up to the store thanks ive got to stop at the post office and i thought id get a cup of coffee okay ill ride you id even coffee you but stoneys mean as a bull bitch whats his problem god knows went away a couple of days and he come back mean and tough whered he go he didnt say but he come back mean ill wait while you get your mail dont bother willie ive got to address some things suit yourself he backed out and slid away up the high street the post office was still dusky and the floor newly oiled and a sign up danger slick floor wed had number drawer since the old post office was built i dialed g r and took out a pile of plans and promises addressed to boxholder and thats all there waswastebasket fodder i strolled up the high intending to have a cup of coffee but at the last moment i didnt want it or didnt want to talk ori dont know why i just didnt want to go to the foremaster coffee shop good god what a mess of draggletail impulses a man isand a woman too i guess i was sweeping the sidewalk when mr baker ticked out of elm street and went in for the ceremony of the time lock and i was halfheartedly arranging muskmelons in the doorway stands when the oldfashioned green armored car pulled up in front of the bank two guards armed like commandos got out of the back and carried gray sacks of money into the bank in about ten minutes they came out and got into the riveted fortress and it drove away i guess they had to stand by while morph counted it and mr baker checked and gave a receipt its an awful lot of trouble taking care of money as morph says you could get a downright distaste for other peoples money and by the size and weight the bank must have anticipated a large holiday withdrawal if i was a runofthemill bank robber now would be the time to stick it up but i wasnt a runofthemill bank robber i owed everything i knew to pal joey he could have been a great one if he had wished i did wonder why he didnt want to just to try out his theory business piled up that morning it was worse than i had thought it might be the sun turned hot and fierce and very little wind moved the kind of weather that drives people on their vacations whether they want to go or not i had a line of customers waiting to be served one thing i knew come hell or high water i had to get some help if allen didnt work out id fire him and get someone else when mr baker came in about eleven he was in a hurry i had to stand off some customers and go into the storeroom with him he put a big envelope and a small one in my hands and he was so rushed that he barked a kind of shorthand tom watson says the deeds okay he doesnt know whether its papered he doesnt think so here are conveyances get signatures where ive checked the moneys marked and the numbers noted heres a check all made out just sign it sorry i have to rush ethan i hate doing business like this you really think i should go ahead goddammit ethan after all the trouble ive gone to sorry sir sorry i know youre right i put the check on a cannedmilk carton and signed it with my indelible pencil mr baker wasnt too rushed to inspect the check offer two thousand at first and raise your offer two hundred at a time you realize of course youve only got a fivehundred balance in the bank god help you if you run short if its clear cant i borrow on the store sure you can if you want interest to eat you up i dont know how to thank you dont go soft ethan dont let him poormouth you he can be a spellbinder all dagos can just remember number one i am sure grateful got to go he said want to hit the highway before the noon traffic and out he went and nearly knocked mrs willow down in the doorway where she had been over every cantaloupe twice the day didnt get any less frantic i guess the heat that splashed the streets made people edgy and downright quarrelsome instead of a holiday youd have thought they were stocking up for a catastrophe i couldnt have got a sandwich over to the morph if id wanted to i not only had to wait on people i had to keep my eyes open a lot of the customers were summer people strangers in town and they steal if you dont watch them they cant seem to help it and its not always stuff they need either the little jars of luxuries take the worst beating foie gras and caviar and button mushrooms thats why marullo had me keep such stuff back of the counter where the customers arent supposed to go he taught me its not good business to catch a shoplifter makes everyone restless maybe becausewell in his thoughts anywayeveryone is guilty about the only way is to charge the loss off to somebody else but if i saw someone drifting too close to certain shelves i could forestall the impulse by saying those cocktail onions are a bargain ive seen the customer jump as though id read his mind what i hate worst about it is the suspicion its unpleasant to be suspicious makes me angry as though one person were injuring many the day wore on to a kind of sadness and time slowed down after five chief stoney came in lean and grim and ulcerish he bought a tv dinnercountry steak carrots mashed potatoes cooked and frozen in a kind of aluminum tray i said you look like you had a touch of sun chief well i aint i feel fine he looked miserable want two of those just one my wifes gone visiting a cop dont get holidays too bad maybe its just as well with this mob hanging around i dont get home much i heard you were away who told you willie he better learn to keep his big mouth shut he didnt mean harm hasnt got brains enough to mean harm maybe not brains enough to stay out of jail who has i said it on purpose and i got even more response than i had anticipated just what do you mean by that ethan i mean weve got so many laws you cant breathe without breaking something thats the truth gets so you dont really know i was going to ask you chiefcleaning up i found an old revolver all dirty and rusty marullo says its not his and it sure isnt mine what do i do with it turn it over to me if you dont want to apply for a license ill bring it down from home tomorrow i stuck it in a can of oil what do you do with things like that stoney oh check to see if theyre hot and then throw them in the ocean he seemed to be feeling better but it had been a long hot day i couldnt let him be remember a couple of years ago there was a case somewhere upstate police were selling confiscated guns stoney smiled the sweet smile of an alligator and with the same gay innocence i had one hell of a week eth one hell of a week if youre going about needling me why dont do it because ive had one hell of a week sorry chief anything a sober citizen can do to help like getting drunk with you i wish to christ i could id rather get drunk than anything i can think of why dont you do you know no how could you if i only knew what its for and where its from what you talking about forget it eth nodont forget it youre a friend of mr baker has he got any deals on im not that good a friend chief how about marullo where is marullo went in to new york he wants to get his arthritis checked over god almighty i dont know i just dont know if there was just a line why id know where to jump youre not talking sense stoney no im not i talked too much already im not too bright but if you want to unload i dont no i dont theyre not going to pin a leak on me even if i knew who they were forget it eth im just a worried man you couldnt leak to me stoney what was itgrand jury then you do know a little whats behind it progress stoney came close to me and his iron hand grasped my upper arm so tightly that it hurt ethan he said fiercely do you think im a good cop the best i aim to be i want to be ethdo you think its right to make a man tell on his friends to save himself no i dont neither do i i cant admire such a government what scares me eth isi wont be such a good cop any more because i wont admire what im doing did they catch you out chief its like you said so many laws you cant take a deep breath without you break one but jesus christ the guys were my friends you wont leak ethan no i wont you forgot your tv dinner chief yeah he said ill go home and take off my shoes and watch how those television cops do it you know sometimes an empty house is a nice rest see you eth i liked stoney i guess he is a good officer i wonder where the line falls i was closing up shop drawing in the fruit bins from the doorway when joey morphy sauntered in quick i said and i closed the double front doors and drew the dark green shades speak in a whisper whats got into you someone might want to buy something yeah i know what you mean god i hate long holidays brings out the worst in everybody they start out mad and come home pooped and broke want a cold drink while i draw the coverlets over my darlings i dont mind got some cold beer to take out only ill take it out just open the can i punched two triangular holes in the tin and he upended it opened his throat and drained it into him ah he said and set the can on the counter were going on a trip you poor devil where i dont know we havent fought over that yet somethings going on do you know what it is give me a clue i cant i just feel it hair on the back of my neck kind of itches thats a sure sign everybodys a little out of synch maybe you just imagine it maybe but mr baker doesnt take holidays he was in one hell of a hurry to get out of town i laughed have you checked the books know something i did youre kidding once i knew a postmaster little town had a punk kid working there name of ralphpale hair glasses little tiny chin adenoids big as goiters ralph got tagged for stealing stampslots of stamps like maybe eighteen hundred dollars worth couldnt do a thing he was a punk you mean he didnt take them if he didnt it was just the same as if he did im jumpy im never going to get tagged if i can help it is that why you never married come to think of it by god thats one of the reasons i folded my apron and put it in the drawer under the cash register takes too much time and effort to be suspicious joey i couldnt take the time have to in a bank you only lose once all it needs is a whisper dont tell me youre suspicious its an instinct if anythings just a little bit out of norm my alarm goes off what a way to live you dont really mean that i guess i dont i just thought if youd heard something youd tell methat is if it was any of my business i think id tell anybody anything i know maybe thats why nobody ever tells me anything going home no i think ill go eat across the street i switched the front lights off mind coming out through the alley look ill make sandwiches in the morning before the rush one ham one cheese on rye bread lettuce and mayonnaise right and a quart of milk you ought to work in a bank he said i guess he wasnt any lonelier than anybody else just because he lived alone he left me at the door of the foremaster and for a moment i wished i could go with him i thought home might be a mess and it was mary had planned the trip out near montauk point theres a dude ranch montauk point dude ranch deep hollow ranch in montauk eastern long island with all the fancy fixings you see in what they call adult westerns the joke is that its the oldest working cattle ranch in america it was a cattle ranch before texas was discovered first charter came from charles ii originally the herds that supplied new york grazed there and the herdsmen were drawn by lot like jurors for limited service of course now its all silver spurs and cowboy stuff but the red cattle still graze on the moors mary thought it would be nice to spend sunday night in one of the guest houses ellen wanted to go into new york stay at a hotel and spend two days in times square allen didnt want to go at all any place thats one of his ways of getting attention and proving that he exists the house boiled with emotionellen in slow dripping juicy tears mary tired and flushed with frustration allen sitting sullen and withdrawn with his little radio blasting in his ear a thumping whining song of love and loss in a voice of subhysteria you promised to be true and then you took and threw my lovin lonely heart right on the floor im about ready to give up mary said theyre just trying to help they seem to go out of their way to be difficult i never get to do anything ellen sniffled in the living room allen turned up the volume my lovin lonely heart right on the floor couldnt we lock them in the cellar and go off by ourselves carotene dear you know at this point i wish we could she had to raise her voice to be heard over the pounding roar of the lovin lonely heart without warning a rage came up in me i turned and strode toward the living room to tear my son to shreds and throw his lonely lovin corpse on the floor and trample it as i went loping through the door the music stopped we interrupt this program to bring you a special bulletin officials of new baytown and wessex county were this afternoon subpoenaed to appear before a grand jury to answer charges ranging from fixing traffic tickets to taking bribes and kickbacks on town and county contracts there it camethe town manager the council the magistrates the works i listened without hearingsad and heavy maybe they had been doing what they were charged with but theyd been doing it so long they didnt think it was wrong and even if they were innocent they couldnt be cleared before the local election and even if a man is cleared the charge is remembered they were surrounded they must have known it i listened for a mention of stoney and it didnt come so i guess he had traded them for immunity no wonder he felt so raw and alone mary was listening at the door well she said we havent had so much excitement in a long time do you think its true ethan doesnt matter i said thats not what its for i wonder what mr baker thinks he went on a holiday yes i wonder what he feels allen grew restive because his music was interrupted the news and dinner and dishes put off our trip problems until it was too late for a decision or for further tears and quarreling in bed i got to shivering all over the cold passionless savagery of the attack chilled right through the warm summer night mary said youre all goose lumps dear do you think you have a virus no my fancy i guess i was just feeling what those men must feel they must feel awful stop it ethan you cant take other peoples troubles on your shoulders i can because i do i wonder if youll ever be a businessman youre too sensitive ethan its not your crime i was thinking maybe it iseverybodys crime i dont understand i dont much either sweetheart if there was only someone who could stay with them repeat please columbine how i would love to take a holiday just with you its been forever were short on unattached elderly female relatives put your mind to it if only we could can them or salt or pickle them for a little while mary madonna put your mind to it i ache to be alone with you in a strange place we could walk the dunes and swim naked at night and i would tousle you in a fern bed darling i know darling i know its been hard on you dont think i dont know well hold me close lets think of some way youre still shivering do you feel cold cold and hot full and emptyand tired ill try to think of something i really will of course i love them but i know and i could wear my bow tie will they put them in jail i wish we could those men no it wont be necessary they cant even appear before next tuesday and thursday is election thats what its for ethan thats cynical you arent like that well have to go away if youre getting cynical becausethat wasnt a joke the way you said it i know your jokes you meant that a fear struck me i was showing through i couldnt let myself show through oh say miss mousie will you marry me and mary said oho oho my sudden fear that i might be showing through was very great i had made myself believe that the eyes are not the mirror of the soul some of the deadliest little female contraptions i ever saw had the faces and the eyes of angels there is a breed that can read through skin and through bone right into the center but they are rare for the most part people are not curious except about themselves once a canadian girl of scottish blood told me a story that had bitten her and the telling bit me she said that in the age of growing up when she felt that all eyes were on her and not favorably so that she went from blushes to tears and back again her highland grandfather observing her pain said sharply ye wouldna be sae worrit ye wouldna be sae worrit my dear you wouldnt worry so much about what people think if you realized how little they care according to jackson benson steinbeck heard this line on a train trip from sag harbor to new york city wi what folk think about ye if ye kenned how seldom they do it cured her and the telling reassured me of privacy because its true but mary who ordinarily lives in a house of flowers of her own growing had heard a tone or felt a cutting wind this was a danger until tomorrow should be over if my plan had leaped up fullgrown and deadly i would have rejected it as nonsense people dont do such things but people play secret games mine began with joeys rules for robbing a bank against the boredom of my job i played with it and everything along the way fell into itallen and his mouse mask leaking toilet rusty pistol holiday coming up joey wadding paper in the lock of the alley door as a game i timed the process enacted it tested it but gunmen shooting it out with copsarent they the little boys who practiced quick draws with cap pistols until they got so good they had to use the skill i dont know when my game stopped being a game perhaps when i knew i might buy the store and would need money to run it for one thing it is hard to throw away a perfect structure without testing it and as for the dishonesty the crimeit was not a crime against men only against money no one would get hurt money is insured the real crimes were against men against danny and against marullo if i could do what i had done theft was nothing and all of it was temporary none of it would ever have to be repeated actually before i knew it was not a game my procedure and equipment and timing were as near perfection as possible the cappistol boy found a in his hand of course an accident was possible but that is so in crossing the street or walking under a tree i dont think i had any fear i had rehearsed that out of me but i did have a breathlessness like the stage fright of an actor standing in the wings on his opening night and it was like a play in that every conceivable mischance had been inspected and eliminated in my worry that i would not sleep i slept deeply and as far as i know without dreams and overslept i had planned to use the dark preday for the calming medicine of contemplation instead when my eyes jerked open the tail of the cow in the lake had been visible at least half an hour i awakened with a jar like the blow of driven air from high explosive sometimes such an awakening sprains muscles mine shook the bed so that mary awakened saying whats the matter ive overslept nonsense its early no my ablative absolute this is a monster day for me the world will be groceryhappy today dont you get up youll need a good breakfast know what ill do ill get a carton of coffee at the foremaster and ill raven marullos shelves like a wolf you will rest little mouse of a mouseness and try to find a way for us to escape from our darling children we need that i mean it i know we do ill try to think i was dressed and gone before she could suggest any of the seasonal things for my protection and comfort joey was in the coffee shop and he patted the stool beside him cant morph im late annie could you give me a quart of coffee in a carton itll have to be two pints eth good even gooder she filled and covered the little paper buckets and put them in a bag joey finished and walked across with me youll have to say mass without the bishop this morning guess so say how about that news i cant take it in you remember i said i smelled something i thought about that when i heard it youve got quite a nose its part of the trade baker can come back now wonder if he will come back you get no smell there i looked at him helplessly im missing something and i dont even know what it is jesus god you mean i should see something thats what i mean the law of the fang is not repealed oh lord there must be a whole world i miss i was trying to remember whether its both lettuce and mayonnaise you like both he stripped the cellophane cover from his pack of camels and wadded it to push in the lock got to go i said weve got a special sale on tea send in a box top you get a baby know any ladies i sure do and thats about the last prize they want dont bother to bring them ill come for the sandwiches he went in his door and there was no click of the spring lock i did hope that joey never discovered that he was the best teacher i had ever had he not only informed he demonstrated and without knowing it prepared a way for me everyone who knew about such things the experts agreed that only money gets money the best way is always the simplest the shocking simplicity of the thing was its greatest strength but i really believe it was only a detailed daydream until marullo through none of his fault walked in his own darkness over a cliff once it seemed almost certain that i could get the store for my own only then did the highflown dreaming come down to earth a good but illinformed question might be if i could get the store why did i need money mr baker would understand so would joeyso for that matter would marullo the store without running capital was worse than no store at all the appian way appian way an important roman road linking rome to southern italy of bankruptcy is lined with the graves of unprotected ventures i have one grave there already the silliest soldier would not throw his whole strength at a breakthrough without mortars or reserves or replacements but many a borning business does just that marys money in marked bills bulged against my bottom in my hip pocket but marullo would take as much of that as he could get then the first of the month the wholesale houses are not openhanded with credit for unproved organizations therefore i would still need money and that money was waiting for me behind ticking steel doors the process of getting it designed as daydreams stood up remarkably when inspected that robbery was unlawful troubled me very little marullo was no problem if he were not the victim he might have planned it himself danny was troubling even though i could with perfect truth assume that he was finished anyway mr bakers ineffectual attempt to do the same thing to danny gave me more justification than most men need but danny remained a burning in my guts and i had to accept that as one accepts a wound in successful combat i had to live with that but maybe it would heal in time or be walled off with forgetfulness the way a shell fragment gets walled off with cartilage the immediate was the money and that move was as carefully prepared and timed as an electric circuit the morphy laws stood up well and i remembered them and had even added one first law have no past record well i had none number two no accomplices or confidants i certainly had none number three no dames well margie younghunt was the only person i knew who could be called a dame and i was not about to drink champagne out of her slipper number four dont splurge well i wouldnt gradually i would use it to pay bills to wholesalers i had a place for it in my knight templars hatbox there was a support of velvetcovered cardboard the size and shape of my head this was already lifted free and the edges coated with contact cement so it could be restored in an instant recognitiona mickey mouse mask no one would see anything else an old cotton raincoat of marullosall tan cotton raincoats look alikeand a pair of those tearoff cellophane gloves that come on a roll the mask had been cut several days ago and the box and cereal flushed down the toilet as the mask and gloves would be the old silvered iver johnson pistol was smoked with lampblack and in the toilet was a can of crankcase oil to throw it in for delivery to chief stoney at the first opportunity i had added my own final law dont be a pig dont take too much and avoid large bills if somewhere about six to ten thousand in tens and twenties were available that would be enough and easy to handle and to hide a cardboard cakebox on the cold counter would be the swap bag and when next seen it would have a cake in it i had tried that terrible reedy ventriloquism thing to change my voice and had given it up for silence and gestures everything in place and ready i was almost sorry mr baker wasnt here there would be only morph and harry robbit and edith alden it was planned to the split second at five minutes to nine i would place the broom in the entrance id practiced over and over apron tucked up scale weight on the toilet chain to keep it flushing anyone who came in would hear the water and draw his own conclusion coat mask cakebox gun gloves cross the alley on the stroke of nine shove open the back door put on mask enter just after timeclock buzzes and joey swings open the door motion the three to lie down with the gun theyd give no trouble as joey said the money was insured he wasnt pick up the money put it in cakebox cross alley flush gloves and mask down toilet put gun in can of oil coat off apron down money in hatbox cake in cakebox pick up broom and go on sweeping sidewalk available and visible when the alarm came the whole thing one minute and forty seconds timed checked and rechecked but carefully as i had planned and timed i still felt a little breathless and i swept out the store prior to opening the two front doors i wore yesterdays apron so that new wrinkles would not be noticeable and would you believe it time stood still as though a joshua in a wing collar had shot the sun in its course the minute hand of my fathers big watch had set its heels and resisted morning it was long since i had addressed my flock aloud but this morning i did perhaps out of nervousness my friends i said what you are about to witness is a mystery i know i can depend on you to keep silent if any of you have any feeling about the moral issue involved i challenge you and will ask you to leave i paused no objections very well if i ever hear of an oyster or a cabbage discussing this with strangers the sentence is death by dinner fork and i want to thank you all we have been together humble workers in the vineyard and i a servant as you are but now a change is coming i will be master here henceforth but i promise i will be a good and kind and understanding master the time approaches my friends the curtain risesfarewell and as i moved to the front doors with the broom i heard my own voice cry dannydanny get out of my guts a great shudder shook me so that i had to lean on the broom a moment before i opened up the doors my fathers watch said nine with its black stumpy hour hand and minus six with its long thin minute hand i could feel its heart beat against my palm as i looked at it chapter fifteen it was a day as different from other days as dogs are from cats and both of them from chrysanthemums or tidal waves or scarlet fever it is the law in many states certainly in ours that it must rain on long holiday weekends else how could the multitudes get drenched and miserable the july sun fought off a multitude of little feathered clouds and drove them scuttling but thunderheads looked over the western rim the strongarm rainbearers from the hudson river valley armed with lightning and already mumbling to themselves if the law was properly obeyed they would hold back until a maximum number of anthappy humans were on the highways and the beaches summerdressed and summergreen most of the other stores did not open until ninethirty it had been marullos thought to catch a pinch of trade by having me jump the gun half an hour i thought i would change that it caused more ill feeling among the other stores than the profit justified marullo didnt care about that if he ever knew about it he was a foreigner a wop a criminal a tyrant a squeezer of the poor a bastard and eight kinds of son of a bitch i having destroyed him it was only natural that his faults and crimes should become blindingly apparent to me i felt old long hand edging around on my fathers watch and i found i was sweeping viciously with tensed muscles waiting for the moment of swift smooth movement of my mission i breathed through my mouth and my stomach pushed against my lungs as i remember it did waiting for an attack for saturdaymorningfourthofjulyweekend there were few people about a strangerold manwent by carrying a fishing rod and a green plastic tackle box he was on his way to the town pier to sit all day dangling a limp strip of squid in the water he didnt even look up but i forced his attention hope you catch some big ones never catch anything he said stripers come in sometimes i dont believe it a redhot optimist but at least i had set the hook in his attention and jennie single rolled along the sidewalk she moved as though she had casters instead of feet probably new baytowns least reliable witness once she turned on her gas oven and forgot to light it shed have blown herself through the roof if she could have remembered where she had put the matches morning miss jenny good morning danny im ethan course you are im going to bake a cake i tried to gouge a scar in her memory what kind well its fannie farmer but the label fell off the package so i really dont know what a witness she would make if i needed a witness and why did she say danny a piece of tinfoil on the pavement resisted the broom i had to stoop down and lift it with a fingernail those assistant bank mice were really mousing the hour with cat baker away they were the ones i wanted it was less than one minute to nine when they burst from the coffee shop and sprinted across the street runrunrun i called and they grinned selfconsciously as they charged the bank doors now it was time i must not think of the whole thingjust one step at a time and each in its place as i had practiced i folded my anxious stomach down where it belonged first lean the broom against the doorjamb where it could be seen i moved with slow deliberate speed from the corner of my eye i saw a car come along the street and i paused to let it go by mr hawley i whirled the way cornered gangsters do in the movies a dusty dark green chevrolet had slid to the curb and great god that ivy league government man was getting out my stonebuilt earth shuddered like a reflection in water paralyzed i saw him cross the pavement it seemed to take ages but it was simple as that my longplanned perfect structure turned to dust before my eyes the way a longburied artifact does when the air strikes it i thought of rushing for the toilet and going through with it it wouldnt work i couldnt repeal the morphy law thought and light must travel at about the same speed its a shock to throw out a plan so long considered so many times enacted that its consummation is just one more repetition but i tossed it out threw it away closed it off i had no choice and lightspeed thought said thank god he didnt come one minute later that would have been the fatal accident they write about in crime stories and all this while the young man moved stiffly four steps across the pavement something must have showed through to him whats the matter mr hawley you look sick skitters i said thatll wait for no man run for it ill wait i dashed for the toilet closed the door and pulled the chain to make a rush of water i hadnt switched on the light i sat there in the dark my quaking stomach played along in a moment i really had to go and i did and slowly the beating pressure in me subsided i added a bylaw to the morphy code in case of accident change your planinstantly it has happened to me before that in crisis or great danger i have stepped out and apart and as an interested stranger watched myself my movements and my mind but immune to the emotions of the thing observed sitting in the blackness i saw the other person fold his perfect plan and put it in a box and close the lid and shove the thing not only out of sight but out of thought i mean that by the time i stood up in the darkness and zipped and smoothed and laid my hand on the flimsy plywood door i was a grocery clerk prepared for a busy day it was no secretiveness it was really so i wondered what the young man wanted but only with the pale apprehension that comes from a lowgrade fear of cops sorry to keep you waiting i said cant remember what i ate to cause that theres a virus going around he said my wife had it last week well this virus carried a gun i nearly got caught short what can i do for you he seemed embarrassed apologetic almost shy a guy does funny things he said i overcame an impulse to say it takes all kindsand im glad i did because his next words were in my business you meet all kinds i walked behind the counter and kicked the leather knight templar hatbox closed and i leaned my elbows on the counter very odd five minutes earlier i saw myself through the eyes of other people i had to what they saw was important and as he came across the pavement this man had been a huge dark hopeless fate an enemy an ogre but with my project tucked away and gone as a part of me i saw him now as an object apartno longer linked with me for good or bad he was i think about my age but shaped in a school a manner perhaps a culta lean face and hair carefully trimmed short and standing straight up white shirt of a coarse woven linen with the collar buttoned down and a tie chosen by his wife and without doubt patted and straightened by her as he left the house his suit a gray darkness and his nails home cared for but well cared for a wide gold wedding ring on his left hand a tiny bar in his buttonhole a suggestion of the decoration he would not wear his mouth and dark blue eyes were schooled to firmness which made it all the more strange that they were not firm now in some way a hole had been opened in him he was not the same man whose questions had been short squared bars of steel spaced perfectly one below its fellow you were here before i said what is your business department of justice your business is justice he smiled yes at least thats what i hope but im not on official businessnot even sure the department would approve but its my day off what can i do for you its kind of complicated dont know quite where to begin its not in the book hawley ive been in the service twelve years and ive never had anything like this before maybe if you tell me what it is i can help you do it he smiled at me hard to set it up ive been driving three hours from new york and ive got to drive three hours back in holiday traffic sounds serious it is i think you said your name was walder richard walder im going to be swamped with customers mr walder dont know why they havent started hotdogandrelish trade youd better start am i in trouble in my job you meet all kinds tough ones liars cheats hustlers stupid bright mostly you can get mad at them get an attitude to carry you through do you see no i guess not look walder what in hells bothering you im not completely stupid ive talked to mr baker at the bank youre after mr marullo my boss and i got him he said softly what for illegal entry its not my doing they throw me a dossier and i follow it up i dont judge him or try him hell be deported yes can he make a fight can i help him no he doesnt want to hes pleading guilty he wants to go well ill be damned six or eight customers came in i warned you i called to him and i helped them select what they needed or thought they did thank heaven i had ordered a mountain of hotdog and hamburger rolls walder called what do you get for piccalilli its marked on the label thirtynine cents maam he said and he went to work measuring bagging adding he reached in front of me to ring up cash on the register when he moved away i took a bag from the pile opened the drawer and using the bag like a potholder i picked up the old revolver took it back to the toilet and dropped it in the can of crankcase oil that waited for it youre good at this i said when i came back i used to have a job at grand union after school it shows dont you have anybody to help im going to bring my boy in customers always come in coveys never in evenly spaced singles a clerk gets set in the interval to meet the next flight another thing when two men do something together they become alike differences of mind become less ragged the army discovered that black and white no longer fight each other when they have something else to fight in company my subcutaneous fear of a cop dissipated when walder weighed out a pound of tomatoes and totted up a list of figures on a bag our first flight took off better tell me quick what you want i said i promised marullo id come out here he wants to give you the store youre nuts i beg your pardon maam i was speaking to my friend oh yes of course well there are five of usthree children how many frankfurters will i need five apiece for the children three for your husband two for you thats twenty you think theyll eat five they think they will is it a picnic uhhuh then get five extra for dropping in the fire where do you keep the plugo for sinks back there with the cleansers and ammonia it was broken up like that and was bound to be edited of customers it was like this i guess im in a state of shock i just do my job and its with mugs for the most part if you get conditioned by crooks and liars and cheats why an honest man can shock the hell out of you what do you mean honest my boss never gave away anything hes a tough monkey i know he is we made him that way he told me and i believe him before he came over he knew the words on the bottom of the statue of liberty hed memorized the declaration of independence in dialect the bill of rights was words of fire and then he couldnt get in so he came anyway a nice man helped himtook everything he had and dropped him in the surf to wade ashore it was quite a while before he understood the american way but he learnedhe learned a guy got to make a buck look out for number one but he learned hes not dumb he took care of number one this was interspersed with customers so it didnt build to a dramatic climaxjust a series of short statements thats why he wasnt hurt when somebody turned him in turned him in sure all it takes is a telephone call who did that who knows the departments a machine you set the dials and it follows through all the steps like an automatic washer why didnt he run for it hes tired right to his bones hes tired and hes disgusted hes got some money he wants to go back to sicily i still dont get it about the store hes like me i can take care of chiselers thats my job an honest man gums up my works throws me sky high thats what happened to him one guy didnt try to cheat him didnt steal didnt whine didnt chisel he tried to teach the sucker to take care of himself in the land of the free but the boob couldnt learn for a long time you scared him he tried to figure out your racket and he discovered your racket was honesty suppose he was wrong he doesnt think he was he wants to make you a kind of monument to something he believed in once ive got the conveyance out in the car all you have to do is file it i dont understand it i dont know whether i do or not you know how he talkslike corn popping im trying to translate what he tried to explain its like a man is made a certain way with a certain direction if he changes that something blows he strips a gear he gets sick its like awell like a doityourself police court you have to pay for a violation youre his down payment kind of so the light wont go out why did you drive out here dont know exactly had tomaybeso the light wont go out oh god the store clouded up with clamoring kids and damp women there wouldnt be any more uncluttered moments until noon at least walder went out to his car and came back and parted a wave of frantic summer wives to get to the counter he laid down one of those hard board bellows envelopes tied with a tape got to go four hours drive with this traffic my wifes mad she said it could wait but it couldnt wait mister i been waiting ten minutes to get waited on be right with you maam i asked him if he had any message and he said tell him goodby you got any message tell him goodby the wave of illdisguised stomachs closed in again and it was just as well for me i dropped the envelope in the drawer below the cash register and with itdesolation chapter sixteen the day went quickly and yet was endless closing time had no relation to opening time so long ago it was that i could hardly remember it joey came in as i was about to close the front doors and without asking him i punched a beer can and handed it to him and then i opened one for myself and i have never done that before i tried to tell him about marullo and the store and found i could not not even the story i had accepted in exchange for the truth you look tired he said i guess i am look at those shelvesstripped they bought things they didnt want and didnt need i unloaded the cash register into the gray canvas bag added the money mr baker had brought and on top i put the bellows envelope and tied up the bag with a piece of string you oughtnt to leave that around maybe not i hide it want another beer sure me too youre too good an audience he said i get to believing my own stories like what like my tripledeck instincts i had one this morning woke up with it guess i dreamed it but it was real strong hair on the back of my neck and everything i didnt think the bank was going to get stuck up today i knew it i knew it lying in bed we keep little wedges under the foot alarms so we wont tramp them by mistake first thing this morning i took them out i was that sure of it braced for it now how do you explain that maybe somebody planned it and you read his mind and he gave it up you make it easy for a guy to guess wrong with honor how do you figure it god knows i think ive been mr knowitall to you so much i got to believe it but it sure shook me up you know morph im too tired even to sweep out dont leave that dough here tonight take it home okay if you say so i still got the feeling somethings screwy i opened the leather box and put the money sack in with my plumed hat and strapped it closed joey watching me said im going in to new york and get a room at a hotel and im going to watch the waterfall across times square for two solid days with my shoes off with your date i called that off ill order up a bottle of whisky and a dame dont have to talk to either of them i told youmaybe were going on a little trip hope so you need it ready to go couple of things to do you go on joey get your shoes off first thing to do was to call mary and tell her i had to be a little late yes but hurry hurry hurry news news news cant you tell me now sweetheart no i want to see your face i hung the mickey mouse mask on the cash register by its rubber band so that it covered the little window where the numbers show then i put on my coat and hat and turned out the lights and sat on the counter with my legs dangling a naked black banana stalk nudged me on one side and the cash register fitted against my left shoulder like a bookend the shades were up so that the summer late light strained through the crossedwire grating and it was very quiet a quiet like a rushing sound and thats what i needed i felt in my left side pocket for the lump the cash register pushed against me the talismani held it in my two hands and stared down at it i had thought i needed it yesterday had i forgot to put it back or was my keeping it with me no accident i dont know as always it put its power on me as i traced its design with my finger at midday it was the pink of a rose but in the evening it picked up a darker tone a purplish blush as though a little blood had got in it it wasnt thought i needed but rearrangement change of design as though i were in a garden from which the house had been moved in the night some kind of makeshift had to be set up to shelter me until i could rebuild i had retired into busyness until i could let new things enter slowly and count and identify them as they came the shelves all day assaulted showed many gaps where their defenses had been breeched by the hungry horde a snaggletoothed effect a walled town after artillery fire let us pray for our departed friends i said the thin red line of catsup the gallant pickles and condiments down to the small bald capers of vinegar we cannot dedicate we cannot consecrateno not that it is rather to us the livingno not that alfioi wish you luck and surcease from pain you are wrong of course but wrongness can be a poultice to you you made a sacrifice for having been a sacrifice people passing in the street flickered the light inside the store i dug back in the debris of the day for walders words and for his face when he said them a doityourself police court you have to pay for a violation youre his down payment kind of so the light wont go out thats what the man said walder in his safe world of crooks shaken by one gleaming shaft of honesty so the light wont go out did alfio say it that way walder didnt know but he did know thats what marullo meant i traced the serpent on the talisman and came back to the beginning which was the end that was an old lightmarulli three thousand years ago found their way through the lupariae to the lupercal on the palatine lupercal on the palatine lupercalia the wolf festival honoring romulus and remus mythical founders of rome took place near the cave of lupercal the legendary grotto where romulus and remus were suckled by a shewolf the palatine is one of romes seven hills to offer a votive to lycean pan protector of the flocks from wolves and that light had not gone out marullo the dago the wop the guinea sacrificed to the same god for the same reason i saw him again raise his head out of the welter of fat neck and aching shoulders i saw the noble head the hot eyesand the light i wondered what my payment would be and when demanded if i took my talisman down to the old harbor and threw it in the seawould that be acceptable i did not draw the shades on long holidays we left them up so the cops could look in the storeroom was dark i locked the alley door and was halfway across the street when i remembered the hatbox behind the counter i did not go back for it it would be a kind of question asked the wind was rising that saturday evening blowing shrill and eagerly from the southeast as it must to bring the rain to soak the vacationers i thought to put out the milk for that gray cat on tuesday and invite it in to be a guest in my store chapter seventeen i dont know for sure how other people are insideall different and all alike at the same time i can only guess but i do know how i will squirm and wriggle to avoid a hurtful truth and when finally there is no choice will put it off hoping it will go away do other people say primly ill think about that tomorrow when i am rested and then draw on a hopedfor future or an edited past like a child playing with violence against the inevitability of bedtime my dawdled steps toward home led through a minefield of the truth the future was sowed with fertile dragons teeth it was not unnatural to run for a safe anchorage in the past but on that course set square across it was aunt deborah a great wing shot on a covey of lies her eyes gleaming question marks i had looked in the window of the jewelry store at expanding watch bands and glasses frames as long as was decent the humid windy evening was breeding a thunderstorm there were many like greataunt deborah early in the last century islands of curiosity and knowledge maybe it was being cut off from a world of peers that drove the few into books or perhaps it was the endless waiting sometimes three years sometimes forever for the ships to come home that pushed them into the kind of books that filled our attic she was the greatest of greataunts a sibyl and a pythoness in one said magic nonsense words to me which

her hand one finger between the pages i know her method she would ask me what she thought i might think an interesting question and then let slip whatever it was mary wanted to tell me its a kind of triumph for ellen to tell first i wouldnt say she is a tattletale but she is i waved crossed fingers at her kings x but daddy i said kings x miss hothouse rhubarb and i meant kings x i slammed the door and shouted a mans bathroom is his castle and i heard her laugh i dont trust children when they laugh at my jokes i scrubbed my face raw and brushed my teeth until my gums bled i shaved put on a

snatched it almost greedily and carried it in both hands to the living room marys eyes were on me strangely somberly why did you take it ethan for luck my love and it worked chapter eighteen it rained on sunday july third as it must fat drops more wet than usual we nudged our way in the damp segmented worms of traffic feeling a little grand and helpless and lost like cagebred birds set free and frightened as freedom shows its teeth mary sat straight smelling of freshironed cotton are you happyare you gay i keep listening for the children i know aunt deborah called it happylonesome take flight my bird those long flaps on your shoulders are wings you juggins she smiled and nuzzled close its good but i still listen for the children i wonder what they are doing now almost anything you

worry a little ill feel better if i do i never heard it better put shall we together go over all the horrid possibilities you know what i mean i do but you highness brought it to the family it only travels in the female line the little bleeders no one loves his children more than you my guilt is as the guilt of ten because i am a skunk i like you now thats the kind of worrying i approve of see that stretch look how the gorse and heather hold and the sand cuts out from under like solid little waves the rain hits the earth and jumps right up in a thin mist ive always thought it is like dartmoor or exmoor and ive never seen them except through the eyes of print you know the first devon men must have felt at home here do you think its haunted if it isnt youll haunt it you must not make compliments unless you mean them its not for now watch for the side road it will say moorcroft it did too and the nice thing about that lean spindle end of long island is that the rain sinks in and there is no mud we had a dolls house to ourselves fresh and ginghamy and nationally advertised twin beds fat as muffins i dont approve of those sillyyou can reach across i can do one whole hell of a lot better than that you harlot we dined in greasy dignity on broiled maine lobsters sloshed down with white winelots of white wine to make my marys eyes to shine and i plied her with cognac seductively until my own head was buzzing she remembered the number of our doll house and she could find the keyhole i wasnt too buzzed to have my way with her but i think she could have escaped if she had wanted to then aching with comfort she drowsed her head on my right arm and smiled and made small yawny sounds are you worried about something what a thought youre dreaming before youre asleep youre working so hard to make me happy i cant get past into you are you worried a strange and seeing time the front steps of sleep yes im worried does that reassure you i wouldnt want you to repeat it but the sky is falling and a piece of it fell on my tail she had drifted sweetly off with her panic smile i slipped my arm free and stood between the beds the rain was over except for roof drip and the quartermoon glistened its image in a billion droplets beaux rêves beaux rêves french for pleasant dreams my dearling dear dont let the sky fall on us my bed was cool and oversoft but i could see the sharp moon driving through the seafleeing clouds and i heard the ghostcry of a bittern i crossed the fingers of both handskings x for a little while double kings x it was only a pea that fell on my tail if the dawn came up with any thunder i didnt hear it all golden green it was when i came to it dark of heather and pale with fern and yellowy red with wet dune sand and not far away the atlantic glittering like hammered silver a twisted gaffer oak beside our house had put out near its root a lichen big as a pillow a ridgewaved thing of gray pearly white a curving graveled path led among the small township of doll houses to the shingled bungalow that had spawned them all here were office postcards gifts stamps and also dining room with bluecheckered tablecloths where we dolls could dine the manager was in his counting house checking some kind of list i had noticed him when we registered a man of wisped hair and little need to shave he was a furtive and a furthy man at once and he had so hoped from our gaiety our outing was clandestine that i nearly signed his book john smith and wife to give him pleasure he sniffed for sin indeed he seemed to see with his long tender nose as a mole does good morning i said he leveled his nose at me slept well perfectly i wonder if i can carry a tray of breakfast to my wife we only serve in the dining room seventhirty to ninethirty but if i carry it myself its against the rules couldnt we break them this once you know how it is i threw that in because thats how he hoped it was his pleasure was reward enough his eyes grew moist and his nose trembled feeling a little shy is she well you know how it is i dont know what the cook will say ask him and tell him a dollar stands tiptoe on the misty mountaintop the cook was a greek who found a dollar attractive in time i toted a giant napkincovered tray along the graveled path and set it on a rustic bench while i picked a bouquet of microscopic field flowers to grace the royal breakfast of my dear perhaps she was awake but she opened her eyes anyway and said i smell coffee oh oh what a nice husbandandand flowersall the little sounds that never lose their fragrance we breakfasted and coffeed and coffeed again my mary propped up in bed looking younger and more innocent than her daughter and each of us spoke respectfully of how well we had slept my time had come get comfortable i have news both sad and glad good did you buy the ocean marullo is in trouble what a long time ago he came to america without asking leave wellwhat now they are asking him to leave deported yes but thats awful its not nice what will we do what will you do playtime is over he sold me the storeor rather he sold you the store its your money he has to convert his property and he likes me he practically gave it to methree thousand dollars but thats awful you meanyou mean you own the store yes youre not a clerk not a clerk she rolled face down in the pillows and wept big fullbosomed sobs the way a slave might when the collar is struck off i went out on the dolls front stoop and sat in the sun until she was ready and when she had finished and washed her face and combed her hair and put on her dressing gown she opened the door and called to me and she was different would always be different she didnt have to say it the set of her neck said it she could hold up her head we were gentlefolks again cant we do anything to help mr marullo im afraid not how did it happen who found out i dont know hes a good man they shouldnt do it to him how is he taking it with dignity with honor we walked on the beach as we had thought we might sat in the sand picked up small bright shells and showed them to each other as we must do spoke with conventional wonder about natural things the sea the air the light the windcooled sun as though the creator were listening in for compliments marys attention was split i think she wanted to be back home in her new status to see the different look in the eyes of women the changed tone of greetings in the high street i think she was no more poor mary hawley she works so hard she had become mrs ethan allen hawley and would ever be and i had to keep her that she went through the day because it was planned and paid for but the real shells she turned over and inspected were the shining days to come we had our lunch in the bluechecked dining room where marys manner her certainty of position and place disappointed mr mole his tender nose was out of joint that had so joyously quivered at the scent of sin his disillusion was complete when he had to come to our table and report a telephone call for mrs hawley who knows were here why margie of course i had to tell her because of the children oh i do hope he doesnt look where hes going you know she came back trembling like a star youll never guess you couldnt i can guess its good she said have you heard the news have you heard the radio i could tell by her voice it

cheers and cries of triumph and a cake if there was anything open id get sparklers the roadside stands of course on the way homeif they have any left mary put down her head a moment as though she were

hawleycalled allen well its been an honor to have you and mrs allen with us mrs hawley of course i hope youll come again lots of celebrities have stayed here they come forthe quiet mary sat straight and proud on the golden road toward home in the slow and glittering snake of the traffic i got a whole box of sparklers over a hundred now thats more like you dear i wonder if the bakers are back yet chapter nineteen my son conducted himself well he was relaxed and kind to us he took no revenge ordered no executions his honors and our compliments he accepted as his due without vanity and also without overdone humility he advanced to his chair in the living room and switched on his radio before the hundred sparklers had fizzed out to black sticks it was obvious that he forgave us our trespasses i never saw a boy accept greatness with more grace it was truly a night of wonders if allens easy ascent into heaven was surprising how much more so was ellens reaction some years of close and enforced observation told me miss ellen would be tattered and stormblown with envy would in fact look out for some means of minimizing his greatness she fooled me she became her brothers celebrator it was ellen who told how they were sitting in an elegant apartment on sixtyseventh street after an evening of magic casually watching the cbs late news on television when the word of allens triumph was announced it was ellen who recounted what they said and how they looked and how you could have knocked them over with a feather allen sat remote and calm during ellens telling of how he would appear with the four other honorables how he would read his essay while millions looked and listened and mary clucked happily in the pauses i glanced at margie younghunt she was indrawn as she was during cardreading and a dark quiet crept into the room no escaping it i said this calls for icecold root beer all around ellen will get it where is ellen she drifts in and out like smoke margie younghunt stood up nervously this is a family party ive got to go but margie youre part of it where did ellen go mary dont make me admit im a trifle on the pooped side you have had it dear i keep forgetting we had such a rest youll never knowand thanks to you i loved it i wouldnt have missed it she wanted to be away and quickly she took our thanks and allens thanks and fled mary said quietly we didnt tell about the store let it ride it would be robbing his pink eminence its his right where did ellen go she went to bed said mary thats thoughtful darling and youre right allen its been a big day time you went to bed i think ill sit here a while allen said kindly but you need rest im resting mary looked to me for help these are the times that try mens souls i can dust him or we can let him have his victory even over us hes just a little boy really he needs his rest he needs several things but rest isnt one of them everyone knows children need their rest the things everyone knows are most likely to be wrong did you ever know a child to die of overwork noonly adults children are too smart for that they rest when they need rest but its after midnight so it is darling and he will sleep until noon tomorrow you and i will be up at six you mean youll go to bed and leave him sitting there he needs his revenge on us for having borne him i dont know what youre talking about what revenge i want to make a treaty with you because youre growing angry so i am youre being stupid if within half an hour after we go to bed he does not creep to his nest i will pay you fortyseven million eight hundred and twentysix dollars and eighty cents well i lost and i must pay her it was thirtyfive minutes after we said good night that the stair creaked under our celebrity i hate you when youre right my mary said she had prepared herself to spend the night listening i wasnt right dear i lost by five minutes its just that i remember she went to sleep then she didnt hear ellen creep down the stairs but i did i was watching my red dots moving in the dark and i did not follow for i heard the faint click of the brass key in the lock of the cabinet and i knew my daughter was charging her battery my red spots were active they dashed about and ran away when i centered on them old capn was avoiding me he hadnt come clear sincewell since easter its not like aunt harrietup in heben she be aunt harrietup in heben she be rockin chair written by hoagy carmichael and performed with louis armstrong my dear old aunt harriet in heaven she bebut i do know that when i am not friends with myself old capn doesnt come clear thats a kind of test of my personal relations with myself this night i forced him i lay straight and rigid far over on my side of the bed i tightened every muscle of my body particularly my neck and jaw and doubled my fists on my belly and i forced him bleak little eyes white spiky mustache and the forwardcurving shoulders that proved he had once been a powerful man of his body and had used it i even made him put on the blue cap with the short shiny visor and the gold h contrived of two anchors the cap he hardly ever wore the old boy was reluctant but i made him come and i set him on the crumbling sea wall of old harbor near the place i sat him firmly on a heap of ballast stone and fixed his cupped hands on the head of the narwhal cane that cane could have knocked over an elephant i need something to hate being sorry and understandingthats pap im looking for a real hate to take the heat off memorys a spawner start with one clear detailed print and it springs into action and it can go forward or back like a film once it starts old capn moved he pointed with his cane line the third rock beyond the breakwater with the tip of porty point at high water then out that line half a cablelength she lies whats left of her how far is half a cablelength sir how far why half a hundred fathom of course she was anchored to swing and the tide flowing two badluck years half the oil casks empty i was ashore when she caught fire about midnight when the oil fired she lit the town like midday and flames running on the oil slick as far as osprey point couldnt beach her for fear of burning the docks she burned to the water in an hour her keel and false keel are down there nowand sound shelter island virgin oak they were and her knees too howd it start i never thought it started i was ashore whod want to burn her why her owners you owned her i was halfowner i couldnt burn a ship id like to see those timberslike to see what shape theyre in you can go now capn sir thats slim fare to hate on its better than nothing ill get that keel upsoon as im rich ill do that for youline the third rock with porty point at high water fifty fathoms out i was not sleeping my fists and forearms were rigid and pressed against my stomach to prevent old capn from fading but when i let him go sleep lapped over me when pharaoh had a dream he called in the experts and they told him how it was and would be in the kingdom and that was right because he was the kingdom when some of us have a dream we take it to an expert and he tells us how it is in the country of ourselves i had a dream that didnt need an expert like most modern people i dont believe in prophecy or magic and then spend half my time practicing it in the springtime allen feeling low and lonely announced that he was an atheist to punish god and his parents i told him not to go out on a limb or he wouldnt have leeway to not walk under ladders and cancel black cats with spit and thumb and wish on the new moon people who are most afraid of their dreams convince themselves they dont dream at all i can explain my dream easily enough but that doesnt make it any less frightening an order came through from danny i dont know how he was going away by aircraft and he wanted certain things of me things i had to make myself he wanted a cap for mary it had to be of dark brown sueded lambskin with the wool on the inside it had to be of skin like an old pair of sheeplined slippers i have had to be like a baseball cap with a long beak also he wanted a wind gaugenot the little whirling metal cups but handmade from the thin stiff cardboard of government postcards mounted on strips of bamboo and he called me to meet him before he took off i carried old capns narwhal stick with me it stands in the elephantsfoot umbrella stand in our hall when we got the elephants foot as a present i looked at the big ivorycolored toenails i told my children the first kid who puts nail polish on those toenails gets clobberedunderstand they obeyed me so i had to paint them myselfbright red fingernail enamel from marys harem table i went to meet danny in marullos pontiac and the airport was the new baytown post office when i parked i laid the twisted stick on the back seat and two meanlooking cops in a squad car drove up and said not on the seat is it against the law so you want to be a wise guy no i was just asking well dont put it on the seat danny was in the back of the post office sorting packages he was wearing the lambskin cap and whirling the cardboard wind gauge his face was thin and his lips very chapped but his hands were swollen like hotwater bottles as though they had been waspstung he stood up to shake hands and my right hand was folded in the warm rubbery mass he put something in my hand something small and heavy and cool about the size of a key but not a keya shape a metal thing that felt sharpedged and polished i dont know what it was because i didnt look at it i only felt it i leaned near and kissed him on the mouth and with my lips felt his dry lips all chapped and rough i awakened then shaken and cold the dawn had come i could see the lake but not the cow standing in it and i could still feel the chapped dry lips i got up instantly because i didnt want to lie there thinking about it i didnt make coffee but i went to the elephants foot and saw that the wicked club called a cane was still there it was the throbbing time of dawn and hot and humid for the morning wind had not started to blow the street was gray and silver and the sidewalk greasy with the deposit of humanity the foremaster coffee shop wasnt open but i didnt want coffee anyway i went through the alley and opened my back doorlooked in the front and saw the leather hatbox behind the counter i opened a coffee can poured the coffee in the garbage pail then i punched two holes in a can of condensed milk and squirted it into the coffee can propped the back door open and put the can in the entrance the cat was in the alley all right but he wouldnt come to the milk until i went into the front of the store from there i could see him gray cat in gray alley lapping the milk when he raised his head he was mustached with milk he sat down and wiped his mouth and licked his pads i opened the hatbox and took out the saturday receipts all listed and held together with paper clips from the brown bank envelope i removed thirty onehundreddollar bills and replaced the other twenty of them this three thousand dollars would be my margin of safety until the stores economy could balance marys other two thousand would go back to her account and as soon as i could do it safely i would replace the three thousand the thirty bills i put in my new wallet which made it very fat in my hip pocket then i brought cases and cartons from the storeroom ripped and tore them open and began to replenish my exhausted shelves while on a strip of wrapping paper i listed the goods that had to be reordered cartons and boxes i piled in the alley for the collection truck and i refilled the coffeecan with milk but the cat did not return either he had had enough or he took pleasure only in what he could steal it must be that there are years unlike other years as different in climate and direction and mood as one day can be from another day this year of was a year of change a year when secret fears come into the open when discontent stops being dormant and changes gradually to anger it wasnt only in me or in new baytown presidential nominations presidential nominations the democratic national convention met at the los angeles memorial sports arena july and nominated john f kennedy for president and lyndon b johnson for vice president the republican national convention met at chicagos international amphitheater july and nominated richard m nixon for president and henry cabot lodge for vice president would be coming up soon and in the air the discontent was changing to anger and the excitement anger brings and it wasnt only the nation the whole world stirred with restlessness and uneasiness as discontent moved to anger and anger tried to find an outlet in action any action so long as it was violentafrica cuba south america europe asia the near east all restless as horses at the barrier i knew that tuesday july fifth was going to be a day larger than other days i even think i knew what things would happen before they happened but since they did i will never be sure whether i really knew i think i knew that the seventeenjewel shockproof mr baker who ticked the hours would come rattling at my front door an hour before the bank opening time he did before i had opened for business i let him in and closed the doors after him what an awful thing he said i was out of touch i came back as soon as i heard which awful thing sir why the scandal those men are my friends my old friends ive got to do something they wont even be questioned before electionjust charged i know couldnt we issue a statement of our belief in their innocence even a paid advertisement if necessary in what sir the bay harbor messenger doesnt come out until thursday well something should be done i know it was so formal he must have known i knew and yet he met my eyes and he seemed genuinely worried the crazy fringe will ruin town elections unless we do something weve got to offer new candidates we dont have any choice its a terrible thing to do to old friends but theyd be the first to know we cant let the egghead fringe get in why dont you talk to them theyre bruised and mad they havent had time to think it out did marullo come he sent a friend i bought the store for three thousand thats good you got a bargain get the papers yes well if he jumps the bills are listed he wont jump he wants to go hes tired i never trusted him never knew what he had his fingers in was he a crook sir he was tricky played both sides of the street hes worth a lot if he can dispose of his property but three thousandthats a giveaway he liked me he must have who did he send the mafia a government man you see marullo trusted me mr baker clasped his brow and that was out of character why didnt i think of it youre the man good family reliable propertyowner businessman respected you dont have an enemy in town of course youre the man the man for town manager ive only been a businessman since saturday you know what i mean around you we could get respectable new faces why its the perfect way from grocery clerk to town manager nobody ever thought of a hawley as a grocery clerk i did mary did but you arent we can announce it today before that crazy fringe gets set ill have to consider it from keelson to skysl keelson to skysl the keel is the spine of the ship providing structural support and the keelson is a beam or timbers along the keel to add strength a skysail is the topsail in a square rigger theres no time who had you thought of before before what before the council burned ill talk to you later saturday was a big day i could have sold the scales you can make a nice thing of this store ethan i advise you to build it up and sell it youre

not all dead if her keels alive youd better go if youre going to bless the opening of the safe and ive got to open up then his balance wheel started and he ticked off to the bank i think now i had

throat why should i i can understand why you were huffy i guess i wasnt verydiplomatic maybe that was it have you chewed on my proposition yes what do you think i think six per cent would be better i

whole tempo had changed people took time they wanted to talk about the scandal saying it was bad awful sad disgraceful but enjoying it too we havent had a scandal for a long time nobody mentioned the democratic national convention coming up in los angelesnot even once of course new baytown is a republican town but i think mostly they were interested in what was close to home we knew the men whose graves we danced on chief stonewall jackson came in during the noon hour and he looked tired and sad i put the can of oil on the counter and fished out the old pistol with a piece of wire heres the evidence chief take it away will you it makes me nervous well wipe it off will you look at that thats what they used to call a twodollar pistoltoplatch iver johnson you got anybody that can mind the store no i havent wheres marullo hes out of town guess maybe you might have to close up for a while what is this chief well charley pryors boy ran away from home this morning got a cold drink there somewhere sure orange cream lemon coke give me a sevenup charleys a funny kind of guy his boy tom is eight he figures the worlds against him and hes going to run away to be a pirate anybody else would of give him a crack acrost the behind but not charley arent you going to open this sorry there you are whats charley got to do with me i like him of course well charley dont do things like other people he figures the best way to cure tom is to help him so after breakfast they get a bedroll together and a big lunch tom wants to take a jap sword for selfprotection but it drags so he settles for a bayonet charley loads him in the car and drives him out of town to give him a good start he let him out over near taylor meadowyou know the old taylor place thats about nine oclock this morning charley watched the kid a while first thing he did was sit down and eat six sandwiches and two hardboiled eggs and then he went on acrost the meadow with his brave little bindle and his bayonet and charley drove home here it came i knew it i knew it it was almost a relief to get it over bout eleven he come slobbering out on the road and hooked a ride home i think i can guess stoneyis it danny fraid so down in the cellar hole of the old house case of whisky only two empties and a bottle of sleeping pills sorry i got to ask you this eth been there a long time and something got at him at his face cats maybe you remember any scars or marks on him i dont want to look at him chief well who does how about scars i remember a barbwire cut above the knee on his left leg andandi rolled up my sleevea heart just like this a heart just like this steinbeck also had a tattoo similarly etched with a stanford classmate tattooed we did it together when we were kids cut in with a razor blade and rubbed ink in its still pretty clear see wellthat may do it anything else yesbig scar under his left arm piece of the rib cut out he had pleural pneumonia before the new drugs and they put in a drain well of course if there was a rib cut thatll do it i wont even have to go back myself let the coroner get off his ass youll have to swear to those marks if its him okay but dont make me look at him stoney he wasyou knowhe was my friend sure eth say is there anything in what i hear about you running for town manager its news to me chiefcould you stay here two minutes i got to go just two minutes while i run across the street and get a drink oh sure i get it surego ahead i got to get along with the new town manager i got the drink and a pint too to bring back with me when stoney had gone i printed back at two on a card closed the doors and drew the shades i sat on the leather hatbox behind the counter in my store sat in the dim green darkness of my store chapter twenty at ten minutes to three i went out the back door and around the corner to the front of the bank morph in his bronze cage drew in the sheaf of money and checks the brown envelope and the deposit slips he spread the little bank books with a y of fingers and wrote small angled numbers with a steel pen that whispered on the paper as he pushed the books out to me he looked up with veiled and cautious eyes im not going to talk about it ethan i know he was your friend thanks if you slip out quick you might avoid the brain but i didnt for all i know morph may have buzzed him the frostedglass door of the office swung open and mr baker neat and spare and gray said quietly can you spare a moment ethan no use to put it off i walked into his frosty den and he closed the door so softly that i did not hear the latch click his desk was topped with plate glass under which were lists of typed numbers two customers chairs in echelon stood by his tall chair like twin suckling calves they were comfortable but lower than the desk chair when i sat down i had to look up at mr baker and that put me in the position of supplication sad thing yes i dont think you ought to take all the blame probably would have happened anyway probably im sure you thought you were doing the right thing i thought he had a chance of course you did my hatred was rising in my throat like a yellow taste more sickening than furious apart from the human tragedy and waste it raises a difficulty do you know whether he had relatives i dont think so anybody with money has relatives he had no money he had taylor meadow free and clear did he well a meadow and a cellar hole ethan i told you we planned an airfield to service the whole district the meadow is level if we cant use it it will cost millions to bulldoze runways in the hills and now even if he has no heirs it will have to go through the courts take months i see his ire fissured i wonder if you do see with your good intentions youve thrown the thing sky high sometimes i think a dogooder is the most dangerous thing in the world perhaps youre right i ought to get back to the store its your store it is isnt it i cant get used to it i forget yes you forget the money you gave him was marys money shell never see it now you threw it away danny was fond of my mary he knew it was her money fat lot of good that will do her i thought he was making a joke he gave me these i pulled the two pieces of ruled paper from my inside pocket where i had put them knowing i would have to draw them out like this mr baker straightened them on his glasstopped desk as he read them a muscle beside his right ear twitched so that his ear bobbed his eyes went back over them this time looking for a hole when the son of a bitch looked at me there was fear in him he saw someone he hadnt known existed it took him a moment to adjust to the stranger but he was good he adjusted what is your asking price fiftyone per cent of what of the corporation or partnership or whatever thats ridiculous you want an airfield i have the only one available he wiped his glasses carefully on a piece of pocket kleenex then put them on but he didnt look at me he looked a circle all around me and left me out finally he asked did you know what you were doing ethan yes do you feel good about it i guess i feel as the man felt who took him a bottle of whisky and tried to get him to sign a paper did he tell you that yes he was a liar he told me he was he warned me he was maybe theres some trick in these papers i swept them gently from in front of him and folded the two soiled pencilwritten sheets theres a trick all right ethan those documents are without a flaw dated witnessed clear maybe he hated you maybe his trick was the disintegration of a man mr baker no one in my family ever burned a ship well talk ethan well do business well make money a little town will spring up on the hills around the meadow i guess youll have to be town manager now i cant sir that would constitute a conflict of interest some pretty sad men are finding that out right now he sigheda cautious sigh as though he feared to awaken something in his throat i stood up and rested my hand on the curved and padded leather back of the supplicants chair youll feel better sir when you have got used to the fact that i am not a pleasant fool why couldnt you have taken me into your confidence an accomplice is dangerous then you do feel you have committed a crime no a crime is something someone else commits ive got to open the store even if it is my own store my hand was on the doorknob when he asked quietly who turned marullo in i think you did sir he leaped to his feet but i closed the door after me and went back to my store chapter twentyone no one in the world can rise to a party or a plateau of celebration like my mary it isnt what she contributes but what she receives that makes her glow like a jewel her eyes shine her smiling mouth underlines her quick laughter builds strength into a sickly joke with mary in the doorway of a party everyone feels more attractive and clever than he was and so he actually becomes beyond this mary does not and need not contribute the whole hawley house glowed with celebration when i came home brightcolored plastic flags were strung in canopies from center light to picture molding and lines of colored plastic bannerets hung from the banisters you wouldnt believe it mary cried ellen got them from the esso service station george sandow loaned them whats it about about everything its a glory thing i dont know whether she had heard of danny taylor or had heard and retired him certainly i didnt invite him to the feast but he paced about outside i knew i would have to go out to meet him later but i did not ask him in youd think it was ellen had won honorable mention mary said shes even prouder than if she was the celebrity look at the cake she baked it was a tall white cake with hero written on its top in red green yellow and blue letters were having roast chicken and dressing and giblet gravy and mashed potatoes even if it is summer good darling good and wheres the young celebrity well its changed him too hes taking a bath and changing for dinner its a day of portent sibyl somewhere you will find a mule has foaled and a new comet come into the sky a bath before dinner imagine i thought you might like to change too i have a bottle of wine and i thought maybe a speech or a toast or something like that even if its just the family she fairly flooded the house with party i found myself rushing up the stairs to bathe and be a part of it passing allens door i knocked heard a grunt and went in he was standing in front of his mirror holding a handglass so he could see his profile with some dark stuff maybe marys mascara he had painted on a narrow black mustache had darkened his brows and raised the outer ends to satanic tips he was smiling a worldwise cynical charm into the mirror when i entered and he was wearing my blue polkadot bow tie he did not seem embarrassed at being caught rehearsing for a turn he said and put the handmirror down son in all the excitement i dont think ive told you how proud i am itswell its only a start frankly i didnt think you were even as good a writer as the president im as much surprised as i am pleased when are you going to read your essay to the world sunday fourthirty and a national hookup i have to go into new york special plane flying me are you well rehearsed oh ill do all right its just a start well its more like a jump to be one of five in the whole

all of us do you know ive bought the store yeah i heard well when the bunting and the tinsel come down im going to need your help how do you mean i told you before to help me in the store i couldnt do

is it like i told you its just a start ill not let loose the dogs of war tonight well discuss it later theres a guy from nbc been trying to get you on the phone maybe its a contract because like im not of age have you thought of school my son who needs it if you got a contract i got out fast and closed the door and in my bathroom i ran the water cold and iced my skin and let the cold penetrate deep to control my shaking rage and when i emerged clean and shining and smelling of marys perfume my control was back in the few moments before dinner ellen sat on the arm of my chair and then rolled over in my lap and put her arms around me i do love you she said isnt it exciting and isnt allen wonderful its like hes born to it and this was the girl i had thought very selfish and a little mean just before the cake i toasted the young hero and wished him luck and i finished now is the winter of our discontent made glorious summer by this son of york thats shakespeare ellen said yes muggins but what play who says it and where i wouldnt know said allen thats for squares i helped carry the dishes to the kitchen mary still carried her glow dont fret she said hell find his line hell be all

wont my little dungflower pink thing you mean the talisman sure you may whats a talisman look it up in the dictionary know how to spell it talesman no talisman why dont you tell me youll know it better if you look it up she locked her arms around me and squeezed and as quickly let me go the night closed thick and damp about me humid air about the consistency of chicken broth the street lights hiding among the fat leaves of elm street sprouted damp hairy halos of moisture a man with a job sees so little of the normal daylight world no wonder he must get his news and his attitudes from his wife she knows what happened and who said what about it but it is strained through her womanness wherefore most working men see the daylight world through womens eyes but in the night when his store or his job is closed then is a mans world risenfor a time the twisted staff of narwhal ivory felt good in my hand its heavy silver knob polished by old capns palm once long ago when i lived in a daylight world the world being too much with me the world being too much with me peace william wordsworths sonnet the world is too much with us and allusions to walt whitmans leaves of grass i would have gone to grass face downward and very close to the green stems i became one with ants and aphids and sow bugs no longer a colossus and in a ferocious jungle of the grass i found the distraction that meant peace now in the night i wanted old harbor and the place where an inevitable world of cycles of life and time and of tide could smooth my raggedness i walked quickly to the high street and only glanced across at my greencurtained store as i passed the foremaster in front of the fire station fat willie sat in the police car red of face and sweating like a pig you on the prowl again eth yep terrible sad about danny taylor nice fella terrible i said and hurried on a few cars cruised about building a breeze but there were no strollers no one risked the sweat of walking i turned at the monument and walked toward old harbor and saw the anchor lights of a few yachts and offshore fishing craft then i saw a figure turn out of porlock street and come toward me and i knew by walk and posture it was margie younghunt she stopped in front of me gave me no chance of passing some women can look cool on a hot night perhaps it was the breezy movement of her cotton skirt she said i guess youre looking for me she replaced a strand of hair that wasnt out of place why do you say that she turned and took my arm and with her fingers urged me to walk on thats the kind i get i was in the foremaster i saw you go by and i thought you might be looking for me so i whipped around the block and intercepted you howd you know which way i would turn i dont know i knew listen to the cicadasthats more hot weather and no wind dont worry ethan well be out of the light in a moment you can come to my place if you want ill give you a drinka tall cold drink from a tall hot woman i let

arent very brave and wish they were if you saw one youll know what i mean remember after all the cape work when the bull tries to kill something that isnt there yes remember how he gets confused and uneasy sometimes just stands and looks for an answer well then they have to give him a horse or his heart will break he has to get his horns into something solid or his spirit dies well im that horse and thats the kind of men i get confused and puzzled if they can get a horn into me thats a little triumph then they can go back to muleta and espada muleta and espada a muleta is a red cloth attached to a stick used by matadors an espada is a matadors sword margie just a moment im trying to find my key smell the honeysuckle but ive just had a triumph you have hooked a capetrampled it how do you

him the part of a man a woman can know sometimes thats the best part but not often it was with danny he trusted me the room was a memory album of other rooms bits and pieces of other lives like footnotes the fan at the window made a small whispering roar she came back soon in long loose billowing blue and brought a cloud of scent when i breathed it in she said dont worry its a cologne mary has never smelled on me heres a drinkgin and tonic i rubbed the glass with tonic its gin just gin if you rattle the ice youll think its cool i drank it down like beer and felt its dry heat reach out over my shoulders and down my arms so that my skin shimmered i guess you needed that she said i guess so ill make a brave bull of youenough resistance so youll think you have a triumph thats what a bull needs i stared at my hands crisscrossed with scratches and tiny cuts from opening boxes and my nails not too clean she took the ivory stick from the couch where i had dropped it i hope you dont need this for your drooping passion are you my enemy now me new baytowns playmate your enemy i was silent so long that i could feel her growing restless take your time she said youve got all your life to answer ill get you a drink i took the full glass from her and my lips and mouth were so dry i had to sip from it before i could speak and when i did my throat wore a husk what do you want i might have settled for love from a man who loves his wife mary you dont even know her i know shes tender and sweet and kind of helpless helpless shes tough as a boot shell go right on long after youve rattled your engine to pieces shes like a gull that uses the wind to stay aloft and never beats a wing thats not true comes a big trouble shell breeze through while you burn up what do you want arent you going to make a pass arent you going to beat out your hatred with your hips on good old margie i set my halfemptied glass down on a side table and quick as a snake she lifted it and put an ash

twenty years i havent done a lick of work except pick up a few presents from admirers doesnt seem like twenty years but it is im not a good little kid any more she went to her little kitchen and brought three ice cubes in her hand dumped them into her glass and sloshed gin over them the muttering fan brought in the smell of sea flats exposed by the dropping tide she said softly youre going to make a lot of money ethan you know about the deal some of the noblest romans of them all are creepers go on she made a sweeping gesture with her hand and her glass went flying the ice cubes bounced

pavement and punctuated my wondering about why i told joey that she wouldnt talk that would spoil her game she had to keep the pin in her hand grenade i dont know why i could see the chrysler standing at the curb by the old hawley house when i turned into elm street from the high but it was more like a hearse than a freight car black but not gleaming by reason of the droplets of rain and the greasy splash that rises from the highways it carried frosted parking lights it must have been very late no lights shone from the sleeping houses on elm street i was wet and i must somewhere have stepped in a puddle my shoes made a juicy squidging sound as i walked i saw a man in a chauffeurs cap through the musty windshield i stopped beside the monster car and rapped with my knuckles on the glass and the window slid down with an electric whine i felt the unnatural climate of airconditioning on my face im ethan hawley are you looking for me i saw teeth in the dimnessgleaming teeth picked out by our street light the door sprang open of itself and a lean welltailored man stepped out im dunscombe brock and schwin television branch i have to talk to you he looked toward the driver not here can we go inside i guess so i think everyones asleep if you talk quietly he followed me up our walk of flagstones set in the spongy lawn the night light was burning in the hall as we went in i put the narwhal

strike for a wage raise no just go away nowplease well work something out im sure you will i let him out and sat down again and turned out the light and sat listening to my house it thudded like a heart and maybe it was my heart and a rustling old house i thought to go to the cabinet and take the talisman in my handhad stood up to get it i heard a crunching sound and a whinny like a frightened colt and quick steps in the hall and silence my shoes squidged on the stairs i went in to ellens room and switched on the light she was balled up under a sheet her head under her pillow when i tried to lift the pillow she clung to it and i had to yank it away a line of blood ran from the corner of her mouth i slipped in the bathroom i see are you badly hurt i dont think so in other words its none of my business i didnt want him to go to jail allen was sitting on the edge of his bed naked except for jockey shorts his eyesthey made me think of a mouse in a corner ready at last to fight a broom

that dont you read the papers everybody right up to the topjust read the papers you get to feeling holy just read the papers i bet you took some in your time because they all do im not going to take the rap for everybody i dont care about anything except that stinking sneak mary awakens slowly but she was awake perhaps she hadnt been asleep she was in ellens room sitting on the edge of the bed the street light made her plain enough with shadows of leaves moving on her face she was a rock a great granite rock set in a tide race it was true she was tough as a boot unmoving unyielding and safe will you be coming to bed ethan so she had been listening too not now my darling dear are you going out again yesto walk you need your sleep its still raining do you have to go yes theres a place i have to go there take your raincoat you forgot it before yes my darling i didnt kiss her then i couldnt with the balled and covered figure beside her but i touched her shoulder and i touched her face and she was tough as a boot i went to the bathroom for a moment for a package of razor blades i was in the hall reaching in the closet for a raincoat as mary wished when i heard a scuffle and a scramble and a rush and ellen flung herself at me grunting and snuffling she buried her bleeding nose against my breast and pinned my elbows down with encircling arms and her whole little body shook i took her by the forelock and pulled her head up under the hall night light take me with you silly i cant but if youll come in the kitchen ill wash your face take me with you youre not coming back what do you mean skookum of course im coming back im always coming back you go up to bed and rest then youll feel better you wont take me where im going they wouldnt let you in do you want to stand outside in your nightgown you cant she grappled me again and her hands caressed and stroked my arms my sides dug her balled fists into my side pockets so that i was afraid she might find the razor blades she was always a caressing girl a stroking girl and a surprising girl suddenly she released me and stood back with her head raised and her eyes level and without tears i kissed her dirty little cheek and felt the dried blood against my mouth and then i turned to the door dont you want your stick no ellen not tonight go to bed darling go to bed i ran away fast i guess i ran away from her and from mary i could hear mary coming down the stairs with measured steps chapter twentytwo the tide was on the rise i waded into the warm bay water and clambered into the place a slow ground swell moved in and out of the entrance flowed through my trousers the fat billfold in my hip pocket swelled against my hip and then grew thinner under my weight as it watersoaked the summer sea was crowded with little jellyfish the size of gooseberries dangling their tendrils and their nettle cells as they washed in against my legs and belly i felt them sting like small bitter fires and the slow wave breathed in and out of the place the rain was only a thin mist now and it accumulated all the stars and town lamps and spread them evenlya dark pewtercolored sheen i could see the third rock but from the place it did not line up with the point over the sunken keel of the belleadair a stronger wave lifted my legs and made them feel free and separate from me and an eager wind sprang from nowhere and drove the mist like sheep then i could see a starlate rising too late rising over the edge some kind of craft came chugging in a craft with sail by the slow solemn sound of her engine i saw her mast light over the toothy tumble of the breakwater but her red and green were below my range of sight my skin blazed under the lances of the jellyfish i heard an anchor plunge and the mast light went out marullos light still burned and old capns light and aunt deborahs light it isnt true that theres a community of light a bonfire of the world everyone carries his own his lonely own a rustling school of tiny feeding fish flicked along the shore my light is out theres nothing blacker than a wick inward i said i want to go homeno not home to the other side of home where the lights are given its so much darker when a light goes out than it would have been if it had never shone its so much darker when a light goes out shone the typescript of the novel ends with this sentence the rest of the book is a handwritten addition the world is full of dark derelicts the better waythe marulli of that old rome would have known itthere comes a time for decent honorable retirement not dramatic not punishment of self or familyjust goodby a warm bath and an opened vein a warm sea and a razor blade the ground swell on the rising tide whished into the place and raised my legs and hips and swung them to the side and carried my wet folded raincoat out with it i rolled on one hip and reached in my side pocket for my razor blades and i felt the lump then in wonder i remembered the caressing stroking hands of the lightbearer for a moment it resisted coming out of my wet pocket then in my hand it gathered every bit of light there was and seemed reddark red a surge of wave pushed me against the very back of the place and the tempo of the sea speeded up i had to fight the water to get out and i had to get out i rolled and scrambled and splashed chest deep in the surf and the brisking waves pushed me against the old sea wall i had to get backhad to return the talisman to its new owner else another light might go out end and i hope this time its clear i really do hope so js the typescript and handwritten

greek design the stars incline they do not command in latin astra inclinant non necessitant a common elizabethan astrological notion im going to make our fortune what steinbeck wrote in sea of cortez provides a gloss to ethans decision and to the ethical issues of this novel there is a strange duality in the human which makes for an ethical paradox we have definitions of good qualities and of bad not changing things but generally considered good and bad throughout the ages and throughout the species of the good we think always of wisdom tolerance kindliness generosity humility and the qualities of cruelty greed selfinterest graspingness and rapacity are universally considered undesirable and yet in our structure of society the socalled and considered good qualities are invariable concomitants of failure while the bad ones are the cornerstones of success perhaps no other animal is so torn between alternatives man might be described fairly adequately if simply as a twolegged
