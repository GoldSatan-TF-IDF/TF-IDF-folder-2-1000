marion lennox the surgeons family miracle dear reader i love setting my books in the farming community where i was raised but sometimes i worry im in a rut so this time i decided to write outside the square the surgeons family miracle was therefore supposed to be a dramatic romance set against the exotic loveliness of a pacific island with nary a cow in sight and so it isfor half the book but halfway through i got homesick so doctors ben and lily ended upyou guessed itflying back to bens farm in australia to conclude their very satisfactory romance in the long run they do end up on their gorgeous pacific island but their farming community comes with them i have a fabulous time writing books of the heart and im also delighted and relieved that you seem to love my country settings my family rolls its eyes when i tell them farmings romanticbut romance is where you find it no just look under the next cow pat happy reading marion prologue lily stared at the thin blue line in consternation her plane ticket was right beside her on the bed in three hours shed be flying back to kapua her pacific island home and from now on she and ben would be nothing but friends she was pregnant she gazed at herself in the mirror horror building theyd been so careful for the past four years but last week shed had a tummy bug and this week knowing she might never see him again well the only sure contraceptive was abstinence and how could she bear to be apart if this final week was all she had she was having bens baby she needed to tell him the thought made her blench hed hate it she knew how much hed hate it ben who held himself aloof who backed away at the first sign of needhow could he be a father maybe the biggest reason hed let himself be drawn into their relationship had been that at the end of four years hed known she had to go home she loved him with all her heart she closed her eyes overwhelmed with panic how could she leave him knowing she was carrying his child how could she leave him at all he wouldnt let her leave if he knew she was pregnant she knew that about him he might hold himself apart he might admit he needed no one but her lovely ben was an honourable man hed suffered a desperately lonely childhood himself and to have a child grow up without a father he wouldnt do it but neither could he love a child she thought bleakly he didnt know what loving was theyd been together now for almost all their medical training and for all that time her loving had been a oneway deal oh she couldnt complain ben had been honest with her from the start lily i love you as much as ill ever love a woman but i dont want a permanent relationship hed spelt it out repeatedly making sure shed understood this time together is great but as soon as we finish medical school i need to go and see the world but now ben would feel the same about abortion as she did she thought but anything else shed seen the flare of panic whenever shed come close to admitting she needed him and a child would make no difference or maybe it would make him decide to marry her she thought bleakly and that would be worse than loneliness hed be trapped by his own sense of decency the clock ticked on she should be packing ben didnt need her she told herself he didnt need anyone and back home in kapua her fellow islanders truly did she continued staring into the mirror thinking of the girl shed been ten minutes ago and the woman shed suddenly become she was a woman with obligations kapua her island home since she was eight years old had never had a doctor islanders were dying because of it but lily had excelled at school and shed been desperate to study medicine somehow the islanders had supported that wish kapuas economy was subsistence level which meant the islanders decision to fund her medical training had been huge her family and neighbours had gone without basic necessities to give herand themselvesthis chance the further her training had progressed the more the islanders anticipation had built their telephone calls over the last few months had been jubilant theyd built a hospital because they knew she was coming she was qualified the island would have its first doctor she was carrying bens child appalled she let the test strip fall and her hand dropped to her waistline she was feeling for a pregnancy that was hardly there this was so new so tiny a fragment of human life pregnancy didnt always end in a live birth she thought trying not to cry to tell ben now impossible he was off at the end of this week on his first mission with the armed forces hed react with forcefulness she thought hed decide on marriage hed organise a date for a wedding during his first leave but if she leftas she had to leavehe wouldnt follow she thought bleakly shed tried so hard to persuade him to visit her island but hed reacted with incomprehension the islanders were her family how could that be he didnt know what a family was family yes the islanders were her family theyd love this child to bits she thought ben would see a child as nothing more than chains she was rocking back and forth now distressed beyond measure how could she tell him if she told him then hed insist on marriage and how could she refuse him but how could she not go home so tell him and go anyway she told her reflection im not brave enough there were footsteps on the outside stairs the door was flung open and ben was there her lovely ben big and strong and tanned and laughing for the sheer joy of living the father of her child lily theyve accepted me into sas training he said before she could say a word and he was across the room lifting her swinging her round and round in his excitement its the crack army assault teamthe best in the world youll be off saving your little island but ill be seeing the world he spun her round and round until she felt dizzy and when he finally set her on her feet she had no choice but to lean against him to feel the strength of him one last time sweetheart weve each achieved our dream he said and she could tell that his thoughts were already off in the exciting future where she played no part ill miss you like hell my love ill miss you she managed but only just will you he cupped her chin forcing her to look at him but his eyes were alive with excitement and he didnt see the change in hers i cant understand how you can want to go back to such a place as kapua he said when the whole world is yours the island is my world he nodded i guess he said hugging her against him i guess were both driven but in different directions but i wish we could share no you dont she whispered but so softly he didnt hear she whispered it from her heart to his you dont wish we could share my love youre my darling ben blaydenwho walks alone chapter one isnt kapua where lily cyprano lives ben was running to a tight schedule and he sighed as sam hopper joined him sam was a skilled surgeon but he talked too much the first chinook was leaving in an hour normally the adrenalin was kicking in by now making him move with lightning speed but lately hell what did it mean when preparation for disaster seemed routine what he asked without looking up and sam poured himself coffee and hiked his frame onto the bench where ben was sorting drugs lily he repeated patiently cute as a button half islander half french we all thought she looked like audrey hepburn only curvier sexiest thing on two legs she went through med school then went home to work on the little island where shed been raised wasnt that kapua he paused sorting old memories hey werent you two an item i was a couple of years above you but i seem to remember im right arent i bens hands stilled for a momentjust for a momenta surge of remembered pain washed through him lily then he regrouped were talking about seven years ago he snapped the trivia you keep in that tiny mind of yours but kapua is lilys island yeah ben said remembering hed been so caught up in the urgency of the job that until now he hadnt thought of the link between kapua and lily but yes kapua was definitely the place lily called home is she still there how would i know i havent heard from her for years itd be a joke if she was among the insurgents a great joke he said dryly starting to pack again they were moving fast news had hit that morning of an insurgent attack in kapua the islanders needed help desperately kapua was the biggest of a small group of pacific islands its population was an interracial mix of the original polynesians and the spaniards whod decided to colonise the place centuries ago there was little sign of that colonisation now the spaniards had obviously decided the polynesian lifestyle suited them much better than their own and the islands laidback lifestyle continued to this day but things were changing ignored by the rest of the world for centuries the island had recently been made more interesting to other countries by the discovery of oil the islands rulers had shown minimal interest in selling it to sell the oil could change their lifestyle but it would leave their descendants without resources when it was finished the islanders had therefore decided to make the oil last maybe a hundred years or more and so far theyd sold nothing that decision seemed to suit most islanders but greed did dreadful things it took few brains to guess that the insurgents whod stormed the capital would be interested in only one thingoil money its just as well the island has big friends sam said moving on and ben nodded the call for help had been frantic the insurgents had blasted their way into kapuas council compound and there were reports of deaths and chaos across the island this wasnt a political takeover where oil wealth would be shared among the whole population the opinion of those who knew was that this would be a group with outside backingbacking that could potentially cause instability in the entire pacific region with such destructionwith human loss and chaosthere was little choice for kapuas political allies troops were therefore flying in immediately among them would be lieutenant ben blayden md shes probably forgotten me he thought grimly whats the bet shell be a fat island mama by now with six or seven kids that thought made him smile domesticity would have made lily happy all through her medical training shed ached to be home my islands family to me shed told him come and see what its like not him he was in too much of a hurry to get where he wanted and he wanted action the thought of settling on a remote island and raising children made him shudder but lily lily was great he told sam she was a goodlooking lady look her up when you get there pop in and make a social call during the gunfire maybe its not as serious as reported sam said optimistically maybe you can persuade the nasty men to put away their guns pour margueritas for everyone and go lie on the beach as if you never know sam said yawning but at least itll be action see if you can find a few bodies that need sewing up nice interesting cases ill be there in a flash you want to take my place after you persuade the boys to put their guns away sam said grinning youre the frontline doctor not me i cant find benjy lily was making her way through the crowded hospital terror making her numb all around her were people who needed her the criminals whod taken over the compound had shot indiscriminately seeming to relish the destruction they were creating the death count at the moment stood at twenty but there were scores of injured scores of people lily should be caring for right now but benjy at first sign of trouble when kapuas finance councillor had stumbled through lilys front door that morning clutching her bloodied arm lily had told benjy to run to kiras house kira was lilys greataunt a loving gentle lady who was like a grandmother to benjy she lived well away from the town centre in an islandstyle bure by the beach benjy would be safe there lily had thought as shed worked her way through the chaos of that morning then at midday an elderly man had stumbled into the hospital weeping kiras neighbour kira the man had wept kira somehow lily had finished treating an islander shed been working on a bullet had penetrated the mans thigh causing massive tissue damage hed need further surgery but for the moment the bleeding had been controlled as soon as shed been able to step away from the table shed run to find that kiras hut had been burned to find kira dead and to find no sign of her son shed stood on the beach and looked at the carnage and felt sick to the stomach dear god where was her little boy nowhere by the time she returned to the hospital she was shaking so badly that her chief nurse took control holding her arms in his broad hands and giving her a gentle shake what do you mean you cant find benjy isnt he with kira kiras dead shot in the back pieter that kind loving old lady and benjys gone theres no one on the beach at all her breath caught on a sob of terror where would he have gone why isnt he here she was close to collapse and the big islander pushed her into a chair knelt before her and took both her hands in his maybe hes with jacques i dont know where jacques is either oh god if hes she buried her face in her hands but pieter was hauling her hands down meeting her gaze head on he was the islands most senior nurse sixty or so big and gentle and as patient as any man shed met the look of fear in his eyes now made her more terrified than shed been in her life if pieter was scared but he had himself more together than she did so benjys probably with jacques he told her or hell be hiding its a good sign lily benjys the most sensible sixyearold i know if we look for him or for jacques itll only jeopardise us all you were crazy to have left the hospital yourself he hesitated then but they had to face facts im sorry but you need to block benjy out lily youre our only doctor and we need you trust jacques to take care of him for now benjys on his own and so are we it was dusk as the chinook carrying ben hovered over the northern beach its searchlights illuminating the sweep of sand while they assessed whether it was safe to land we have the north beach secured theyd been told on a shaky radio connection by a deputy head of council whod seemed to be having trouble speaking they dont seem to be near and the hospitals ours thats all a problem with an idyllic island existence thought ben grimly was that it left everyone exposed to the nasties of this world life in paradise is all very well if everyone feels that way the majority of islanders hadnt owned guns theyd never dreamed of needing them and it had left the way for the few to run riot a burst of gunfire came from their left and the pilot swung the chinook round so the floodlights pierced the forest thats ms the sergeant sitting beside ben told them i recognise the firing pattern they sound too far away to be accurate reports are that most of these guys were already on the ground were therefore acting on the assumption that they wont have highcalibre weapons theyll give us trouble on the ground but if thats all they have i say land ok were going in the pilot said you know your job guys lets go pieter had personally brought another two units of plasma into the operating theatre he was needed outside lily knew but she also knew he was treating her as a patienta patient who he needed to stay on her feet the woman under her hands was the islands housing councillor the wound to her chest was deep and ugly it was a miracle the shot had missed her heart all lilys attention had to be on her but pieter knew that she needed at least some hope he was giving it to her now friendly troops are landing on fringe beach he said a couple of new patients have come in from the rainforest and they saw them land weve radioed for help and its come lily was hardly listening benjy she was whispering over and over again benjy how many one of the theatre nurses asked and lily focused enough to hear terror in her voice that matched her own any minute now the few armed men they had could be subdued the insurgents could take this place over and outside somewhere in this island was her sixyearold son three helicopters so far lily could feel a tiny lessening of terror in the theatre staff at the news outside help these men are cowards pieter said into the stillness theyve left this place alone because they know we have guns here theyll shoot us but they wont risk being shot themselves they wont have counted on outside help so soon im guessing they hoped to bring more military suppliesmaybe more menonto the island before that if theyre not already here if they had full military capability theyd have shot down the helicopters pieter said soundly and lily thought benjy benjy benjy many of the islanders are hiding pieter added glancing at her long may they stay hidden benjy is there any news from the council compound a nurse asked and lily clamped off a blood vessel and waited for the site to be swabbed she felt sick we dont know whats happened there pieter said all we know is that those who ran from the building were shot were those inside shot too who would know pieter said heavily theres no access anyone who goes near the place is met with gunfire he handed over the plasma glanced at lily to see if she was okwas anyone ok just nowand turned away there are three more urgent cases he told lily dully hand over here as soon as you can she worked all that night and into the next morning blocking out everything but medical imperatives or she almost blocked out everything there was so much need they needed a dozen doctors and there was only her she worked like an automaton her silent plea a background throbbing that could never stop benjy benjy benjy you need to sleep pieter told her at four in the morning and she shook her head how can i sleep i feel the same but were no good to anyone if we collapse were good until we collapse lily said bleakly turning to the next stretcher a burst of gunfire in the distance made her wince thats the way its going to be it was almost dawn there were two platoons with full military and medical gear on the ground now brought in under cover of darkness crack sas troops with more on the way how can they hope to have had a successful coup ben demanded he was treating a corporal whod been hit in the face a bullet aimed at him had hit a tree and sheared off what had essentially been an arrow the mans face was grazed and once the splinter was out hed be fine if this was the extent of their casualties theyd be lucky the guess is that theyd never expect us to act this quickly the corporal told him first rule of warfarenever mess with a country who shares our passion for cricket the man left and ben rechecked his gear as soon as the island was secured they could search for wounded but for now when the road into the township was still under insurgent hands there was time to think about lily ever since sams comment yesterday shed been drifting in and out of his mind at such a time with her medical training she had to be at the hospital when could they reach the hospital he worked on sorting gear so that when they moved into the township the urgent stuff could be moved first and he wouldnt be left without imperative supplies his job was partly about good medicine but it was also a lot about good organisation hey doc weve got the road clear a voice called and he turned to see a corporal emerge from the shadows graham was a sometime paramedic depending on need ive just been talking to the big boys he said were heading for the hospital now it seems to have become a refuge the locals weve found are saying theres been a recent drug problem on the island so the hospital orderlies have been trained to be security guards the first insurgents got a reception of gunfire and theyve left the place alone thats where our initial radio report came from and were in contact with the radio operator now hes telling us its safe to come in lily ben thought she wasnt necessarily at the hospital he told himself she could be anywhere he glanced across at the few canvasshrouded figures on the beach she could even be dont go there dawn she was still operating but without much hope they were out of plasma low on everything and the child under her hands had lost so much blood that she almost hadnt started operating but therein lay defeat and somewhere in the back of her exhausted mind lay a cold fury that had grown so great that if any of the insurgents had been close to her scalpel right this minute they would have feared for their lives the boy she was operating onhenriwas a friend of benjys three nights ago shed made pizza for the pair of them and theyd watched a silly movie she in the middle of the settee with a little boy at either side henri had been with his father on the beach where kira had been killed henris father had fled with the wounded boy into the rainforest and had waited far too long before he dared bring the boy for treatment benjy and henri im sorry i didnt see what happened to benjy henris father had told her but all his attention had been on his son and lilys must be too the wound on henris thigh was massive tissue torn clear and jagged fragments of bone embedded in what remained it was well beyond lilys area of expertise she was sweating as she worked and as she looked at the heart monitor and saw that she was failing she knew tears were mixing with the sweat damn them damn them damn them damn them then the door slammed open the theatre staff jerked to attention in truth theyd spent the last twenty four hours expecting gunmen to burst in and these were gunmenbut they were dressed in khaki uniforms she recognised friends keep still everyone drawled a voice as armed men pointed machineguns and the officer in command assessed what was before him checking that the place wasnt an insurgent stronghold but here was no disguising that a very real operation was taking place there was also no disguising that they were operating on a child the officer in charge made a lightning assessment and obviously decided this was no place for warfare whos in charge he said and lily checked the monitor winced again and managed to reply im operating this child is critical we have to continue what do you need doctor he asked and her heart which had almost stopped beating started to thump again plasma she said and she made no attempt to disguise the desperation in her voice now and help if you have anyone with medical training right this was a man of few words and plenty of action and lily blessed him for it everyone out except theatre staff lets keep this place as aseptic as possible someone find the medical supplies now and get ben in here pronto the machineguns disappeared lily turned her attention to the wound again as the door slammed open once more plasmas on its way a voice said im a doctor do you want me to scrub she didnt look up she couldnt yes please she managed and the man hauled off his outer uniform let it fall to the floor and crossed to the sinks lilys exhausted pieter told him shes been operating for almost twentyfour hours and her hands are shaking thats what im here for the voice said more medics are on their way but im the forerunner im a lieutenant in the sas and i have surgical training what do you want me to do ben lily whispered and she lifted her hands clear her fingers were trembling so much she couldnt go on doctor pieter said urgently and magically ben was there lifting the clamps from lilys fingers and checking the monitor get that plasma here now he roared in a voice that could be heard in the middle of next week he glanced at pieter who was acting as anaesthetist are you a doctor im a nurse with the basic training lilys taught me im pieter then lily you take over the anaesthetic ben snapped pieter no offence but of course theres no offence pieter said motioning to lily to take over if you knew how pleased i am to leave this to you guys i can imagine ben said and fixed his gaze on lily forcing her to steady you can do this he said she took a deep breath i can right he snapped dont you dare collapse theres no time lets get this kid out of danger and worry about everything else later ben was there she was so exhausted she could hardly think but the knowledge settled in her heart and stayed it made her feelnot better but somehow less hopeless which was crazy it was ridiculous to think that ben blayden could make all right with her world though hed thought so from the start he was loud and bossy and sure that his way was right there are no easy answers shed told him at the end of med school theyd been discussing their future but theyd already accepted their future didnt involve each other of course there are easy answers you follow your vocation and you dont get distracted hed said and shed wanted to agree with him but she hadnt been able to she had already been distracted and now here he was again just as distracting she could hardly see him under his mask and theatre cap but shed glimpsed enough to see that hed hardly changed still with that mass of jetblack curls that always looked unruly that always looked supremely sexy still with those deep brown eyes creased at the edges from constant laughter still with that body that said he worked hard and he played hard strongly physical ben was just who they needed right now hed always been just who she needed blood pressure he snapped and she responded fast the medical side of her working once more on automatic seventy on fortyfive were clamping this and waiting he snapped theres muck further down but to clear it involves further blood loss we have to get that pressure up first muck further down shed never intended to clear it the bullet that had smashed into henri had obviously blasted though wood first as there were shards of splintered timber in the wound shed decided her only option was to get the bleeding vessels clamped and the wound closed then hope like hell they could get him off the island to a competent surgeon before the wound festered now here was ben saying lets take our time lets use the plasma get his blood pressure up and get this wound properly cleaned the tiny frisson of hope built both for henri and for them all he wouldnt operate this way unless he knew that things werent hopeless outside she thought he wasnt closing fast and moving on to the next disaster right she firmed and made her tired mind find its third or fourth or maybe its twentieth wind she could do this thank you ben she whispered and he flashed her a look of concern she looked away she didnt need sympathy now if he said just one word her world could collapse she thought dear god where was benjy now that henris blood pressure was rising ben worked swiftly knowing the anaesthetic itself was a strain on this desperately injured child but now they had plasma he thought hed make it the child was strong and otherwise healthy and lily had done the hard part lily this was no contented mama with six or seven babies he glanced along the table to where she stood at henris head all he could see of her was her eyes they were the same eyes hed fallen hard for more than ten years before when they had still been kids at university but theyd changed she seemed haunted she looked exhausted beyond all limits exhausted by something that went beyond this present drama if hed had another doctor hed have ordered her away from the table even if she wanted to work having such an exhausted colleague had its own risks but the rest of the medical team wasnt flying in until they were sure it was safe to do so ben was the forerunner sent to deal with frontline casualties and thered be no more medics here for the next few hours so he worked on and lily watched henris obs like a hawk and monitored the anaesthetic as if shed been trained to the job shed been practising here for seven years ben thought shed been a lone doctor here for seven years shed need so many skills shed fall over if he didnt hurry im closing now he said at last and saw lilys shoulders sag under her theatre gown was it just exhaustion before i came here i did a rough check of the wards he told her trying to alleviate a terror he only sensed unless more have come in theres nothing else urgent the rest of my medical team will probably be here in the next few hours why dont i take over and you guys get some sleep we wont sleep pieter said gruffly speaking for them all we dont know whats gone on outside until we know whats happened to the rest of the islanders therell be no sleep for anyone lily was reversing the anaesthetic henri coughed and gagged his way into consciousness and as soon as he did so she stepped away from the table i need to go stay ben said urgently i need to talk to you theres no outstanding surgery not as far as i know but im sorry ben she faltered looking down at henri maybe she was thinking she should stay but her gaze moved to ben and her shoulders straightened i have to go now please look after him pieter will you talk to his father of course we will pieter said and he put his hands on lilys shoulders and propelled her out of the room you go he said and find him safe who was she worried about he couldnt follow it was a complex wound and dressing it took time then he worked out antibiotic doses and started them running through the drip then the moment he walked out the door he was clutched by a man who turned out to be henris father is he hell be fine ben said gently as im sure lily told you you can see him in a minute just take that shirt off first will you he grimaced at the gore over the mans clothes hed carried his desperately injured son to the hospital and it showed youll scare henri into a relapse if he sees you like that then as the mans terror didnt fade he took him by the arm and led him into the theatre henri was still coming round there were tubes going everywhere but his breathing was strong and steady and colour was seeping back into his face hes not quite awake ben said change your shirt and you can sit with him while he wakes his mother the man muttered ben thought uhoh and braced himself for another tragedy but it seemed none was coming his mothers in sydney he whispered my daughters won a scholarship to boarding school there our daughters very clever you know shes fourteen and shes he broke off and buried his face in his hands let me give you something to help the trembling ben said even though all he wanted to do right now was find lily i want we all want mate ben said softly lets just do what comes next what came nexttreating him for shock and dressing a jagged cut across his elbow that the man hadnt noticed until ben helped him off with his shirttook time then just as hed settled henris dad into a chair by henris bedside and wondered whod sleep the deepest a private came to find him one of our mens got a flash burn to the arm he told him theyre chucking out molotov cocktails and he got hit from where from that place they call the council compound he shrugged were mopping up nowthere doesnt seem to be any aggressive fire from anywhere else on the island except from there paul was just real unlucky to be hit so whats happening ben asked did our guys storm the place dunno about that the private told him leading the way back to his friend with the burns theyre saying there are hostages the sergeant reckons when they saw how many of us had arrived they took fright grabbed as many people as they could and barricaded themselves in the powers that be have had us fall back out of range my mate heres the last one injured we sit and wait sarge reckons theyd reached his mate now a lanky corporal with an arm that was blistered and raw ouch ben said youve been playing with matches the corporal gave him a sickly grin and ben looked round to find pieter anyone to prepare him a syringe of morphine pieter appeared as if hed known he was being looked for his face though was more grim than the last time ben had seen it whats up he asked i hope not much pieter said my wife and daughters are ok word is that orders being restored except at the council compound do we know how many people are in there i have no idea pieter said brusquely lilys gone to find out lily ben frowned she might be needed here if shes anywhere else she ought to be asleep you cant expect that of her pieter said her sons missing and her fiancé theyve been missing for twentyfour hours now and lilys going out of her mind chapter two he was caught for the next few hours at mid morning the roads were declared open a no go area was declared around the complex of buildings called the council compounda series of bungalows surrounding a palm filled conclave used for island gatherings here the insurgents had holed up there was no clear idea how many were there or who was insurgent and who was hostage but a cursory sweep had now been made of the entire island the insurgents were either laying down their arms and declaring this had been a mistake or they were with their comrades in the compound it had surely been a mistake ben thought grimly as more injured made their way to the hospital where was lily he couldnt leave the hospital at midday a plane landed on the islands small airstrip bringing bens colleaguespeople like sam who relished trauma surgery bens role was hands on if necessary but it was mostly organisational getting on the ground first assessing what was needed doing handson treatment in the first few hours but then handing over to those more qualified in various specialties these guys were good and their arrival meant he could often stand aside not today there was too much to be done there was a sports oval beside the islands hospital the hospital was tiny totally inadequate to cope with the influx of wounded four hours after the arrival of his team and equipment ben had a massive field hospital erected as an annexe operating theatres a triage centre ward beds theyd erected this hospital before and his team knew their stuff as well as the hospital itself there was the need to organise supplies was there enough plasma were there enough body bags would he ever get used to this ben wondered as he worked on into the afternoon these were lilys people where was she every time anyone approached he looked up hoping it was her shed be aware that she was no longer desperately needed shed be searching for her son and for her fiancé her son and her fiancé well hed expected her to be married with babies why did those two words have the capacity to make him feel as if hed been kicked it was only because he didnt know where she was he told himself as the day progressed it was only because he couldnt help her he was helping her now doing her work for her he wanted quite desperately to find her finally as dusk was falling the bulk of the organisational work had been done and the urgent cases had been treated it was time to hand over sam was available to take charge im taking some sleep he told sam and sam looked down to where ben was changing his theatre slippers for military boots sleeping quarters for med staff are right through the canvas sam said cautiously youre expecting to die with your boots on theres no threat so youre putting your boots on why im taking a walk to take in the sights sam said smiling theyd worked together for a long time now and sam knew him well youve been on your feet since last night youre dropping where you stand but youre going for a walk no one knows where lily is sams smile faded our lily she was here when i first arrived ben said she was close to collapse when i arrived but her kids missing her kid sams brow creased what sort of kid how the hell would i know a kid kid pieterthe head nursetold me shes got a kid she cant find but pieters gone home and wont be back on duty till tomorrow i cant find anyone who knows where she is so im taking a look grab some men sam told him theres lurgies out in that dark forest he wasnt kidding there was rainforest everywhere who knew what rebels were still out there wanting to kill lily it was a dumb thought brought about by exhaustion but even so the thought wouldnt go away he felt sick ill be careful he told sam you want me to come with you and hold your hand youre afraid of the dark there is that sam said peaceably with just the faintest rueful grin to show ben wasnt far off the mark but for the gorgeous lilyill risk it look shes an old friend and shes in trouble ben said exasperated unless you have any more dumb comments youre holding me back off you go then sam said standing aside hed almost been laughing but as ben rose from lacing his boots sam put a hand on his shoulder there was a long line of grim reminders out the back of the hospital reminding them both just how serious this situation was find her he said dusk had given way to darkness when ben made it to the road leading to the compound hed been hailed three times on the way ben this ladys got a kid who got badly mosquito bitten while they were hiding ben i reckon im allergic to the water you got something to settle my stomach and finally the worst which was ben weve found another body you want to come and take a look before we shift it to the morgue it didnt make sense ben thought the insurgents had appeared at dawn and had stormed toward the compound shooting everything in their path if theyd hoped to achieve pandemonium and terror then theyd succeeded but in doing so theyd created a situation where the islanders allies had been forced to act immediately this reeked of fools work ben thought grimly and a hostage situation negotiating with fools was a nightmare where the hell was lily the question became a mantra running through his head over and over he asked everywhere the islanders all knew her but everywhere he asked he received headshakes her boy is missing and also her man we saw her earlier but shes no longer here he rounded the last corner to the roadblock before the compound here were the men and women he worked with stopping anyone fool enough to risk their lives by trying to get nearer there was someone in their midst a woman her voice raised i know some were hurt let me ask im a doctor theyll let me in please please i beg you lily and he knew his colleagues answer before he heard it first rule of hostage situationsdamage limitation however many were in there dont make it worse by sending more he saw lilys shoulders slump there was little light out hereall lights had been ordered offand she was just a dark shadow in the moonlight but he knew it was lily she was still in theatre garb she looked like lily lily he said and she looked up and saw who it was he saw the flash of recognition but he also saw the defeat despair and exhaustion lily he said again and reached her and held her and it was just as well ben she whispered and crumpled where she stood he carried her back to the hospital shed gone past protesting shed gone past anything but lying limply in his arms what had happened to his vision of lily as a fat mama with a brood of happy children he asked himself she was thinner even than he remembered she was only five feet four a woman of half french parentage and that parentage showed shed stood out from every other medical student in their course looking elegant and somehow right whatever she wore he gazed down at her now as they approached the hospital here well out of range of the hostagetakers lights were permitted on the roads and he could clearly see her features her jetblack curls were still cut into that elfin style hed loved tendrils clinging to her face making her audrey hepburn type features seem even lovelier than he remembered but this was a new lily a battered lily there was nothing elegant about the bloodstained jeans and tshirt and theatre overgown she was wearing dark smudges marred her lovely eyes there was a scratch across her cheek and shed bled a little she looked likelike lily why had he let her go that was a dumb question there had never been any thought of staying together he remembered they each had their own path in life and they hadnt coincided ben she managed rousing a little as he reached the entrance to the field hospital he kicked aside a canvas barrier and found a stretcherbed he set her down and her eyes widened as if shed suddenly remembered she had to do something i cant she whispered you can he said you have to rest its ok its not ok she tried to sit up and as he gently guided her back on the pillows she shoved her hands against his chest and pushed i need to you need to sleep lily he said firmly youve worked for thirtysix hours or more without a rest youre exhausted past the point of collapse i must you cant then will you do it for me she said wildly pleasefindben hed thought shed been talking about her son what was she talking about now im here he said but she was staring straight through him please ill look for your son he told her figuring she was verging on the delirious ill have the men start a search tell me about him how old is he she was focusing on the point where the canvas had been pulled aside to form a door as if she was expecting any minute that someone would appear hell be with jacques he must be jacques benjy she whispered and the effort shed made was too much and it was too much effort to hold her eyes open a moment longer my ben hes six years old she said defeated hes six years old and he looks like you his names benjy i called him after his father she slept just like that she faded sinking into a sleep that was almost unconsciousness ben stared down at her incredulous questions crowding his mind the silence stretched out he stared at lily as if staring could elicit information but of course it couldnt and the longer he stared the more questions formed a sixyearold boy called benjy could it be no theyd always been careful they had been medical students not a pair of uninformed teenagers she hadnt meant it he said that to himself thinking there were more bens than him in the world she could have been referring to anyone he thought suddenly of the last time hed seen lily seven years back hed been excited about the life ahead of him and hed thought shed been just as excited about returning here but at the last moment shed clung and wept and then closed her eyes and pushed him away thered been half an hour until her flight but go now shed whispered go lily i cant bear it if you stay ill break please go and suddenly finally he knew in his heart that what he was thinking was right somewhere in the chaos outside in the dark and frightening rainforest or worse in the midst of the hostage situation was a little boy who was his son i called him after his father he feltill there was nothing more for him to do here dazed he made his way back through the triage station to the entrance to the islands permanent hospital sam was sitting out on the steps smoking thatll kill you ben said but he said it almost automatically with no passion behind it and sam took a couple of drags on his cigarette and ground it out under his heel dont i know it but seeing i only smoke when i lose a patient im not likely to die any time soon damn the kid had been left too long another kid ben said and his heart missed a beat who it was suddenly hard to ask the question but it had to be asked not a sixyearold boy called benjy when sam shook his head his heart started again but only just a tenyearold girl called sophia sam said head injury she was hit with shrapnel we drilled a burrhole to try and alleviate pressure but she died under our hands he shifted his foot and stared at his stubbedout cigarette as if he regretted extinguishing it what were these bastards thinking he exploded this isnt like any sort of military coup ive ever seen they shot anything that moved kids women ive even seen a couple of shot dogs theyre mad ben agreed i dont like our chances of negotiating sam said morosely god help the hostages no ben hesitated and then sat down on the step beside sam sam cast him a look that was suddenly concerned and moved aside to give him room do we know how many are being held hostage sam asked and ben shook his head he was trying to think straight and it wasnt working i called him after his father i need to get a search party together he said and rose sam rose with him there are search parties from one end of the island to the other sam reminded him looking for injured islanders and rounding up anyone remotely connected to a gun why do you need another are you still looking for lily i found her he said her sons missing shes just passed out on meshes been operating for thirtysix hours straight and shes closer to being unconscious than asleep i promised id look for the kid a littlie sam asked concerned and ben took a deep breath knowing it had to be said knowing it had to be acknowledged a sixyearold boy he managed and took a deep breath to give him strength to say the next few words a sixyearold boy called benjy lily named him after his father the next few hours passed in a blur at headquarters the officers listened to bens storythe local doctors son was missing as was her fiancéa man called jacquesand they consulted lists were searching for them already the captain told him others have reported them missing jacques is the islands financial administrator his bungalows in the compound and he hasnt been seen since the uprising hes either a hostage or dead and dr lily told us about the little boy he was sent to the beach at the first sign of trouble but he would have found his greataunt dead and everyone gone maybe he was forcibly taken to the compound or more likely he didnt need to complete the sentence ive pulled the searchers back now well search again in the morning why not now you know why the captain said patiently there might still be armed men in hiding and ill not risk our team being picked off if i knew for sure the kid was there and alive then id risk it but i know no such thing and neither do you his voice softened hell ben you know the rules is this doctor putting pressure on you shes an old friend ben said heavily and shes been a hero here in the last two days shes performed medicine thatd put us to shame well comb the forest again at first light the captain promised ill double the contingent to that area i cant promise more than that and the hostage situation theres no communication the captain said grimly so we sit and wait for them to make the first move the last thing we need is another bloodbath theres nothing anyone can do for the moment im guessing the best thing for you to do is get some sleep the captain said studying his friends face and seeing a strain there hed never seen before hell ben its not like you to get personally involved its not is it ben said go to bed the captain said roughly concerned if theres any news ill let you know thanks and ben yeah this lady doctor mmm how well did you know her and there was suddenly a hint of an understanding smile behind the captains bland enquiry but ben didnt feel like smiling i knew her well enough but im going to bed he muttered just keep the lid on the hostage situation thats all i ask chapter three ben woke at dawn and five minutes later he was striding into the original hospital looking for lily for she was gone the first thing hed done had been to check her stretcherbed and the sight of its neatly folded blanket had made him feel ill hell hed slept six hours and hed needed that sleep shed had little more than that and shed had a lot more to catch up on wheres dr lily he snapped at the first person he saw it was pieter the big nurse assessed bens face and nodded as if he now understood something that had been worrying him youll be dr ben blayden yes i should have realised yesterday the nurse told him im afraid i wasnt thinking you should have realised what that youre our lilys ben that youre our benjys father it took the wind out of bens lungs so much so that he felt as if hed been punched after seven years where is she he managed and pieter shook his head troubled she came in here about four am i wasnt here one of your men said she should go back to sleep but i doubt she followed instructions her son is missing pieters voice softened if im not mistaken your son is missing ben flinched he stood stunned letting the words sink in last night thered been room for doubt lilys words had been almost incoherent the desperate words of a woman whod gone past the point of sense but now shes told you about me she told me that benjy was the son of a man she met at medical school that youd elected to be an emergency doctor with the sas that shed chosen to come home to raise your son alone because your worlds could never meet and then yesterdaywhile lily was scouring the island she went to my wife she sobbed to her that you were here and how could she tell you about a son when she didnt know if he was alive she never told me ben whispered trying to rid himself of this sense of unreality not sure whether he was angry or confused or justbereft he should be angry he thought the appropriate emotion should definitely be anger but bereft was winning he had a son where the hell was he shed only just learned she was pregnant when she came home pieter was saying watching his face this island is a very easy place to raise a child without a father in a sense were a huge family where parenting is done by all she wouldnt have seen the need he had it now anger in spades sweeping through him with a ferocity he found breathtaking she wouldnt have seen the need to tell me she didnt think i had the right to know she said you feared relationships pieter said but she also said you were a moral man whod want to do the right thing by your son she said her decision was not to load you with that responsibility but even you know lily and i have worked side by side for almost seven years pieter said reassuringly as if ben was a little unhinged and he had to settle him which maybe wasnt far from the truth im the cousin of her mother theres little about lily i dont know so she told you and she didnt tell me i believe she thought you wouldnt want to know pieter looked grave this is a conversation you should be having with lily but this is maybe not the time for considering feelings lilys in desperate trouble she needs all the help she can get where is she now the big mans face clouded i dont know maybe thats why im telling you this i should be out looking for her she should be here helping with our wounded as i need to be there are shoulds everywhere theres been no word about the hostages no and this jacques he will be fine that one pieter said and his expression grew even more grim he must be a hostage but if he ismaybe hell be the first one to talk his way out he is not an islander you understand jacques came here when the oil was found he helps us with our administration you dont like him hes not one of us and there it was ben thought grimly the reason lily had said she could never leave the island the islanders were family but even though jacques was an outsider lily had agreed to marry him he must have something if id come to her island maybe she would have married me he thought suddenly but it was a dumb thought hed never have wanted to come here and he had a lot more to think about right now than a sevenyearold romance that had gone astray ben a voice called from the end of the corridor and it was sam wearing theatre gear again yes theyve released three of the hostages he said or at least they opened the front doors and shoved them out each of them has gunshot wounds we need all hands in theatre and that means you which meant another six hours operating six hours where they somehow managed to stabilise the injured islanders but things have settled ben was told by the sergeant in charge when with surgery completed hed made his way to temporary headquarters weve done a comprehensive sweep of the island there are no more injured have you seen the island doctor lily the sergeant said yes shes working in the original hospital she knows you guys are thorough but most of the families want to talk to her he hesitated theyve had a succession of english teachers on the island and english is spoken by everyone but maybe if my kin had been shot id want my family doctor to talk me through it damn ben had just come from the field hospital which was next door to the original building he turned to leave but then he remembered it wasnt just lily he was concerned about the hostage situation were negotiating the sergeant told him they want transport out of here do we know whos in there ten islanders the most badly injured theyve tossed out ten fits with the number of islanders who remain missing we dont know how many rebels is lilys son there yes the sergeant said and ben felt suddenly lightheaded we know hes alive he demanded one of the injured men saw him yes and youve told lily she was here when we heard shed been everywhere on the island checking with each search team as they came in checking herself we were almost as glad as she was when we heard the kid was alive andjacques someone he ventured and there was a nod we assume so he wasnt seen by the guy we talked to but he said he heard him talking so theyre both safe and youll negotiate transport in exchange for the hostages we dont know yet the sergeant said these guys are dangerous we need to get permission from higher up the line our politicians are talking to the only people here who are fit to speak thats the deputy head of council and the finance councillor and theyre both still in a state of shock but the decision to negotiate isnt up to us it has to be you want to storm the place no but then the sergeant was watching him curiously sensing his tension this was the team sent in as a front line at every crisis and he knew ben well ben usually worked efficiently with little emotion he was emotional now he couldnt stop being emotional i need to talk to lily we need your written assessment by dusk the sergeant said mildly youll have it but the priority is lily he found her sitting outside the hospital under a group of palms in the hospital gardens there were three islanders with heran old woman and two children the old woman was keening her distress while the children looked on in incomprehension ben hesitated but then he walked close enough to listen lily glanced up as he approached he gave a slight shake of his head the hope that had flared in her eyes faded and she turned again to the old woman pulling her into her arms and hugging her close hush kira died instantly mary you know that my only sister lily didnt speak again she simply held her not hurrying waiting until the woman had sobbed the worst of her grief out waiting until she raised her head of her own accord waiting until she was ready to talk do you want help to look after the children she asked her at last i can find someone if you need to be alone the old woman glared and pulled away as if lily had said something obscene she put out her arms and the children a girl of about five and a boy of about three scooted in and were hugged tight theyll stay with me until their mother is well enough to care for them again or until their father can get here heres dr blayden hes here to help me with the injuries he helped operate on your mother last night kids hes a hero right when we need him the kids looked up at him doubtful looking for a reallife hero ben smiled and crossed to the little group squatting down beside them and delving in his pocket for sweets he carried them everywhere for just such an emergency as this tell me your names he said folding the sweets into their hands before they had a chance to draw back nicki the little girl whispered staring down at her lolly while the boy huddled behind his grandmother keeping his hand closed over the precious sweet and my brother is lanie is your mothers name louie yes i did help fix her last night he told them nicki and lanie were with their mother when the men came lily said briefly and ben thought lily knew what she was doing traumatised kids had to talk about what happened louie ran with them she ran to her mothers the bullet had pierced louies shoulder as shed run ben winced what sort of criminals shot at a mother fleeing with her children i think these men are very very bad and very very stupid he told the children but our soldiers have them all in one place now and they cant hurt anyone and your mother is getting better you can visit her now if you like i was just coming to tell them that lily said shell feel much better after shes seen you ben said and he smiled at the old lady and after shes seen her mother he delved back into his pocket and brought out six more sweets they were sold as traffic lights round flat shining discs red green and yellow choose one more each he told the children and then i want you to choose two each to take to your mother can you do that the children nodded and the old lady stood her face had cleared a little some of the horror fading my daughter truly will be well she truly will be well ben said and he and lily stood and watched as the little family bade them farewell and went to do their hospital visiting ben was left with lily she looked a thousand per cent better than the night before he thought shed showered and changed she was wearing a tiny denim skirt a tshirt and leather sandalshardly the attire of a doctor about to do her roundsbut he could see nothing amiss with it except that her legs were covered with scratches a couple of them were deep and nasty let me see to your legs he said and she gazed down as if wondering what he was talking about seeing the bloody scratches she merely shrugged theyll be fine trivial stuff not so trivial if they get infected i have more to worry about than infected legs maybe he said but legs come first you want to come voluntarily or do you want to be carried im a lieutenant you know i have authority in this place she managed a feeble smile id rather be bribed with sweets she said and he shoved a hand in his pocket and produced a handful eat one he said and she shook her head when did you last eat i cant remember then eat a sweet he told her ill bathe those legs and then youre going to be fed but dont argue dr cyprano as of last night your deputy head of council gave us authority in this place im therefore representing the occupying force and what i say goes you eat she opened her mouth to protest hed been unwrapping a sweet while hed talked and he popped it in no protests no sir she told him with a mouth full of red sweet or yes sir i dont know which he dressed her legs she stayed silent throughout which suited his mood there were things that had to be said but he didnt know where to start bathing her scratches applying antiseptic and dressing the worst of them gave him time to think it was as if he was getting used to her all over again she lay passively on an examination trolley while he worked she stared straight ahead seemingly oblivious when he had to scrub though he must have hurt her then he took her to the mess tent waved away anyone who would have talked to them sat her down and watched as she mechanically ate the pasta he brought her as she drank coffee and as she pushed her mug away and rose and said thank you very much i need to go now im coming with you unless there were new developments ben wasnt needed now in the hospital the uprising had been quelled so fast that maybe they could have managed with less manpower but the fact that theyd come fast and hard had maybe averted a greater tragedy he thought but for now there were enough medics to cope with medical needs there was no more organisation for ben to do he could stay by lilys side for she intended to go back to the roadblock in front of the compound he knew that without asking that was where negotiations were taking place if he had been lily that was where hed want to be and it was where he wanted to be for it was his son held hostage the concept was so overpowering he didnt know what to do with it but all he knew was that he needed to go with her the roadblock was half a mile from the hospital across the beach road it was midafternoon and the heat was getting to him lily was lightly dressed but ben was wearing fatigues and he was feeling it walk on the beach he suggested and lily diverted her footsteps without saying a word her silence was starting to scare him this wasnt the lily he remembered shed been bright bubbly fun and startlingly intelligent her professors had described her as smart as paint and more than one had said it was a shame she wasnt staying in australia to specialise but australias loss would be kapuas gain they had all known that and shed never questioned her destiny he hadnt questioned her destiny either lily we need to talk he said as they walked through the fringe of coconut palms to the beach beyond what good is talking she whispered dully and he heard how close to breaking point she really was hell be fine lily he said softly the men and women doing the negotiating are the best we flew them in as soon as we realised how serious the hostage situation was theyre never going to blast their way in ive watched these people before and seen the way they work they have all the patience in the world it might take days but theyll get them out alive they know their stuff but lily had only heard the one word days she choked with those murderers hes six years old what he must be thinking i should have taken him to kiras myself but the woman i was treatingshed have bled to death i couldnt dear god i couldnt you had medical imperatives he said gently hed talked to the finance councillor by nowthe woman was recovering in hospitaland hed seen the wound lily had somehow pulled together lily was right if shed taken the time to take care of her son before shed treated her the woman would be dead you saved her life lily but i should have kept benjy with me she whispered hes my son im all he has doesnt he have jacques he asked and she looked blindly up at him uncomprehending your fiancés in there as well isnt he she steadied a little at that jacques she said and then more strongly jacques maybe thats why hes there maybe he went to jacques but then she shook her head but hed have had to come past the hospital to reach jacques jacques is in administration hes in charge of finance she told him oh we have a finance councillor but louise isnt exactly smart she does what jacques says except for selling oil louise dug her heels in over that so did we all she fell silent she was trembling ben saw even though the day was hot she was walking in the damp sand near the waters edge here the water was a turquoise blue clear to the bottom ben could see fish feeding on weed drifting in and out in the shallows the beach was wide and golden this place was indeed a tropical paradise that such tragedy had come to it lily must have been thinking the same a tremor ran though her and ben took her hand hell be ok lily im sorry she whispered theres no i mean im sorry i didnt tell you about benjy he didnt answer he couldnt hes such asuch a she took a deep breath hes very much like you ben if anything happens to him and you havent met him she hiccuped on a sob and then seemed to regroup i thought i had the right she told him i thought it was me who was pregnant not you and i knew youd be appalled but seeing you here hes your son ben and i should have made the effort even if you didnt want him why would i not want him what were we ben she demanded suddenly angry babies ourselves we were young for med school we were young for life you were so lit up about joining the army you were off to save the world armies are used for peacekeeping you told me but it was excitement that was in your heart action drama sure you didnt want to fight but you did want to go wherever there was action and meall i wanted to do was come home my mother had sold everything she owned to send me to med school and the islanders helped because everyone here needed a doctor i was as excited as you werebut i was excited at coming home to help my people did it work out he asked and she took a deep breath there wasnt a trace of colour on her face she looked sick i guess it did she said slowly but there was a cost my mother died just after i got back she had cancer shed known for two years but she hadnt told me because she hadnt wanted to interrupt my studies oh lily you see when i found i was pregnant i was just as shocked as you would have been we were so careful but then our lecturers used to say the only surefire contraception is a brick wall were proof of that so what could i do youd made it clear you never wanted a family i couldnt burden you with one against your wishes she steadied then forcing her voice to sound neutral i had to come home as it is ive made a life for both of us here every islander loves benjy every islander is his uncle or his aunt or his cousin by traditional ties if not by blood and he has jacques he has jacques she agreed though it took her time to respond her voice was uncertain now as if hed touched a nerve they dont get on why would you ask me that it is my business if hes my son hes not your son i wont burden you with him hes lily i want him to be my son the words surprised them both they stopped and a wave higher than usual washed in over their feet lilys sandalled toes were washed clean ben was wearing tough army boots the water receded and they hardly looked damp it was dumb to be looking at boots ben thought the whole thing was dumb maybe lily was right maybe he should back off right now but he had a son by lily and she looked distraught he reached out and touched her face there was a fine coat of dust over everything courtesy of setting up the field hospital on land where the grass had withered during the dry season dust was on lilys face streaked now by tears and he tracked a tear with his finger i wonder what this place is like in the rainy season he thought inconsequentially lily didnt move she submitted to his touch without comment i think i loved you lily he said and she managed a ghost of a smile benjy was conceived in love she whispered ive always believed that its the truth just lucky were older eh she said but her voice was strained to breaking point she brushed his hand from her face turned determinedly northward again and started walking just lucky weve found sense and youve found jacques as you say do you have anyone no youre still running from relationships i dont run no she hesitated and then glanced sideways at him cautious youre angry maybe i am because i didnt tell you about benjy yeah but maybe youre right he said bleakly maybe seven years ago i wouldnt have wanted to know i was dumb we were both dumb mmm he kicked some more sand and tried to think of other things besides how close this woman was and how bereft she looked and how he wanted to he couldnt want she had a life here and a son and a fiancé and he was here with a job to do he should be working he should go back to the hospital and organise paperwork for the evacuations he could help treat the minor wounds of islanders still cautiously presenting his team were doing that he wouldnt be needed again unless there was a blastout in the hostage situation a blastout benjy his son think of something else he thought fiercely they were nearing the headland where the compound lay and the strain on lilys face was well nigh unbearable she was staring ahead as if she was willing herself to see through walls he had to distract her lily theres a couple of things bothering me i dont have time to not about us he said gently about this situation can you help she took a deep breath and steadied of course you told me seven years ago that this island was like a huge family everyone knew everyone and no one locked their doors is that right yes but but what he asked the insurgents were forced to leave the hospital alone and weve been wondering why weve been told theres been a drug problem on the island so youve trained orderlies to act as security guards is that right yes but do you know these drug users are they locals no she said slowly and he knew she was having trouble concentrating but she was determined to try weve had three breakins over the last two months none before down south theres a surf camp the surf here is fantastic and devotees come to train but for the last couple of months theres been guys there who are worrying they just lie around and drink and the breakins started at the same time they arrived theyve had threemonth visas our local policeman couldnt find evidence to deport them so he trained and armed our orderlies and we let it be known she gave a rueful smile our orderlies are the most peaceable of men but it acted like a deterrent the breakins stopped so where are these men now maybe i heard they were to go to one of the outer islands im not sure you never thought to get a profile on any of them im a doctor i didnt think anything but you its not my responsibility she flashed ben if you knew how hard i work theres no other doctor on any of these islands kapuas the biggest in the chain but theres twenty inhabited islands the health service is me no one wants to fly to australia for treatment hardly anyone will leave their own island pregnant mothers are supposed to fly out to fiji to give birth but hardly any do elderly islanders wont leave no matter how sick they are i fly by the seat of my pants doing what comes next and policing isnt on my list sure our policeman should have investigated more and maybe if id thought of it i would have reminded him but i didnt i was just grateful the breakins stopped im sorry he said startled by her anger and she stooped and picked up a shell and tossed it into the sea with such savagery that she came very near to knocking out a seagull the gull rose with a startled shriek and lily stared at it for a moment and then sighed sorry bird she said and then sorry ben its justduring med school everyoneincluding youassumed i was coming home to an idyllic island existence but this placewe need a full medical service with helicopter evacuation with at least two doctors and a setup where i can do operations that involve more than me cutting frantically while im instructing pieter in the niceties of anaesthesia she broke off turned her face to the council compound again and winced he tugged her against him for a moment she resisted staying rigid in his grasp but he on kept holding her willing some of his strength into her i promise well keep your son safe he said softly i swear but what sort of dumb promise was that how could he make it good but she finally gave in and let herself lean against him his arms held her and he smelt the citrus fragrance of her hair memories flooded back of the lily of seven years ago and he thought shes the same lily my lily and with that thought came selfknowledge if there was a choice if he could walk into the compound and say let the boy go take him instead hed do just that for lily but it wasnt just for lily for things had changed the child in the compound wasnt just lilys son he was his own son he had family the thought was incredible his world had changed he thought dazed it had shifted on its axis leaving everything he knew unaligned and suddenly desperately he wanted to kiss this woman properly as she needed to be kissed as he ached to kiss her taking her lips against his mouth possessing the sweet core of her loving her but he knew that if he did that shed pull back she was terrified for her son she was taking strength from him and he wanted her to keep doing that so hold yourself back he told himself fiercely though god only knew what effort that cost him but somehow he managed it kissing her hair but lightly as one would have comforted a distressed child he stood holding her as she leaned against him warmth flowed between them it was as if she was admitting finally that she needed help she needed him but with that thought came an answering one he needed her lily he couldnt pull her tighter into him he mustnt what was happening here was too precious to be destroyed by stupid impulses no matter how strong those impulses might be lets go he said gently and somehow he put her away from him and smiled gently down into her strainedtoexhaustion face lets go and find our son of course she said dully if we can we will he said well do this together were together until we find him ben he pulled her against him once more but gently as one would have comforted a friend she was his friend she was the mother of his child he hugged her and then he linked his hand in hers and led her forward youre not alone lily he told her ill be here for you for however long it takes chapter four the days wore on and the nights each night ben lay in the dark and listened to the soft breathing of the woman in his arms imperceptibly his world changed lily needed him in a way hed never been needed in his life this crisis didnt stop medical imperatives occurring elsewhere and lily had refused to stop working as the islands doctor ben and his team tried to take as much of the load from her as they could but the islanders made no secret of the fact that they trusted only dr lily just refuse to go ben told her ill go crazy with nothing to do shed say besides theres a girl in labour on an outer island or theres an old man in severe pain this is my normal workload ben the islanders trust me but no one else youre an outsider he was an outsider but he wasnt an outsider to lily he was father to an island child a child hed never met the situation was surreal how lily could work she could work only because she had him he knew that by now and so did everyone on the island at the end of a long day shed drag herself back to her bungalow behind the hospital and hed make sure he was there waiting for her shed fall into his arms exhausted with the fears and the frustrations and the pain of a day filled with medical need hed hug her close but carefully rigidlyhed take it no further he mustnt shed run and she mustnt run so hed hold her and hed tell her what if anything had changed in the hostage situation sometimes shed cry and if she did hed let her cry her fill then hed cradle her to sleep as hed cradled her tonight seven years ago hed lain with lily as a man lay with the woman he loves their loving then had been exciting and fun and happy this time there was no lovemakingor lovemaking in the sexual sense she had no energy left for sex and his desire for her had changed he wanted her to sleep he wanted her to drift into an unconsciousness where she didnt have to be terrified for her son this was a different sort of lovemaking he thought the girl hed loved was gone what was left was the mother of his son he loved her no he told himself in truth he didnt really understand it himself he only knew that if the choice was an exciting return to the lovemaking of old or achieving a measure of peace for the woman he held in his arms the choice was a nobrainer he hardly slept himself that was no problemhed learned to exist on catnaps he could survive but the nights stretched on and he held on he held his woman and his worldchanged i shouldnt be letting you do this lily whispered to him in the dark its not fair i need this too he told her its our son lily lets do this together the end when it came was swift and deadly it was three in the morning lily was sleeping fitfully nestled against him her breasts moulded to his chest with only the flimsy fabric of her sleepwear between them hed been cradling her in his arms murmuring softly to her at need reassuring her when shed wake at every unexpected noise and then he heard it a low murmur at first then building until it was a cacophony of sound heading towards them helicopters big ones he was out of bed hauling on his pants and groping for his boots as lily jerked into terrified wakefulness what is it choppers he said his fingers clumsy in his haste not ours hell we knew they had to have outside help lily stay here in your dreams benjy ill take care of him he said and set his hands on her shoulders and propelled her back on the pillows i swear ill take care of him lily please stay here i cant if you wont stay i cant go he said the helicopters were almost overhead and he knew what theyd be aiming for but did they come with death to the islanders in mind surely not lily promise me stay here until i bring benjy to you i you must he had to go there was no time to wait for promises he kissed her hard and fast and strong taking strength from her as well as giving it he grabbed the torch hed left at the door and he was gone ben ran toward the compound there were four helicoptersno fivehovering overhead the moon was a mere sliver its rays hardly reaching through the clouds it had been steamy all day and tonight it had rained maybe thats why theyd come tonight he thought as he ran keeping to the cover of the trees why were they there and then the clouds parted for a moment and he topped a slight rise and saw the compound backed onto the beach despite the dim light ben could suddenly see the whole picture while four choppers hovered one helicopter was behind protected and it was landing on the beach ben stood stock still his job was to stay in the background and wait for casualties assessing medical need so he had to stay back now troops were running past keeping to the shadows but the hostages a message rang out loudly the sound system had been set up initially as a tsunami warninga long low sirenbut technicians had tweaked it a couple of days ago making it capable of transmitting voices so in an emergency all could be warned of anything at all now the warning was urgent take cover a voice boomed and ben recognised their bassvoiced drill sergeant dont take aggressive action i repeat take cover thank you ben breathed as he forced himself to wait some more his team was good he realised now that the choppers were simply providing cover for an escape bid giving the fifth chopper time to land and assist those leaving the compound hed pulled further back into the shadows of the palms the choppers had floodlights and they were searching the shadows a hand landed on his shoulder and he came as near to yelping as a grown man could ben lily he grasped and held her how the hell i told you to stay back she was dressed in windcheater and jeansshe must have moved as fast as he had i cant he tugged her back into the shadows hauling her tight against him how did you know where i was i followed you she whispered but she wasnt concentrating on him she was staring skyward appalled whats happening theres a chopper landing on the beach the others are covering it whoevers in the compound will be going out the back way he grimaced and hauled her tighter why dont we stop them we could ben said grimly staring up but theres four choppers directly over the compound if we shoot we risk a chopper coming straight down they know that see how theyre clustered over the buildings thats a defence in itself second second we dont know who they are he said grimly those choppers are huge and expensive we shoot them down we find out who they are and we have to face the reality of maybe a neighbour being an armed aggressor if theyre here simply to get their people out of a bungled situation then our orders are to resolve a situationnot to start a conflict but benjy she said wildly if they take benjy how can you think politics when its our child our child the words pierced him making him want to put away everything hed ever been taught making him want to run into the compound right now itd help no one and he knew it he tugged her harder against him she was no fool but where a child was concerned his child we have to wait he told her and god only knew how hard it was to say it but if they take him why would they take him lily we just have to believe they wont and then it was over as quickly as it had started the chopper on the beach rose into the night sky to join its companions they gathered together above the compound a menacing hulking threat and then suddenly the five machines swept off together at full power growing smaller and smaller until they disappeared they hadnt disappeared before ben and lily were running into the compound hand in hand stumbling through the darkness in shared terror benjy the sound of the helicopters was still fading in the distance as ben shone his torch into one room after another while men shouted warnings from outside saying not to enter until it had been checked but neither of them were listening and lily was clutching bens hand with a fierceness that urged him to move faster they found them the hostages had been herded into one small bungalow at the end of the row they were bound together huddled against the furthest wall their faces blank with terror all except one one hostage was a child and even as ben swung the flashlight to find him lily had her son in her arms and she was holding him so tightly that it might be quite a while before anyone saw benjy cyprano again chapter five miraculously there were no more deaths the official decision not to oppose the rescue effort had been the saving of many ben thought gratefully as he worked through the night the sound systems message and the noise of the choppers had made everyone seek refuge there were shock cases among the hostages as well as gunshot wounds the hostages were a trembling stunned muddle of emotions and ben thought theyd need to bring in psychologists to counsel them as for benjy im taking him home lily had said solidly loudly as if she had been defying anyone to argue ben had been needed so hed reluctantly nodded to one of his men to accompany herto see her home safely shed disappeared into the night and he hadnt seen her since benjy was physically unharmed for now that was all that mattered he wanted desperately to go to them but he couldnt medical imperatives he had a job to do it was almost midday the next day before he surfaced from the field hospital and could hand over the hospital to sam im going to lilys he said and sam looked thoughtful the whole armys relieved we got the kid out he said then he hesitated you know the islanders think the sun rises and sets around lily but theres talk theres no sign of the boyfriend it was assumed he was a hostage but hes not ben knew that the unknown jacques lilys fiancé do you think hes an organiser sam asked bluntly im betting he is ben said grimly thats what were thinking the big boys will be wanting to talk to your lily shes not my lily sam raised his brows in mock enquiry not shes engaged to jacques whos not here i suspect shes not engaged any more boyo he raised his brows and the boy theres rumours scotch them of course sam said blithely but ben knew exactly where the rumours stemmed from and he knew there was nothing he could do about it he was wasting time he had to see lily ben knocked and entered the little bungalow behind the hospital there was no answer he hesitated but hed been in and out of this bungalow so many times over the last few days he felt he had the right he pushed the door it swung inward and he went right on in they were asleep for a moment the sight of them knocked him sideways lilys bedroom door was ajar from the sitting room he could see them clearly a woman and a child huddled together on a big bed holding each other tightly even in sleep he went further in they didnt stir lily had been crying he could see tear stains on her dusty face the choppers flying low had sent up a swirl of dust and sand and everyone whod been near them had been coated lily was no exception she looked so young he thought she looked almost as young as the child in her arms and the boy this was the first time hed been able to see him clearly benjy called after his father ben stood stock still taking in every detail benjy was six years old and skinny his small face freckled and open he was wearing stained shorts and a filthy tshirt his legs were bare and grubby his small feet were callused as if his constant state was barefoot of course he thought this was an island child this was his child his arms were twined around his mothers neck and his small nose was flattened against her breast he lookedlike him there was a photo he had somewhere of himself at the same age ben thought stunned into immobility the likeness was unmistakable benjy safe with his mother he didnt cry hell he never cried such a thing was unthinkable but the kid was ben with a start he realised lily was awake she was looking up at him with eyes that were uncertain almost as soon as she saw him her gaze went to her son as if making sure his reality was not some hopeless dream ben she whispered again as the sleep faded from her eyes and he wasnt sure who she was referring to im glad hes safe it was inadequate but he couldnt think of anything else to say are there more casualties five injured hostages from the original attack none critical its over lily theyve gone yes andjacques hes gone too i see she whispered and her lips touched benjys filthy hair do you need me no i just came to make sure benjys fine hes not hurt he saidjacques looked after him ben had guessed that much however wicked jacques was there must have been a vestige of fondness for the boy otherwise hed have been thrust out with the other rejected hostages or killed at least he hadnt taken him with him i dont understand lily whispered and neither did ben it might take weeks for this story to be pieced together if indeed it ever could be lets leave it for now he said softly and he stooped and kissed her softly on the forehead he brushed tears from her eyes with his fingers and then knelt and kissed her again on the lips she didnt move just lay passive not welcoming his kiss but not pushing him away either maybe she needed the contact as much as he did but he couldnt stay not now she had her son back for that would be admitting something he couldnt begin to admit a need of his own no just sleep he told her we have two doctors and six paramedics on duty and theres nothing for you to do but to care for your son our son she whispered and he felt his gut twist as hed never felt it twist before our son he repeated and he stood and stared down at them for a very long time until lilys eyes closed again she held her son now and not him he was no longer needed he left them somehow when she appeared at the hospital the next morning ben told her sternly she was to spend the next few days with her son that she wasnt to think of anything else that he and sam and pieter had things under control she looked at him blankly and left but she didnt go home on this island everyone knew everyones whereabouts and pieter told ben what she was doing she was working her way through the island homes talking to each family about what had happened and there was nothing ben could do to stop her in medical school theyd been taught to stay emotionally detached emotional detachment on kapua the concept was ridiculous the concept of such involvement left ben cold but he couldnt remonstrate he didnt understand why she needed to do this but she did and he had to take a back seat emotionally as well she had enough emotional baggage already without him adding more shed need time to come to terms with jacquess betrayal for it had been betrayal it had been confirmed that lilys fiancé had been in the group of insurgents whod made the break away from the island he was with them ben had been told and hed had to say as much to lily she hardly seemed to take it in she desperately needed time so did he he thought grimly as he worked on how did you come to terms with fatherhood at least there was work enough to keep his mind busy elsewhere somehow the night of the hostage drama had changed the islanders distrust of outside doctors whether it was sams big mouth or pieters he wasnt sure but it was suddenly known everywhere that ben was benjys father and if he was benjys father then he had the right to protect lily to say no she couldnt come her first priority had to be benjy astonishingly the consensus now was that he had the right to treat the islanders how did lily manage he asked himself as the days wore on he hadnt realisedhad anyonewhat a medical centre kapua had become lily was the island doctor not just for kapua she was island doctor for a score of smaller islands as well there was such need in the three days after the hostage release he saw trauma as great as that caused by the uprising two men drowned on an outer islandtheyd been fishing drunk and had ended up on rocks two boys survived the accident but they were now in hospital one with a broken leg one with multiple lacerations and shock as well as that he had viruses to deal with he had infections there was a manic depressive whod refused to take her medication and was seeing aliens there was a childbirth that was one where hed really wanted lily the girl had gone into premature labour the women caring for the expectant mother had rung the hospital to ask lily to come but they hadnt said what the need was when theyd heard lily wasnt available theyd simply hung up and tried to cope themselves by the time theyd admitted defeat and called ben hed had a premature baby of thirty weeks gestation on his hands it had still taken all his persuasive powers before mother and child had agreed to being flown to fiji lily will fix my baby when shes back at work the girl had said desperately trying to ignore the fact that her baby had major breathing difficulties in the end ben had simply said ruby lily cant help you you go to fiji on the next flight or you have a dead baby ruby had conferred with the island women and had finally agreed that yes she and her baby could go but there had been an unspoken undercurrent if lily had been there shed have fixed the baby herself what did you expect of a male doctor interfering in womens business what lily must have to cope with he ached to talk to her but he knew she had to have space somehow he let her be on the third evening he returned from an outer island late an old lady with bone metastases had needed pain relief but she wasnt stirring from home and it had taken him hours to get her settled and pain free finally exhausted he headed for the mess tent to face a congealed dinner he carried his unappealing plate over to an empty tableand lily walked in she was such a different lily to the lily hed met and loved at med school he thought oh she was still dressed as she always was as she had been then in light pants and simple tshirt her curls were washed and shining and her features were those of the lily of old she was smiling with a trace of the laughter he remembered so well but the strain behind her eyes was dreadful she had her benjy back but there were still losses that must ache he thought kira had been like a mother to lily since her own mother had died hed gleaned that much from island gossip lilys grief for the old woman would be raw and deep there were few secrets on this island and wherever he went people talked of lily even though he was taking away her load of acute medicine he knew she was working with traumatised islanders listening to them being one of them acting more effectively than any trauma counsellor his team could possibly provide hi she said with that lovely trace of a french accent hi he said back and attempted another mouthful ofwhat was this i hear youve been out saving my world she sat and smiled across at him thank you ben she said and his gut twisted just like that a simple thank you i havent saved everybody he said i sent ruby mannering and her baby to fiji the women infer that if youd been there no such trip would be necessary and a couple of fishermen drowned on lai i know its unlikely but i have the distinct impression if youd been around you could have brought them back from the dead her smile faded i heard about them she admitted morons and as for ruby and the baby her smile returned again just a little sure i would have sent her to fiji and if id known she was pregnant i would have sent her earlier but she didnt tell me she was pregnant and for once the islands grapevine let me down i need to get over there and box some ears i can imagine you boxing ears her smile returned youd better believe it if they want me to care for them then they have to tell me whats going on i have enough problems without unexpected births you have enough problems anyway he said gently this setup is impossible it is what it is ben she said theres no point in questioning it there was a moments silence so much to say ben attempted another bite of whatever lay on his platemaybe lasagneand gave up he pushed the plate aside and the mess sergeant came over to collect it not hungry no ben lied they fed me out on lai there was another silence they were alone in the mess tent now apart from the two men behind the workbench it was hot in there and still you want to go for a walk lily suggested wheres benjy asleep henris dad jean is staying at my house henris getting on well but jeans having nightmares sams sending henri to sydney in the next couple of days for reconstructive surgery but meanwhile benjy and i are helping keep jeans nightmares at bay here it was again lily taking on the troubles of her world but youre here he said thinking she couldnt be keeping other peoples nightmares at bay if she was out of the house jeans watching rugby on television lily said and that faint smile returned again there are limits on neighbourliness come on its better outside and maybe we need to talk so they left it was cooler outside the ocean breeze making the night lovely do you want to go to the beach he asked tentatively wait here for a minute she was gone for three or four minutes and when she returned she was carrying a basket dinner she said i can see a lie when it rises up and bites me and you saying youd eaten on lai was a great big lie dr blayden it might have been he admitted cautiously and she chuckled a lovely throaty chuckle that hed almost forgotten but when he heard it again how could he have forgotten egg and bacon pie she told him sushi rolls chocolate éclairs youve been cooking he was astounded and she chuckled once more how little you know of this island the currency here is food im the islanders doctor therefore i have more food than i know what to do with this week the islands cooks have been working overtime theres not a family affected by this tragedy that doesnt have an overstocked pantry great he said because he couldnt think what else to say he followed as she led him to the path down to the beach there was enough light to see by enough light for lily to choose a spot on the sunwarmed sand spread a rug and then plop down on her knees and unpack as he didnt follow suit she looked up at him what she demanded and he thought what indeed he didnt have a clue the tide was far out the sand was soft and warm and the moonlight made the setting weirdly intimatea picnic rug in the night with this woman whom hed known so well seven years ago but not known since he was still in his uniform heavy khaki he felt overdressed you could take your boots off she suggested as though shed read his mind and he smiled and sat and hauled his boots off and that made it more intimate still eat she ordered and that was at least something to do actually it was more than something whoever was doing lilys cooking knew their stuff you dont need army rations while youre here she said help yourself to my fridge im not sure how much longer well be here sam was saying i talked to him today while you were away but we have fifteen islanders still in hospital with injuries that need rehabilitation sams thinking well have to airlift them out theyll hate it ben said who knew enough of the island mindset by now to realise such an airlift would create major problems for patients like henri whod need further reconstructive surgery the islanders would consider evacuation regrettable but reasonable but if the patient was slowly recovering and all they needed was supervision and rehabilitation i cant cope if we dont lily said and he heard a hint of despair behind the words you wont have to well work things out maybe some of our medical staff can stay presupposing heres no crisis anywhere else in the region there is that but lily youll be wanting to talk about jacques she said dully changing the subject as if she couldnt bear talking about the last one everyone wants to talk about jacques i dont especially he knew he sounded cautious hell he was cautious if she hadnt wanted to talk about evacuating the injured how much more difficult would it be to talk about jacques ive been talking to your intelligence people she muttered bleakly intelligencethats more than i have he still wasnt sure where to go with this dont beat yourself up he tried and she responded with anger easy for you to say you didnt agree to marry someone who turns out to have betrayed the whole island hes a smart man lily it wasnt just you he conned for the essentials had been worked out by now it must have been no accident that jacques arrived on the island just after the council had decided not to sell their oil maybe they could be persuaded to change their minds but no one had been persuaded and jacquess attempts to drum up political change had been met not just with apathy but with incomprehension then jacques and whatever political power was behind him must have decided to take over by force they must have thought no one would notice the distress of such a small island but the thugs sent to carry out the operation had been idle for too long aching for a fight maybe jacques had argued for more time for better trained men the hostages said that jacques had been appalled at what had happened knowing such bloodshed must have been bound to cause international response but that didnt help lily who was staring out at the darkened sea her face bleak and selfjudging you loved him he asked and anger resurfaced what do you think i guess you did if you agreed to marry him he was here for three years before i agreed thats a pretty long courtship he wasnt sure where she was taking this but he didnt know where he was going either so he may as well join her he was great to benjy she said and some of the anger faded he was smart and funny and kind he transformed the islands financial situation he worked so hard while he tried to persuade you to sell the oil that was the only thing we disagreed about six months ago when he was given the final knock back he just exploded telling me the islanders were fools they were sitting on a fortune and if they didnt want it others did he was justvitriolic and then then he just seemed to accept it lily said he stopped haranguing our politicians and just focusedwell on being nice again on beingperfect so you agreed to marry him there wasnt anyone else she said after you he drew in his breath it had to be talked about some time it had to be now ours was a great friendship he said softly and then watched as her anger returned is that how you think of it as a friendship dont you think that i loved you ben she snapped ive never thought anything other than that i broke my heart when we went our separate ways there was a moments silence while he thought that through for the life of him he couldnt think what to do with it shed loved him had he loved her hed been a kid he thought a useless kid just starting out on the adventure of life he hadnt known how to love a woman he still didnt know you should have told me about benjy he said finally and it sounded lame even to him you wouldnt have wanted to know you think back to what you wanted thento be in the middle of every hot spot this world had to offer where did a child fit into that i would have he paused and she answered for him what ben sent him a cheque at christmas and a signed photo of his daddy doing brave and daring things all over the world thats not fair she hesitated for a moment he thought she was going to make some hot retort but in the end she didnt no its not fair she agreed at last and youre right i should have told you any number of times over the last seven years ive thought you should know but were you afraid id come she shrugged maybe that was it but im over it she was over loving him that was good wasnt it shed loved jacques were grown up now he agreed at last were sensible we dont do the heart thing any more did you ever do the heart thing lily i know she whispered its not fair to ask if you loved me seven years ago we were kids but i did feel grown up in the way i felt about you as you feltgrown up about jacques even more grown up she said and just as stupid that was a decision of the head and look where that got me she rose and brushed sand from her pants looking uncertainly back toward the hospital i need to go id like to get to know benjy before i leave of course it worried him he decided that she was being calmly courteous this was a reasonable discussion but he didnt feel reasonable he felt like hitting something maybe i need to do that fast he told her most of the troops will be pulling out in the next few days then as he saw the flash of fear behind her eyes he said lily theres no need to fear anyone coming back no ones naming names but we know who was behind this nothing can be said no accusations can be made but theyll be aware that the eyes of the world are on them now and they darent try again i suspectmaybe the islanders arent as innocent as they thought you were how can we be innocent when so many of our number are dead she said not attempting to hide her bitterness and that they be allowed to get away with murder she faltered and closed her eyes ben stepped forward but her eyes flew open and she stepped away dont touch me i only im not the lily you knew i can see that he said gravely to have coped with the medical needs of this community for so long im fine she said im fine because i have support from all the islanders you know when i came back here seven years ago there was a part of me that didnt want to come but now you want to put up the barricades jacques was an outsider and look what he caused i should have known so yes i want you all gone i want my life normallike it was before jacques was here how could i ever have been stupid enough to believe him first you then him my choice of men youre putting me in the same category as jacques he demanded appalled but no apology was forthcoming look at you she said scornfully a grown man chasing danger like its some sort of adrenalin rush i dont need it yes you do she said weariness replacing anger i asked you to come and see my island when we finished med school and you know what you said you said ive no intention of wasting time sleeping under coconut palms as if my life has anything to do with sleeping and nowyoure on this island because its what you term exciting someone else might stay behind and help me pick up the pieces but it wont be you sam told me sam ben said and groaned inwardly because sam was the last person hed want to be telling lily what he was like now whats sam been saying sam said youre a frontline doctor she said you go in first the heroic lt blayden where danger is thats where you are so he said cautious unable to think of any way to avoid a criticism he didnt really understand so maybe thats why i havent told benjy about you what have you told him about his father not much she said and flushed ben this is crazy im way out of my league ive spent the last few days thinking benjy might have been killed that should make the rest of this discussion trivial but its not it still matters i do want to get to know him so stay on she said challenging if a medic can stay here as long as the field hospitals needed why cant that person be you my job means i dont stay in one place he said blankly and my job is to protect benjy she said as if hed ended the conversation i need to get back to him ill come with you i dont want you in my house she took a deep breath i know that sounds dumband mean while benjy was in danger i needed youi needed anyoneand you sleeping in my house helped but it doesnt help now it only complicates things why because i dont need you any more she told him simply i dont need you and i dont need jacques end of story youve taught me a hard lesson ben blayden but maybe im finally learning so go back to your quarters and move on and benjy i cant figure that out maybe i will in the morning im too tired now its too late at night and im not sleeping lily leave it she snapped i dont want you being sympathetic i dont want you to be anything at all i just want everything to be as it was it cant be you think i dont know that she yelled and her voice rose so high that a flock of native birds flew upward from the palms in sudden fright she backed away from him taking some of her anger out in movement she glared at him turned away and kicked out as the remains of a wave reached up to her toes water sprayed up around her and then retreated she was left alone on a patch of washed sand shimmering in the moonlight shimmering blue electric blue where a moment ago it had been dark and lifeless suddenly a thousand lights had turned on around her feet she stood absolutely still and the lights slowly faded but they were still there a thousand no a million tiny blue lights shining from within the wash of white water surging in and out with the tide oh she whispered deflected from her anger light was everywhere she gazed down at her feet and she wiggled her toes experimentally the lights went on around her oh it was scarcely a breath it was a whisper of awe she bent and put a hand on the sand lifting it she left a perfect handprint of light shimmering blue she stared down awed as the lights slowly went out again and her handprint became nothing but a darker patch in the wet sand but still there were lights wherever the water washed there was light what is it she breathed oh ben he was as awed as she was but he did know what it was hed seen this once before on the south coast of australia and it had blown him away then as it was doing again now its bioluminescence he told her its millions of tiny sea creatures called dinoflagellates you rarely see them this close to shore theyre like fireflies responding to movement with a tiny blue glow its not magic she was turning round and round very slowly watching her feet glow around her almost in truth he was as awed as she was maybe it is it surely looks magic oh ben he walked down the beach until he was beside her as soon as he reached the soaked sand his footprints lit up blue just like lilys this wasnt here when we came wed have noticed lily breathed how theyll have come in on the tide they never have before its rare as hens teeth this close in its she was still turning slowly with her hands held out like a ballet dancer she sank and dug her hands into the soaking sand lifting them high the sand fell from her fingers in a shower of blue light she laughed a laugh of pure delight a laugh he hadnt heard for so long its magic she whispered its just magic it is he caught her as she rose and spun once more and he tugged her against him they stood side by side their bodies touching water washing over their feet gazing out at a sea that was a wash of blue and shimmering silver a magic show put on just for them just for this night they didnt speak there was no need the wonder of the night was before themand it was also within them ben thought as he held her close and watched her wonder how could he have left this woman she was so beautiful lily he said at last uncertainly and she took a deep breath cast one last wondering look at the sea and then tugged away from him just a little but enough that wasawesome ben she managed but i need to go lily dont she said as he looked down at her in the moonlight and they both knew what he meant dont take this further they were no longer lovers he thought and this was a night for lovers this was a scene set for lovers she was right they had to move on thank you for tonight ben she whispered her voice suddenly ragged at the edges she was forcing herself to break the moment she was forcing herself to break away from him thank you for the last few days buti cant i cant she put her hand up to his face and she touched him a fleeting gesture maybe reassuring herself that he was real and not some figment of this magic night this magic setting i need to ground myself she faltered i need to return to my islanders my medicine and my son i needto go do you yes lily no no please you cant and neither can i she was right and he knew it they both knew it and she at least had the courage of her convictions this night was meant for them he thought but he could take it no further they both knew it before he could say another word she fled she grabbed her sandals and her picnic basket as she ran up the beach and then she disappeared into the night behind the palms back to her bungalow back to her life as she must as he must return to his life for it was what he wanted wasnt it he stared once more at the magic light show put on just for them find another audience guys he said wearily you misjudged this one but how could she find sleep after that she couldnt the night was long and full of shadows and ben was no longer beside her she had benjy back she told herself it should be enough but ben had lain with her in those nights of terror and she missed the warmth of him the smell of him she missedben if shed stayed at the beach dont go there the night stretched on and lily let her thoughts drift to the first time shed met him shed been in her second year of university studying furiously her work taking up every available minute up three steps of a library ladder shed tugged out a tome that had been shoved in too tightly the book had come out too fast and all of a sudden she had toppled backward but ben had been right underneath ready to catch her shed landed in his arms she looked up into his concerned eyes and shed been smitten he had been big and dark with jetblack hair that curled randomly flopping over his lovely brown eyes and making him look very very sexy he had been tall and bigboned and superbly muscled and hed had a smile to die for hey the skys falling hed exclaimed holding her close but whos complaining if the sky looks like this hed set her on her feet and hed chuckled and brushed curls out of her eyes and picked up her booksand shed fallen in love on the spot the years that followed were amazing ben took life as it came seizing every opportunity with both hands oh he was hardworkinghis medicine was as important to him as it was to lilybut from that day their mutual studies became fun they studied together they surfed they went bushwalking they drank coffee in latenight bars they argued long into the night over anything and everything it was a magical few years that almost blew her away with happiness but there was no longterm commitment bens background was wealth and neglecthis parents were socialites who threw money at their son instead of affection and there was more lily guessed at shadows he wouldnt talk of and he wouldnt let her probe and lily lily had been taught what love did and shed thought she didnt want it her mother had abandoned the island and her people for a handsome frenchman when he walked out lily was four and mother and child were left destitute lily still had hazy memories of those days which had culminated in her mothers attempted suicide when she was seven french authorities contacted the islanders and lily and her mother were brought home to be accepted back with love but to know that the island was not to be lightly left and to be taught by her mother that romantic love was catastrophic so shed agreed with ben that love was for others shed tried to mean it too but shed failed her heart was irrevocably his but there was no way she could tell him she might love him but she agreed there was no future for them for when med school was complete she knew what she had to do and shed done it she told herself shed come home and shed borne benjywho looked like his daddy benjy stirred now in his sleep and she kissed the top of his head the resemblance was amazing when ben leaves again ill still have you she whispered but it wasnt enough it had to be enough for ever she had been right to leave the beach tonight she told herself she had to be right and ben back in his quarters listening to sams not so gentle snoring ben was no closer to sleep than lily what was wrong with him he usually slept the moment his head hit the pillow not now he was thinking of lily lily spinning slowly in her pool of phosphorescence lily her face was right before him the strain behind her eyes deep and real the medical needs on this island were huge shed been working too hard before this had happened and now hed leave her and shed sink back into a life where duty overcame all she should have time off that much was obvious for her to calmly go on working with no time to adjust was asking for longterm trouble they had to get a medical team here on a longerterm basis he thought well maybe he could arrange that in this current climate no reasonable request would be refused he could get doctors and paramedics here for at least the next few months that wouldnt stop lily working but she had to stop working he thought again of the strain behind her eyes shed collapse if she didnt stop she needed more nights like tonight he thought oh not with him but nights where she could stop spinning because of work and then an idea came into his mind so preposterous that for a moment he almost rejected it unexamined she wouldnt but she needed it so much he thought of the islands political head gualberto panjiamtu was a man in his seventies whod coped with being held hostage with dignity and had emerged with his concern for his islanders paramount gualberto would understand that lilys health was vital to all could he ask gualberto to release lily from her obligations for a while shed never agree but ideas kept spinning faster than lily had spun on the beach he should sleep he didnt sleep he lay and stared at the canvas overhead and thought about lily chapter six lily didnt see ben all the next day so much for ben getting to know benjy benjy stayed with her as she moved through the island spending time with each of the traumatised islanders trying to prevent longterm damage normally whenever she visited island homes benjy would dart off as soon as she arrived blending with the familiarity of an extended family but not now he clung listening in as the islanders talked through their terrors he shouldnt be with her lily thought he needed urgent attention himself but what could she do with kira gone benjy clung to her as a lifeline and pushing him away would do more harm than allowing him to stay she should stay at home with him but who else would do this these were her people she felt like she was being torn in two there was nothing to do except to work on through it so she kept on doing what came next and by her side benjy was stoic she needed to get her life in order she thought dully as she and benjy walked home at dusk but how there were no answers as they approached her bungalow she saw her lights were on often the islanders would come to her house if they needed her surely not more work she thought bleakly she was so tired you can do this lily she murmured and pushed her door wide there was indeed someone waiting for her it was gualberto and ben gualberto she said setting bens presence aside as too confusing gualberto as head of kapuas council was a stable presence a surety in a world that was no longer sure its lovely that youre here she told him and she meant it how can i help you its not for you to help me lily the old man said gravely its how i can help you ben tells me you need to rest she flashed ben a look of anger he hadnt been near benjy so much for promises and now to tell gualberto she needed to rest he was piling more problems on an elderly man who had enough to cope with i dont she snapped hear us out lily ben said and she bit her lip go run a bath benjy she told her son but gualberto put out his hands and tugged her son onto the seat beside him benjy needs to hear what weve organised i hope youve organised nothing weve organised you a holiday lily the old man said and he suddenly sounded severe sit down this was so unusual a statement that she did sit benjy was on the chair by gualberto it was a fourchair table that meant she had to sit by ben she sat but she shifted her chair as far away from him as possible gualberto smiled at the movement as if he found it amusing what was funny about it lily asked herself and then decided she was too tired to care she wanted them all to go away she could sleep for a hundred years theres a thing called burnout gualberto told her and his hand came across the table to grip hers ben tells me you have it ben doesnt know me she tried to tug her hand away but she couldnt ben has organised for you to take a rest the old man said sternly weve thought this thing through we depend on you and weve pushed this dependence too far i dont know what you mean this feeling of being out of controlshed had it since that first morning when the finance councillor had stumbled wounded through her front door and it was growing stronger rather than weakening she felt as if her body was growing so light that any minute she could float free she felt terrified maybe something of what she was feeling showed in her face for the old mans sternness lessened lily youre not to try any longer he said gently after medical school you came home to work here on this island but as the outer islands have discovered we have a permanent doctor theyve been using you too your workload has built to the stage where you can no longer cope its taken dr blayden to show us that he doesnt know i do lily ben looked concerned as he had no right to be on her behalf sam and i have been looking through the records of hospital admissions you had no right and weve talked to the island nurses youre doing ten clinics a week seven of them on outer islands youre on call twentyfour hours a day seven days a week the hospital is nearly always full because the islanders refuse to go elsewherewhy should they when they have you to care for them youre doing the work of three doctors meanwhile kiras been caring for benjy gualberto said and now kiras dead mama looks after me benjy interjected trying to keep up with what was happening and gualberto nodded in agreement of course she does thats what mothers do but your mama takes care of all the islanders as well she still has to look after me benjy said lily heard panic and rose and rounded the table and tugged him into her arms of course i do of course i will some things go without saying gualberto said heavily but benjy your mothers had a dreadful time and we need to take care of her as she takes care of us ii dont know what yyou mean lily stammered but gualberto was pushing himself heavily to his feet hed had a dreadful time too these past days and it showed lily i cant heal anything he said but ill do my best i know who ben is and what he is to you he looked at benjy and back at ben as if confirming the undeniable resemblance there are many things you need to sort out but one thing is already sorted ben is a good man he is a good man lily he reiterated heavily i know the men he works with and i know him myself ive watched him work with our people in the time since he arrived and i tell this to you stronglyhe is a good man as jacques never was maybe thats none of my business but i have accepted his proposal on your behalf proposal she flashed a glance of pure astonishment at ben we havent paid you as we ought the old man said heavily when you returned after medical school we had a subsistence economy you agreed to work for a tiny wage plus a share of the necessities we all share in that seemed reasonable but now ben asked me if you could afford to go away for a little and i had to tell him you couldnt he grimaced maybe weve been too afraid of what the oil money would do to us maybe we were too fearful of jacques and his intentions regardless what money we have is tied up in the short term thats nothing to do with it is something to do with you he went on inexorable now hed started for theres no money to say to you go where you want but there is an alternative i dont want an alternative listen lily ben said urgently and lily subsided again a little ben tells us that he owns a farm on the coast of new south wales gualberto said this is what he proposes and i agree theres nothing there but a housekeeper and farm manager ben tells me theres a beach horses to ride and nothing to do nothing lily you will stay there for a month i cant she was staring wildly from gualberto to ben and back again were they out of their minds to propose that she just leave and go to bens property ben will stay here to cope with medical necessities gualberto said interjecting before the next obvious objection was aired maybe hell join you toward the end of your stay but not before he says you and benjy need space to be by yourselves we all agree she opened her mouth but ben was there before her think it through lily he said urgently his eyes never leaving hers ill organise the medical setup here im due for leave and ill take it as such so even if theres a crisis i cant be called away officially sam will stay on for a bit as well and three of our nurses want to stay with your people thats a full medical complement butyou cant just do that she faltered you cant just walk in and say go to some farm ive never heard of would you not like to get away lily gualberto asked her serious now pushing for an answer truly lily in your heart i dont i dont you do ben said youre desperate for a break and you know it benjy needs time with you just say yes my love im not your love she whispered dazed of course not he said ruefully i meantlily just say yes dr cyprano a farm benjy whispered hed been trying desperately to keep up and he thought he had it now we can go to a farm mama just say yes ben repeated and gualberto smiled at them all and made to leave i think the yes is already spoken he said gravely lily for the next few weeks youre forbidden to practise medicine anywhere on this group of islands we love you as our own but for the next few weeks you belong to yourself take your son and go and now he smiled a worldweary smile that still managed to hold a hint of real amusement ill move on to the next problem but i believe i dont need to worry more about this one ill leave you in the capable hands of dr blayden ben stayed on she asked him to leave but he simply shook his head and started making dinner i can do this she told him but he shook his head she was sitting stunned at her kitchen table while this big man in army camouflage took over her life ive found three casseroles in the refrigerator he told her the one that looks best says its red emperor in spicy coconut cream broth he grinned at benjy man to man red emperord be fish i reckon thatd be guaranteed to put hairs on your chest how about it benjy looked at ben and then cautiously at his mother then he tugged the neck of his tshirt forward and looked down at his hairless tummy he glanced again at benwho grinned some more and flipped a couple of buttons open baring his chest to the waist definitely hairy like me he said theres a heap of fish and coconut cream gone into this manly chest youre mad lily said faintly trying to block out the vision of a body any young boy would think was enviable though who was she kidding it wasnt benjy who thought it was fantastic she so wanted to no she wouldnt listen to her hormones she told herself fiercely while benjy agreed that maybe he did want some of the casserole they ate together mostly they ate in silence though occasionally ben would direct a remark to benjy which benjy would consider and answer with a monosyllabic reply ben didnt appear put out by the lack of conversation he attacked the truly excellent casserole with relish then cleared away while lily sat still stunned seemingly unable to move bens farm her mind was saying no but get away her heart was replying and it sounded so desirable it was like a sirens song where were earmuffs when she needed them and as well as that bens farm that suddenly wasnt her mind talking it was her heart ben could be there at the end of their stay just for a little benjy might get to know his father at the end of the time shed come back here and get on with the rest of her life but benjy might have established a relationship which he needed to have this was crazy she couldnt leave these were her people benjy slumped in weariness almost before he finished his dinner trying her best to ignore benshe didnt know what else to doshe carried him through to bed he was asleep before his head hit the pillow she gazed down at his small face for a long moment and then turned to find ben watching you must let him have a break ben said gently you cant move forward from this as if nothing has happened youre a psychologist ive talked to psychologists what gives you the right hes my son she drew in her breath but it was as if she didnt find any once more that disembodied feeling came over her as if she was floating out of control maybe she swayed she didnt know but all of a sudden he was right before her lifting her into his arms holding her against him for a brief hard moment letting her feel the strength of his body against hergrounding herand then lowering her gently onto the bed beside benjy she didnt know how she didnt know why but it worked the awful dizziness faded and she felt the pillow soft and cool against her face for one crazy moment she considered giving in to this mandoing what he saidletting him take a control she no longer had it was a crazy thought but right now she didnt have the capacity to fight it do you know how close to collapse you are ben growled and she thought about that or tried to think but things were a bit fuzzy he was somale she thought inconsequentially nice tomorrow shed be sensible and tell him what he could do with his preposterous idea she decided tonight tonight he was glaring down at her concerned and she thought how wonderful it was to have someone concerned about her it was her whose job it was to be concerned about everyone on this island and on every other island within boating distance now the tables were turned im not close to collapse she managed and bens gorgeous brown eyes crinkled into laughter the laughter shed always loved of course youre not he agreed you could run a tenmile race right now maybe ten yards she said cautiously and he chuckled maybe not even one foot from your pillow youre going on this holiday my lovely lily ive set it up for you the islanders have agreed there are people to take over your worklily have you ever had time off with benjy how could she think about that when his eyes were on hers and the pillow was soft and benjy was warm against her and ben wasben was there i dont thats what ive been told he said and his smile faded dont fight me on this one lily tomorrow were putting you on a helicopter out of here were taking two of our injured back to sydney central and then the pilot will take you to the farm its en route to base so theres no problem rosa and doug my farm managers are expecting you youre to spend the next few weeks healing our son and healing yourself our son lily gazed at ben for a long moment our son she should resent the words she thought but instead it seemed as if she was handing over control that was something shed vowed never to do but now it was happening it wasnt the void shed feared the lightness was with her again but instead of making her feel ill it suddenly felt like there might just be a sliver of joy in all this no argument ben told her how could she argue she couldnt even raise her head from the pillow youre so done in ben said ruefully and he knelt by the bed and touched her cheek with his forefinger it was like a caress a gesture of warmth and strength and caring the feeling was an illusion she thought but for now she didnt care shed take her comfort where she could find it no argument for tonight she whispered thats great he sounded relieved she thought dreamily why was he relieved as if she could ever argue with him but of course she could she must but not tonight ill argue tomorrow she whispered and he smiled it wont help but youre welcome to try goodnight my lily he said and he bent suddenly and kissed her hard on the mouth as she remembered being kissed all those years ago she should push him away she should but she didnt the kiss lasted for as long as she wanted a delicious languorous indulgence in sensual pleasure that surely should have had her running back to her tightly controlled world men were dangerous ben was dangerous but not tonight tonight she let him kiss her she even found the energy to put her arms around his neck to hold his head in her hands to deepen the kiss and to take what she needed delicious languorous pleasure she was almost asleep it had to end but when it did when he finally pulled away her eyes were closing on a lovely dream her world was right ben was there which was a ridiculous thing to think but think it she did and it pervaded her dreams she snuggled against benjy and she slept as she hadnt slept for a long long time and kneeling beside her ben kept watch over lily and her sonhis sonuntil his pager crackled into life until there were medical imperatives and he could watch no more chapter seven she woke up and he was gone for a moment the remnants of her dream stayed with her making her smile making her look expectantly to where ben had been but of course he wasnt there she glanced at her bedside clockand found it wasnt there either startled she checked her wristwatchand yelped it was eightthirty there was a ward round to be done and and things were different benjy was awake she focused on the rest of her bedroom benjy had pulled an ancient suitcase from the bottom of the wardrobe he had a pile of clothes folded beside him and he was calmly assessing each item hi she said cautiously and he turned and smiled at her it was a great smile it was a smile she hadnt seen for too long ben came round a while ago benjy said when he thought we were asleep he was going to go away again but i heard him and we had toast together he said i should start thinking about what ill need to take to the farm the farm idea hadnt been a dream then but it might as well be the idea was crazy well talk about it after im dressed she told him benjy we need to ben says sams doing house calls this morning benjy told her and the nice nurse with the funnycoloured hair yellow and green debbie ben said sam and debbie are going to sort out all our problems no sweat did he say that she said starting for the bathroom as if he knows he says were leaving at ten and if were not ready hes going to pick us up and toss us in the helicopter and take us regardless he stared down at two tshirts i dont know what regardless means mama which one should i pack neither dont you want us to go benjy we cant there will be horses benjy whispered ben said there will be horses and i can ride one drat the man how dared he upset her son horses smell and they kick did ben take away my alarm clock bens horses wouldnt kick and i dont like your alarm clock neither do i sweetheart she told him but its all about who i am i want a holiday he said suddenly stubborn the children in my picture books have holidays i want one lilys resolve faltered she hesitated and there was a sharp rap on the outside door it opened before she could respond and ben was there dressed in his camouflage gear again looking big and tough and dangerous and smiling why are you wearing those clothes she said trying to sound cross and not breathless you look like youre heading into battle believe it or not i dont have anything else he told her i didnt pop in an extra bag of casual gear i like it benjy announced i want to wear a uniform like that when i grow up no you dont lily told him but her son looked suddenly mutinous uhoh what are you doing here she demanded thinking maybe this was a dangerous conversation to pursuethough concentrating on ben rather than benjy seemed even riskier i came to wake you up he said cheerfully i didnt want you to sleep through your holiday you took my alarm clock guilty but it was an entirely altruistic action on my part as here i am replacing it wouldnt you rather wake up to me no she snapped but his grin was making her think he had a point he definitely had a point anyway you make a lousy substitute my clock was set for six a perfectly ridiculous time he told her for the first day of your holiday ben im not lily you are he told her and his smile faded i meant what i said last night if you could afford some other way of doing thisof getting away from the island a bit by yourselfand i thought you would then maybe i wouldnt be this bossy but all the islanders agree all every single person ive talked to he said cheerfully bar none the women want to pack for you but i figured you only needed spare knickers and togs togs swimsuit he said patiently honestly lily you spent six years in australia i know what togs are ben i cant hed come to the bedroom door but no further which was just as well shed woken some time in the night and had tugged off her pants and bra she was now wearing a pair of very scanty knickers and a tshirt that didnt come down quite far enough this man was the father of her child she told herself feeling desperate he knew her so well that appearing before him in knickers and tshirt shouldnt worry her it did she wanted all the barricades she could get and clothing was just the start of it lily you can still he didnt move hes holding himself back she thought hes feeling the same as i am just in case you do want to take more than knickers and togs pieters wifes here to help you pack he told her he turned back and mary was behind him she came in now cautiously as if she was afraid what she might find but when she saw lily in her knickers and tshirt she smiled her broad islander face a tonic all on its own you dress well to greet your visitors she said and lily glared at both of them mary tell ben he has no right ordering me around he does have a right mary said softly im here as backup im here to tell you we all agree you were exhausted before this happened all of us knew it we just chose to ignore it becausewell maybe we needed you too much but we dont need you now youre to go child take your benjy and do what the good doctor says youre not to come back before youve gained ten pounds and youve lost those dark shadows under yours eyes mary dont argue she said severely and then rounded on ben what are you doing here she demanded lily needs to shower and pack and theres no room in that for you shoo yes maam ben said and he grinned and blew a kiss to lilyand shooed an hour and a half later lily and her son were in the great army helicopter heading for the mainland she had to work during the journey that was how ben had squared it with the authoritiesindeed it suited them all well a corporal with shrapnel in her knee and a supply sergeant whod smashed a hip in the chaos of the night of the helicopters both needed constant medical attention but they wanted to go home to sydney so benjy sat up front with the pilot one half of him overjoyed to be right where he was and the other half of him thinking holiday holiday holiday horses horses horses lily worked on in the rear one part of her was still a doctor checking her patients were comfortable making sure there was no deterioration talking to them about their condition and how they were looking forward to being reunited with their families one tiny part of lily was thinking holiday but the biggest part was thinking ben ben ben and there was no way she could get the refrain from her head ben watched the chopper disappear from view and it was as if hed cut out a part from himself and sent it with them lily and his son you should be with them mate it was sam coming up behind him and placing a hand on his shoulder the sensation made ben start and sam grinned youre not very awake are you lad i could be the enemy theres no enemy here not any more no sam eyed the retreating helicopter thoughtfully so tell me againwhy didnt you go with them i need to work here im working here so that makes two of us plus the nurses its what we need so lets see if im right sam said thoughtfully youve sent the lady to your family farm youve also volunteered to take leave because you know the powers that be wont approve two doctors staying here and the lady wouldnt have gone if she didnt know there were two of us to take over her work thats the truth sam said youve got it bad mate i havent got anything youre still in love with her shes gorgeous ben snapped anyone would love her she used to be gorgeous sam said bluntly now shes skinny shes got too many freckles her hair needs a decent cut and she looks like she hasnt slept for a month thats why she needs a holiday yeah but it doesnt say shes gorgeous he hesitated you planning on following this through like how the kids yours sam said you marry her and you have an instant family how does that seem it wont happen why not i dont do family no sam said thoughtfully of course you dont look can we leave this ben said exasperated youre planning on operating on larry arnoo this afternoon yeah sam said and grimaced larry should be on his way to sydney too theres shrapnel too close to the spine to leave it there if it hits a nerve hes stuffed but theres no way hes going to sydney hes only agreed to have the operation here because he assumed lily would do it as if she could have you seen some of the work shes done on this island sam demanded she and pietera nurse with no formal training whatsoeverhave done operations in the past that would have made me quake because theres no one else to do them shes out of it now ben growled she has a month off or more if i can manage it but youre not interested in marrying her hell sam i dont do marriage and do you think shed follow me where i go for the rest of her life or stay happily a home body while im away no chance well then ben said heavily thats it were back where we started longterm friends but at least i wont leave her pregnant this time not if you stay here and she stays there sam agreed and grinned but thats not likely to be a longterm arrangement now is it chapter eight the chopper crew set their patients down at sydney central benjy watched openmouthed as sydney appeared and disappeared underneath them he didnt say another word until they reached bens property neither did lily it had been seven years since shed seen anything but the island and there was a lot to see they followed the coast north until they came to a mountainous region where farms seemed few and far between here we are the pilot called cheerfully and set the big machine down to land a woman seemed to be waiting they saw her first a dot beside a house set on coastal farmland the dot grew bigger until it became the woman it must be one of bens managers in the tiny part of her mind that had dared to think ahead to what waited for them lily had imagined some sort of elderly family retainer a plump and cuddly lady who made sponge cakes and beamed no such thing sure rosa was an older womanin her sixties maybebut there the resemblance to her image stopped she was thin and wiry dressed in tightfitting jeans glossy boots and a crimson shirt with sleeves rolled up to the elbows a defiant redhead with auburn curls twisted into an elegant knot she looked like some sort of retired spanish dancer lily thought tugging benjy out from under the blades while the pilot tossed out their bags she turned to say goodbye but the chopper was already rising her escape route was cut benjy was right behind her clinging as if the woman might bite lily took her sons small hand and propelled him forward and then thought she was almost using her small son as a shield she had that lightheaded feeling of being out of control again oh for heavens sake this was nothing to worry about hi the woman called without a trace of a spanish accent and there was the second illusion dispelled welcome to nurrumbeen nurrumbeen all she knew of this place was what shed seen as theyd circled before landing it was a farm seemingly carved into the wilderness rich grazing land encircled by sea on one side and rainforest on the other what on earth was she going to do here for a month no people no medicine she wouldnt have minded the odd shop she soundlessly told the absent ben and the thought of his possible reaction to such a whinge was enough to allow her to greet rosa with a smile were lily and benjy i hope youre expecting us we surely are rosa shook lilys hand with a grip as strong as a mans and then her eyes moved past her to benjy benjy she whispered in a tone that said she either knew or she guessed bens involvement there was intelligence in these black eyes not much would get past rosa youre both more welcome than i can say she said come into the house the house was long and low whitepainted with wide verandas all around and the allpervasive scent of something that looked like honeysuckle running riot everywhere they walked inside and there were so many questions in lilys head that she felt as if she might burst by her side benjy seemed awed into silence ben should be here in all the time shed spent with ben during university never once had he introduced her to his parents or taken her to any of the properties his parents owned neither had he talked about his family we dont get on hed said brusquely and shed never got past it for her to come here now with his son without him there was a man inside older than rosa small wiry and greying he was leaning heavily on a walking stickand he was wearing an apron this is my doug rosa said proudly as if conjuring up something magical were here to look after you yourebens parents housekeepers lily asked cautiously and lily and doug both smiled im bens housekeeper doug said but food first questions later he sat them down in the big farmhouse kitchen and produced sandwiches sponge cake and chocolate éclairs rosa poured tea for lily and lemonade for benjy and both rosa and doug beamed as they ate and drank seeming to enjoy the fact that they were obviously disconcerted ben should be here lily thought again this is his house oris this his parents house im not sure what the setup is here she ventured as benjy wrapped himself around a chocolate éclair tell it like it is rosa doug pushed another éclair forward and lily couldnt resist yum were housekeeper and farm manager rosa told her dougs the housekeeperhe makes the best sponge cakes youve ever eaten she hesitated then glancing at doug and then nodding as if coming to a decision to tell more doug was a farmhand here when he was young and i worked in the stables rosa told them bens parents were running the place as a horse stud but they spent very little time here but we knew ben when he was little and his sister a sister lilys eyes widened shed dated ben for years what else didnt she know i didnt know ben had a sister bethany died when she was four rosa said but by then ben was at boarding school anyway when ben was about twelve doug had an appalling tractor accident it rolled on top of me doug said smiling at benjy as if trying to make light of what must have been dreadful damned wheel mount gave way on a slope you ever thought how much a twoton tractor can hurt one day ill show you the scars wow whispered benjy through cream anyway bens parents wouldnt accept liability rosa said without rancour stating facts they said it was dougs duty to maintain the tractorthe fact that thered been no money to maintain it was carefully ignored and they doctored their bank accounts to make it seem like there was there was a court case and we lost the fight left us in debt for years we left here i worked in a racing stable and dougwell doug stayed home and tried to keep himself occupied i learned how to cook doug said he did rosa said affectionately then about six years ago bens father passed away his mother had died earlier and it wasnt a month after his fathers death before ben came to find us he remembered us doug said smiling at a memory he obviously found good his parents didnt come here often but until my accident theyd send ben hed arrive on his own for holidays like us benjy announced and doug nodded exactly like you rosa taught him to ride a horse and he remembered us all those years later rosa said softly until his parents died there was little he could do but as soon as he could he did what did he do lily asked he installed us back here rosa said with quiet pride theres a little house behind this oneits beautiful hes given us life tenancy he sat and talked about what doug and i could do and we said i loved the farm and doug could keep a house clean so thats what we are housekeeper and farm manager you should see me hoover doug said grinning and lily suddenly felt like grinning back for the last week shed been moving in a nightmare this couple made her feel she was waking up and bens care shed fallen in love with him all those years ago suddenly she was remembering why does ben come here often now she asked and rosa gave a definite nod whenever he can we keep telling him he should bring friends heregirlfriends and the likebut he wont hes a bit of a loner and hes not the marrying kind doug added but rosas eyes had moved to benjy maybe he hasnt been until now she said but things change her gaze shifted to lily do you and he leave the girl alone love doug said starting to clear the table no questions you know what ben said shes worn to the bone just food and rest and plenty of both starting now rosa take them to their bedrooms for a nap before they explore the farm yes sir rosa clicked her riding boots together as she saluted her husband then she smiled and waited for lily and benjy to accompany her lets get you settled for a really long stay they were at his farm ben had several properties left to him by parents who had valued everything in terms of money nurrumbeen was the only place he had any emotional tie to and it was only his sense of obligation to doug and rosa that had created that tie hed go there when he had the medicine on the island thoroughly sorted he told himself but wanted to go there now why benjy was his kid he thought as the days wore on he had to learn to kick a football he had to learn to ride a horse rosa would teach him to ride maybe itd be fun to teach him himself but that meant involvement the kid might even learn to need him he didnt do needing he couldnt itd do his head in he was a man who walked alone until now a little voice whispered insidiously in his head you could stop and be a family and keep on doing the work i love you could change direction you might even learn to love other things which was a really scary thought he thought back to his childhood every single thing hed ever loved had been a fleeting attachmentto people like rosa and doug people he had seen when his parents had allowed it and then whod disappeared out of his life forever like his sister bethany thats what love is he thought bleakly he knew enough now to shield himself from it if he loved he lost forget it you have work to do here he told himself severely stay here stick to your medicine and get them out of your mind as if for the first three days lily threw herself into her holiday as if she only had days to get to experience everything she rode she fished she swam she built the worlds biggest sandcastle she read late into the night she rose at dawn to jog on the beach rosa and doug watched and said little benjy was drawn to them she knew they offered to take over his care and let her rest but rest wasnt on her agenda neither was clinging to her son but her legacy from the last few days was one of fear and everywhere she went benjy went too benjy loved the horses rosa and doug grazed beef cattlethat was the farms main incomebut rosa had four mares and one stallionjust to give her pleasureand they gave benjy pleasure too one of the mares was heavily pregnant and benjy was fascinated we cant go until flickers had her foal he told lily and lily thought she wasnt sure how long she could stand being there she was still in overdrive playing as hard as shed worked on the island the events of the past few days haunted her the effects theyd had on benjy haunted her as well making her worried sick that there might be longterm repercussions he hardly talked to her of the time in the compound he hardly spoke of kira he never spoke of jacques shed betrayed her son by loving jacques orby thinking shed loved jacques she hardly slept youre like a woundup clockwork toy rosa said on the third night doug was feeding the dogs benjy was supervising and lily and rosa were picking peas from the vegetable patch why dont you go for a walk by yourself after dinner let doug read to the boy itd do them both good her smile faded a little i worry about doug why he has chest pain lily frowned what sort of chest pain do you want me to talk to him you know im a doctor no rosa grimaced hed hate it that i said anything he hardly admits it to me and im sure its worse than he lets me see she hesitated but when ben comesmaybe ben will do something rosa if it really is chest pain he needs urgent medical assessment if he goes to the doctor when bens not here and the doctor says he has to stop doing housework then well leave here rosa said sounding desperate after bens been so good to us theres no way doug would stay on if he cant work for his keep she hesitated but maybe if it was ben that was to do the telling i know it sounds foolish but prides one of the few things left to doug rosa chest pain can mean theres nothing you can do or i can do rosa said with finality we wait for ben and as for now youre to go for a walk ben says you should when did he tell you that she demanded startled and rosa smiled he rang us when you were at the beach he worries about you then as if on cue the phone rang again whats the bet thisll be ben doug called from the veranda rosa told him this morning that you wouldnt slow down and hes worried suddenly she found she was shaking maybe ben was right she conceded maybe she was cracking up it is ben doug called she walked up the steps to the kitchen rosa and benjy followed so much for privacy they were all watching her she turned her back on the lot of them rosa doug and benjy were gazing at her as if she was their evenings entertainment she was cracking up hi she said and took a deep breath and tried again hi that was better her voice didnt squeak this time rosa says youre running on overdrive ben said lily thought great cut to the chase why dont you im fine she told him i need to come home the islands ok without you he said softly as if he understood where her head was which was crazy for how could he know sam and pieter and i have the medicine here under control youre not coming home until youre well i am well youre not well i want you to do something for me not unless i can come home he chuckled that deep throaty chuckle that had once made her smile but now suddenly made her want to weep its not going to happen sweetheart he said dont call me lily he corrected himself if ive figured out the time difference right you should be just about to have dinner how did dougs meals are like clockwork how often do you come here were talking about you not me we shouldnt be just shut up for a minute if you go out straight after dinner i cant let me speak he said exasperated theres a track from the house to the ridge up on blair peak its a full moon here so its a full moon there as well were under the same moon lily remember that anyway i want you to put some decent boots on and take yourself up to the peak tonight tonight he said sit up at the peak for as long as you need then walk straight down to the beach and wander back with your toes in the water she heard his smile again take your boots off first is this some sort of order its a medical prescription benjy cant this is not for benjy he said its for you its dumb its a medical prescription lily he repeated his voice softening trust me why should i for no reason other than im asking he said lily do this for you i cant yes you can my love or at least you can try dont tell me what to do ok im not telling im suggesting you can be angry while you do it but i still think you should do it and the phone went dead she replaced the receiver on its cradle and turned slowly to face the rest of them they were all looking at her expectant waiting for news you can my love he had no right to call her that but he had he said i should go up to blair peak lily said noticing in some abstract way that her hand was no longer shaking thats a fine idea rosa approved wear boots thats what ben said the snakes dont move so much at night doug added but you should err on the side of caution snakes she whispered and suddenly her mind was sharp again are you out of your minds nope rosa said cheerfully dumping peas on the table and starting to pod its a tiny risk and with boots its negligible and so worth it bens right dear you have to go i dont have to do anything if you want to get well you need to go doug told her its better than all the medicine in the world go mama benjy said you want to be better she stared down at her small son confounded im not sick no but you want to be better benjy said it might stop your hands from shaking so it might she whispered just how much had her small son noticed there you are then rosa said and beamed benjy do you want your mama to read you a bedtime story first or do you want her to go straight after dinner so she went she hadnt the least idea why she was going but there were four bulldozers forcing her to go rosa and doug and benjyand ben what right did ben have to propel her to do anything she demanded of herself trying to be angry trying to be anything but deeply in love with him but how could she be angry hed never been anything but honest with her and now hed been the means of sending her to this place and already benjy was looking better the terrors of the past few days becoming something they could face down together regardless the desire to be angry was still there the track was easy to follow in the moonlight but it was steep she was puffing with effort and kicking stones in front of her as she climbed anger was a much simpler emotion to concentrate on than anything else anything else was just too darned complicated just pity the snake that gets in my way she said out loud and then she thought lucky its not ben whos here the toad pushing her around it wasnt working she tried a bit harder to justify itand couldntand suddenly it was jacques who was before her shed hardly been able to think of him until now but suddenly it was jacques she wanted to kick jacques had seemed caring and compassionate and loving hed wooed her for years and shed finally let herself agree to marry him and you were a criminal she said into the darkness you rotten deceiving toerag you bottomfeeding maw worm she tested out her vocabulary a bit more that led to frustration she didnt have the words to match her anger nancy sinatras song came into mind an oldy but a goodythese boots are made for walking she hummed a few bars and then broke out in song setting up a squawk in the undergrowth as night creatures were startled out of their peaceful activities sorry guys she told them but she sang some more and suddenly she wasnt thinking about jacques any more she was thinking about ben well i dont need you either you macho army medic anger faded she did need ben but he didnt need her but then she reached the top a rocky outcrop at the height of the ridge here for about twenty yards in either direction no trees grew she could almost see her island from here she thought and she found herself scanning the horizon looking for home there was a rustling in the bushes at the edge of her rock ledge she turned and a pair of tiny wallabies had broken cover maybe for no other reason than to look at her they gazed at her for a long moment finally they decided she was harmless and started to crop the mosses at the edges of the rock the sky was vast and endless the moonlight shimmered over the water behind her was the mountain range dividing the coast from the hinterland it looked as if the whole world was spread out before her she felt tiny insignificant she turned to the two wallabies awed and wanting to share does this spot put you in your place she asked them they gazed at her not answering but taking in every detail of what was obviously a very interesting specimen yes but a specimen of what she whispered ben had sent her up there im under the same moon hed said she let his words drift and they felt ok her island was under the same moon she was under right now ben was out there somewhere caring for her island the awful feeling of being bereft without anchor without purpose slowly melted trouble is hes been under the same moon since the first time i met him she whispered i cant get him out of my mind do you need to maybe we can be friends she thought and for a moment felt so bleak that she winced but the night wasnt going anywhere it seemed like she couldnt go down the ridge until shed thought this through and the wallabies were waiting for answers hes a good man she told them and they looked as if they might agree he sent me up here it was a bit of a oneway conversation she needed a bit of feedback she decided so she turned back to conversation with herself you should have sorted this out seven years ago she told herself you know you should you should have told ben about benjy you should have taught benjy to care for ben and you should have given ben access other parents do that and maybe you could have even grown to be friends it would be good to be bens friend you dont want to be bens friend yes i do she told the night fiercely answering her own accusation ben walks alone but that doesnt make him any less of a person hes a wonderful man and hell make a wonderful father just get things in perspective like how like telling yourself to be sensible like admitting you find ben seriously gorgeousheck you know that already youve had his baby theres no harm in admitting how sexy you think he is and if he wants to be part of benjys life youll see him lots that was a good thought it was even a great thought and you can stop feeling guilty too she told herself it wasnt that you were looking for a replacement for ben that made you accept jacques if ben hadnt been in the back of your mind you probably would have married jacques a long time ago and where would that have left you her eyes widened at that so ben saved me from marrying jacques she whispered good old ben maybe i should tell him she grinned she thought about it a little longer and it feltok im giving myself my own psychotherapy here she told the wallabies courtesy of ben she rose stretched and gazed out to sea ben was over there just over the horizon i love him she told the silence now i just have to learn to like him you can do that yes i can she told the wallabies and she grinned at them both and turned to take the track down the ridge i might have to come up here a few times and talk to you guys again but hey youre cheap now if you dont mind i have a holiday to start how the hell had she done all this ben had told lily he had the medical needs of the island totally sortedwhich wasnt quite true he and sam were both working full time and they never reached the end of the queue do you think these people have been saving their dramas for the last forty years just waiting for us to arrive sam asked a week after lily had left i thought medicine in a war zone was hard this is ridiculous there is a financial issue ben said thoughtfully hed talked to gualberto at length now and he had a clear idea of the problems lily was facing when lily first started here there was no money for decent medical facilities no ones looked at the broader picture since they found oil lily wont have had time to look shell have been too busy to think past the next case of coral poisoning sam lifted his day sheet summarising his daily patients and winced do you have any idea how many times islanders cut themselves on coral and get infected yes ben said i saw six cases yesterday myself maybe we could bomb the hell out of the coral sam said morosely thatd fix it there speaks a surgeon if it hurts chop it out you got any better ideas i have actually ben said use some of the oil money set up a firstrate health system with a stateoftheart hospital and medical bases on all outlying islands we could advertise to medics from australia initially but we need to organise more of the island kids into medical training lily was an exceptiontheres been none since we need island kids thinking about medicine and ancillary services as careers we also need a helicopter service devoted to medical needs and staff to run it so sam was regarding his friend in awe a complete medical service for all the islands this sounds serious youre seriously thinking of setting this up not me but i can advise you wouldnt be tempted to stay its not what i do you need to establish some sort of relationship with benjy ill see him at the farm when i leave here for a few days on your way to the next disaster thats what i do yeah sam said still thoughtful so it is i forgot just as well i havent ben said but as he walked away his friends eyes stayed on him thoughtful life had slowed to a crawl the biggest excitement was the impending arrival of flickers foal and after three weeks at the farm lily was having trouble even sharing that she slept long and deeply untroubled by dreams or nightmares benjy slept in the big bed beside her and after the first few days his dreams also seemed to disappear he had needed this lily conceded ben had been right we didnt need jacques he confided to lily and lily agreed he wasnt a good man benjy i shouldnt have gone to him benjy whispered it was late at night and he was cuddled against her before sleepa time when demons could be faced together and dispersed as unimportant when kira was killed i was really scared he whispered i was running toward the beach and i heard shooting men were running up the road toward me so i ducked into the trees until they were past then i saw what had happened on the beach i started running back to you but then i saw jacques yelling at the men really angry and they werent shooting at him so i came out of the trees and he said come with him he snuggled even closer trembling but i shouldnt have mama he hesitated and then he added bens nicer than jacques it wouldnt take a lot to be nicer than jacques lily thought bitterly but she made herself answer mildly he is is ben our friend yes is he a better friend than jacques he is lily repeated trying to figure what else to say how to tell a child that ben was much more than a friend how to tell a child that a stranger was his father he likes me better than jacques did benjy murmured i went to university with ben she told him hes been my friend for a long time but he hasnt visited us before hes been busy benjy he looks after everybody when theres trouble you look after everyone when theyre in trouble no but she hesitated benjy on the islandwhen those men camethey were friends of jacques and they wanted our oil jacques didnt know they were going to shoot anyone but they did i think jacques wanted to be rich ben doesnt want to be rich he just wants to stop people hurting like you a bit like me but ben travels all around the world we stay on the island but you like it here benjy reasoned there might be lots of other places that are cool one place at a time she whispered floundering doesnt ben go to one place at a time i guess so then he could still be our friend we could visit him he goes to dangerous places then he could keep visiting us benjy persisted we could tell him our place is dangerous and he would come then it is dangerous it was only dangerous once its safe now you know that then he wont come and visit i dont know sweetheart she said helplessly lets just wait and see shes only agreed to take four weeks off if you leave it any longer you wont have any time with her at all maybe thatd be for the best ben said for the tenth time or more but what about benjy hes your kid sam said letting his exasperation show doesnt he deserve a father sam talked so much that occasionally he said something sensible ben had almost managed to turn off but that comment it hit a nerve benjy deserved a father he hadnt thought of it like that until now hed thought of this from his own point of view and from lilys not from benjys you can get by without one he said trying to sound confident says you sam said mockingly says the man whose parents tossed you into boarding school at five and paid people to look after you on holidays you survived so benjy should too is that what you think where the hell do you get your information im a doctor sam said smugly we learn by listening in medical school plus i looked up your army notes when you applied to this unit they gave you a psych test as a medical officer i just happened to look you could get struck off for that i never look at anything thats not available from other sources if i had time to look sam said virtuously im just being timeefficient but the psych test said you were a loner and listed your background as evidence hence you get the frontline work while good old sam who has his christmas with thirty or so relatives gets to stay home till you clear up the villains so quit asking questions ben growled use those sources of yours to find out what you want med school taught me to get patient profiles from a variety of sources sam said still virtuous the best source of all is the patient im not your patient his patience at an end bens voice was practically a roar they were in the staff quarters of the field hospital the walls were canvas there was a startled murmur from outside and sam grinned great he said thats started a bunch of rumours doctor cracks under pressure you need a break a nice family holiday will you cut it out im playing family counsellor sam said its my new role starting now go make friends with your son and get yourself reattached to lily youre single ben snapped go find yourself a family ah but theres the rub sam told him youre not happily single me im meeting ladies shortening my list figuring out where i fit in before i settle down but youyoure running in fear my friend and i also got to know benjy hes a great kid and he deserves more than youre prepared to give so i reckon you should reconsider youre not needed here any more youve set up the bones of the new medical service we can do the rest theres a chopper leaving in the morning you should be on it butt out not until youre on the chopper sam eyed him consideringly theres levels of brave lt blayden sam said softly off you go and face the next level do you think ben will come while youre here rosa asked and benjy looked worried we want him to come dont we mama mmm lily tried to be noncommittal they were walking back to the house leading flicker the mare was growing heavier every day with the weight of her foal she loved the lush pasture by the river but she couldnt be trusted to graze there by herself her normal paddocks on the far side of the river rosa had explained with the dry weather the rivers dropped and the ground on this side is marshy if we left her be shed end up stuck in mud lily wasnt sure if that was true or it was an explanation designed so she and benjy had to spend a couple of hours each morning supervising flickers grazing but contrivance or not it was working there was a lot to be said for supervising a pregnant mare and doing nothing else this place was the ben blayden cure for posttraumatic stress or the ben blayden heart cure no his prescription hadnt worked for that hes very busy she told benjy hes probably needed somewhere else by now theres time if you make time rosa said darkly she shook her head hes so unhappy since he was a little boy hes been looking for a family rosa i know rosa smiled down at benjy i have big ideas for your mama and our ben but big ideas are not necessarily bad ideas i just wish that hed come and two hours later he did they were washing for lunch when they heard the helicopter and benjy was out of the house in a flash its got to be him he told lily as she joined him on the veranda it has to be and it was chapter nine ben stepped out from under the rotor blades and looked across at the house she was there lily was standing on the veranda dressed simply in shorts and a singlet top even from here she looked different and benjy benjy was racing to meet him a nugget of a kid all arms and legs his grin the same as lilys multiplied by ten his grin was lilys grin before shed taken on the worries of the world ben ben ben ben was forced to drop his holdall as benjy catapulted himself into his arms before he knew what was happening he was hugging his son and being hugged and looking over the mop of curls to where lily was smiling a welcome of her own his gut twisted so sharply it was physical pain bens here benjy called deeply satisfied and wriggled in bens arms to face his mother really lily said i thought it was the milkman silly benjy said reprovingly its our ben you never said that about jacques lily halted on the third step down from the veranda ben had reached the base of the steps he needed to climb three steps to reach her but he hesitated aware that this moment was important i didnt like jacques benjy said and buried his face in bens shoulder he kept saying i had to be a man youre a kid lily said i know benjy said and peeped his mother a smile the smile was pure mischief ben thought hed never seen benjy like this as free as kids were supposed to be free their stay here had done them both worlds of good he could read it in their faces maybe theyd want to leave almost straight away well that was ok hed only dropped in to check on his way to the next mission on his way to the next danger i can ride a horse benjy told him wriggling until ben set him on his feet but not flicker cos shes going to have a baby rosa says i can help choose a name for her foal and what about your mama ben said smiling up at lily can she help choose mama chose my name benjy said its not fair that she chooses the horses name too he skipped up the steps to lily why did you call me bens name he asked because lily said and faltered she looked at ben in her eyes a question now or never her gaze said and he had to make an instant decision ok he could do this maybe this wasnt the best time but was there ever a good time for something so momentous he nodded benjy ive told you about ben lily said softly i told you all about the good things he does and the brave doctor he is what i should have told you benjy is that ben is your father bens small mouth dropped open he stared at his mother like shed lost her mind then very slowly he turned on the steps to stare at ben youre my dad yes ben said feelingodd i am henri said jacques would be my father no lily said ben is you mean he gave you the tadpole that went into your egg benjy demanded and ben almost choked but he didnt because funny or not this was a really serious moment thats it lily said sounding relieved i knew i had to have a father somewhere benjy said he looked ben up and down head to toe youre sure were sure ben said softly we should have told you before but ive been off adventuring and your mama didnt want to tell you by herself benjy considered that for all of ten seconds he looked at it dispassionatelyand decided it was acceptable more than acceptable his grin came back with a vengeance cool can i ring up henri in hospital and tell him sure lily said well ring tonight can i tell flicker now of course cool he said again and breathed a great sigh of satisfaction then he bounced down the steps and headed horsewards to spread the news i guess ive done what i came to do ben managed benjys departure had created a silence that was lasting too long he didnt know how to break it and his words now sounded flippant and sort offinal that was how she took it anyway you should have held the helicopter she said stiffly maybe if you radio fast theyll come back and collect you that was so ridiculous that he didnt respond and she didnt press it tadpole huh he ventured and the tension eased a little she managed a smile fathers are supposed to give their sons sex education not mothers her smile grew rueful actually i didnt give him the tadpole bit i suspect that was from henri or another of his mates on the island maybe its time i took a hand if you have a better sex spiel than tadpoles be my guest her agreement took him unawares here he was meeting his son as his son for the first time and lily was handing over responsibility for sex education it was his responsibility maybe it was he wasnt going to be there theres no need to panic lily said and he sensed a fraction of withdrawal of friendliness i can do it myself id like to help i dont want help she said parentings not about help you either do it or you dont you parent on your own terms that sounds ominous i read it in a book she confided and suddenly she smiled again abandoning tension in truth i know nothing about the rules from here on in you and benjy will have to work it out for yourselves but meanwhile rosa and doug will be aching to see you theyll be trying to give us private time but just about busting a corpuscle to see you busting a corpuscle its a medical term she said wisely im surprised you havent heard of it it involves mess into the middle of next week hed forgotten that hed forgotten lily happy he grinned at her she grinned back and then she stood aside so he could come up the steps and past her into the house welcome home she murmured as he passed and it was all he could do not to turn and kiss her maybe she would have welcomed it he thought but it behoved a man to act cautiously nevertheless as he passed her he was extremely glad that he hadnt asked the helicopter to wait they had a great dinner doug had pulled out all stops to create a feast roast beef with all the trimmings followed by an apple pie that made bens eyes light up with pleasure the minute he saw it i remember this pie he glanced at doug and frowned hang on when i was a kid here you and rosa worked outside how did you know i loved this how did you get the recipe mrs amson was the cook here then doug said placidly when you offered us the job i rang her and asked her for recipes for anything you liked rosa said softly it seemed the least we could do when you were handing us our lives back ben coloured lily stared across the table fascinated the normally incontrol doctor who handled crisis after crisis with aplomb was seriously discombobulated why are you staring at ben benjy asked her and lily answered without thinking hes discombobulated benjy thought about that for a minute and then giggled that sounds like his arms and legs have come off just his cool she said and smiled across the table at ben i like to see a man discombobulated for good reason whats good reason benjy asked still intrigued because he does good things for people rosa said rising and starting to clear away except no ones supposed to thank him he doesnt like people hugging him our ben so all we can do is make him apple pie we could hug him benjy said so we could lily agreed hes been very good to us our ben he is our ben benjy agreed he turned to doug hes my dad i thought that must be it doug said gravely and dads should be hugged i dont know whether he wants to be hugged youll have to ask him ask me tomorrow ben said getting up from the table in such a hurry that his chair crashed to the floor behind him i need to take a walk we can come with you benjy offered do you want to meet flicker tomorrow ben said backing out the door as if propelled for now i need some space to myself he always needs space to himself rosa and lily were washing up benjy had asked doug if he could do bedtime reading duty and ben was nowhere to be seen itll take an indomitable lady to break down those barriers im not sure im that lady lily said she hesitated but by now she was sure rosa had figured out everything there was to know about her and she surely knew ben as well im not sure therell ever be a lady for ben hes looking like a man in love tonight hes looking like a man whos afraid if he asked you to marry him he wont lily whispered and even if he did i cant leave the island cant you rosa dried her hands on the dishcloth and turned to face her is there really no one who could take your job theres no money to pay anyone of course there is she said briskly doug and i have been reading the newspapers kapua has as much oil wealth as it wants they can easily pay medical staff enough to encourage them to come its not like kapuas a desert either it sounds lovely it is lovely lily whispered its home homes where the heart is rosa retorted look at me ive been following doug for years working where hes needed to be but thats different why is it different because ben wouldnt want us where he is nothings changed since medical school like leaving the table now the conversation was too close to the bone hes cultivated armour and no ones getting through you love him rosa said gently and lily nodded i always have then then nothing she said his armours thirty years deep no ones getting through well stay in touch now for benjys sake but we wont do more than that and me i have to rebuild some armour of my own which was why she should be in bed which was why she should be anywhere but where she was at midnight which was sitting on the back veranda waiting for ben to come home he did come home walking steadily across the paddocks in the moonlight he was still wearing the army camouflages hed been wearing when hed arrived maybe he had no casual clothes here she thought these must be the only clothes he took with him as he travelled the world or maybe there was a reason he still wore them this was army camouflage a reminder that he was still on duty somehow a reminder that his armour had to stay he didnt see her as he strode up through the garden to the veranda she was sitting on an ancient settee to one side of the front door have you been up to the peak she asked gently as he reached the top of the stairs and he froze there was a moments stillness while he collected his thoughts when he turned to her he was smiling but she wasnt sure the smile was real you guessed its a great place she told him it made me stop stop let go she said gently i spent the first few days here doing what i normally dotrying to cram in as much as i possibly could blairs peak sort of took that out of me ive slowed down so much now that im practically going backwards im glad its what you needed how about you she asked has it slowed you down unlike you i dont need to be slowed down im not a workaholic sam said youre an adrenalin junkie which is just as bad as me sam doesnt know what hes talking about hes your friend i dont have friends there was a silence at that it stretched out into the night sky permeating everything we were friends she said at last and now i find youve borne me a son without telling me so much for friendship you think it might have been something more then she demanded he was standing before her dressed for battle and that was suddenly how she was feeling like she was geared up for battle as well she hesitated but the look on his face said he wasnt even going to consider their relationship ok then try another track do you love rosa and doug she asked and his brows snapped down in confusion what sort of question is that just answer it do you as much as i love anyone thats what i thought do you know doug has angina or worse rosas terrified but she cant persuade him to go near a doctor why didnt she say how can she say anything when your visits are so rare they make special dinners theyd never dream of interrupting one of your visits with medical necessity thats crazy it is she retorted its because they love you hell lily im tired she said pushing herself to her feet i wanted you to know about doug so if you leave tomorrow youll at least know theres trouble here he wont take advice from me it sounds like angina but it could be more serious i cant tell that unless i examine him and how can i ill talk to him which will solve the problem this time but after that hell lily im not responsible for these people then you should be she snapped they love you just like she caught herself drawing herself back closing her mouth with a gasp no thats it leave it lily leave it fine he said cautiously and she made to push past him to go indoors but his hand caught her shoulder and he turned her so she was facing him lily you dont need to go back to the island of course i need to go back to the island you dont he said heavily sam and i have worked it through with gualberto weve set up an embryonic medical service that should be up and running within weeks an embryonic medical service gualbertos agreed he told her eager to move to a neutral impersonal topic its time for the island to stop sitting on all its resources we had a massive meeting last week the consensus is that theyll not exploit their oil for individual wealth but theyll spend real money on education and medicine which is where you come in i come in where everyone knows youre overworked the plan is to get at least two fully trained doctors plus interns working on the islandbut thats just for starters we see a medical service that eventually serves all outlying islands with you or someone like you as administrator but with every specialty represented we see a much bigger hospital you need connections to australian teaching schools so kapua can become part of their remote training roster for young doctors you need a helicopter service for outlying islands and the oil money is more than enough to fund it for generations to come itll be huge lily she stared at him dumbfounded and ran her tongue over lips that were suddenly dry youve set all this up already yes gualberto gualberto never thought of this by himself no sam and i have been on the island for little more than a month she said blankly what do you know about what we need we know what you need lily this leaves you free to spend time away from the island why would i spend time away from the island you could spend time with me he said suddenly uncertain maybe we could spend a couple of weeks here a year while i get to know benjy youll be a father two weeks a year i can hardly do more no she said bleakly of course you cant lily i dont do family why the hell not i told you so many years ago when we were kids id hoped youd change by now he stared at her in the moonlight what more do want of me lily he asked you tell me i dont know she said wearily but im scared benjy knows youre his dad so now theres two of us two of us spending months of every year not knowing where you are what youre doing if benjy get as attached to you as i am how can i put him through that youre attached of course im attached she sighed you know i am i tried so hard to fall in love with jacqueswith anyonebut all i ever wanted was you youve been in my heart every minute since the day i met you but im not letting you destroy my life im not letting you mess with benjys life come here two weeks every year and fall in love with you all over again how can i do that and survive lily its what i am its nonnegotiable i didnt ask to be benjys father but thats nonnegotiable too she gulped for breath and regrouped i didnt ask to be benjys mother but i am i didnt ask to fall in love with you but i did ben youve spent your entire life finding yourself a place where you didnt have to get attached you swing into a crisis situation save lives do good but you never visit them again you never need to hear feedback from patients two years after the event you dont need to attach yourself to a community in any shape or form sam says you even hold yourself aloof from the crisis response team i cant help what i am no and neither can i she said but seeing you for two weeks every year itd destroy me ben so somehow you need to work out a relationship with benjy that doesnt include me and dont ask me how you can do that because i dont know ill support whatever you want but i cant continue to be near you i justcant lily what she sighed again and looked up into his face which was a mistake because regardless of anything else this was ben her ben the ben shed carried in her heart for all these years he wasnt hers shed known that then and she knew it now the scars of his childhood were too deeply etched there was no place she could reach him im sorry ben she whispered and she reached up and touched his lips fleetingly with hers which was a further mistake she backed away but as she did so she saw his eyes widen flare lily he said and it was the way hed always said it like it was a caress lily it was a plea she didnt move she didnt move and she didnt see him move but she had or he had or whatever and suddenly she was being held tightly in his arms crushed against his chest kissed and kissed some more this was dumb this was crazy letting herself be kissed in the moonlight letting herself be kissed as shed been kissed all those years ago for it was the same exactly as she remembered it was a searing molten kiss that felt like two forces were being hauled together and fused into one it was a whitehot heat that made her heart twist with longing and desire and love ben she couldnt pull away where was the strength for that nowhere how could she ever have thought she could love jacques shed tried so hard and shed failed and she knew it was no character flaw in jacques that had prevented itthough heaven knew it should have been it was because she considered herself irrevocably married to this man her heart but here was no happy ending ben had been raised to never give his heart how could such a man change how could such a man admit a need he couldnt but she did oh she did she thought as her body melted into his she kissed him back with a fierceness that matched his own she loved him with every fibre of her being willing him to soften willing him to love her as she loved him his hands were tugging her against him he felt wonderfula big man superbly muscled strengthened by years of military training moving from emergency to emergency running he was still running she thought in that tiny fragment of her mind that was available for such thoughtwhich wasnt much admittedly but it was enough to tinge this kiss with sadness to tinge it with the inevitability of parting he was so right for her she was so right for him her breasts moulded against his chest as if she was somehow meant to be there theyd been made in one cast and then split somehow and now for this tiny fragment of time the two halves of the whole had come together there had to be a way there had to the kiss extended for as long as a kiss could without moving to the next stepthe seemingly inevitable step for a man and a woman whod loved before and whod been apart for seven long years she couldnt take that step she thought she mustnt there was no such thing as a one hundred per cent effective birth control and to take another pregnancy back to the island no she managed as he drew back a little and she saw a trace of confusion cross his face no heaven knew where she found the strength to say it but it had to be said no further ben we cant but i dont want another child but that was a lie she thought shed love another child another piece of ben to carry forward into her life without him hey were not about to we might have been about to she whispered but we cant that doesnt make sense i think it does she said and pulled further away just a little just as much as she could bear to ben i love you maybe i do dont say it she said suddenly urgent because you dont you never have you just love the part of me that youre prepared to accept what does that mean he seemed genuinely baffled and she shook her head nothing had changed she thought bitterly this was the same problem theyd had seven years ago oh maybe it had been clearer then the islanders had paid for her medical training and there was no way she could refuse to return but there were two reasons she couldnt be near with ben one was her obligation to her island home and the other was that ben didnt want her ben didnt want her maybe we could work something out he said his voice husky with passion and desire lily ok i dont do family but maybewhat i feel for you therell never be another woman i feel this way about so maybe we could do something marriage or something maybe i could come to the island whenever im on leave she stared at him stunned youre talking marriage i dont know he ran his fingers through his hair in a gesture of pure bewilderment but we have to do somethingto make this work for benjy how can i be a father to him if youre not there and if we were married would that make you feel better about me being theresometimes youre asking me to marry you because of benjy i want you too lily two weeks a year however long i can spare ill try you cant justtry but then she looked into his eyes and saw his confusion and she felt her heart twist he was trying he was trying so hard this was her ben if she said yes hed sweep her into bed right now she thought and that was what she wanted more than anything else in the world all she had to do was say yes and hed marry her and benjy would have a father and then and then hed leave for the next crisis would you think of us while you were away she asked and the look of surprise she saw in his eyes answered her question before he spoke of course i would he said but she didnt believe him did you remember i was on kapua yes sam said you didnt sam sam talks too much she whispered but he answered my questions he knows you well sam and so do doug and rosa they say you never stay long enough anywhere to be involved you run like youre terrified of what happens if you lose your heart psychoanalysis by rosa and doug and by sam and by lily she whispered what did they do to you those parents of yours to make you so fearful she hesitated ben what happened to bethany bethany your sister all the time we spent together you never told me you had a sister she died when i was six its old news did you love her hell lily i was tiny did you love her that is none of your business and its nothing to do with what i am now im a grown man yes you are she took a deep breath and im a grown woman a woman who thought about you every day that we were apart whod die a little if you died and who feels sick that you lost someone you loved and you wont talk about it but you wont youve closed off god knows if its because of your sister i dont you wont let me near enough to find out but ben if any of us went missingdoug or rosa or me or benjy or sam or anyone else who cares for youwould you miss us of course be truthful ben he paused she stepped back a little the veranda light was on and she could see his face clearly what she saw there answered her question without him finding the words youll never let yourself get that close she whispered will you lily im saying i think i love you he sounded exasperated rather than passionate she thought he soundedconfused im offering marriage she shook her head how can you say you think you love me dont you know how can i know ill tell you she said anger coming to her aid loves great but its opening yourself again to that chasm of loss its lots else besides but its definitely not putting a signature on a piece of paper and a deal to spend a few days each year together i cant of course you cant she said anger fading and a bleak acceptance taking its place of course you cant i should never have agreed to come here im putting more pressure on you than you can bear even by telling you that benjy is your son you should have if i had maybe the pressure would have been on you for the last seven years and maybe you would have fallen properly in love or maybe you would have cracked under the strain i dont know but i do know that i need to back off now i need to let you be im going to bed now ben she said and somehow she kept her voice resolute im going to bed alone and ill stay that way because no marriage at all is better than the one youre offering i have to stay sane for benjys sake if not my own lily if i were you id take another walk up to blair peak she told him i think you need it more than i do oh and ben yes it was a clipped response he was angry she thought and she knew it was confusion that was causing the anger he thought he was doing the right thingthe noble thing and she was rejecting that absolutely how hurtful was that practicalities when in doubt talk medicine ben rosas really worried about doug she told him and somehow her voice was steady and it worked shed deflected him she thought seeing the relief in his eyes medicine was the great escape dont worry about me she said dont worry about benjy well be fine worry instead about doug who isnt fine she saw the confusion fade still more she saw him clutch at medical need as if he was clutching a lifeline how long has he had pain rosa says for months but hes admitting little and he wont see a doctor rosa says hes been waiting for you for me he demanded startled why the hell im not his doctor no she said softly theres an attachment there that i dont think youre admitting either she hesitated rosas scared its worse than dougs letting on she thinks doug might want to talk to you about caring for rosa if hed know i would you would what look after rosa but i need to find out whats wrong youll look after rosa how if anything happened to doug she could hardly stay here this is a dumb conversation nothings happening to doug hes showing every sign of worrying himself into a coronary sure he needs an examination and maybe treatment but the best thing you could do is what youre incapable of doing which is giving yourself she whispered telling rosa youll be here for her ill look after her the same way youd be husband and father to us no she said sadly thats no use to anyone oh ben and she turned before he could say another word she walked into the house and let the screen door slam behind her he did indeed walk up to blairs peak but the answers werent there she was asking too much of him he told the night but he knew that was a falsehood he was afraid shed accused him of not loving of not throwing his heart into the ring and letting fate take a hand she was right why he needed a shrink he decided but he sat up on the peak and he knew the answers were already his for the first time in more than twenty years he let himself think about bethany at six hed been sent to boarding school lots of kids were sent to boarding school at six they survived and hed hardly seen anything of his parents anyway he could hardly say hed missed them but thered been his kid sister bethany had been four years old to his six his little sister even now the memories of her were warm and strong with an assortment of nursery staff caring for them bethany had been his constant shed suffered from asthma he still remembered the terror of her attacks the feeling of helplessness as shed gasped for breath his sixyearold self telling untrained nursery staff what to do and then his father leaving him at boarding school wholl look after bethany hed demanded and he could remember his desperation the fear shell be looked after his father had said brusquely you look after yourself there had been nothing else to do hed looked after himself but bethany had died before the year had ended the school matron had told him of her death her face crumpling with sympathy moving to hug him but hed wanted none of it his parents hadnt come near him he looked after himself any shrink in the world would tell him that was holding him back now he knew it himself but to break through he couldnt he justcouldnt even blair peak had no answers chapter ten breakfast the next morning was a strained affair once again doug had gone to enormous trouble frying homecured bacon making pancakes setting the big kitchen table with fine china old and fragile lily looked across at dougs strained face it was better than looking at the silent ben she thought and there was enough tension on dougs face to make her concerned why had he used the best china the kitchen was equipped with a dishwasher but china like this would have to be handwashed she concentrated on this small domestic problem rather than let herself think about ben ben was eating silently while benjy was watching him with a certain degree of speculation the knowledge that ben was his father was clearly of immense importance to benjy and he was cautiously reassessing the man before him for parental qualities all in all it didnt make for a casual breakfast think about doug she told herself dougs eyes were as strained as lily felt and she wondered just how bad his chest pain was rosa and benjy could take flicker down to the river this morning she suggested ben and i will do the washingup you need to take a rest doug she told him with a sideways warning glance to ben you look as tired as i felt three weeks ago but the elderly man was having none of it dont be daft girl he said youve lots of catching up to do and if i know ben hell be flying out of here before we know it no he wont lily started but then she looked uncertainly at ben will you the choppers not coming back till tomorrow ben said but if i need to i can delay it thats what you call plenty of time doug said derisively to get to know your son if thats all the time you have theres no way im taking up any of it doug im really worried about your chest pain lily said bluntly if he really was hiding pain im having no more pain now than ive been having for months i read about it on the internet itll be angina my mother had it for years and she died when she was ninety seven he managed a shaky grin she was hit by a bus then so that leaves me twenty odd years of angina before i meet my bus if it is angina ben growled we dont know you need to be examined you can listen to my chest this afternoon doug said so much like he was conferring a benevolent favour that they all laughed but even so lilys eyes met bens and she saw her concern reflected there ben really did care she thought he tried desperately not to but he couldnt hide it completely just as doug couldnt hide the fact that he hurt rosa rose and started clearing away plates looking relieved this afternoon youll be examined then she told doug youve agreed before witnesses so theres no wriggling out of it now meanwhile ill do the housework while ben and benjy and lily take flicker to the river you rest thats my final word doug so no arguments doug opened his mouth to arguebut then thought better of it and gave a sheepish grin i can almost understand your reluctance to tie the knot he told ben see what you let yourself in for women he flung up his hands in surrender fine ill have an idle morning as long as you three spend the morning together promise we promise lily said dont we ben id rather examine you now ben said but doug shook his head thats an excuse not to spend time with lily and benjy and you know it ive had this discomfort for months and its going nowhere stop your fussing and enjoy the day so ben lily and benjy led the pregnant mare to the river the day was fabulous but lily wasnt concentrating on the day how could she ever break through this mans barriers she wondered and why wouldnt he talk about his sister his silence hurt but if it hurt her how much more would it be hurting him hes never talked about bethany rosa had told her so i dont see how you can make him start now they walked slowly the mare was so heavy with foal that ben was concerned are we sure we should be taking her out of the home paddock rosa says a bit of exercise does her good benjy told him and she says the grass by the river is horse caviar he thought about that and frowned i dont know what caviar is fish eggs ben told him and benjy wrinkled his nose in disbelief so the grass tastes like fish eggs theres no accounting for taste ben told him and grinned benjy was leading the mare with ben by his side lily was walking behind watching her son and his father the likeness was uncanny she thought the sun was glinting on two dark heads ben had only brought a small holdall with him but he must leave clothes here for hed finally ditched his uniform this morning he was wearing chinos and an opennecked shirt with the sleeves rolled up he looked wonderful lily thought and the longing she had for him the longing that had stayed with her for all those years surged right back as strong as ever she blinked back tears she was right she told herself fiercely she couldnt marry this man she couldnt break down the barriers by herself she could block out this pain but with the marriage he was suggesting it would stay with her all the time she and benjy would have a few short days with him but then hed be off over and over intent on his life of drama putting her and benjy out of his mind not letting himself need there was the crux of the problem she thought she needed ben but he didnt need her and he surely didnt need benjy hed taught himself fiercely not to need and who could blame him why do you like fighting benjy asked him now and she stilled and listened they were trudging slowly toward the river keeping pace with flickers slow amble ben and benjy were at flickers head and lily was behind but ben may as well have been talking to her i dont like fighting he said but when fighting happens people are often wounded thats what happened on your island my job is to fix people after fighting or sometimes i go to where other bad things have happened like tsunamis and earthquakes my mama fixes people benjy said following a line of reasoning yet to be disclosed she does are your people hurt worse than mamas people i guess not it depends and do you get to see the people when theyre better mama says thats the best thing about doctoring she sees people when theyre sick and then one day when theyre better they come to our house and sit on our porch and tell mama how better theyre feeling or the ladies come and show us their babies sometimes mama even cries when she hugs the babies do you cry when you hug babies thats not what i do i guess mamas wouldnt come close to you with babies when youre wearing your scary uniform maybe they wouldnt ben sounded strained to breaking point lily thought he wasnt enjoying this one bit if the helicopter landed right now would he climb aboard i like you better without your uniform benjy told him giving a little skip of contentment as if his line of questioning had achieved the results hed wanted but i need a picture of you in your uniform henri will think its cool but its better like you are now youre more like a real dad now thanks can you kick a football yes can you swim yes will you swim a race with me at the river i didnt bring my gear you can swim in your boxers benjy told him i swim in my boxers then a thought occurred to him doug wears flappy white jocks that make me giggle when rosa hangs them on the clothesline but henris dad wears boxers you dont wear flappy white things do you umno ace benjy said satisfied mama can hold flicker and well go swimming doesnt your mama go swimming someone has to look after flicker shes the mama thats not very fair im happy to watch lily volunteered from behind them after all benjy can go swimming with his mama every day how often can he go swimming with his dad so she sat on the grassy bank watching her son and his father swim while flicker grazed contentedly beside her benjy swam like a little fish island kids practically swam before they could walk and lily took it as a given but she saw now that ben was astounded by his small sons skill this was no splashingintheshallows swim this was an exercise in benjy showing his dad exactly what sort of kid he had he weaved and ducked around bens legs surfacing when least expected doing handstands so his small feet were all that was seen above the water challenging ben to a race but ben was a fine swimmer too they raced from one tree fallen by the river bank to another three hundred yards upstream lily watched as ben started to race she saw him check his pace and she knew he was holding back so benjy could win she grinnedand she saw the exact moment when ben realised benjy had been checking his pace as well but only so he could put on a burst of speed at the end benjys small body surged ahead and suddenly ben was left behind his raw strength wasnt enough to compensate for the lead hed given benjy benjy surfaced glowing laughing at ben and then calling triumphantly to his mother he thought he had to give me a head start he yelled to lily so i won more fool him race again lily decreed so they did this time ben didnt hold back he used all his strength and all his skilland he only just won you beat me benjy said growing happier by the minute mama cant beat me a daddy should be able to beat his kid then stop getting better ben growled but watching him lily saw his sudden flash of pride and then shock up until then fatherhood had been some sort of abstract concept she thought sure hed been shocked to learn of benjys existence and then hed been concerned about him but this was something else this child was his sonthis little boy who had so much life ahead of him who had so much potential to be proud of swimming was one tiny thing but thered be so much more as he grew little and big lily watched as myriad emotions washed across bens face and she wondered how he was going to handle this she thought how shed felt as kira had handed over her newborn son to her six years ago and she saw those same emotions reflected now on bens face now we can make sand bombs benjy announced can you make sand bombs dont worry if you cant cos ill teach you it was a day of wonders benjy had a father a father he could be proud of and he intended to milk it for all it was worth if youre leaving tomorrow we have to hurry up he told ben i can teach you to fish im a really good fisherman can you teach me to shoot with guns that was a discordant note but it didnt spoil the day im a doctor mate ben told his son i might wear army fatigues but i dont shoot youd shoot if you had to i wont have to benjy thought about that and found it was acceptable ok then can you ride a horse the only bad part of the day was the discussion that went on after ben examined doug doug managed to hold ben off until late afternoon but finally ben told him if he didnt submit then he rosa lily and benjy would subdue him by force doug didnt smile which was a measure of how frightened he really was lily thought and when ben came out of the bedroom after the examination his face confirmed those fears hell rosa how long has he had this level of pain i dont know rosa bit her lip looking suddenly old six months that hes admitted to me maybe longer he only admitted it to me when i found him in the kitchen one night looking grey and sick he said it was indigestion but i didnt believe him but you didnt insist he see a doctor rosa swallowed maybe i was afraid to she whispered my dad died of a heart attack to admit doug has a bad hearti just kept hoping youd come home they thought of ben almost as their son lily thought there was such a depth of emotion in rosas voice i just kept hoping youd come home and ben heard it she watched his face and there were was an echo there of the emotions hed felt that morning he had a son and now he had something akin to parents and a wife he couldnt accept any of those things she saw the tiny flare of panic behind his eyes and she thought there was no way hed take this further parents son wife the whole domestic catastrophe no theres definite arrhythmia he told rosa and lily knew that once again he was seeking some sort of refuge in medicine his voice was brusque and strained theres something badly wrong his blood pressures high as well im guessing hes had some sort of infarcta heart attack maybe thats what it was the night you said he was in such pain hes telling me the pains not so bad now but hes still uncomfortable which means the pain before must have been awful dear god rosa whispered colour draining from her face she clutched at lily you think bens not saying hes going to die lily told her guiding her into a chair by the stove benjy had gone to his bedroom to sort story books he wanted ben to read to him that night and she thanked god for it the sight of rosas face would have terrified him rosa how old was your dad when he died ben asked softly and lily nodded silently agreeing with his line of questioning lets get to the heart of the terror here fiftythree rosa whispered almost twenty years younger than doug is now he had pain just like doug and there wasnt anything we could do about it one day his heart stopped just like that so i thoughtwhen doug started getting the painwell what can doctors do thats why i didnt insist hes better staying here for whatever time he has left theres lots doctors can do ben told her and lily thought he really was a good doctor tensions forgotten he was facing down terror with confidence and reassurance you must have heard of bypass surgery yes but no buts ben told her im listening to dougs heart and im hearing a heart under strain im not a specialist and itll take tests to find out exactly whats wrong but im suspecting he has minor blockages one or more of the blood vessels running to or from the heart have probably narrowed to the point where the blood supply is compromised forty years ago there was nothing we could do now bypass surgery is so common its done routinely in every major hospital lily will concur i concur lily murmured so all we need to do is get doug to one of those hospitals hell never agree he has agreed ben said then he added ruefully though not as soon as id like how soon would you like now ben said promptly with pain like his hes a walking time bomb but hes refusing to leave until i leave but youre not leaving until tomorrow ben said theres a medivac helicopter in the area tomorrow it was tentatively due to collect me but ill radio them to pick us both up and that will be that lily thought hed found an excuse to run you shouldnt go yet rosa whispered i need to go i was only intending to stay for a couple of days and i need to accompany doug of course you do lily thought bitterly the medical imperative can i come too rosa asked and then she bit her lip but i cant leave the farm flicker ill organise for someone to fly in and take over ben told her itll be twentyfour hours at most then well fly you out to join doug itll need to be someone whos good with horses rosa was clearly torn flickers due within the next week itll be someone whos good with horses ben assured her you know i inherited three farms from my parents i still keep them as working farms and i have excellent staff on each ill transfer someone here as soon as i can when dougs recovered well bring him back and ill leave someone here to help as long as you need thank you rosa whispered her eyes suddenly brimming with tears i think can i go and see doug now of course ben told her but he stays in bed and rests until we leave if he doesnt then i call in a medivac team right now thats fine by me rosa whispered and fled which left the two of them facing off over the kitchen table she should shut up lily thought dully she should say nothing there was nothing to be gained by conflict but she was going to have to tell benjy that ben was definitely leaving the thought of his disappointment made her cringe so theres no doctor on the medivac chopper sorry you know very well what i mean i assume the chopper will be bringing someone back to this district from the city is that what you meant when you said itd be in the area tomorrow yes since when has the medivac service carried patients without a medical team i didnt ask you didnt ask whether thered be a doctor on board she raised her brows in disbelief maybe we can ask now doug wants me to go with him hes terrified and so are you what are you talking about youre falling in love with your son she said softly for you thats even more terrifying than falling in love with me so youre running the trouble is ill back off im not sure benjy will hell be back on your island and i wont see him it was a gut response he said it and then realised what hed said it was an acknowledgement of fear an acknowledgement that he was putting as much distance as possible between himself and his embryonic family coward lily whispered im not a coward rosa told me about bethany how many years have i known you ben yet you never told me about your sister youve been running since then rosa had no right and im not running you know you are its you whos refusing to marry me thats a joke you dont know what marriage is its surely not waiting for you to drop in for a few days each year lily leave it she said dully but dont pretend to be hurt because i wont marry you youre not asking me to marry you you dont know what the word means they ate a desultory dinnersteak cooked by lily and not even close to the wonderful food doug had preparedand then lily and benjy went for a walk to say goodnight to flicker rosa went to sit with doug and ben was left to his own devices hed expected to spend that evening with benjy hed thought maybe they could do something togethersome sort of bonding thing he thought like taking a cricket bat and hitting a few balls he only had tonight he should be angry that benjy had elected to go with his mother and talk to a horse rather than spend time with him but benjy had watched him over the dining table and had made his own decision benjy had lost kira only a few weeks ago that pain would be still be raw maybe he wasnt going to put himself in the position where it hurt again or maybe it already hurt ben had been there when lily had told benjy that ben would be leaving in the morning hed seen his face shut down he knew that look hed perfected it himself so so stay he told himself as he walked out onto the veranda in front of the house was the home paddock benjy and lily would be there with flicker he could join them but his feet turned the other way he walked down to the beach found a likely looking sandhill and sat and watched the moon over the water out there was kapua home to lily and benjy he could get there twice a year he thought or maybe even more if he made the visits brief whenever he had a decent leave he could spend a few days with benjy but he had a night free now and benjy had elected to go with his mother as lily had elected to stay with benjy were all protecting ourselves he told the night he thought about the plan theyd made for the medical services for kapua and the outlying islands lily could take over the role of medical director but there was another major position to be advertised director of remote medical servicesa doctor whod be based in kapua but who would take care of the outlying islands he and sam had listed the requirements for such a position emergency medicine an ability to work alone experience in tropical medicine and preference would be given to someone with a pilots licencesomeone who in an emergency could take control of a helicopter hey i know someone who fits this sam had said do you ben had ignored him hed had to because if he ever took a job like that then every night hed come home to lily and benjy so lily was quite simply the loveliest woman hed ever met would ever meet the way he felt about her was nonnegotiable and benjy was great benjy was his son so why the terror why the icecold feeling that gripped his guts whenever he thought about taking things further committing not to a marriage but to a relationship where benjy and lily were permitted to need him maybe he should just jump in at the deep end try it out and see but if he failed hed looked at lilys face tonight over the dinner table and hed looked at benjys and hed seen the same wooden look of pain hed hurt them already how much more would he hurt them if he committed he wanted lily to commit no he didnt he saw it now more clearly than hed seen it at any time in his life lily was prepared to throw her heart into the ring and maybe so was benjy but didnt they understand that he could crush it if he wasnt capable coward he told himself but it didnt help a thing lily lay in the dark and stared at the ceiling she was under no illusions tomorrow ben would leave shed see him next when he made a flying visit to kapua to see his son so what was different shed lived with loneliness for seven long years but now she didnt even have kira she hadnt wept for the old woman shed stood at the graveside and her face had stayed wooden shed felt wooden but now she wanted kira and the pain she felt for the wonderful woman whod been part of her life for so long was suddenly so acute she couldnt bear it and it was mixed up with the way she felt about ben shed loved and shed lost shed never admitted to herself that she hoped ben might resurface in her life shed even finally agreed to marry jacques but maybe that thought had always been therethat tiny flare of hope and now it was dead as kira was dead life went on as a doctor shed seen grief from many angles and she knew that grief could finally be set aside but not tonight the house was asleep her son was asleep she wasnt needed there was no one to see her dr lily cyprano buried her head in her pillow and she wept breakfast the next morning was dreadful none of them seemed to have appetites doug had refused to stay in bed but he was grimfaced and silent he looked strained and ill lily thought and even though it meant ben would leave she was relieved for dougs sake doug needed specialist medical intervention urgently she even found it in herself to be grateful ben was going with him that must give some reassurance to rosa rosa trusted ben implicitly maybe she did too when will everyone be coming back benjy asked in a small voice pushing his toast away uneaten doug will be back here in a couple of weeks lily told him after the doctors have fixed him up what about my dad they all waited for ben to answer that but he didnt he concentrated on buttering his toast and lily stopped thinking she trusted him implicitly and instead allowed anger to surge she glowered across the table at ben low life she told herself but it didnt work she couldnt produce anger he wasnt someone she could be angry with she thought miserably he was just ben a man so wounded by life that he could never make a recovery well be gone by the time ben gets back she told benjy gently but hes promised to visit us on kapua that was something but not enough benjy sniffed and sniffed again heroically holding back the tears lily had shed the night before come out with me to see how flicker is this morning rosa suggested rising from her own uneaten breakfast and casting an uncertain look at her husband youre ready bring on the chopper doug said morosely youve packed everything i could possibly need while you cleaned the kitchen she snapped he got up at dawn and scrubbed out the cupboards she told ben and lily of all the obstinate pigheaded go out with the boy doug said please rosa youre making me nervous fine rosa muttered there was still half an hour before the helicopter was due and she looked strained to the point of collapse ill check on the chopper time ben said and lily knew he wanted the chopper to be there now just for doug or was he running too of course he was running lily i need to run through what has to be done here while were away doug told her dragging his eyes from his wifes strained face if youre to stay here until ben sends help then i need to make a list fine lily told him rosa and benjy went out one door ben went out the other she stared at the closed door for a momentand then turned back to doug doug had turned to the bench to find a pad and pencil he lifted the pencil a couple of inches from the pad oh he said in a tiny startled voice and he dropped the pencil doug nothing she saw his eyes focus inward doug by the time lily reached him he was sliding lifelessly onto the floor ben lily was screaming even as she broke dougs fall she lowered him to the floor taking his weight hed slumped between a chair and the bench she shoved the chair out of the way with her feet it crashed into another and splintered she didnt notice doug wasnt breathing she had her fingers on his neck frantically trying to find a pulse none ben she screamed again shed been three weeks away from medicine but she was all doctor now she hauled doug onto his back ripping his shirt open ben hed heard the door slammed open and ben was with her shoving the mess of furniture out of the way so savagely that the chair leg lily had broken splintered off and skittered over the linoleum check his airway lily snapped and ben was already doing it feeling in dougs mouth turning his face to the side as lily thumped down on his chest ben stooped and breathed into dougs mouth then straightened let me he told lily and she knew at once what he meant cpr needed strength and he had more of it than she did do we have any oxygen she demanded no his hands were already striking dougs chest over and over trying desperately to put pressure on his heart as lily gave the next breath come on doug dont you dare die come on doug please come on his eyes didnt leave dougs face as the cpr continued strong and sure and as rhythmic as lily could possibly want please please lily couldnt talk but she could pray over and over please she breathed and she waited and she breathed and she prayed and she breathed and prayed some more there was a roaring overhead and it was the backdrop to her prayer building in volume as she breathed and ben swore and pushed downward over and over please the door swung inward doug its the helicopter it was rosa she took one step inside the door and stopped dead as she saw what was in front of her her hands flew to her face her colour draining oh god rosa is that the medivac chopper bens voice was curt and hard slicing across her terror doug rosa tell me his order was almost brutal is that the medivac chopper yes or no yes she whispered her face was as ashen as dougs and she clutched for the table for support but ben would have none of it terror was an indulgence they had no time for then run he told her we need oxygen and a defibrillator theyll have them on board run rosa well save him yet rosa gave a gasp of sheer dreadand turned and ran there was no choice but to continue lily kept on breathing shed never done artificial respiration without an airway but there was no hesitation doug felt like family it had to work please then at first she thought she was imagining it it was the air she was breathing in for him that was making his chest rise but no she drew back as ben kept applying pressure and she saw it again chest movement she wasnt causing ben she screamed and he drew back just a little and she was right dougs chest rose imperceptibly all by itlsef a weak shudder ran through his body and his eyes flickered then rosa waas back bursting through the door with a man and a woman behind her they were dressed in the uniforms of the australian medivac service rosa must have been coherent enough to make herself heard for the woman was carrying a medical bag and the man was carrying a defibrillator but maybe blessedly a defibrillator wouldnt be needed oxygen ben snpped not taking his eyes off doug we have a pulse dear god one of the newcomersthe womanwas hauling open her medical bag lily grabbed an oxygen mask and was fitting it to dougs face before the girl could make a demur the man was carrying an oxygen cylinder as well as the defibrillator he set it on the floor and ben fitted it swiftly to the tube attached to dougs mask he watched dougs chest every minute as did they all they had no attached monitorall they could go by was the rise and fall of dougs chest but it rose and it fell lets get an iv line up ben snapped the two newcomers ad obviously realised by now that ben was a doctoror maybe they already knewand theyd merged seamlessly into a highly skilled team there were now four medics and the right equipment and suddenly doug had a chance more than a chance his eyes flickered open again and this time they stayed open dont try to talk lily said urgently doug youve had a heart attack but youre ok youll be fine if you stay still rosa he didnt say the word but lily saw his lips move and knew what he wanted she shifted a little so he could see his wife and rosa could see him shes here lily said and she felt like bursting into tearsbut of course she didnt because she was a doctor and doctors didnt weep over their patients no matter how much they felt like it but she looked across dougs body at ben and she saw exactly the same emotion on bens face as she was feeling herself doctors didnt cry no matter how much they wanted to and after all bens conniving the choosing of who would leave the farm today was now decided differently the two medivac officers were dr claire tynall and harry hooper a nurse trained in intensive care claire and harry took over dougs care with smooth efficiency fitting a heart monitor adjusting the oxygen supply transferring doug to a stretcher that could be raised onto wheels so he could be could be transferred easily to the chopper there was space for one more person in the helicopter and it wasnt going to be ben i need to go with him rosa sobbed and ben agreed of course you do lily could you pack her some essentials while we get doug into the chopper so lily did a fast grab from rosa and dougs residence while they loaded him doug was at risk of arresting again they had to get him to a major cardiac unit fast i hope this is all you need lily told rosa as she ran to the helicopter to find doug and rosa already aboard buy whatever else you need and put it down to me ben said gruffly ill be with you as soon as i can then as rosas face crumpled in distress he climbed up into the chopper and gave rosa a swift hug that was it ben climbed down again the door slammed shut the chopper rose into the morning sky it hung above their head for an instant then headed inland ben and lily were left standing side by side staring after it its ok lily ben said as if reassuring himself we did good he reached out and touched her hand we did didnt we she said and her voice broke she pulled awayjust a little but enough it was suddenly enormously important that she didnt touch him she was very close to complete disintegration shed seen deaths from cardiac arrest many times in her professional life but today well things had changed shed stayed independent too she thought but ben had come back to her and now her independence was a thing of the past but she had to find it again she had to hell be ok ben muttered as the sound of he helicopter faded to nothing he shoved his hands deep into his pockets and lily thought he looked as strained as rosa had he loved these people he will be she said softly in the voice she might have used for a frightened family member after a trauma he lookedbewildered i yes he was more than bewildered he was in shock she thought but she had to move on i need to find benjy she managed are you ok of course im ok he said and he seemed to give himself a mental shake why wouldnt i be because someone you love almost died i dont love yes you do she whispered she held his gaze for a moment watching what looked like a struggle behind his eyes had he not realised how important doug and rosa were to him they were desperately important she thought maybe in the same way kira had been important to her the aching void of loss slammed home again as it had hit home time and time again since kiras death but at least kira had died knowing she was loved lily thought at least shed told the old lady that she was loved and so had benjy had ben ever told rosa and doug they were loved had he admitted it to himself youll see them soon she said softly and he flinched sure he shook his head somehow hauling himself back under some sort of control illill get someone here to take over the farm as soon as i can because you want to see doug and rosa or because you want to leave us lily wondered but she didnt say it she had to do a bit of selfprotection here too ii need to find benjy she repeated she needed to give her little boy a hugmostly because she needed a hug herself the totally incontrol ben blayden seemed somehow now right out of his comfort zone he was staring ahead like he was looking into an abyss and maybe he was even considering jumping ok he managed lets findlets find our son our son lily thought our son but he was already moving away questions had to wait chapter eleven finding benjy was easier said than done despite the emotional nuances between lily and ben almost as soon as she thought about benjy lily was aware of a wave of unease where was he as she hurried back to the house she forced herself to rewind the events of the last halfhour rosa and benjy had gone out to talk to flicker but then rosa had hurried back to tell them the helicopter was there benjy may well have stayed with flicker but he must have seen the helicopter land she thought wouldnt he have come back to the house by now ben was by her side but before she reached the house shed started to run leaving him behind can you check the front of the house she called she ran up the veranda steps just inside the back door benjy no benjy ok he must still be with flicker she walked back out onto the veranda expecting to see benjy on his favourite perch on the end of the water trough where he talked to flicker in these last weeks flicker had become benjys new best friend someone to talk to when adults didnt cut it but the trough was bare he must be in the house lily thought retracing her steps had he come in while theyd been trying to save doug what had he seen benjy had suffered too much trauma for one small boy she reached the back door again and started to call but then she turned again to stare down at the home paddock shed almost missed it her eyes had swept the paddock looking for benjy but now she did another long perusal there were no other animals in the home paddock the other four horses were grazing in the pasture on the far side of the river it was only flicker who was kept this side as rosa wanted her close for foaling but the gate at the far side of the paddock was open and flicker was gone she catapulted down the back steps ben came around the corner of the house and she almost ran into him whoa he said reaching out and steadying her hes not out the front isnt he here nno she stammered neither is flicker the gates open ben stilled without releasing lily he turned to check the paddock nothing would he have tried to take her to the river maybe he would lily whispered he was so upset about you going if he and rosa were getting flicker ready for her daily walk and rosa came back inside lets go side by side they ran down the track leading to the pasture where they normally brought the mare to graze they reached the rocky outcrop at the bend to the horse pasture and stopped dead as they saw the deserted river bank before them no horse no small boy shes a strong horse lily whispered at the fork in the track even rosa sometimes has a battle turning her this way rosa says she wants to join the other horses closer to the sea ben said and they were already moving hell its marsh down there if the horse gets stuck and it seemed that was just what had happened for most of its length this river was deep and fast surging from the mountains to form a swiftrunning channel but at its mouth it broadened and shallowed on the far side of the river was a rocky incline delineating the edge but not this side because it was summer and the water from the mountain catchment was less the width of river had narrowed there was now thirty or forty yards of riverflat on this side normally under water but now dry or almost dry on the far side of the river lily saw the other four horses belonging to the property they were staring over the river toward a clump of rocks for a moment she couldnt see what they were staring at and then appallingly she did flicker was there halfhidden by the rocks lily hadnt seen her because shed been searching for something of horse height and flicker was now a lot lower than horse height the mare had taken herself halfway across the flat trying to reach her companions and then shed sunk she was up to her withers in mud struggling to free herself from what looked to be an impossible situation her world stilled where was benjy dear god where was benjy but ben was there before her benjy ben was yelling his sons name breaking into a run across the mud regardless of whether it was safe or not benjy im here it was a terrified wail from behind the horse dad im here help me she was running almost as fast as ben the ground gave a little under her feet but she was moving too fast to sink it was firm enough to hold herjustbut it was a miracle flicker had got this far out ben reached the horse before she did by the time she reached them he was around the other side of flicker and there was benjy he was still clutching the halter as if he alone could stop the mare sinking but the mares struggles had made the ground at her head a quagmire it looked a glutinous mess that had hauled benjy into it as well as the mare hed sunk to his chest and the mares struggles were driving them both deeper but ben had him he sat on the ground behind benjy with his legs on either side of his son his arms came around benjys chest and he leaned backward dont struggle he told benjy just go limp in my arms let me do the work he looked at the mare hush he told her and crazily the mare stopped struggling for a little she looked wildeyed and as terrified as benjy but maybe bens bedside manner was not bad for horses either but lily had eyes only for benjy she sat as ben was doingthe mud only sucked you in if there was a big weight on a small surface so she presented the mud with her backside and prayed it was big enough she was desperate to help but ben had benjy fast in his arms fighting for the mud to give up its prize and it did slowly gradually benjy was eased outward then wonderfully as his torso came free the rest of him came in a rush and ben sprawled backward his arms full of mud and boy lily reached for him but ben wasnt relinquishing him they lay in the mud a tangle of legs and arms and mud and pure emotion bens small shoulders were shaking with sobs and his face was a blotched and crumpled mess he lay on bens chest while lily reached out and ran her fingers through his hair and felt her heart go cold at the thought of what might have been she kept pulling benjy sobbed at them still cradled against his father i tried to take her to the nice grass but she wouldnt come and she keeps sinking more oh benjy itll be ok its not ok benjy managed hiccuping on a sob his small body might be crumpled against ben gathering comfort but he was made of stern stuff and hed only slumped a little and now he was pulling away shes stuck and we have to help her he bit his lip trying valiantly not to cry any more enough this was her baby lily sat up and tugged him away from ben into her arms sweetheart lets think about you first well look after flicker but we need to check you are you hurt were you kicked nno just stuck so nothing hurts now my dad pulled me out of the mud benjy whispered so im ok its what your dad does best lily whispered back holding him close hes very very good at making people ok just lucky we had him here hey there was a moments silence lily very carefully didnt look at benbut it was a struggle tell us what happened ben managed at last he was sitting up too now taking in the full mess the mare was in or maybe he was trying not to look at his son hed been rocked to the core lily thought and she knew it because she was feeling exactly the same the only difference was that shed known she loved her son to bits ben looked like a thunderbolt had hit him but flicker needed them bens question was waiting to be answered and finally benjy took a deep breath and told them flicker was acting funny when rosa and me came out this morning she kept going back and forth by the gate over and over rosa said maybe somethings happening but then the helicopter came and she said stay with flicker and she went inside and no one came and no one came and flicker was going back and forth and back and forth and i thought id start taking her down to the river like she wants cos youd know where id be but she was still acting funny she was whinnying and looking behind her all the time and then she came the wrong way she pulled and pulled and i couldnt stop her coming here then she got stuck and every time she fought i went deeper and i couldnt get out of the mud his words ended on a frightened whisper lily hugged him close and looked at ben who was watching them as if as if nothing what can we do this was no time for wondering what ben was thinking she decided she didnt have a clue when had she ever lets check ben edged forward lying by the mares flanks keeping out of range of the churned mud at her head she was still for the moment but quivering in obvious fear and pain he ran his hand down her side and he frowned maybe shes in labour he said and lily winced and held benjy tighter still mare stuck in mud in labour throw us another complication why dont you she demanded and ben managed a smile sorry but lets assume the worst we need equipment what sort of equipment maybe putting the mare down was the kindest option she thought bleakly oh but benjy its not time for that yet ben said his smile fading and she knew hed seen the bleakness of her thoughts benjy i want you and your mother to stay here while i fetch what i need i want you to stay calm and stay away from the churnedup mud and i want you to try and keep flicker calm as well no more struggling ill be as fast as i can he hesitated then he moved back to where they sat and touched benjy lightly on the cheek then with the same muddy finger he touched lily it was a feather touch and why the touch of a mudcaked finger should warm herwhy it reassured her that all was wellshe didnt know but it did great beside manner she managed and he smiled again the doctor will make it all better he said just keep on believing that you two but the doctor had better move ill be back as soon as i can be stay calm it was all very well staying calm and controlled when ben was close but the moment he disappeared it got a lot harder but she was a doctor too lily decided so conjure up your own bedside manner she told herself right we have to stay calm she told benjy sternly and they both turned to looked at the mare her eyes were wild and fearful and while they watched lily saw a ripple pass over her glossy hide a muscle contraction labour lily had been in some tricky delivery situations before but none surpassed this ben will know what to do she murmured more to herself than to benjy or flicker hes gone to get what we need what did they need a crane did farms have cranes she knew the answer to that would be no she reached out across the mud and touched the mares nose but flicker snorted and flung back her head in alarm its ok girl lily told her but maybe the mare heard the lack of certainty in her voice i sang her a kira song before you came benjy whispered she went down so far i thought she might go all the way i was scared id be pulled down too and i didnt know what else to do so i just held onto her and sang that was a really sensible thing to do lily said swallowing hard at the thought of the bravery hed shown she thought of what sensible things she could do and she came up with only one suggestion do you think we could both sing ok benjy said doubtfully i will if you will so they did and it was dumb but it seemed to work they sat on the soft ground in front of the marebut not so close as to alarm her or be sucked down as well lily held benjy on her knee and they sang together the songs kira had taught both of them soft island songs meant to pacify a child before sleep they were songs that were meant to murmur that all was right with the world and it was safe all wasnt right with her world lily thought but ben had saved her son and hed save the horse as wellshe knew it so she held benjy tight and she sang until finally ben reappeared driving the farm truck he parked it just in front of where the ground became soft while lily and benjy finished the song theyd started he climbed from the cab and started unloading gear planks lots and lots of wooden planks each about six feet long spades what looked like tarpaulins lets help lily said but flicker tossed back her head her eyes fearful again benjy you keep singing while i go to help ben shes your friend ok benjy said but im scared bens here now flicker will be fine the best person to be here in an emergency is an emergency doctor youll see by the time she reached him ben had almost finished unloading he smiled at lily as she approached the same way he might smile at a terrified patient well get her out youre as worried as i am she accused and he gave a rueful smile i might be and if we cant get her out ive called the local vet for backup and the local vet would be how local hes half an hours drive away so hell be here in half an hour not quite hell be here half an hour after he delivers a heifer of her first calf oh great i brought the rifle he muttered and lily gulped um that was never a backup plan in her sort of medicine its only if she breaks anything or starts to struggle deeper he said she cant deliver a foal where she is we dont know shes in labour im sure shes having contractions right his lips compressed so we get her out before she has her baby how dig he said and handed over a spade were in this together they were they laid planks around the mare giving themselves a solid place to work right the next thing was to stop the mare sinking further ben knelt on one side of the mare and shoved a tarpaulin under her belly talking softly to her all the time lily knelt on the other side flickers belly was resting on mud sinking a little beneath the surface ben worked his way in from one side lily burrowed from the other flicker stayed still and they were able to drag the tarp through there were three more contractions as they worked now what lily demanded struggling to her feet again a heap of mud coming with her now we dig ben said benjy you keep singing youre exactly what flicker needs lily were working down from about six feet in front of her digging what will act as a ramp outward from her hooves well be sliding planks in as we dig and then well cover them with canvas she should be able to get purchase really got any other suggestions nope lily said and started to dig they worked for half an hour digging forward steadily lily wasnt half the digger ben was but every few minutes they swapped so the trench they were creating was even fifteen minutes into the digging lily had blisters on blisters but she would die rather than admit it the thought of the rifle in the back of the truck was the best of spurs and all the time benjy sang in a high quavery voice that held the occasional sob every time he paused the horse became agitated again rolling her eyes pulling back her legs had no purchase in the mud and shed almost ceased trying to get herself out but lily was worrying now about shock how did you tell if a horse was in shock can we contact the vet and see if we can give her a sedative she asked as she dug im imagining a sedative will cross the placenta the same as in human babies wouldnt you say yes but i already asked the vet ben said grimly no sedative lets just dig so dig they did forming a sloping hole downward until they had what was essentially a ramp from close to the mares front legs they left about a foot of mud between the hole and the mares legs deciding theyd break through in one hit at the end fearing she might lash out finally the hole was dug swiftly they lined it with boards and covered the boards with canvas shoving the canvas under the boards at the ends and the sides so as soon as the horse was on it her weight would hold it in place now we just have to break through ben muttered lily hold her halter talk to her see if you can distract her ben didnt want to get kicked lily thought and she was in complete agreement neither did he want her to surge forward when only one leg was free ok benjy were into distraction the mare was in obvious pain now labour must be advancing her eyes were panicked and lily thought it was more than being stuck that was panicking her she had to distract the mare from painand from ben she knelt on the mud to the side of the mare and tugged flickers halter making her look sideways rather than straight ahead no struggling she said sternly benjy tell your friend bens trying to help flicker look at us she jerked the halter look at us ben was in the hole he was scraping at the last of the mud trying to break through nearly there the last barrier of mud was collapsing down on itself freeing the mares legs flicker appeared not to notice her eyes were looking inward there was a foal in there battling to come out ok ben muttered and hauled himself up and onto the far side of the hole from lily he reached out and grabbed the other side of flickers halter lets get you out gorgeous lily pull lily staggered to her feet stand aside ben ordered benjy shall i sing bens face was a picture of bewilderment fear and the beginnings of excitement no ben said get behind her and shout as loud as you can only her front feet are free benjy said doubtfully staring at flickers still trapped hindquarters and ben grimaced i know he told benjy but shes a strong horse it should be enough it had to be enough lily thought for to dig under the abdomen to free the back legs was impossible itd be impossible even if they had time which they didnt so lily and ben pulled and benjy shouted for a long moment lily thought the mare simply wasnt going to try thered be so many sensations hammering the mare now that being stuck in mud would be the least of them but lily pulled as if she really believed the mare would come free and ben pulled too flicker suddenly hauled a foreleg upward the mud squelching as it released its grip one hoof hit the canvascovered wood and found purchase encouraged she tried the second hoof and it too found purchase now for the big pull ben murmured come on my beauty please lily muttered please and then it happened the mare gave one last despairing whinny found purchase with both hooves and hauled herself forward with a movement so sudden that lily sprawled backward in the mud ben didnt stop the mare was lurching out onto the boards and ben was tugging the mare forward further further leading her as fast as he could over the soft ground so she couldnt sink again while lily lay in the mud and tried to regain her breath man and horse made it to the pasture safe lily lay on the mud and watched them and smiled and smiled benjy came up to her worried about why she hadnt risen and she tugged him down and held him tight and grinned wasnt that the best youre covered in mud just like me and i love it just like i love you oi on dry ground ben was holding the mares head and looking back at them in bemusement benjy could you remind your mother that shes a doctor we have a baby to deliver guys so if youre finished wallowing in the mud maybe you could help what they needed was a nice easy delivery but of course that wasnt going to happen flicker was exhausted and distressed to begin with and she hardly had the strength to push but ben had thought past getting the mare out of the mud hed filled a couple of huge thermos flasks with hot water and hed tossed buckets and rags and rope into the back of the truck practically a whole birthing unit lily noted but no incubator the suns incubator enough ben growled if we can get it out he glanced at benjy who was starting to look distressed again i meant if we can get it out quickly benjy do you think you can keep these buckets full of clean water if you took one over to the river and half filled it then wed have it ready well top it up with hot water from the thermos that way we can have as much warm soapy water as we need stay on the firmer ground where there are rocks to walk on dont go anywhere near where weve been digging sure benjy said desperate to be doing something to help lily was the same she stood in the sun the mud drying hard on her body and felt like she needed direction it was flicker doing the work hold her head ben ordered so she did ben cleaned the mare down a little washing away the worst of the mud the mare submitted to his ministrations with uneasy patience she kept looking behind her as if she couldnt figure what was hurting and then what must have been a deeper contraction hit she whinnied a little and sank to her knees then rolled onto her side wheres the vet lily demanded nervously as benjy lugged over his fourth bucketful of water why do we need a vet ben asked how long do horse labours last i have no idea but lets not panic yet i cant think of anything else to do there speaks a thoroughly competent doctor you went to the same medical school she snapped so what are you doing that is useful any minute youll tell me to go help benjy its better than you both pacing the waiting room he retorted maybe you could go buy some cigars or maybe i can just pace she muttered hurry up flicker id reckon shes doing the best she can how would you know and how would you they glared at each other and ben put his head on one side and surveyed her a strange smile behind his eyes youre beautiful when youre panicking shut up and deliver a foal theres no but his words were cut short the mare gave a mighty heave a gush of water flowed followed seconds later by a tiny hoof two hooves lily murmured come on another contraction no second hoof another contraction no hoof there has to be ben muttered worried and lily guessed what he wanted before he said it she emptied a thermos into the closest bucket then swished soap round in it handing the cake to ben it couldnt be harder than a human baby could it ben was already soaping his arm he felt around the tiny hoof and then had to pause until another contraction had passed now but it wasnt now my hands too big he gasped im not as sure of what im looking for as i am in human birth you try she was already soaping she knelt then figured she was still too high so she lay full length on the ground and waited for the next contraction to pass ease back flicker ben told the mare breathe for a bit i bet she skipped prenatal classes lily muttered irresponsible ladies and then the contraction was past lily soaped her hand some more then carefully slid her fingers past the one tiny hoof where come on her fingers found another hoof fantastic there had to be a nose she thought and then wondered if it was a front hoof or a back hoof did horses come out forward or backward was that a nose she was feeling whatever she shoved her fingers as far back as she could hooked the tiny hoof and hauled it toward her another contraction hit her hand was still trapped she gasped in pain the sensation that of a vice against her hand yike she muttered yike yike yike benjy ben was yelling calling to benjy to leave his final bucket of water and come back we think the foals coming i know whats coming she muttered shes delivering my arm dont you dare call benjy why my language she yelled as another contraction rolled through block your ears the hoof had slithered through her fingers and wasnt forward enough but now she had it again this time she tugged with more certainty heaven knew if it was right but it had to come in her direction so why not aim it that way she just had it where she wanted it when the next contraction hit her hand lifted free the second hoof appeared like magic with a nose and thenand then a foal slithered slowly out into a brandnew world it had been a huge physical effort as well as an emotional one ben looked on as benjy examined the perfect little foal the little boy burst into tears and was gathered into his mothers arms and held ben cleared the foals nose and lifted the tiny creature round to his mothers head so flicker could nuzzle her baby then lie there in exhausted contentment lily had been lying full length during the foals birth and shed now rolled sideways to give ben room to work but she was going nowhere she hugged benjy to her as he sobbed and sobbed and ben thought this was much more than a foal being born this was a culmination of all that had gone beforea month of hell or more than that he looked down at lily bloodstained filthy smiling through her tears holding her son against her breast cradling him to her whispering nothings he loved her he loved them all he thought flicker and foal rosa and doug benjy his son and lily he always had he thought and it was such a massive lightbulb moment that he felt his world shift in some momentous way that he didnt understand but his world hadnt moved from its axis it was as if it had settled back onto an axis that he hadnt known had been missing he thought back to something benjy had said my dad pulled me out of the mud benjy had whispered so im ok his son had needed him and hed been there if benjy needed him again how could he not be close if lily needed him it was exactly the same and more he thought then that it was more than him being needed because what he felt for them both was a need itself he needed them both they might need him but he needed them so desperately that he could never again walk away he hadnt been there for bethany he thought thinking suddenly of his baby sister it hadnt been his fault he hadnt been permitted to be there but hed loved her and now suddenly the grief for her loss settled as if something had been explained that had been tormenting him for years hed loved bethany it was ok to grieve for her she wasntnothing and with that thought the guilt hed been carrying for years suddenly inexplicably eased today hed been there for his son hed been there for lily and he would be again for ever and ever as long as they both lived he needed them this was his family you are my north and my south whod said that hed heard it at a funeral he remembered it had been the wife of a sergeant killed in east timor the woman had stood dryeyed and empty talking to her lost love you are my north and my south hed hardly listened he remembered hearing the words and then consciously deciding that he needed to think about what he was doing the next day he couldnt let himself dwell on it because love like that was terrible only it wasnt hed only thought it was terrible today benjy had called him dad sure it might end he thought as he looked down at his woman and his son the thought of that was empty bleak as hell yet what hed been doing until now was just as bleak to do without that love because one day it might endthat was dumb he could see it now with a clarity that almost blew him away its not just you he said to lily breaking in on the conversation to himself halfway through its more than just you lily looked up at him smiling past her sons rumpled curls its not just me i do love doug and rosa how about that she whispered and smiled at him it was enough he sank to his knees and stooped to kiss her but she had her arms full of child and his kiss went awry as it had to in these crazy circumstances but then he knew his intention and maybe she did too for she was still smiling her eyes full of unshed tears but the beginnings of joy not far behind i need you he told her lily ive always needed you ive just been too stupid to see but what happened today were a family i know i dont deserve a second chance but im asking you for one i want to marry you i want to adjust our lives so we can be together but i never want to be apart again oh ben will you come and live on our island benjy asked absorbing bens words and heading straight to what mattered most yes he said and watched as lilys eyes filled with tears ben we cant ask you youre not asking im telling im coming home he bent forward and kissed her on the nose and then more surely he kissed her on the mouth when they finally broke away they were all smiling and benjys was the biggest smile of all kisses are yucky but i liked that he said great ben told him its good that you like it because i intend to kiss your mother just like that every day for the rest of our lives once first thing in the morning once just before we go to sleep and a hundred times in between we have a happy ending lily whispered i dont believe in endings no no i think this morning he told her as he gathered woman and child into his arms and held them tight i think this morning is a happy beginning benjy do you know what a phosphorescent tide is no said benjy puzzled its when the lights go on in the sea he said in shallow water it might happen once in a lifetime your mother and i saw it but you missed out so ive decided i need to come back to your island so we can watch out together for phosphorescent tides i have a feeling that when were around the concept of once in a lifetime is ridiculous weve been given a second chance and from now from right at this minute were going to take any chance were given chapter twelve the first anniversary of the insurrection on the island could well have been a day of sadness but the islanders of kapua had never looked on death as a final farewell funerals were a time of celebration of affirmation of the power of life they were a thanksgiving for the joy of life itself but the shock of the attempted coup had thrown the islanders off course the funerals twelve months ago had been blurred with horror now a year later the islanders wanted to do it better theyd come to terms with their losses in their own way and they wished to right a wrongto celebrate the lives of those theyd lost and to turn mourning into a peaceful acceptance and a deep thankfulness for lives well lived those killed by jacquess accomplices had been loved and that love would live for ever in the hearts of those left behind and of those to come that was the gist of the words spoken by the islands pastor on this day of remembrance everyone on the island was there the soft sea breeze blew gently across the graveyard and the scent of frangipani mixed with the salt from the sea lily stayed in the background with benjy by her side on the other side of benjy holding his hand letting the child lean against him stood his father her husband ben and benjy her family she listened to the pastors words and let the peace of acceptance drift into her heart thank you for loving me she told kira and she glanced across at her husband and she smiled and thank you for bringing ben back home to me for ben was truly home now he was an accepted islander lilys husband benjys father the islanders had accepted him into their hearts with nothing but pleasure and why would they not have in less than a year ben had transformed the medical setup on the island there were remote clinics on each of the outer islands with rapid transfer available to the main base on kapua and the base at kapua was wonderful the tiny hospital had been extended to double its size lily was based there now as were two interns on rotation from sydney and sam that had been a coup in itself for when the time had come for sam to leave hed looked long and hard at the islandand at pieters pretty teacher daughterand hed decided that maybe kapua wasnt such a bad place to put down roots so there were now five doctors on the island and maybe thered be even more when the new wing of the hospital opened the obstetric wing it was magic lily thought as she continued to listen from an island with basic medical facilities they were moving fast to be state of the art her island home had become even more of a paradise not that they stayed there all the time now in the few days after dougs heart attack when lily and ben and benjy had been marooned caring for a newborn foal but with little else to do but talk and nothing to talk about but their future theyd worked it out doug and rosa would be grandparents to benjy theyd been practically all the parents that ben had known and grandparents couldnt be left out of the equation of this embryonic family therefore four times a year theyd spend at least a week at the farm and four times a year doug and rosa would be flown out to the island to spend as long as they wanted there they were there now after his double bypass doug looked and felt wonderful doug and pieter had struck up a fast friendship and doug and gualberto were as thick as thieves many more of the islanders would end up as visitors back at the farm lily thought happily her world had been extended and was about to be extended even more but first there were ghosts to be laid to rest first loves to be acknowledged the pastor had finished speaking now flowers had been laid on each grave and the islanders were drifting away thered be a celebration on the beach tonight but for now individual families needed time to themselves to assimilate all theyd felt that day rosa and doug were moving from the graveyard too but before they left rosa reached into her capacious bag and produced a box she smiled across at lily in her eyes a question and lily left her husband and son to take the box from her what is it ben asked as she returned she looked up at this wonderful man she loved with all her heart and she thought was this the right thing to do shed done it without asking she and rosa had done it without talking to him about it because they knew this would hurt they wanted the hurt to be brief but they also knew that unfinished business must be completed before moving forward its bethanys ashes she said and she saw his face become blank with shock bethany rosa said you werent permitted to go to her funeral she said as far as she knew your parents hadnt ever told you where she was doug remembered a fight when you were about eightyou asking what had happened and your father saying to leave it the dead were best forgotten doug and rosa always thought it was wrong she whispered only they never knew what to dohow to broach it with you but after we married rosa talked to me about it she knew that bethany had been cremated she knew her ashes had been left in a memorial wall at a huge sydney cemetery shed always hated the thought so she faltered a little then looking at the blankness on his face hoping shed done right we wrote to the accountant who was the executor of your parents estate she whispered we asked if we needed your permission but he said youd never been involvedthat as far as he knew you didnt even know where bethanys ashes were but he was happy to sign a release form because we thoughtrosa and doug and i thought that you should bring bethany home we thought maybe you could scatter her ashes here or maybe you could scatter them at the farm wherever but we thought wed like to help you to do that she faltered ben if you want us to take the ashes back to sydney then we will but rosa and doug and i thoughtwe thought this might be right the blankness faded as ben stared down at the box thinking through what theyd done his gaze lifted meeting hers beside him benjy stood watchful lily had explained to benjy who bethany was kiras death had made benjy more mature than his years he knew enough now to be silent and he knew this moment was important he held bens hand and lily thought that this was right ben was holding his son as he thought about a little sister hed loved a long time ago yet had never said farewell to i love you ben whispered i know lily replied trying to hold back tears but bethany was your first love benjy and i would like to be with you while you say goodbye but if you dont want us of course i want you he tugged benjy closer and hugged him you know that you know how much she did the world settled a little this was the right thing to do lily thought feeling a sense of peace and absolution sweep over her she held out the box to him then gestured to benjy benjy came to her as ben took his sisters ashes in both his hands if you want to do it here now the pastor is waiting lily told him and rosa and doug are just through the trees they loved bethany too theyd also like the chance to say goodbye yes he said softly and then more firmly yes this is a good time to do this the best so this memorial service became the memorial service for one other the pastor came forward quietly and said a prayer and a blessing and ben opened the box and scattered his sisters ashes over the wildflowers of the churchyard over the graves of those who had gone before over the calm and lovely headland of this their island home and when it was over they turned and walked together ben and lily with benjy walking behind between rosa and doug a family going home it was the best thing ben told her holding her close to let me say goodbye its a lovely name bethany lily whispered her hand was warm in his secure loved do you think we should consider using it again for for a new little life she whispered and she smiled and held his hand tighter today weve said goodbye to some of our family my darling ben but in a seven months timetime to say hello that night in the waves around kapua the tiny phosphorescent creatures came again the lights went on in their sea miracles happened marion lennox
