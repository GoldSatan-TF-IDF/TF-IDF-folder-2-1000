good night umm shanks the phone went dead i looked at it wondering then i switched it off i draped the towel over the side of the bath unlocked the door and returned to the bedroom feeling my way across the unfamiliar space to the bed what was that a deep sleepy voice said nothing i said slipping between the sheets wrong number chapter one my name is kathryn telman i am a senior executive officer third level counting from the top in a commercial organisation which has had many different names through the ages but which these days we usually just refer to as the business theres a lot to tell about this particular concern but im going to have to ask you to be tolerant here because im intending to take things slowly and furnish further details of this ancient honourable and to you no doubt surprisingly ubiquitous concern in due course as they become relevant for the record i am one point seven metres tall i weigh fiftyfive kilos i am thirtyeight years old i have dual britishus nationality i am blonde by birth not bottle unwed and have been an employee of the business since i left school early november in the city of glasgow scotland mrs todd the housekeeper cleared away my breakfast things and padded silently away across the pine floor cnn babbled quietly from the television i dabbed at my lips with a crisply starched napkin and gazed out through the tall windows and the light rain to the buildings on the far side of the grey river the company apartments in glasgow had been shifted a few years earlier from blythswood square to the newly fashionable merchant city area on the north bank of the clyde this building had been in company ownership since we built it in the late seventeen hundreds it was a warehouse for nearly two centuries was leased out as a cheap clothing store for a decade then it lay unused for a number of years it was renovated in the eighties to create office and retail units on the ground and first floor and loftstyle apartments on the three remaining floors this the top floor was all business mrs todd glided back to complete the tidying of the table will there be anything else ms telman no thank you mrs todd the car is here ill be ten minutes ill let them know my watch and mobile agreed that it was i rang mike daniels yesh ah yesh ah indeed they couldnt find you a dentist zhey found me a dentisht but zhere washnt time to do

believe you could call him a person of hench if we had hitmen hed be one in fact hed probably be their boss i know a little more about this sort of thing than most execs at my level because i started out in security that was before an interest in gadgets technology and future trends got me angled across the companys career tracks and on to the plutocratic mainline maintaining contacts in security may well prove to be one of the more astute investments ive made in my own future hazhleton shit ish he azh shcary azh everybody shesh not normally but walker is i wonder what hes doing in the country i heard a rumour zhere wash shome short of meeting nexsht week atumm in yorkshire really yesh shumshing to do wish the pashific shing maybe hesh here for zhat maybe hazhletons coming over from the

your own assignment ha im trying to take my mind off it anyway i have to go theres a car waiting for me have a safe and productive trip yeah yeah yeah all zhat shtuff i was on sabbatical one of the privileges that comes with my rank is that im allowed one year in every seven on full pay to do just as i please this has been a business institution for those at my level and above for about two and a half centuries and seems to be working well well probably keep it certainly i had no complaints even though i had not taken what most people would regard as full advantage of such a serious perk nominally and for tax purposes i was based in the states i spent about a third of the year travelling generally in the developed world i was still enjoying this largely airborne lifestyle but when i did want to feel the earth under my feet i could always retreat to the modest but comfortable cabin i owned in the santa cruz mountains just outside the town of woodside ca within easy reach of stanford palo alto and the rest of silicon valley thats modest and cabin in the californian opulent sense with a pool hot tub five bedrooms and a fourcar garage if home is the place that best displays your character then this was my home from the stuff on the shelves you could have told that i liked german composers realist art french films and biographies of scientists also that i was addicted to technical journals my european base was suzrin house the companys monolithic warren of offices and apartments overlooking the thames at whitehall which i preferred to our swiss base at château doex i suppose suzrin house was my second home though in terms of architectural cosiness thats a bit like regarding the kremlin or the pentagon as a piedàterre never mind my job wherever i might be was to keep abreast of current and incipient technological developments with the brief of recommending which of those technologies the business ought to invest in id been doing this for a while it was i am pleased to say on my advice that we bought into microsoft on its initial flotation back in the eighties and into the internet server companies at the start of the nineties and while many of the other computer and associated hitech companies weve put money into have gone quite spectacularly bust a few of our investments in the computer and it industries had produced returns sensational enough to make the whole investment programme one of our most worthwhile in recent history only the portfolios we developed in steel and petroleum during the late eighteen hundreds have yielded greater rewards my reputation in the company was if i may toot my own tuba a tad at least very secure and possibly whisper it even verging on legendary and believe me we have a generous stock of living legends in the business i had achieved level three status ten or fifteen years earlier than i might have hoped for even as a highflyer and while it depended on the goodwill of my coworkers i was fairly confident that some time in the next few years i would be promoted to level two a close inspection of my own personal mammon graph would reveal even to the untrained eye that my remuneration package including commission multipliers gained as a result of my successful forecasts regarding computers and the internet was already more generous than that of many of our level two executives it had occurred to me a couple of years earlier that i was probably what the average person would consider independently wealthy in other words that i could have existed comfortably without my job though of course as a good business woman that was all but unthinkable for me anyway you cant rest on your laurels these successes with computer software and communications lucky guesses if you wanted to be uncharitable were all in the past and i still had a job to do and so it was that at that moment i had high hopes for our recently takenup stakes in fuel cell technology and had been lobbying hard for more investment in private space concerns we would see the lexus hummed its way through the mirrorwet streets of glasgow heading east people hunched against the buffeting windrush of rain some carried umbrellas others held folded tabloids or flapping carrierbags over their heads as they waited at pedestrian crossings i checked my laptop for email then read the newspapers my chauffeur was called raymond raymond was about half my age tall and athletic with short blond hair he and i had developed what they used to call an understanding over the week or so i had been in glasgow raymond was perfectly good behind the wheel though i confess i preferred him between the sheets which was where he had been the night before when mike daniels had called if mrs todd knew from the start that we were involved she was able to pretend that she didnt because raymond had so far always succeeded in waking up in time to slip away before she arrived in the morning an able if occasionally overly energetic lover at night raymond was the soul of driving professionalism and formal politeness during the day when i was raymonds age this sort of compartmentalisation of roles and relationships would have struck me as hypocritical even deceitful now however it seemed quite the most convenient even honest way to behave raymond and i could be prim and correct with each other while he performed his driverly duties and as carnally abandoned as we desired when he took off his peaked cap and set his grey uniform aside in fact i rather enjoyed the contrast it lent a certain anticipatory frisson to the mundane condition of being taken from one place to another ah ms telman yes raymond some bad traffic up ahead he said he glanced at the cars navigation screen take a different route aye okay raymond whirled the steeringwheel to send us down a side road leading to the river raymond took this sort of thing seriously personally i have no interest in my route to a given destination but some people like to be told why theyre going one way rather than the other i scanned the newspapers midterm elections in the states dow up british chancellor makes an announcement today about extra government borrowing interest rate cut expected later today footsie up pound down death and destruction in central america caused by the remains of hurricane mitch thousands buried under mudslides part of my mind scanned a mental list of company assets in the area wondering how we might be affected while my conscience shook its metaphorical head and tried to dredge up some human sympathy for the victims from the depths of my corporate soul i could have logged on to the companys encrypted website and found out what exposure we had in guatemala nicaragua and honduras and if our web people were on the ball what damage wed taken down there but i preferred to finish reading the papers first general pinochets appeal against his extradition to spain was due to come up in the house of lords that week this was of more than academic interest for us as a company frankly the fate of one old fascist massmurderer was irrelevant in business terms though i dont doubt that as a company we kept on good terms with whoever was in power in chile throughout the allende years pinochets regime and subsequently but the whole issue of diplomatic immunity was one that exercised us at that point hence what mike daniels referred to as the pashific shing personally i thought the pacific thing was all a monumental irrelevance but it was out of my hands and i was probably not invited to the rumoured shindig in yorkshire that weekend no matter what mike might think that was level one stuff the preserve of the hazletons and the parfittsolomenides of the business the chip factory lay a few miles outside glasgow near the town of motherwell standard lowlevel landscaping of clipped grass ornamental water features and a scattering of thin trees their leaves mostly gone to the autumn winds they bent in the rainheavy wind as the lexus rolled up to the main entrance of the vast ochre shed that was silex systems principal manufacturing facility raymond jumped out and was there with a golf umbrella opening the door mr rix the plant manager and henderson his deputy were waiting in the foyer what happens to the chips that fail theyre thrown away you cant recycle them in theory you could but it would add a lot of cost by the time theyre at this stage theyre already so materially complicated it would take a fortune to start reducing them to their individual constituents i was standing with mr rix and mr henderson in one of the cleanest places on earth i was wearing something not far off a spacesuit the closest id seen to it were the shiny things they wear in those rather forced heywerecoolreally intel ads for pentium processors the suit was loose and quite comfortable as it would have to be if you were to spend an entire working day in it with a full face mask incorporated into the helmet breathing seemed easy enough though apparently i was doing it through a submicron filter the suits slipperlike shoes were built into the bottom of the legs so that it felt a little like being a small child again wearing pyjamas when i changed into the onepiece out of my white silk blouse and moschino skirt and jacket i felt a moment of regret at even temporarily giving up my clothes until it occurred to me that the suit i was putting on was probably much more expensive than the one i was taking off we were deep in the giant factory in a sterile room at the centre of three concentric levels of antiseptic cleanliness i was looking through a glass screen at a complex and gleaming machine which was depositing cdsized wafers on a platter spinning them and then plopping liquid on to the centre so that it flowed apparently instantly to cover the whole shining surface then a metallic arm quickly flipped the wafer over and into another part of the machine around us more spacesuited workers were gliding across the high polish of the tiles pushing tall carts of wafers or sat hunched over microscopes on workbenches or staring at computer screens the text and graphics reflecting off their face masks while their hands pushed mice around or gloved fingers fluttered over quietly rattling keyboards the air transmitted a whole choir of subtle humming whining noises to my shielded ears and smelled a little like a hospitals except cleaner everywhere under the high bright lights surfaces glittered and sparkled even without knowing the breathtaking scale of the investment a plant like this required you could have smelled the money here i hope you can stay for lunch ms telman mr rix said just the usual canteen grub for us normally of course but we could go further afield if you liked can we tempt you mr rix was a big man a head taller than me and wide his jowly face gleamed behind his mask smiling from the eyes down i felt quite cool in the airconditioned variously filtered atmosphere but mr rix seemed to be sweating perhaps he was claustrophobic thank you id be delighted the canteen will be fine do you often take these ah sabbaticals as a sort of busmans holiday ms telman asked his deputy this is my first sabbatical mr henderson i told him i havent had time to establish a pattern henderson was about my height stockier i started walking towards one of the parts of the clean environment we hadnt visited yet the two men jockeyed for position between the workbenches and the humming machines a robot delivery unit on a collision course sensed us approaching and glided to a stop until we passed by i think if i had a year off id find somewhere better than motherwell to spend it he laughed and he and rix exchanged glances it is a sabbatical mr henderson not a holiday oh of course of course however i did spend a month on a yacht in the caribbean at the start of the year without my phone or a laptop that got me nicely wound down i told them smiling broadly behind the mask since then ive been taking the occasional little holiday to let me think and ive travelled round a lot of the company sites id wanted to see but never got round to plus i have spent quite a while in the library of congress and the british library ah mr henderson said its just that i thought you must have seen the inside of a chip plant before thats all one or two i agreed mr henderson was right to be surprised in fact he was right to be suspicious if that was what he was despite the impression id been careful to give this was not at all a casual visit i stopped outside a swipecard protected door in a tall blank wall and nodded where does this go i asked ah this is an area where weve got the workmen in at the moment mr rix said waving at the door installing a new finishing line cant actually go through right at this moment in time too much dust and that sort of thing you know plus theyre test loading some of the etching chemicals today i think arent they bill henderson said oof rix said taking a comic sort of step away from the door i think well keep well away from that stuff eh they both laughed in the safety briefing before wed donned our spacesuits as well as being told what to do in the event of a fire and where to run for a dousing if something acidic splashed on us wed been warned about various chemicals with very long names which were used in the chipproduction process they could allegedly sneak through the tiniest hole in a glove soak instantly and unnoticed through the skin and get straight to work rotting your bones from the inside before going on to perform even more insidious horrors on your vital organs well said mr henderson the two men started to pull away from the door mr rix put an arm out as though to shepherd me away i crossed my arms whats the likely life of the plant hmm ah well with the new lines in place mr rix began but i didnt pay very much attention after that i had what you might call half an ear for his tone of voice and i was listening for certain keywords but what i was really interested in was mr rixs and mr hendersons body language their whole demeanour and all i could think of was these guys are trying to hide something they were frightened of me which does i confess give me a buzz but it went beyond the usual nervousness of local bosses used to total deference having to answer to somebody from higher up in the organisation who has come to pay a shortnotice visit there was something else maybe theyre both closet misogynists i thought perhaps their habituated reactions to women were derisory or even coercive id looked at the files on this place there was a slightly higher than average rate of staff turnover especially amongst female workers and there had been a few more complaints that had ended at industrial tribunals than one might have expected but somehow that didnt feel like it would account for the edgy vibe i was getting here of course it could be me i could be wrong always check the equipment for sensor error first i dont know whether id have dismissed the feeling in the end or not id probably have decided they had some lucrative little scam going that could have got them cashiered but not something it was worth my while bothering with given that the plants figures looked pretty good in general but something happened that made me think about it all later a spacesuited woman came into view down an aisle i could tell her gender from her gait as much as her shape she seemed distracted struggling to carry a laptop a plasticwrapped metal briefcase a thick glossycovered manual and heavy straggling cables i saw her first then henderson looked round casually back at me and then quickly at her again he started towards her then glanced back at rix whose voice faltered momentarily before continuing the woman was fishing in a pocket of the spacesuit for something as she approached us while henderson strode to meet her just before he got to her she pulled out a swipe card on the end of a little metal chain then henderson intercepted her one arm out as he nodded back in the direction she had come from her head came up as she noticed him for the first time mr rixs arm extended again and touching my right shoulder gently but firmly pulled me round and away while his other hand waved through the air and he said with just a little too much hearty bluster while yet before they turn it into a batterychicken shed eh he clapped his gloved hands together well now cup of tea i smiled up at him what a good idea i had raymond take us on a detour on the way back to a nondescript field by what had once been a main road near coatbridge come here small girl whit i said come here whit fir what what did you say eh are you

say certainly not maam always been very nice to me katie monsfuckin brass monkeys oot here so it is ye could gie us a lift then zat okay aye really well yes aye come oan simon were get tin a ride home in this wummins braw big car wipe yir feet eh and that is how i met mrs elizabeth telman a level two executive in the business one rainy saturday afternoon in the autumn of outside coatbridge to the east of glasgow mrs telman was one of those people who always seemed about six inches taller than she really was to me even now when i think of her she appears in my memory as a tall elegant woman as lithe and slim as my mother was wee and dumpy yet the two were within a couple of inches of each other in height and not really that different in build i suppose mrs telman just held herself straighter she had long raven hair which she only stopped dyeing gradually in her seventies my mother was mousy brown though i inherited hair somewhere between fair and blonde apparently from my maternal grandmother mrs telman had a wide mouth and long fingers and an accent that sometimes sounded american sometimes english and sometimes something else entirely something tantalisingly foreign and exotic there was a mr telman but he lived in america the two had been estranged since barely a year after their marriage mrs telman had gerald drop simon at his house and then took me to the local shop where i bought my two replacement bottles of fizz we arrived at my house just as my mother was staggering up the path with her carryout fresh if thats the word from the pub i think mrs telman decided she wasnt going to get much sense out of mother right then and so arranged to return the following morning my mother threatened to slap me for talking to a stranger that night very drunk she cuddled me to her her breath sweet with the smell of fortified wine i tried not to squirm and to appreciate this unusually drawnout burst of physical affection but i couldnt help thinking of the rich subtle beguiling odours in mrs telmans car some of which seemed to come from the car itself and some from her she reappeared to my surprise the next morning before my mother was up once my mother was dressed we went for a drive i was given a milky way and got to sit up front with gerald which was good but i couldnt hear what was going on in the back because of the glass partition which was annoying gerald kept me entertained by telling me what he thought the other drivers were saying and thinking and letting me work the indicator switch on the dashboard meanwhile my mother and mrs telman sat in the back swapping my mothers woodbines and mrs telmans sobranies and talking that night i got to sleep with my mother for the first time in years all the way through to the morning i was hugged even more fiercely and i puzzled over her hot tears the next morning gerald picked my mother and me up and took us through to edinburgh to mrs telmans huge grand red sandstone hotel at the end of princes street mrs telman wasnt there herself she was off doing something important somewhere else in the city we went to a big room where to my consternation and my mothers embarrassment i was washed again by a large lady dressed like a nurse given a medical inspection and then measured and dressed in a scratchy shirt skirt and jacket that were the first entirely new clothes id ever worn part of my horror at all this was because i thought we were in a public room where anybody might walk in and see me in my knickers i didnt realise that these rooms were mrs telmans that we were in her suite i was taken to another room where a man gave me lots of sums and other tasks to do some were purely arithmetical some were questions about lists some consisted of looking at little diagrams and then looking at others and deciding which one fitted with the first lot and some were more like little stories i had to complete they were fun i was left alone with a comic while the man went away mrs telman came and took us to lunch in the hotel she seemed very happy to see me and she kissed my mother on both cheeks which made me jealous though i wasnt sure of whom over lunch while my mother and i swapped conspiratorial looks as we tried to work out which cutlery to use i was asked if i wanted to go to a special school i recall being horrified i thought special schools were where bad boys were sent for thieving and vandalising but after this was cleared up and i was assured i would get to go home of an evening i agreed tentatively i started at miss stutelys school for girls in rutherglen the next day i was a year behind the others but physically no bigger than any of my classmates and shorter than several of them i was picked on for threequarters of that first day until i sent a girl home with a broken nose following a fight during afternoon playtime i was almost thrown out and had to sit patiently through several stern talkingsto a tutor came to our house in the evenings to give me extra lessons mrs telman found my mother a job in an officemachine factory in stepps the same factory mrs telman had been on her way to inspect when her car had picked up a puncture we ate better we had proper furniture a phone and soon a colour television i found i had a lot fewer uncles than id thought i had and mother stopped walking into doors when i left miss stutelys and entered kessington academy in bearsden we moved from our terrace in coatbridge to a semi in jordanhill my mother was now at another factory helping to make things called computers not adding machines she never married but we went on holidays with a nice man called mr bullwood mrs telman came to visit us every few months and always brought book tokens for me and record tokens clothes and little things for my mother my mother died suddenly at easter while i was on a school holiday in italy we had taken buses ferries and trains to get to rome but i flew back alone mrs telman and mr bullwood met me at glasgow airport and took me in mrs telmans car still driven by gerald straight to the cemetery in coatbridge it was a warm sunny day i remember watching her coffin disappearing behind the curtains at the crematorium feeling worried that i could not seem to cry a smallish man with shaking hands wearing a shiny and badly fitting suit with a black armband up by one shoulder came to me afterwards and breathed whisky over me telling me with tears in his rheumy red eyes that he was my father mrs telman put an arm round my shoulder and i let myself be guided away the man shouted things at us everything changed again i was sent to board at an international school in switzerland run by the firm mrs telman worked for i was miserable there but no more than id been in the months between my mother dying and completing the term at kessington academy i studied for my baccalaureate and found a keen solitary release in skiing and skating i was surrounded mostly by forbiddingly bright girls from families which seemed to possess infinitely deep reserves of money taste and talent and glamorous idiots with braying laughs who were destined to go straight to finishing schools and who had no ambitions beyond a rich marriage i finished with a flourish and several academic prizes brasenose college oxford awaited mrs telman adopted me and i took her name i cried for both of them when she died last year the phone rang for a long time well past the number of rings youd normally allow before concluding that there was nobody present to answer it finally who is this the voice rich sibilant and velvety was that of an elderly man who was rather angry the voice of a man answering a phone that rarely rang and which when it did was equipped to tell him the number that was ringing him and from its memory also tell him to whom that number belonged a phone which he expected to bring only important information hello its me kate is that you dear girl yes im using a callbox ah i see a pause does that mean that i was right and youve discovered something interesting possibly where are you near where ive been all week i see would it be best to meet up i think it would perfect perfect this weekends definitely on can you still make it of course my heart i have to say leapt uncle freddy had told me a couple of weeks earlier that there might be a highlevel meeting and general hooha to use his term this coming weekend and that i might be invited but i hadnt liked to take this for granted my contingency plans had consisted of surprising raymond and spiriting him away for a couple of nights i would do all the driving wed go somewhere discreet and expensive with a log fire and id feed us both lots of vintage champagnebut that would have to be put on hold i would be going to blysecrag good important gettogether kate the cherubim and seraphim of our tribe will be in attendance not to mention more temporal powers yes there have been rumours have there indeed well mike daniels had wind of something by last night ah yes the lfour whose teeth were stolen what on earth was all that about no idea well the bush telegraphs obviously working still be that as it maywell need you here on friday afternoon should all be finished by sunday but dont count on it all right all right i should tell you your friend suvinder will be there will he now oh joy yes still coming uncle freddy an invitation to blysecrag is something i could never turn down oh dear my money is running out ill be there on friday until then ha right you are jolly good bye what happened to your phone this new one doesnt work out here can you believe that heads should roll you need another phone i believe they sell such things there in tokyo how did the signing go fine kr loved his bottle of scotch is it really yrs old yep ps get there ok ps usual retiring self apparently the x stands for xerxes last seen escorting several geishas back to his to show them its circular bed boy can that guy talk talking about talking oh right kr didnt seem to mind my slight teeth shortfall situation at all smiled and bowed throughout probably thought it was a total hoot toothless gaijin recommended dentist been there done that now got splendid set of temporary tokyo teeth with teflon now instead of well by gum that took you hours ive been busy the origins of what we now call the business predate the christian church but not the roman empire to which it might fairly be said we owe our existence and which at one point technically at any rate we owned owning the roman empire even if it was only for a total of sixtysix days sounds wonderfully romantic a real business coup in fact we regard it as one of our greatest and most public mistakes and it taught us a lesson we have never forgotten most of the details are available in fairly digestible form in gibbons decline and fall where it is recorded in volume one chapter v ad that a wealthy and foolish senator called didius julianus purchased the empire at public auction from the praetorian guard who had disposed of the previous ruler one pertinax after he had proved too keen on tackling the empires various corruptions hed lasted eightysix days beating our man by nearly three clear weeks what only we in the business know is that the unfortunate didius julianus who became emperor julian when he ascended to the throne was merely a dupe the front man for a loose consortium of traders and moneylenders who had inherited a commercial cabal already many generations old possibly drunk on their success certainly unable to decide what to do with it the squabbling merchants let the reins of power slip from their fingers three generals in britain on the danube and in the eastern empire revolted and limited emperor julians occupation of the imperial throne to a little more than two months when he fell so did many of those who had supported him the business had already existed for several centuries by then to rome it had brought furs from scythia amber from the baltic carpets from babylon and in its most intense risky and lucrative enterprise every year secured a host of spices aromatics silks gems pearls and manifold other treasures from arabia india and the further east sensibly keeping away from direct political power all taking part had prospered estates were purchased villas built fleets constructed herds increased slaves and works of art bought with the didius julianus fiasco almost all of that was lost as i say it was a lesson we have cleaved to for the best part of two millennia at least until now arguably with the pashific shing documents clay tablets mostly still stored in the closest we have to a world headquarters near chateau doex in switzerland show that most of our original fortune was made in trading warehousing and lending money there appear to have been a few scams too shipwrecks that never happened camel trains that were robbed by our own people warehouses that burned down either with or without their contents depending whether you looked at one set of accounts or another enough of that sort of thing generally to make us no better than most but sufficiently few for us not to have been the worst allegedly we still store a few items which the catholic church and the holy roman empire asked us to look after sadly nothing quite as dramatic as the body of christ or the holy grail but ive heard on good authority that we have in our possession at least one extra book the scholars dont know about which could well have made it into the bible a book of leonardo cartoons dozens of michelangelos pornographic paintings various other art treasures and potentially valuable documents and several sets of crown jewels rumours ive heard indicate that our swiss bank may be implicated albeit marginally in the recent nazi gold scandal which aside from the morality of it all is both careless and embarrassing given the occasional cooperative venture weve taken on with the rothschilds and the generally good relations weve enjoyed with jewish enterprises over the centuries at any rate one of the reasons that we are able to go quietly about our business as a company without too much intrusion or publicity adverse or otherwise is that we have at least a little dirt on almost everybody whether they are other commercial concerns sovereign states or major religions there are other reasons but well come to those later all in good time a resource which given our longevity we are obviously well used to working with in bulk chapter two well thanks for the ride raymond grinned it was a pleasure having you in the back ms telman he squeezed my hand rather harder than a normal handshake would have called for then tipped his cap and swung his lithe form back into the lexus i permitted myself the briefest of lingering glances and a sigh then followed the two footmen carrying my luggage into the vast symphony in grey stone that was blysecrag house while the car crunched over the pale stones of the driveway and set off back through the deerscattered parklands and forests for the main road kate my girl good to see you dressed in wellworn tweeds waving a shepherds crook with the thoughtless abandon of one brought up all his life under extravagantly high ceilings attended by a brace of gangling wolfhounds leaving a double trail of whiskery grey hairs and saliva across the parquet his own white hair seeming to float uncombed around his head as though in only casual contact with his scalp freddy ferrindonald advanced down the length of the entrance hall laughing arms held wide he was lit from the side by the wintry sunlight pouring through a twostoreyhigh stainedglass window depicting a victorian steel works all gaudy reds splashing oranges and sparking yellows with great roils of belching smoke issuing from huge machines and small hunched human figures barely visible beneath the fumes and sparks a selfconsciously eccentric dashing english toff of the old school uncle freddy was genuinely an adopted uncle of mine as he was a stepbrother of mrs telmans a familial relationship that he had never let stand in the way of sharing with me the odd toothily leering sexual innuendo or giving my bum the occasional pat still he was a laugh and maybe because like me he didnt have much in the way of real family wed always got on surprisingly well welcome back freddy hugged me as enthusiastically as his thin frame and eightyplus years would allow then held me at arms length and looked me down and up youre looking as lovely as ever as are you uncle freddy he seemed to find this hilarious laughing loud enough to raise an echo from the tiered upper galleries of the hall and exposing a wealth of variously angled and diversely coloured teeth he put an arm round my shoulder and walked with me towards the distant foothills of the main staircase miss heggies appeared miss heggies was the housekeeper of blysecrag she was small but formidable with grey bunned hair a steely stare lips the colour and fullness of a small elastic band artificial eyebrows and a voice to etch titanium she also gave the impression of having a combined transporter room and tardis buried somewhere in the house at her command as she seemed to possess the gift of materialising at will wherever and whenever she wanted the only difference was that in star trek or doctor who there was a cheesy sound effect and a vaguely humanshaped shimmer or the sudden appearance of a metropolitan police box to give you a few seconds warning miss h had perfected the art of arriving instantly and without a sound ah miss h uncle freddy called out wheres the lovely kate billeted miss heggies nodded to the expectantlooking footmen with my cases ms telmans in the richmond room she told them miss heggies i said with a nod and what i hoped looked like a respectful smile miss h is the sort of person it pays to keep in with ms telman welcome back miss heggies allowed her head to incline downwards by about a degree while the corners of her mouth twitched this was her equivalent of a floordeep curtsy and a broad but bashful grin i felt truly honoured we started up the stairs i threw open the tall windows and stepped out on to the balcony hugging myself as i drank in the cold air beneath a clear cobalt sky my breath smoked in front of me beyond the stone balustrade the view dropped sharply away in a series of sculpted terraces dotted with lawns flowerbeds pools and waterfalls to the wooded floor of the valley where a few loops of river sparkled through the trees before decanting into the broad lake to my right at the centre of which a single huge fountain towered on all sides the parkland spread away to the hills and crags beyond looking along the cliff edge the house was perched upon i could see a long structure like the top part of a crane laid along the lawn and jutting out over the drop steam drifted over it from behind its rear obscured by a towered and crenellated wing of the house i rubbed my upper arms through my jacket and blouse realising that i was smiling broadly at the view this was blysecrag it was begun in the early eighteen hundreds by the local duke who was determined to create one of the great houses of england he was responsible for the huge reservoir created in the hills five miles to the north of the house which via two valleyspanning aqueducts and a network of canals cisterns and balancing reservoirs supplied the water and the pressure for the various water features in the house and grounds of which the tall fountain in the lake was but the most immediately obvious the duke devoted all his time to the construction of the building but neglected to maintain the fortune that was supposed to pay for it he duly went bankrupt the estate was purchased by hieronymus cowle an eccentric from a local millowning family who had made a second fortune in railways he judged the already vast and rambling halfbuilt structure to be a decent start but insufficiently ambitious many more architects landscape gardeners hydrologists engineers stone masons and artists would have to be thrown at the project by the time hieronymus had finished blysecrag boasted three hundred rooms eighteen towers two miles of cellars five lifts thirty dumbwaiter shafts a similar number of laundrydelivery elevators disguised as wardrobes a waterpowered funicular linking the house to its own railway branch line a sixhundred seat underground theatre with a hydraulically driven revolving stage numerous fountains and a milelong reflecting lake the place was equipped with a variety of systems for communicating with the staff plus a pressurised petroleumvapour lighting system powered by an early hydraulic turbine hieronymus died before he could move in his son bardolphe spent most of the rest of the family fortune indulging passions for gambling and aviation he converted one of the ballrooms into a casino and adapted the reflecting lake which was handily aligned with the prevailing westerlies into a landing lake for his seaplane and near one end of the lake up a short incline had installed the worlds first landbased steampowered catapult on the cliff edge to launch the aircraft it was this structure i could see from the balcony of my room wreathed in steam uncle freddy had just had it restored to working order not content with being able to land his seaplane during the day bardolphe had devised a system of coalgas pipes set just beneath the surface of the milelong lake to release bubbles of methane which could be ignited during the hours of darkness to provide a flarepath for night landings he died in the fall of trying to make his first such landing apparently the wind blew out half the plumes of burning gas and ignited several piles of leaves at the side of the lake causing him to fly towards the trees to one side and collide with the top of an ornamental pagoda he was buried in a coffin that looked like a roulette table housed within a seaplaneshaped mausoleum on the hillside looking over the lake and the house blysecrag was used as a convalescent hospital during the great war then it and the estate fell into disrepair as the cowle family struggled to cope with the ruinous costs of upkeep it was an army training centre during the second world war then the ministry of defence sold it to us in we too used it as a training centre uncle freddy bought it from the company in the late fifties and has lived here since the early sixties the business started the refurbishments but he completed them the restoration of the steam catapult and the reflecting lakes underwater lighting system recently converted to run on north sea gas was all his doing i returned inside and closed the windows the servants had hung my suit carrier in one of the two huge wardrobes and left my other bags on the bed i looked around but there was no tv in here uncle freddy thought he was making a huge concession to modern technology by having a special room to watch television in blysecrag had speaking tubes servantsignal wires pneumatic delivery tubes a domestic telegraph system and its own baroquely complicated fieldtelephonebased intercom network but only a handful of tvs and they were mostly in the servants quarters im a news junkie normally the first thing i do in a hotel room is switch on the tv and find cnn or bloomberg never mind i shivered in my clothes just briefly here i was in a huge house stuffed with antiques and swarming with servants waiting for the vastly rich and powerful to arrive and it was all entirely familiar to me i had one of those moments when i reminded myself how fortunate id been and how privileged i had become as usual the first thing i unpacked even before my toiletries bag was a little netsuke monkey with a dolorous expression and eyes made from tiny chips of red glass i placed it on the bedside table i set the monkey usually along with my watch and a torch by my bed wherever i am in the world so that i always have something familiar to look at when i first wake up the sadfaced little figure was one of the first presents i ever bought myself after i left school embedded in its base is a thirtyfiveyearold predecimal coin the same twelvesided thruppenny bit that mrs telman handed to me from her gleaming black limousine that wet saturday afternoon in uncle freddy wanted to fish i dressed in some old jeans a sensible shirt and a thick woolly jumper i found in a drawer the house provided a lifejacketequipped waistcoat with too many pockets and a pair of thighlength waders an ancient jeep driven with geriatric abandon by uncle freddy himself bounced us down a grassy track to a boathouse by the broad lake with the fountain the pair of wolfhounds bounded after us scattering spittle to either side as they ran in the boathouse we picked up two old cane rods and the rest of the paraphernalia associated with fly fishing are we likely to catch anything at this time of year i asked as we tramped along the shore loosely accompanied by the dogs good god no uncle freddy said and laughed we waded into shady shallows not far from where the river met the lake down an ornamental weir decorated with chubby stone cherubs well the bastards are up to something freddy said casting far out into the gentle current i had told him about my visit to silex systems and the odd behaviour of messrs rix and henderson concerning the locked door he glanced at me as long as youre sure youre not imagining all this im sure i told him they were both perfectly polite but i could tell they really didnt want me there i felt about as welcome as a mole on a bowling green ha i took another look at the plants figures afterwards i said making a reasonable cast myself they show some odd fluctuations theyre like an oil painting the further away you stand the more convincing they look but get up close and you can see all the brushstrokes all the little blobby bits stuck on what the hell can they be up to uncle freddy said sounding exasperated could they have another production line going in there could they be building their own chips and selling them independently i thought about that finished chips are worth more than their weight in gold more than industrial diamonds but i dont see how they could have hidden the capital plant the rawmaterials purchases would barely show in petty cash but the machines the whole linethey cant have hidden that silex theyre not wholly owned are they i shook my head equal fortyeight per cent with ligence us the other four per cent is owned by the employees rix and henderson are our guys but via mr hazleton shit uncle freddy said mr hazleton is a level one executive a single level above uncle freddy and the highest of the high one of the allbutuntouchable principal players of our company and a full member of the board he would be showing up later on today with some of the other power players uncle freddy a frustrated level one man if ever there was one harboured certain resentments concerning mr hazleton do we have a legal route in there he asked only through hazleton i told him or another level one intervening uncle freddy snorted derisively otherwise wed have to wait until the elections next year i said though wed have to start campaigning now and ive no idea who might be plausible replacements ill have to explain about these elections later we should just get a chap in there uncle freddy said i think so want me to talk to somebody yes get a fellow from one of the european offices somebody who knows what theyre doing scottish i suppose but not based there or london i think theres someone in brussels who might do if youll authorise it ill see if i can persuade security to put them on secondment right you are yes think thats the least we should do then uncle freddys line until that point lying in a lazily straightening s shape across the ruffled waters jerked suddenly and disappeared under the surface he looked surprised well ill be he exclaimed and braked the suddenly spinning reel lets hope thats a good omen i said the business has understandings with several states and regimes and over the centuries wed carved out our own little territories in various places we have for example a small factory in the us military base on cuba at guantanamo which produces the only authentic cuban cigars it is moreorless legal to sell in the us though theyre so exclusive and expensive and their production legality so ticklish theyre never advertised rumour has it that it was one of those which president clinton well never mind usefully close to guantanamo is the small bahamanian island of great inagua which is not truly independent but has its own semiautonomous parliament we have interests there too on the us mainland we own a couple of casinos and a few other business ventures in the rez as its usually called formally its the wolf bend native american reservation in a desolate corner of idaho where again conveniently the full remit of us law does not apply we are the only nongovernmental organisation to have a permanent base on antarctica in kronprinsesse euphemia land between dronning maud land and coates land purchased from argentina during the junta this is the closest weve come so far to having our own statelet and has the handy attribute of being both excruciatingly remote and effectively beyond the reach of international law the more lurid company rumours have characterised kronprinsesse euphemia land as our siberia our very own gulag however no one i know has ever heard of anybody being sent there against their will so i reckon its just a story to help keep people well behaved a few places have for an arrangement for services rendered or just outright bribes allowed some of our most senior people to become accredited diplomats hence our interest in the fate of general pinochet who was travelling on a supposedly diplomatic passport when he was arrested in london this seems to be the latest fad with our level one execs in the past we never used to bother perhaps it is simply that when youre so rich you can buy anything all thats left is stuff that money normally cant buy my own theory is that one of our level one people bumped into a highranking catholic at a party once and discovered he was talking to a knight of malta accredited through the vatican to all the best diplomatic courts lee iacocca for example this would leave our level one exec at a disadvantage because only catholics can become knights of malta and there is a strict rule in the business that all executives anybody above level six must renounce all religious affiliations the better to devote themselves to pursuing a life dedicated to mammon anyway some of our level ones possess diplomatic passports from some of the worlds less savoury regimes like iraq and myanmar while some sport papers from places so little known that even experienced customs and immigration officers have been known to have to refer to their reference books to find them places like dasah a trucial state on a small island in the persian gulf or thulahn a mountainous principality between sikkim and bhutan or the zoroastrian peoples republic of inner magadan between the sea of okhotsk and the arctic ocean or san borodin the only independent canary isle these arrangements are useful but theyre expensive and fragile regimes change and if we can buy them now who might buy them tomorrow so theres another wheeze on the horizon a fix for all this we intend to buy our own state outright quite apart from giving us access to all the diplomatic passports we might reasonably require and allowing us unrestricted use of that perfect smuggling route called the diplomatic bag we would also finally have what according to some of the more enthusiastic level ones we really need a seat at the united nations the candidate is the island of fenua ua part of the society islands group in the south pacific fenua ua has one inhabited island two minedout guano outcrops and no natural resources apart from lots of sun sand and salt and some only arguably edible spiny fish they were once so desperate to generate income from any source at all they invited the french to come and blow up nuclear bombs beneath them but the french refused they used to have to import water they now have a desalination plant but the water still tastes apparently on the salty side their power plant works only intermittently there is no natural harbour on the main island barely space for a proper airport and the reefs make it impossible for cruise ships to call even if they want to and as fenua ua is devoid of natural wonders and possesses no native culture whatsoever except that based around the removal of the spines from spiny fish they dont want to the places most pressing problem is that there is no ground on fenua ua higher than a metre and a half above sea level and while its reefs protect the main island from waves and the pacific swell they will not be able to counter the effects of global warming in fifty years time if present trends continue the place will be mostly under water and the capital will look like venice during an adriatic storm surge the deal being suggested is that if well build them a sea wall which will girdle the whole island the fenua uans will let us take control of the entire state as there are only thirtyfive hundred dispirited fenua uans it has proved quite easy to bribe almost all of them three referenda in the last five years have backed our plans by a huge majority this was though not proving an easy deal to complete various governments had got wind of the transaction and had been quietly trying to block it offering various amounts of aid trading credits and personal financial sweeteners to the fenua ua government the us the uk japan and france had proved particularly stubborn and while we hadnt parted with any serious money yet just a few skiing holidays in gstaad a motor cruiser or two a couple of apartments in miami and a few other expensive gifts wed invested a great deal of effort in all this only to find that every time we thought we were on the brink of closing the deal the fenua ua government came up with another objection or pointed out that the french had promised to build them an international airport or the japanese would finance a better desalination plant or the us had offered them their own nuclear power station or the british had suggested they might be able to arrange a visit by prince charles however according to the rumours id been hearing over the last few weeks perhaps there had been some resolution of the problem at last because the meeting at blysecrag had seemingly been set up to bring the whole matter to a head pens might well be wielded hearty handshakes shared and leatherbound document wallets exchanged perhaps i thought as i stood there in my waders watching uncle freddy reel in a lively little trout that very evening ah said uncle freddy throwing the car into a corner and twirling the steeringwheel until his arms were crossed the ferrari went briefly sideways and teetered on the edge of a spin come on come on old girl uncle freddy muttered not to me to the car i clutched my purse to my chest and felt my legs pull up instinctively squeezing the shiny shoppingbags behind my calves in the footwell we continued to head for the hedge for what felt like a few seconds then the daytona seemed to gather itself just at the apex of the corner and its long red bonnet lifted as we roared on down the resulting straight cars were uncle freddys weakness the old stables at blysecrag contained a collection of exotic automobiles some of them very fast that would have shamed most motor museums we were on our way back from harrogate which was about forty minutes drive from blysecrag or half an hour if you drove like uncle freddy he had offered to drive me into town to pick up a new dress for the formal dinner that evening i had forgotten quite how enthusiastic a driver he could be we had been talking on my part largely to take my mind off the mortal peril uncle freddy appeared to be intent on putting us both in about the fenua ua situation and i had expressed the cautious hope as detailed above that things might be settled tonight then uncle freddy had said ah in that particular tone that made my heart seem to sink while at the same time my curiosity suddenly awoke sniffing something major i had been trying to distract myself from uncle fs driving by counting the money id withdrawn from a couple of cash machines in harrogate the developed world divides people neatly into two camps those who get nervous when they have too much money on them in case they lose it or get mugged and those who get nervous when they dont have enough in case they miss a bargain i am firmly of the second school and my lower limit of nervousness seems to be way way above most peoples higher one i tend to lose a lot in currency conversion charges but im never short of a bob or two i blame my upbringing i looked up from my purse at uncle freddy ah i said you bugger uncle freddy said under his breath as a tractor blocked the road ahead and a stream of cars coming in the opposite direction prevented him overtaking he looked at me and smiled suppose you might as well be told now as later he said what were not really interested in fenua ua i stared at him i put the cash away not fully counted what i said flatly its all a blind kate a distraction a distraction yup for what for the real negotiations the real negotiations i felt like an idiot all i seemed to be able to do was repeat what uncle freddy was saying yup he said again throwing the ferrari into a gap in the traffic and past the tractor the place were really buying is thulahn thulahn this was the tiny himalayan principality with which we had i had thought until now a very limited understanding just the usual money for diplomatic passports deal uncle freddy had mentioned the day before on the telephone that suvinder dzung the current prince of thulahn would be in attendance at blysecrag over the weekend but i hadnt thought any more about this beyond reconciling myself to an evening of unsubtle flirting and increasingly outrageous offers of jewels and royal yaks if id leave my door unlocked that night thulahn uncle freddy said were buying thulahn thats how we get our seat at the un and fenua ua oh thats only ever been to throw the other seats off the scent at this point i had better make clear that during the last decade or so when the idea of buying our own country and securing our own place at the un had been gaining popularity amongst the highups we seemed to have started referring to sovereign states as seats what right from the start oh yes uncle freddy said airily while we got quietly on with the negotiations with the thulahnese weve been paying a chap in the american state department a handsome sum every month to make sure they keep coming up with new ways of preventing us buying fenua ua but i mean pwah at this point uncle freddy puffed his cheeks out and lifted both hands from the wheel in a dangerously italianate gesture whod really want fenua ua i thought the actual place was irrelevant i thought it was the seat at the un that mattered yes but if youre going to buy somewhere you might as well buy somewhere decent dont you think decent thulahns a dump id been there theyve so little flat land their single landing strip has to double up as their football park the time i went we nearly crashed on our first attempt because theyd forgotten to remove one of the goalposts the royal palace is heated by smouldering yak dung uncle freddy well bits had been their national sport is emigration ah but its very high you see no danger from global warming there oh no also very survivable in the event of a meteorite strike or that sort of thing apparently and well be levelling off one of their mountains to make a proper airport plan is to carve out lots of caverns and tunnels and shift a lot of archive stuff there from switzerland theres quite a lot of hydroelectric power they tell me but weve got a nuclear plant we bought last year from pakistan just waiting to be installed oh come on get out the bloody way this last was addressed to the rear of a caravan blocking our progress i sat and thought while uncle freddy fretted and fumed thulahn well why not i said the fenua uans will be upset theyve done very well out of us and we shant be making a big fuss about buying thulahn we can keep the charade going with fenua ua until they have their airport or water plant or whatever from one of the other seats but in one generation theyll be under water theyll all be able to afford yachts thanks to us im sure that will come as a great comfort to them ah bugger you uncle freddy muttered and sent us slingshotting past the caravan a car approaching flashed its lights at us and you uncle freddy said before throwing the ferrari into the fluted entrance to blysecrags estate excuse my french he said to me gravel made a noise like hail in the wheel arches as the car fishtailed back and forth before straightening finding the tarmac that started at the gatehouse and roaring on down the drive i checked the time difference and then called one of my girlfriends in california luce kate how ya doin hon oh fine and dandy you well as can be expected given my bossbitch from hell just beat me at squash how politic of you to let her triumph i thought your boss was a guy no its deana markins who deana markins you know her you met her at mings last new year remember no the girls night out hmm

arrive guy called suvinder dzung i may have mentioned him oh yeah the guy who made a pass at you in the scullery well it was the orangery but yes thats my boy i dont think thats why ive been invited but im still just a little suspicious ill only be there to keep him entertained this the himalayan guy well as in hailing from not in physical appearance yes so hes a prince of this place yes but i thought he was the ruler he is so how come this guys called a prince if hes the ruler how come hes not the king no idea i guess its a principality not a kingdom no hold on uncle f said it was something about his mother shes still alive but he was married briefly so shes not the queen but at the same time hes not the king or something but frankly who gives a fuck not i amen chapter three over the next few hours blysecrag changed in character and became suddenly very busy cars trucks and coaches arrived separately and in convoy thundering up the milelong slope that was the finishing straight of the driveway helicopters touched down briefly to disgorge people on to the pad between the tennis courts and the polo ground from where the guests security people technicians entertainers and others were ferried to the house itself by a pair of peoplecarriers uncle freddy was in nominal charge of all this though as usual the people really masterminding everything were those of the businesss quaintly entitled conjurations and interludans division or the charm monsters as they were commonly known within the company so up from london was flown one of the most famous chefs in the country along with his entourage an extremely annoyed and insistent flyonthewall tv crew from the bbc were only prevented from accompanying him by being physically barred from the helicopter arranged through longpredated paperwork in a manner that would make it look like a coincidence a photo shoot with a similarly worldrenowned photographer was set up for the weekend too by a fashion magazine belonging to one of our wholly owned subsidiaries this was supposed to make look less sordid the fact that we had a house full of rich and powerful men none of them accompanied by wives or partners and a rather larger number of stunningly beautiful and allegedly unattached young women all desperate to make a name for themselves in the world of fashion modelling glamour photography acting or well almost anything additional cooks servants entertainers and so on decamped from a series of coaches and minibuses i spotted miss heggies at one point surveying everything that was going on from a thirdfloor gallery window she looked like a proud solitary old lioness whose territory had just been invaded by about three hundred loping hyenas our own security people swarmed over the place chunkily crewcut and sobersuited to a man and a woman most of them in dark glasses all of them with a little wire connecting one ear and their collar and muttering into concealed lapel mikes you could tell the ones new enough never to have encountered blysecrag before by the sheen of sweat on their foreheads and their look of barely controlled professional horror with all its lifts cellars walkways passages stairways galleries dumbwaiters laundryhandling wardrobe hoists and complexly interconnecting rooms securing the house in any meaningful sense was simply impossible the best they could do was sweep the grounds be grateful there was never less than a twokilometre distance between the high wall that bordered the entire estate and the house itself and try hard not to get lost prince suvinder dzung of thulahn arrived from leedsbradford airport by car twenty years earlier the prince had lost his wife of a few months in a helicopter crash in the himalayas which was why he didnt arrive in one of the machines now his transport was from uncle freddys collection a bucciali tav which must count as one of the worlds more outrageouslooking cars having a hood or bonnet as wed say here about the same length as a mini shortly after sending the email to brussels that would dispatch somebody freddy and i trusted to silex in motherwell i joined uncle freddy on the front steps to greet our guest of honour frederick ah and the lovely kate ah i am so glad to see you both kate as ever you take my breath away always gratifying to be compared with a blow to the solar plexus prince hello hello hello uncle freddy shouted apparently of the opinion that the prince had become suddenly deaf and deserved greeting in triplicate the prince accepted a hearty handshake from a beaming uncle freddy and imposed a prolonged hug upon me before planting a moist kiss on my right middle finger he fluttered his eyelids at me and smiled you are still righthanded my lovely miss telman i pulled my hand away and put it behind my back to wipe it in a fight im a southpaw prince how nice to see you again welcome back to blysecrag thank you it is like coming home suvinder dzung was a marginally tubby but lightfooted fellow of a little more than average height with glisteningly smooth dark olive skin and a rakish perfectly black moustache which matched his glossily waved and exquisitely sculpted hair educated at eton he spoke without a trace of a subcontinental accent unless he was profoundly drunk and when in england dressed in savile rows conservative best his major affectation apart from being a bit of a showoff on the dance floor was his collection of gold rings which glittered with emeralds rubies and diamonds come in come in come in old chap uncle freddy said still apparently addressing a triumvirate of princes and waving his shepherds crook so enthusiastically that it nearly felled the princes private secretary a small pale beadyeyed fellow called b k bousande who was standing at the princes side holding a briefcase oops sorry bk uncle freddy laughed this way prince we have your usual suite my dearest kate suvinder dzung said bowing to me and winking as he turned to go see you later alligator i laughed in a while cayman isler he looked confused well thank god we didnt put much money into russia uncle freddy exclaimed he passed the port to me and picked up his cigar from the ashtray pulling on it and rolling the smoke round his mouth what a fucking débâcle i was under the impression we put quite a lot of money into russia mr hazleton said from the other side of the table opposite me he watched as i poured myself a small measure i had permitted myself a relatively unphallic guantanamo cigar along with my coffee the evenings fun was barely begun we had been promised the run of the casino later where we would each be given a stack of chips plus there would be dancing so far there had been no mention of anything as vulgar as our buying suvinder dzungs country off him i handed the port to the prince there were eleven of us around a small diningtable in a modest room set off blysecrags cavernous main dining room we had been many more for dinner our fellow diners having included our titled photographer a television presenter a couple of italian opera singers one soprano one tenor a french cardinal a usaf general a pair of boyish pop stars id heard of but didnt recognise plus an older rock singer i did an american conductor a cabinet minister a fashionable young black poet a couple of lords one duke and two dons one from oxford and one from chicago after pudding we had excused ourselves to talk business taking the prince with us though as i say not much business had actually been talked so far all this to impress suvinder i wondered if we werent appearing a little desperate maybe we were anticipating problems during the negotiating sessions which would start tomorrow there were a few of our own junior people present too lurking quietly in the background plus a couple of the princes servants and standing with his feet spread and his hands clasped in the shadows behind his boss the taut and bulky presence of mr walker hazletons chief of security well we did uncle freddy told hazleton depending on what you call a lot of money but the point is we put in a lot less than most people and a hell of a lot less than a few proportionately were ahead when the pains shared out how comforting mr hazleton was a very tall very imposing man with a broad tanned slightly pockmarked face under a lot of white hair which was as millimetrically controlled as uncle freddys was wildly abandoned he had a deep voice and an accent that seemed to originate somewhere between kensington and alabama when id first met him hed sounded like an archetypal smooth english toff as opposed to uncle fs batty variety but like me hed lived in the states for the last ten years or so and had picked up some of the local intonation this gave him an accent that was either quite charming or made him sound like an english actor trying to sound like somebody from the deep south depending on your prejudices hazleton was cradling a crystal bowl of bunnahabhain in one large walnut hand and pulling on a cigar the size of a stick of dynamite ive always found it hard to look at level ones like hazleton without automatically multiplying the image they presented to me by their wealth as though all their money possessions and stock options acted like giant mirrors proliferating them across any given social space like opposing mirrors in a lift these days we were getting close to being able to assume that anyone at level one was a billionaire not quite in the same financially stratospheric league represented by bill gates or the sultan of brunei but not far off it maybe a factor of ten away the only other level one exec present was madame tchassot a small brittlelooking lady of about sixty who sported tiny glasses and wore her unfeasibly black hair in a tight bun she had a thin pinched face and was chainsmoking dunhills besides uncle freddy there were five other second level people including the recently promoted adrian poudenhaut hazletons protégé and main man in europe he was a tall but podgy englishman with a midatlantic accent who until id come along had been the youngest person to make it to level three wed never got on though uncle freddy had a soft spot for him because he was another petrol head and so always got a tour of the car collection when he came to blysecrag he was rumoured to have some sort of thing going with madame tchassot though nobody was sure and as she rarely left switzerland and he was often at hazletons side in the states it could only have been pretty sporadic personally i found the very idea of the two of them bumping uglies profoundly unsettling the other level twos were m m abillah a small mostly silent seventyyearold moroccan christophe tieschler a merrylooking german geezer of extravagant and seemingly selfsatisfied plumpness and jesus becerrea an aristocraticlooking portuguese with darkly hooded eyes there was only one other level three there stephen buzetski a sandyhaired rangylimbed guy with freckles crinkly eyes a few years older than me whom i loved and whom id loved from the first moment id set eyes on him and who knew this and who was obviously and genuinely flattered and embarrassed by this in equal measure and who was so intolerably perfect and nice and lovable that he wouldnt cheat on his wife to whom he wasnt even all that happily married just faithful the bastard they do say the russians need a strong man their tsars their stalin suvinder dzung put in letting one of his servants pour his port while he undid his bowtie and unbuttoned his dinner jacket the prince wore a dark purple cummerbund secured by golden clasps he was given to sticking both thumbs into the broad belt and stretching it against his belly i wondered if he was trying to twang it maybe he didnt know a good cummerbund doesnt twang perhaps the prince said they need another one what they might get prince is the communists back hazleton drawled if i didnt think yeltsin was just an alcoholic clown i could believe he was secretly a communist himself supposed to appear to attempt capitalism but then make such a godawful mess of it that the brezhnev days look like a golden age in comparison and the marxistleninists like saviours ms telman madame tchassot said suddenly in her sharp little voice i understand you visited russia recently have you any thoughts on the matter i blew out some smoke id intended to keep my head down for the rest of the afterdinner discussion having earlier revealed myself to all as a dangerous radical id contrasted unfavourably the wests reaction to a bunch of the already very rich getting caught out in their hedgefund speculations with that of the response to the unfolding catastrophe caused by hurricane mitch in one case a rescue fund of several billion us dollars was put together within a few days in the other a couple of million had eventually been pledged as long as there was no dangerous talk about a debt moratorium or even perish the thought a total writeoff yes i was i said but i was there to look at a few interesting technologies rather than at their society as a whole whats happened adrian poudenhaut said is that the russians have created their own form of capitalism in the image of what was portrayed to them as the reality of the west by the old soviet unions propaganda machine they were informed that there was nothing but gangsterism gross and endemic corruption naked profiteering a vast starving utterly exploited underclass and a tiny number of rapacious vicious capitalist crooks who were entirely above the law of course even at its most laissezfaire the west was never remotely like that but thats what the russians have now created for themselves you mean radio free europe didnt convince them how sweet life here in the west really was hazleton said with a smile maybe it did poudenhaut conceded maybe most thought it was diametrically equivalent propaganda and took an average the soviets never slandered the west like that i said no poudenhaut said ive seen the old films looked like it to me very old and not representative then the point is that the russians dont really have capitalism at all right now people dont pay their taxes so the state cant pay its employees the majority of people exist through selfsufficiency and bartering and theres negligible accumulation of capital reinvestment and development because all the moneys siphoned off to swiss banks including ours so what they actually have is barbarism im not saying many russians believed life in the west was as awful as it was sometimes portrayed poudenhaut said theres just a nice symmetry to the fact that its the caricature theyre in the process of copying not the reality i dont think they understand it themselves whereas you obviously do i suggested anything we could do hazleton asked me to profit us or to help them i asked well preferably both i thought wed probably be doing civilisation in general a favour if we had here i mentioned a fairly wellknown russian politician killed poudenhaut snorted with laughter hazletons blue eyes partially disappeared a fine network of lines appeared at the corners of his eyes i have a feeling we may have had some sort of dealings with the gentleman already he said he has his moments of slapstick too ill grant but he might not be quite as black as hes painted i raised my eyebrows and smiled one of the other gentlemen cleared his throat somewhere down the table by my side the prince sneezed a servant appeared flourishing a handkerchief you think he is as black as hes painted ms telman hazleton said easily i have this very odd feeling i said that somebody like me though probably male i added with a general smile just catching the concernedlooking gaze of stephen buzetski was sitting here nearly seventy years ago saying the same sort of thing about germany and a faintly comical smalltime politician called adolf hitler it was really only at about this point that it struck me quite how outspoken i was being i had to remind myself a little late perhaps quite how powerful the people in this room were adrian poudenhaut laughed again then saw that hazleton was looking very levelly and seriously at me and stopped thats quite a comparison to make ms telman hazleton said hitler uncle freddy said suddenly as though waking up did you say hitler dear girl i was suddenly aware that just about everybody in the room was looking at me herr tieschler was politely studying his cigar perhaps the trouble is you never can tell stephen buzetski said reasonably maybe if somebody had shot hitler seventy years ago somebody else would have taken his place and things would have worked out much the same it depends whether you believe in the primacy of individuals or social forces i guess he shrugged i sincerely hope im completely wrong i admitted i imagine i probably am but right now russia is the sort of place that makes thinking along such lines seem quite natural hitler was a strong man m m abillah pointed out he made the cattle trucks run on time i agreed the man was an evil genius and no mistake the prince informed us but germany was in a sorry mess when he took over was it not suvinder dzung looked at herr tieschler as though for support but was ignored oh yes i said it was left in a far better state after a hundred divisions of the red army had paid a visit and a succession of thousandbomber raids had stopped by well now began stephen buzetski do you really think it is our business to go around having politicians shot ms telman asked jesus becerrea raising his voice to shout down stephen no i said i looked at hazleton whom i knew had made a lot of money for himself and us in both central and south america over the years im sure that would never even cross our minds or if it did we would swiftly dismiss it ms telman hazleton said with a steely smile because acting upon such a thought would make us bad people would it not was i being ganged up on i was certainly being invited to keep deepening the hole i seemed already to be digging for myself it might make us no better than everybody else i said then looked at uncle freddy blinking furiously beneath his cloud of white hair to my left however proportionately to quote mr ferrindonald we might hope to be ahead when the pains shared out pain can be a good thing poudenhaut said relatively i said in evolutionary terms its better to feel pain and rest up than to carry on walking and hunting on an injured leg say but but its about discipline isnt it poudenhaut said is it pain teaches you a lesson its one way there are others sometimes there is no alternative really i widened my eyes gosh its like a child he explained patiently you can argue with it and get nowhere or you can just administer a short sharp smack and its all cleared up that applies to parents with children schoolsany relationship where one half knows whats best for the other half i see mr poudenhaut i said and do you beat your other half i mean do you beat your own children i dont beat them poudenhaut said with a laugh i give them the occasional slap he looked round the others every family has a naughty stick doesnt it were you beaten as a child adrian i asked he smiled quite a lot at school actually he lowered his head a little as he looked round again as though quietly proud of this proof hed obviously been a bit of a lad it never did me any harm my god i said sitting back you mean youd have been like this anyway you dont have any children do you kate he said oblivious indeed not i agreed so you so i dont really know what im talking about i suppose i said breezily though i do seem to recall being a child i guess we all need to be taught a lesson stephen buzetski said casually reaching for a large onyx ashtray and grinding out his cigar i think i need to be taught that gamblin dont pay he looked towards a rather slumped uncle freddy and grinned that casino of yours open yet sir casino uncle freddy said sitting upright again what a splendid idea just fuck me stephen it wouldnt be right kate then just let me fuck you you wont have to do a thing ill do it all itll be fabulous dreamlike you can pretend it never happened that wouldnt be right either it would be right it would be very right trust me it would be the rightest sweetest nicest thing thats ever happened to either of us i know this i do i feel it in my water you can trust me just let me kate i made a promise i took these vows so so does everybody they cheat i know people cheat everybody cheats no they dont every man does they do not everyone ive met does or would if i let them thats you youre just so enticing except to you no to me too but you can resist im afraid so we were standing in the darkness by the stone wall at one end of the milelong reflecting lake the house lay behind us uncle freddy had had the newly renovated gas flarepath lit for the first time that night suvinder dzung had been allowed to ignite it and a small plaque to this effect had been unveiled to the princes obvious delight gas burbled with a comical farting noise from a hundred different patches of water flames burned above detached torches on a wide obsidian floor fifteen hundred metres long the converging florettes of yellow flame receded into the distance becoming tiny stitching the night if you looked closely you could see the little blue cones of pilot lights hissing away at the end of thin copper pipes sticking out above the water in the middle of each darkly bubbling source of fire i had gambled in the casino i was gambling now though with no real hope of winning i had talked to various people i had even made some sort of peace with adrian poudenhaut i had put off suvinder dzung as politely but firmly as possible when hed tried to get me to come to his room i had stood on the terrace with everybody else to watch fireworks crack and splash across the night skies above the valley casually shooing off the straying right ringencrusted hand of the prince as he came to stand by me and tried to fondle my bum elsewhere in the main house there were rooms you could go to for drugs and apparently there was one where there was some sort of live sex show going on which might turn into an orgy later depending on demand i had talked to the poet and the soprano found myself being embarrassingly girly with the ageing rock singer on whom id had a crush in my teens and been chatted up by both the american conductor and the oxford don i had said hello to the monument in muscle and bronze armani that was colin walker as he stood behind hazleton who was playing at the blackjack table and asked him how hed been enjoying his visit to britain hed told me in his soft measured voice that he had only flown in yesterday but that so far it had been just fine maam i had danced energetically to what i suppose was rave music in one of the small ballrooms with some of the younger execs and fellow guests and more sedately to the music of the forties and fifties played by a big band in the largest ballroom where most of the higherlevel people were suvinder dzung twinkletoed and undeniably impressive had swept and dipped me round the room a couple of times though by then thankfully he was starting to become distracted by a couple of lissom beauties one blonde one auburn whom i assumed were the cavalry dispatched to my rescue by uncle freddy it was there in the ballroom that id encountered stephen buzetski again at last and persuaded him to get up on to the floor and danced with him and eventually danced him out into the night air and then along a terrace from which wed seen again the lights of the reflecting lake id taken my shoes off and hed carried them for me as wed crossed the lawn it was cold and my little blueblack versace number didnt provide much in the way of warmth so this had given me the perfect excuse to hug him and be hugged by him and have him put his jacket around me which smelled of him my shoes stuck out of his jacket pockets stephen youre a rich and handsome man youre a nice guy but lifes too short dammit whats wrong with you i balled a fist and thumped him gently on the chest is it me am i so unattractive am i too old that is it isnt it im just too old he grinned face lit by the dully roaring yellow flames kate weve been through this before you are one of the most beautiful and attractive women i have ever had the good fortune to meet i cuddled into him hugging him tighter pathetically adolescently delighted by what had to be an outright lie nothing about my age then i muttered into his shirt he laughed look youre younger than me and you certainly dont look your age anyway satisfied yes no i pulled back and looked into his eyes so what cant you stand women who take the initiative we had as hed said been through all this before but this too was a dance something that had to be gone through the first time wed been over this ground four years earlier id suggested he might be gay hed rolled his eyes that was when i knew just how perfect he was from the way he did that because rolling his eyes in that way even if it hadnt seemed like an impossibly cute expression in its own right just made it so obvious that this had happened to him before that women had accused him of being gay in the past in their confused and wounded pride at being rejected and he was getting fed up hearing it that was when i knew it really wasnt just me it was other women too very possibly all of them he really was faithful to his wife and really not being either especially choosy or mildly sadistic which of course made him perfect because thats what we try to forget isnt it if hell cheat on her with you hell cheat on you with somebody else by and by so finding a man like this was like hitting the jackpot discovering the mother lode closing the deal of your lifeonly to find the pot had already been cleaned out the claim had been staked by somebody else and the papers had already been signed without you my girlfriends and i had been over this territory often enough too by the time you got to our age all the good ones were gone but until you got to our age you couldnt tell which ones were the good ones what were you supposed to do marry young and hope i suppose or wait for the divorcees and trust you got one whod been a cheatee rather than a cheater or lower your standards or settle for a different type of life altogether which revolved around you as an individual and not you as one half of a couple and which was anyway what id always thought id wanted until id met stephen no i find it flattering when women take the initiative you just never give in what can i tell you im just a boring onewoman guy which meant of course as he was a very honest but also pretty smart guy and he had chosen not to give me a straight answer that he probably had strayed once and so knew what he was talking about which only made me even more sad because it hadnt been with me that hed been unfaithful and so id lost out not once but twice everybody else is doing it stephen hey come on kate what sort of argument is that besides im not them but youre missing out its an opportunity youremissing out i repeated lamely its not some business thing kate yes it is everything is everything is trade transactions options futures marriage is always has been im offering you a deal that would be great for both of us where neither of us loses pure gain total satisfaction on both sides a deal youre crazy to turn down ive got my peace of mind to lose kate ive got a whole guilt trip waiting for me if i did id have to tell em are you mad dont tell her she might find out anyway shed divorce me take the kids shed never know im not asking you to leave her or the children i just want whatever i can get from you anything an affair a single night one fuck anything i cant kate you dont even love her i do no you dont youre just comfortable with her well you know maybe thats what passion becomes what it grows into it doesnt have to be how can you be so determined so ambitious in your business life and so meek in private you shouldnt settle for so little or if you need that bland comfort bit you should have the passion too with somebody else with me you deserve it he let go of me gently holding my hands in his and looking into my eyes kate even with you i dont want to talk about em and the children he looked embarrassed dont you see to me this is like having an affair i get guilty just talking about this sort of thing with you so youve nothing to lose so ive everything to lose believe me this guilt is barely registering on my inbuilt guiltometer but it still troubles me if i climbed into bed with you itd go off the scale i sank back towards him closing my eyes at the very thought believe me stephen a lot would go off the scale he laughed quietly and pushed me away again i didnt think you could push somebody away tenderly but he did i just cant kate he said solemnly and the way he said it just had that stamp of closure over it we d reached some sort of interim result if not a conclusion i could still choose to pursue the matter if i insisted but only at the risk of seriously pissing him off i shook my head guiltometer really you know what i mean yeah i sighed i guess i do he shivered in his white dress shirt hey its getting kind of cold out here dont you think it is lets go back think ill go for a swim before i turn in ill come and watch may i sure blysecrags pool was only a little short of olympic in size buried underground at the end of a tangle of corridors and locatable principally by smell i went arm in arm with stephen down the carpeted corridors the place was dark when we arrived and we had to search for the light switches feeling round the walls until we found them and the lights flickered on above and below the still water the walls were covered with trompe loeil paintings showing pastoral scenes set in a landscape more gently rolling than that surrounding blysecrag and partially obscured by white doric columns spaced every few metres there were numerous tables chairs loungers and potted plants positioned near the walls on two roomlong strips of astroturf and a bar at the far end of the huge space the arched roof was painted blue with lots of little white fluffy clouds i stood looking out over the calm blue surface while stephen disappeared into the changing rooms people had been here earlier the tiled floor was puddled there were towels and bits of swimming costumes scattered around and a welter of poolsidesafe plastic flutes stood or lay by champagne buckets on the tables or had fallen to the pretendgrass floor but the place was quiet and empty now and the waters lay level undisturbed by even the slightest ripple now that the recirculating pumps had been switched off i looked at my watch it was five fifteen much later than id intended to stay up ah well stephen appeared in a pair of baggy blue trunks grinned at me and dived into the water it was a beautiful dive creating what seemed like far too small a splash just a few tiny waves and a larger swell that moved languidly out from his point of entry i watched his long tan body glide across the pale blue tiles on the pools floor then he surfaced shook his head once and settled into a powerful easylooking crawl i sat down by the edge of the pool one knee drawn up under my chin and just watched he completed a dozen lengths then cut across the waves to me sticking his elbows into the gutter that ran along the underside of the pools edge having fun i asked yeah slow pool though slow what is it full of heavy water or something no but its got this side wall he told me patting the tiles above the gutter the waves reflect back out into the pool so youre always slapping into them modern pools dont have walls the water goes right to the top and spills into a flush trench under a grating i thought about this he was right of course carries a lot of the wave energy away he said gives you calmer water makes the pool faster i see he looked puzzled think you could swim in heavy water d two o i suppose so oh well think ill get out now ill wait he struck out for the chrome steps in one corner lifted himself out in one exquisite flowing movement and dripped away to the changing rooms i sat listening to the airconditioning hum and watched the reflections the waters cast on the ceiling and walls their long twisting veins of gold shimmered across the artificial sky and flickered amongst the grooved surfaces of the white plaster columns i looked down at the chopping waters of the pool recalling how perfectly still and calm they had been when wed arrived every wave every ripple on that surface as well as every dancing flick of light curving across the vault of sky and clouds above had been caused by him by his body his muscles powering the shape and weight and surface of his frame through those waters had spread that grace and effort throughout the pool and sent the light unwinding across the painted clouds and sky i rocked forward reaching one hand down to the waters surface and let the liquid come up to meet my flattened palm the little waves hitting my skin like a succession of soft caresses their gentle patting beat like that of an inconstant heart the waters calmed gradually again the waves fell back and smoothed slowly out the veins of light dancing on the ceiling became lazier and broader like a river flowing towards the sea the airconditioner hummed okay stephen said i looked up at him one part of me wanted to let him go back by himself so that i could stay here alone with the humming silence of the air and the slow averaging of the lulling waters but his freckled face tired though still smiling and open and friendly would not let me i accepted a hand up we switched off the lights and returned to the main house he saw me to my room door kissed me lightly on the cheek and told me to sleep well which eventually i did mmm yes hello kathryn is that you uh speaking speaking yes who is that me meme it is me prince suvinder yes kathryn suvinder its the middle of the night ah no what i mustmust correct you there kathryn it is not the middle of the night no

some things about the way our company works the first thing to understand is that we are up to a point democratic put simply we vote for our bosses never mind about that for now well come back to it secondly were quite serious about insisting that if people want to rise above a certain level in the corporate hierarchy they must renounce any religious faith they have previously espoused in practice all this means is that an executive promoted to the rank we once called magistratus then deacon and now call level six has to swear theyve given up their faith we dont insist that people stop going to their churches or their temples or stop worshipping either in public or in private or even stop funding religious works though some sort of gesture in this direction is generally expected and appreciated we certainly do not insist that people stop believing in their heads or their souls if you will all thats required is that people are prepared to swear theyve stopped believing this is quite sufficient to weed out the real zealots the type of people admirable in their way if you esteem that sort of behaviour who would prefer to be burned alive than switch to a different branch of the same church thirdly we practise total financial transparency any company officer may inspect the accounts of any other this has become much easier technically in recent years of course with the advent of computers and electronic mail but the principle has been around since the first century ad its effect is to make corruption as a rule either unachievable or only possible at a trivial scale the main downside is complication this was the case when people had to open up cabinets full of wax tablets for inspection when they had to unroll papyrus scrolls when they had to unchain books from countingroom desks when they had to order old ledgers from storage when they had to search through microfiches and it is certainly the case now with computerised accounts over two millennia every technological advance that promised to make the task easier has been closely and seemingly inevitably accompanied by an increase in the complexity of the figures and systems involved always looking for ways to cut costs weve carried out trials which involve abandoning this practice for specific times and in certain places intending to give it up entirely if the trials prove successful but the results have always persuaded us that the benefits outweigh the costs of course corruption is always possible and probably inevitable a company worry has always been that one of our number might siphon off very small amounts of money over a long period and use that as seed capital for transactions which though they exist outside the business are only possible thanks to the contacts trust and information that persons membership of the company has brought and which grow exponentially until they distort the relationship between the apparent and real economic effect that person produces this sort of scam has been tried by various individuals in the past but as a rule such perpetrators are discovered unless they intend to bury their gains in the ground they have to do something with the profits and an executive living significantly beyond their so easily checkable means has always been a sure sign some sort of chicanery has been going on if somebody plays the long game of building up a big cash fund somewhere we cant see while continuing to live relatively modestly and then retires early suddenly seriously moneyed to their own caribbean island we are not above indulging in our own style of chicanery to try and recover the funds we reckon belong to us we arent the mafia and as far as i know we dont blow anybodys legs off but its surprising what you can do when you have your own swiss bank and youre owed favours that go back in some cases for centuries actually maybe its not surprising at all still it is possible to beat the system big time in the late nineteenth century a certain monsieur couffable one of our senior french executives made a sizeable independent fortune on the paris bourse which we didnt know about until he died hed spent every centime buying dutch old masters which he kept in a secret art gallery beneath his loire château so there you are you do have to bury your money in the ground we never did get our hands on those paintings despite having some very capable lawyers and the cooperation of the late monsieur couffables widow they were childless hed willed the secret collection to his mistress anyway this practice has now become known as couffabling as a business we try very hard not to get couffabled usually whats ours stays ours a legitimately made fortune is never entirely personal in the business and specifically it is impossible to bequeath all youve made to your offspring or indeed anybody else who isnt one of us the higher a person rises within our company the greater becomes the proportion of their income paid in the form of stock options pension rights travel and other perks and so on so far so normal lots of corporations limit the personal tax exposure of their senior people by giving them access to and often unlimited use of cars and drivers apartments mansions aircraft and yachts the lear jet might belong to the company and be shown as a taxliable item on the corporate books but its at the exclusive disposal of the ceo who can use it to go shopping or golfing if he damn well pleases in the same way its the company that pays for the box at the opera or the ball game and the membership of the yacht or country club we do the same sort of thing except perhaps more so the difference between us and others lies in the disposability of the assets that are nominally the property of the executive involved most of these can be sold back only to others in the business and even then there is a strict ranking of how much one can own according to ones hierarchical level what this means is that dynasties are difficult to establish and almost impossible to maintain no matter how doting a father in the business may be he cannot pass on all his power and money to a favourite son just because he wants to the father can make the son rich by most peoples standards and he can attempt to further his boys career in the company but he cannot make junior as rich as he has been or ensure that he too achieves the organisations summit the vast majority of senior execs are quite happy with this arrangement as theyre usually the sort of people who believe that hard work and brains are the keys to success and have formed a dim view of any privilege which has been inherited rather than earned this sort of attitude can actually be seen more clearly outside the business where quite a few very rich and successful fathers whove been in total charge of their own companies have left their children an only modest provision in their wills not through general or specific vindictiveness but just to ensure that their offspring dont start out spoiled and so that they too will know that if they do achieve anything it has at least partially been due to their own abilities rather than the sheer good luck of having a rich daddy naturally all this changes if the individual in the company invents something or has patents to their name take uncle freddy for example an associate level two he would probably only be a level five or six but for the fact that he invented the chilptm the chilptm is the technical name uncle freddys own i think hes a trifle sad it never caught on for those little containers of whitish liquid that you get in tourist class in aircraft or in cafés service stations and not very good hotels instead of a proper jug of milk the original things were those ghastly little pots with aluminium covers that it took both hands to open if you were lucky and which even if you opened them carefully usually splattered their contents over you it was uncle freddy who came up with the much neater modern version which opens cleanly and can be worked onehanded one of those things most of us look at and think why didnt anybody think of that before or i could have thought of thatexcept that uncle freddy actually did chilpstm are literally tiny things but theyre produced by the billion every year the tiniest royalty on each one soon builds up to a very considerable fortune indeed and as uncle f invented the thing hes got the patent and so he gets all the money his promotion to level two in the business was honorary that kind of thing can throw out our system a bit but somehow we manage to accommodate even the uncle freddies of the world a better solution for us as a company of course would have been to have owned the patents corporately and there are a few lucrative ones which we do own and a few more we are cautiously optimistic about an example is the incantm this is a tube made from aluminium plastic or even waxed paper designed to deliver two measured doses of finely ground powder into the nasal passages its registered with every major patent office in the world as a way to deliver either snuff or some sort of medicinal draught into the users nose but nobody who knows about it is under any illusions about its real role and we have no intentions of letting it be used for such a mundane purpose its a cocainedelivery device for when eventually the stuff is legalised youll buy a pack of incanstm no bigger than a pack of long cigarettes from wherever is licensed to sell them by which time of course you may not be able to purchase legally a pack of tobacco cigarettes pop the tab off one snort snort and bingo no chopping cutting and ploughing into stupid little lines on a mirror or the top of a toilet cistern unless youre so into ritual you regard that as the best bit ive tried them at our labs in miami they work best of all for us they work only once unless youre some sort of unabomberstyle microengineer you cant easily refill them the aluminium ones are very sleek and sexy and will be the original premium product they look a little like silver rifleshell cases we may do steel goldplated versions for the luxury and exclusive gift end of the market the plastic version is more massmarket more blue collar the wax paper ones are aimed at the more environmentally aware consumer and are biodegradable we have high hopes for the incantm back to the subject of corruption racketeering bribery blackmail and other common business practices even though our organisation has always been tolerant of such victimless crimes as prostitution blasphemy drugtaking belonging to a trade union sex andor procreation outside marriage homosexuality and so on the societies in which we have to live and with which we have to trade have usually had other ideas so secrecy and blackmail have never been entirely off the menu we are above all pragmatists corruption is frowned upon not because it is intrinsically evil but because it acts like a shortcircuit in the machinery of business or a parasite on the body corporate the point is to reduce such behaviour to a tolerable level not to attempt seriously to eradicate it utterly which would call for a regime so strict and confining it would limit the abilities of the organisation to change and adapt and stifle its natural enterprise even more severely than widespread corruption would even so what we regard as a tolerable level of internal corruption is thanks to our rules on financial transparency positively microscopic compared to that in just about every other organisation we do business with and it is a matter of considerable pride for us that in any given transaction or deal we will almost without exception be the most honest and principled party involved were quite happy to deal with corrupt regimes and people so long as the figures are all above board at our end in many cultures a degree of what is termed corruption in the west has long been a respectable and accepted part of the way business is done and we are ready willing and able to accommodate this in the west of course it is just as common its just not respectable or publicised in all this of course were just the same as any other business or state its just that weve been doing it longer and are less hypocritical about it so were better at it practice makes perfect even the practice of corruption it ought to be one of our mottoes corruption we deal with it voting for your immediate superiors usually strikes outsiders as the most bizarre of our business practices manual and clerical workers tend to find the concept unlikely and bizarre while those higher up have been known to react with outraged disbelief how can it possibly work it works i guess because people generally are not stupid and we do our best to recruit people who are smarter than most it works also because we are used to taking and are able to take a longterm view and perhaps because the practice does not extend into every other organisation we deal with and undertake joint operations with we have had several expensive but unpublished studies performed by highly respected universities and business colleges which have tended to support our belief that letting people vote for their bosses means that a greater proportion of able and gifted people flourish and rise using this method than any other the more usual system where people are picked out from above does have certain advantages talented people can often rise more quickly skipping several layers of management at once but it is our firm belief that this leads to more problems than it solves producing a culture where those on any given level within a company are constantly trying to find ways to flatter those above them sabotage the careers of their colleagues on the same corporate rung exploit oppress and denigrate those on the levels beneath them and generally spend far too much time frivolously furthering their own selfish ends and their status within the company when they ought rightfully to be engaged in the far more serious and productive pursuit of making all concerned more money our system doesnt put an end to all office politics of course nor does it reliably weed out every plausible rogue gifted bully or lucky idiot but it does make them easier to spot control and ditch before they get too far gaining promotion by fooling your boss especially one prone to flattery or sexual favours can be relatively easy gaining the trust of those who work with you every day and will have to take orders from you if you are promoted is a lot more difficult the usual objection to all this is dont people tend to vote for people wholl give them an easy ride sometimes they do and a division of our company might suffer because there is a naturalborn vacillator in charge but people can be demoted by those immediately below them too or pensioned off and worst case an entire department can be closed down from above its structure dismantled its duties redistributed and its personnel dispersed this almost never happens people would rather elect to put somebody in charge over them who knows what theyre doing and whom they respect even if they know that some of that persons later decisions will be disagreeable than work under somebody who will damage all their interests by taking either no decisions or only easy ones we have works councils too in most of our wholly owned subsidiaries though those tend to be at the sort of levels im not terribly familiar with none of this means that management is powerless its just that the spread of any given individuals power is different tending to spread more upwards and less downwards compared to the standard model its still possible for senior people to encourage the careers of juniors and its still possible for juniors to make themselves known to seniors and benefit thereby its just that neither can act without the tacit consent of those who will have to live with the effects of those actions we run generally a happy ship so why have you never heard of us until now we are not conspiratorial or even particularly secretive we dont believe in advertising ourselves but were sufficiently convinced of our own probity to be relaxed about any publicity that happens to come our way the most sinister reason given for our relative obscurity is that because we practise financial transparency and internal democracy while frowning upon conventional familial inheritance the worlds media generally run by people for whom any one of these ideas is anathema regard it as profoundly in their own interests to give us as little exposure as possible another reason is that we undertake many more joint ventures than we do wholly owned ones and in such situations we always let our partner company take the credit and deal with the exposure we are a holding company mostly our interests lying in other companies rather than physically manufacturing products or providing services direct to the public so were partly invisible also we have a variety of different company names and corporate identities for each individual branch of the business all accrued naturally over the centuries and so have no single name apart from the business of course which is so bland general and vague it is almost a form of invisibility in itself we do sometimes get confused with the cia though which is silly theyre the company besides theyre much more open than we are theres no sign on the dc beltway or anywhere else pointing to our hq when somebody sometimes a journalist more usually a competitor does start to investigate one of our concerns they find that the ownership trail leads sometimes straight sometimes only after the sort of byzantine flourishes and convolutions which are a good creative accountants artistic signature to one of those places that act as the commercial worlds equivalent of black holes into which public information might fall but from which none ever emerges the cayman islands liechtenstein or our very own great inagua we are not however totally invisible there are articles about us occasionally in magazines and newspapers sometimes there are television programmes that touch upon our interests and every now and again a business book will mention us the conspiracy theories are the most fun there have been a couple of books and a number of articles but the true home of those who would be our nemesis was the net and now is the web we have dozens of paranoid websites dedicated to us according to which one you choose to believe we are either a the major force behind the new world order which appears to be what americans too stupid to realise that the cold war is over they won and the world is theirs have adopted as the new bogey monster now that ronnies evil empire has a gnp a little less than disney corp b an even more extreme hideous and sinister branch of the international zionist conspiracy in other words the jews c a longterm deepentryist group of dedicated cadres charged by the executive council of the fourth international to bring down the entire capitalist system from within by gaining control of lots of shares and then selling them all at once to produce a crash which is the one i find most amusing d a wellfunded cabal of the littleknown worshippers of nostradamus cult intent on bringing about the end of the financial world through a roughly similar strategy to that of the international marxists which may or may not imply a rethink for this plucky group of theorists if we do all make it past the millennium e the militant commercial wing of the roman catholic church as if given the antics of the banco ambrosio and the black friars they needed one f a similarly extremist islamic

grotesquely powerful to reimpose european dominance over the new world in general and the usa in particular through sneaky cosmopolitan business practices and the introduction of the euro top prize

just move in the wrong circlesexcept i dont i an alien conspiracy run from a spacecraft buried under the new mexico desert sent to bring about the collapse of well see any or all of the above or j just bill gates retirement fund heck weve all been there youve reinstated the underwater nighttime flarepath and cleared the weeds out of your milelong landing lake some enterprising pilots skimmed a dinkylooking dovewhite ilyushin seaplane successfully down over the hills and trees kissed it on to the water and taxied noisily to the far end of the waterway to considerable applause from all those sports fans whove managed to prise themselves out of bed for the crack of noon and then your steam catapult guaranteed repaired by the best technicians money can buy just yesterday suddenly goes on the blink hellish isnt it actually i thought the pilot a dashing iranian looked relieved bugger and blast dont take it personally uncle freddy dammit bugger and blast uncle freddys shepherds crook decapitated two urns worth of michaelmas daisies and hydrangeas with one swinging swish well we missed the spectacle of an exsoviet navy seaplane being catapulted across the valley at the hills on the far side if you looked carefully you could still see the craters where the engineers had fired old trucks loaded with steel plate into the woods to calibrate the catapults throw but we did get to play dodgems being battered on all sides by overenthusiastic revellers without either a decent hangover or the rudiments of driving ability while sitting in a small car resembling a garishly tinplated slipper beneath an electrified metal grid is not necessarily my idea of the best way to ease myself back into sober normality but it seemed only polite to uncle freddy to join in after the disappointment with the catapult re cw who what where c walker pay attention what about him said hi to him yesterday at unc fs maintained hed just flown in day before ie thursday does not compute oh right more detail on adrian georges spotting of cw original message was garbled not at my end obviously ag saw cw while on way to office not in it glimpsed presence in cab in street wednesday this would be so probably that aspect was garbled too never mind ok hows the party going what party you mean youre not bcrg the moment ok yes party usual lowkey affair btw wheres your ass at singapore fun i always thought it was a bit like the east would be if it was run by the swiss this is not intended as a compliment see your point did you know chewinggums banned out here yup lee kwan u must have sat on a piece once and got all upset wonder if theres a flourishing smuggling trade careful even talking about that sort of things probably a crime or at least a misdemeanour fuck em i laugh in the face of their vicious antichewinggum laws yeah youre probably safe theyd never make it stick ack gags goodbye kate uncle freddy i had been summoned to uncle fs large and chaotic study in blysecrag after lunch while most people were still recovering from the excesses of one night and preparing themselves for those of the next jebbet e dessous gesundheit come now dear girl hes a level one i know isnt he the one in nebraska collects tanks and stuff thats right made the news a while ago when he bought a couple of them whatdyecallems rocket thingies scud missiles thats right was that him i thought that was another guy in southern california oh maybe the other chap got caught then and jebbet didnt that would be more like jebbet i cant remember uncle f looked confused and stared at something long grey and untidy on the floor which turned out to be one of the wolfhounds the beast stretched yawned with a single echoing snap of its extensive jaws and then such extreme activity having entirely exhausted it rolled flopping back over with a long sigh and fell asleep again uncle freddy opened his mouth as though to speak then became distracted by something on his desk uncle fs desk was covered to a depth of several inches with a bewildering assortment of mostly paperbased rubbish he picked up a long elegantlooking yshaped piece of metal and turned it over in his hands a look of intense concentration on his face then he shook his head shrugged and put it back again anyway i said anyway yes fancy paying old jebbet a visit do i have to what dont you like the fellow no ive never met him uncle freddy though his reputation goes before why do i have to go and see him well hes sort of asked to see you is that good or bad how dyou mean for him or you for me uncle freddy ahmpretty damn good id say cant do any harm getting to know old jebbet very highly respected amongst the other top brass he is oh yes uncle freddy paused completely mad of course thing is you know his umm nephew or something dont you i said dwight now there is a certain way of pronouncing dwights name that i find it hard to resist sort of dihwight when im trying to make it clear that the prospect of encountering the lad again has a coefficient of attraction roughly on a par with being invited to chew on a wad of silver paper i made no attempt to resist that temptation here dwight uncle freddy looked puzzled staring up at the study ceiling is that a real name dyou think kate that eisenhower fellow was called that too i remember but then he was called ike as well and i could never work out which was a contraction of the other i think it is a real name uncle freddy really yes dont worry its american ah i see jolly good anyway jebbet wants you to talk to the boy uncle freddy frowned and pulled on one pendulous earlobe the nephew dwight hes a playwright or something isnt he or something thought that was the fellow is he any good do you know as a playwright hmm from what ive seen no but of course its all very subjective for all i know the boys a genius modern sort of stuff is it he writes almost by definition hmm uncle freddy why does mr dessous want me to talk to dwight umm good question no idea he couldnt phone email uncle freddy looked pained and shifted uncomfortably in his seat no he definitely wants you to go there but look kate uncle f leaned forward and settled his elbows on the desk causing a small landslide of papers envelopes old magazines scraps of newspapers bits of tissue and by the sound of it at least one untilthen buried glass which fell to the floor with a thud and a faint chinking noise uncle freddy sighed and spared a glance at the stuff that had fallen i think there is something jebbet wants you to talk to the boy about some mad idea he needs talking out of but ive got a feeling he wants to talk to you himself as well the nephew thing might be an excuse for what well jebbets word counts for a lot with the american people in the business from his own level oh well down past yours lot of these young turk types the keen brigade they think the sun shines out of his behind frankly people like that at the us end of things theyre making up the majority of your level these days kate and the one below i know uncle exactly exactly uncle freddy looked pleased uncle freddy you havent actually answered my question what question was that dear girl why does he want to size me up oh for promotion of course old jebbet can put a lot of words in a lot of the right ears as i say the youngsters listen to him he must have heard about you you must have impressed him from afar and good for you i say im already at level three now uncle i was expecting to wait a while yet before any more promotion right now i dont think even i would vote for me to step up another rung think long kate uncle freddy said and actually wagged a finger at me you cant get a good impression in too early thats what i always say all right i said half elated and half suspicious would the middle of the week be suitable just about perfect i should think ill check with his people you still in york state yorkshire i said it was late afternoon on the west coast and id caught luce on her way to her shrink at uncle freddys yeah uncle freddy i was thinking is this the old guy who used to molest you dont be ridiculous luce he pats my butt now and again but thats all hes always been really good to me especially after mrs telman died last year i cried on his shoulder i hugged him if hed really wanted to try anything on that would have been the ideal opportunity but he didnt im just concerned he might have abused you in the past and youre in denial about it thats all what well you seem to just do anything he tells you to and you jump down my throat when i remind you this is the same guy whos sexually harassed you in the past what putting his hand on my backside yeah thats harassment thatd get you fired from any office most places interference with your fanny hell yes yeah my american fanny oh jeez if it had been your british fanny he should have been locked up well call me less than a perfect sister if i let one old guy i happen to like a lot briefly touch my bum through a couple of layers of material the point is i dont count that as abuse but you dont know i dont know what you dont know whether he abused you or not yes i do no you dont you think you know that he didnt but you dont really know that he didnt luce i think were in the same boat here neither of us knows what the hell youre talking about i mean maybe he did much worse things to you in the past and youve repressed all the grisly details and even the fact that it happened in the first place youre in denial about it all and its fucking you up but im not fucked up ha thats what you think you know in principle this idiocy could go on for ever exactly unless you take some action to discover the truth let me guess and the only way to find out is to go to a shrink right well of course look are you on commission or something im on prozac so what i prefer prosaic what i remember is what happened look im sorry i bothered you luce ill dont hang up dont hang up listen this must have been meant to happen because i was just on my wayin fact im here im at the place now look kate i just think theres somebody here that you need to talk to okay now just a second just a second hi

mind doc do you mind its my fucking phone thank you kate kate what the fucks this about ms sinkowitz have a nice session luce for the evening we had a circus to entertain us the word was that during the afternoon once suvinder dzung had been prised out of his bed and sobered up by his servants hazleton madame tchassot and poudenhaut had resumed negotiations with the prince his private secretary b k bousande and hisa gidhaur his exchequer and foreign secretary who had arrived that morning this negotiating party was late for dinner which was accordingly delayed for half an hour and then went on without them this was a little embarrassing as we had to entertain even more rich famous and titled people that evening compared to the friday however uncle freddy made some ridiculous excuse for our absentees guffawed a lot and told a series of longwinded jokes which kept everybody entertained in the drawing room until it was decided to go ahead with dinner anyway my beloved was gone stephen buzetski had disappeared after breakfast that morning called away to washington dc the circus in a tent on the lawn was one of these extreme affairs where people dress as though auditioning for mad max iv they juggled chainsaws attached heavy industrial machinery to their sexual organs and rode very noisy motorbikes while doing unlikely things with knives and flaming torches it was all terribly macho and camp at the same time and quite entertaining however id seen it all before several edinburgh festivals ago so didnt stay long i wandered back into the main house and took myself off to the snooker room i tend to play quite a lot of pool while trawling the inplay hangouts in silicon valley most of the cuttingedge dudes are young and male and find the idea of playing pool with a mature but wellpreserved lady pretty cool often theyll drop their guard when they realise theyre going to get beaten or become a little too relaxed and open if i let them win against the odds honing potting skills on a snooker or a billiard table is good practice for this sort of thing if you can regularly make pots from across eleven and a half feet of green baize switching to a pool table gives you the impression that the pockets have suddenly swollen to the diameter of basketball hoops adrian poudenhaut was there before me also indulging in some solitary play he looked tired he was polite almost deferential and gave up the table for me refusing the offer of a game he exited the room with a wary but knowing smile i looked at my reflection in the rooms tall windows i was frowning a tiny sparkle of light way in the distance caught my eye and i moved closer to the window the snooker room was on the second floor of blysecrag third if you counted the american way the last main floor before the servants quarters in the attics i remembered that from here on a clear night you could see the lights of harrogate another distant blossom of light rose above the town somebody was letting off fireworks it was two days after guy fawkes night but a lot of people held their displays over to the friday or saturday after the more traditional fifth of november i leant against the windowframe arms crossed watching you look sad kate i jumped which is not like me at all and turned round the voice had been male though i half expected to see miss heggies standing there just rematerialised suvinder dzung looking tired and a little sad himself was standing by the snooker table dressed in one of his savile row suits tie undone waistcoat unbuttoned hair less than perfect i was annoyed at myself for not having heard him or spotted his reflection did i look sad i asked giving myself time to gather my wits i thought so what are you watching he came closer and stood beside me i remembered watching our own fireworks the night before on the terrace and him putting his arm round my waist i edged away from him a little trying to make it look as though i was just making room for him but getting the distinct impression that he was perfectly well aware of what i was really doing he gave me a small maybe apologetic smile and did not try to touch me i wondered if he even remembered our early morning telephone conversation fireworks i said look ah yes of course gunpowder treason and plot and all that sort of thing that sort of thing i agreed there was an awkward silence pretty good view for a billiards room i said he looked at me theyre usually on the ground floor because of the weight i explained he nodded and looked thoughtful are you perhaps a catholic kate what you looked so sad the plot in which guy fawkes was taking part was an attempt to restore the catholic succession to england was it not i thought perhaps you were lamenting to yourself his lack of success in blowing up the houses of parliament i smiled no prince i was never a catholic ah he sighed and looked out of the window at the distant lights he smelled a little of smoke and some oldfashioned scent his eyes looked sunken and dark he seemed lost in his own thoughts ah well i hesitated then said you look a little low yourself prince has it been a long day most he said most long he stared out of the window he cleared his throat ah dear kate yes suvinder about our telephone conversation this morning i held up my hands as though to catch a basketball at chest height suvinder i said its all right i hoped i might settle the issue with just that gesture and those words plus a look of friendly sympathy and understanding but the prince had obviously already decided he was going to have his say i hate it when people are so damn programmed i hope you were not offended i was not prince as i said at the time i was annoyed at being woken up but the sentiments were most flattering they were he swallowed sincere but ill put the sincerity was by far the more obvious quality suvinder i said and even surprised myself at the way the words came out the prince looked pleased he gazed out the window again we both watched the few rising sparks i was thinking about how high up we were about the crags and cliffs and the undulating hills between us and the town when he said it is all so flat here isnt it i looked at him are you homesick suvinder perhaps a little he glanced at me you have only been to thulahn once havent you kate just the once and very briefly it was the rainy season then you did not see it at its best you should return it is very beautiful at this time of year im sure it is maybe one day he gave a small smile and said it would please me greatly thats very kind suvinder he bit his lip well then will you tell me why you were looking so despondent dear kate i dont know whether im just naturally reticent or its some businessinspired wariness to do with giving people a handle on my possible weaknesses but normally im loath to share any backstory as hollywood would call it stuff anyway i said i suppose i always find fireworks kind of sad i mean fun too but sad all the same suvinder looked surprised why is that i think it goes back to when i was a little girl we could never afford fireworks and my mother didnt like them anyway she was the kind of person who hid under the kitchen table when there was thunder the only fireworks i ever had of my own were a few sparklers one year and i managed to burn myself with one of those still have the scar see i showed him my left wrist oh dear he said sorry where there i mean i know its tiny looks like a freckle or something but well to have no fireworks as a child that is sad i shook my head its not that though what we used to do was on november the sixth each year my pals and i would go round the town where i lived collecting spent fireworks we d dig the roman candles up out of the ground and search for rockets in the woods and peoples gardens we tramped all over the bits of waste ground looking for these bright tubes of cardboard they were always wet and soggy and the paper was just starting to unravel and they smelled of dampness and ashes we used to stick them in a big pile in our gardens as though they were fresh and unused the thing was to have more fireworks and bigger ones than your friends i found it helped to go further afield to where the betteroff people had their displays oh so you were not just tidying them up i suppose we were doing that too inadvertently but really it was a kind of competition but why is that sad i looked at his big dark melancholy face because there are few things more forlorn and useless than a damp used firework and when i look back it just seems so pathetic that we used to treasure the damn things i shrugged thats all the prince was quiet for a while a few more rockets lit up the skies above harrogate i used to be frightened of fireworks he said when i was smaller the noise yes we have fireworks on many of our holy days and on the monarchs birthday my father would always insist that i let off the biggest and loudest of them it used to terrify me i would never sleep the night before my nurse would stop my ears with wax but still when i set off the larger mortars the blast would all but knock me head over heels and i would start to weep this displeased my father i didnt say anything for a while we watched the tiny silent sparks climbing spreading falling in the distance well youre in charge now suvinder i told him you can ban fireworks if you want oh no he said and looked mildly shocked i could never do such a thing no no they are traditional and besides i came to tolerate them he smiled hesitantly i would even say that now i love them i put my hand out and touched his arm good for you prince he looked down at my hand and seemed to be about to say something then his secretary b k bousande appeared at the door clearing his throat suvinder dzung looked round nodded then smiled regretfully i must go good night kate good night suvinder i watched him pad quickly silently away then turned back to look out of the dark window waiting for more of the tiny lights climbing above the town but there were none chapter five you bitch you asked for it i was just trying to help so was i what do you mean well you spoke so highly of this dr pegging i thought id give him something more to work on you can afford it think of the poor mans fees and i think youve got a crush on him anyway gee i imagine calling up a complete stranger thinking theyre your best friend is probably worth a whole years extra treatment exbest friend whatever oh kate dont be so horrible im sorry luce bygones i suppose word came through from jebbet e dessous people that the middle of the week was far too late to meet up they wanted me there asap so uncle fs lancia aurelia to leedsbradford where some sort of fuckup by british regional aeroflot a fairly regular occurrence judging by the bitter comments of some of my fellow nonpassengers meant i had to hire a helicopter from a company in the airport i phoned our corporate lawyers to let them know wed be charging ba for the relevant amount on my company credit card im with the prince on this one i dont like helicopters either or light aircraft for that matter though in my case its just because of the statistics anyway to heathrow in a bell jetranger with a businesslike pilot who thankfully didnt indulge in any smalltalk then the tinywindowed luxuriously upholstered cigar tube that is concorde no free seats and i was sat next to a smug advertising account director who was himself invasively well upholstered and determined to make the most of both the free champagne and four hours of enforced intimacy i slipped my earphones on and turned up the walkman sheryl crow at volume shut him up i fell asleep after the album finished and woke up as we were decelerating through bumpy clouds i was in that drowsy disconnected state where the bits of the brain that dream dreams and come up with crazy ideas havent been brought back on message by the rational part so that everything goes a bit haywire and i remember watching the us coast far far below and thinking well here i am and stephens in washington dc at least if theres some comprehensive worldwide catastrophe well be on the same continent in the event of some deepimpact type disaster if i survived i could start walking and attempt to find him yes and mrs b might have died tragically and we could start a new life together i shook myself out of it and looked out my us passport to speed the formalities when we landed jfk an american to chicago iffy lunch but the coffee had improved a slim commuter fokker to omaha and a very noisy militarylooking huey to jebbet e dessous vast property on the nebraskasouth dakota border eighty thousand acres of plains cattle scrub trees roads like a map grid and all the dust you could eat the copilot who helped strap me in insisted i wear a pair of heavy olivegreen headphones for the journey my hair which had survived intact for four flights one ocean and half a continent but which has always reacted badly to hats and serious headphones was going to need fixing later on half an hour in we hit some lowlevel turbulence over a series of pinecovered ridges my lunch began to let me know it hadnt really settled down properly and was thinking of relocating i considered the potentially onomatopoeic name of the helicopter i was travelling in and tried to take my mind off my nausea by thinking of other modes of transport with dubious names but only got as far as sikorsky and the cess in cessna before we reached calm air again and my lunch decided that on balance it was happy where it was we landed in late afternoon in a dusty airport on the outskirts of what looked like a small deserted town kicking up a great rolling ochre cloud welcome to big bend maam the pilot said thanks i took my time unclipping my harness and disconnecting the headphones while the dust settled an ancient willis jeep in us army colours roared up and sat just outside the limit of the slowing rotor blades the breeze was cold and sharp and dry beneath a lapis sky stroked with feathers of high pink cloud i could hear the steady crackcrackcrack of heavy machinegun fire from some way off the copilot dumped my bags in the back of the open jeep and jogged back to the huey which was powering up again ms telman the driver was a grizzled but healthylooking guy a decade or so older than me dressed in army fatigues he stuck out one hand eastil john eastil that all your luggage how do you do yes it is ill take you to your cabin hang on he spun the jeeps wheel and gunned the engine we roared away from the huey sorry its not a limo thats all right good to get some fresh air actually i was pleasantly surprised by the way mr eastil drove it was a lot more relaxing than uncle freddys floorthepedalanddamnthespeedbumps banzai style take you long to freshen up ms telman eastil asked mr dessous would like to meet with you directly five minutes my cabin was a tenminute drive away a sprawling wooden thing set in amongst the pines overlooking a slowflowing river winding through a shallow valley carpeted with long pale grass while eastil waited in the jeep outside i hung up my suit carrier washed my face squirted perfume behind my ears dragged a brush through my hair a toothbrush across my teeth and plonked the sadfaced monkey on a bedside table the walkin provided a skiing jacket which i pulled on as i strode out to the jeep we drove back into town through its deserted streets and out the far side we arrived at an old drivein movie theatre a huge field shaped like a baseball ground with the gantry for a vast screen at the wide end though there was no screen just the slim web of girders of its support structure there were a lot of trucks and heavy rigs scattered around and two big mobile cranes one of them with its jib extended and its body raised up off the ground by its extended jacks short rusty posts which must once have carried the speakers for the parked cars were arranged in serried rows across the weedstrewn lot we parked alongside a handful of fourwheel drives and sport utilities by the projection building which looked a lot like a concrete bunker with no proper windows but a scattering of small rectangular apertures all facing in the direction of the absent screen a long tube poked out of one hole miss telman good to meet you jebbet e dessous call me jeb i dont answer to much else ill call you miss telman till i get to know you better if thats all right with you how was your flight cabin okay bustling out of a door in the projection building came a large redfaced man dressed in the sort of speckled beige army fatigues the world has come to associate with the desert storm campaign he wore a similarly camouflaged cap incongruously it was the wrong way round as though he was trying to look new york hip of about five years ago from under which stuck tufts of hair that might have been sandy or just yellowing white he thrust out one massive hand his grip was delicate even sensitive how do you do jeb everythings been good he let go and stepped back to look at me youre a finelooking woman miss telman hope you dont mind me telling you that my opinion of my dumbass nephew has gone up and that takes a lot of doing ill tell you how is dwight oh still stupid he nodded at the jeep come on ill take you to him he looked up at the sky with a frown then pulled his cap the right way round jebbet e dessous driving style was more muscular than that of mr eastil who sat in the back holding on tight and chewing on a cold cigar sing us a song john dessous shouted as we swung round the outskirts of the deserted town what do you want to hear eastil asked i got the impression this was not an unusual request anything dessous looked over at me and tapped the centre of the jeeps bare metal dashboard cant get any sort of sound system in these things he said i just nodded john eastil launched into an enthusiastic no make that just loud rendition of an old song i vaguely recognised but couldnt place until he got to the chorus when i realised it was dixie chicken by little feat dessous tried singing along too but was patently tone deaf we headed along the bottom of a small dry creek towards the jumbled shape of a sprawling stoneandlogbuilt cabin which looked like it owed something to frank lloyd wright probably an apology boy comes here to write dessous shouted at me i see hows he doing oh got some play opening in new york so he says dumbass fool probably financed it himself still wants to make it in hollywood get his name above the titles thats what well youll hear uncle freddy seemed to think dwight had some mad scheme you wanted me to talk him out of i dont want to prejudge anything here miss telman i dont know you dont know which way youll jump i just want you to be honest with the boy he talks about you a lot might listen to you sure as hell doesnt listen to me ill do my best yeah well just give it your best shot we stopped outside eastil stayed with the jeep again while dessous jumped out strode to the door hammered on it once and marched in dwight he hollered as i followed him you decent boy i got a lady here to see you he pulled his cap off and ruffled his hair the cabins shady interior was all long low couches split levels and rugs over naked concrete both underfoot and on the walls from a distant room came a whoop and dessous turned in that direction hold on hold on just backing up we found nephew dwight in a bedroom with a view over the creek the broad bed was covered in sheets of paper on the desk by the window stood an elderly apple mac dwight was standing in front of the machine clicking with the mouse he glanced round yo uncle hi kate how the hell are you dwight was a sharpfeatured awkwardly tall guy only a little more than half my age he was barefoot and wearing jeans and a dressing gown his midlength brown hair was half held in an unravelling ponytail he had a goatee beard and patchy stubble he tapped the keyboard turned the screen off and then came over to me took both my hands in his and kissed me wetly on both cheeks mwah mwah great to see you welcome hello dwight your idea is what we were sitting on a terrace overlooking the dry creek eastil dessous dwight and i drinking beers the stars were starting to come out thick jackets and a warm draught from the opened terrace doors kept us on the warm side of hypothermic its brilliant dwight exclaimed waving his arms about dont you think i resisted the urge to suggest it was he who wasnt thinking and just said run it past me again theres this like thing that looks like a ships funnel or something right in mecca right in the centre where the muslims go on pilgrimage to okay its like the thing theyre going there to see this rock inside this big sort of black shrouded building thing in the centre of this humongous square in mecca the kaaba cool dwight looked delighted you know the name yeah the kaaba man thats it he swigged from his bottle of coors well the idea for the movie is thatoh yeah like hold on this rock thats in the kaaba right its supposed to have fallen from the sky be a gift from god from allah right i mean obviously nowadays everybody knows its a meteorite but its still holy like still venerated okay or they think they know its a meteorite dwight said leaning across the table and nearly putting one elbow in a bowl of dip the idea for the movie is that it isnt a meteorite at all its a fuckin spaceship dwight dessous said sharply aw uncle dwight said with a sort of exasperated laugh its okay kates cool about it sometimes even women cuss these days you know he looked at me and rolled his eyes you can swear in front of women if you want nephew but dont swear in front of women in front of me yeah right dwight said casting his gaze briefly towards the stars again anyway he said and with gratuitous emphasis went on the idea is that the rock inside the kaaba isnt a rock its a lifeboat its an escape pod from an alien spacecraft that blew up above earth fifteen hundred years ago the lifeboat half burned up in the atmosphere so thats why it looks like a rock or maybe its designed to look like a rock right so nobody tries to look inside it i mean maybe all this happened in some sort of like war okay so it had to be disguised right anyway it crashed to the ground in arabia and got taken for this incredibly holy like thing and like maybe it did something you know maybe thats why it was venerated and stuff because it did something that rocks dont usually do that even meteorites dont usually do like float above the ground or dig itself out of the sand or something or zap somebody who was trying to cut into it whatever but it gets taken to mecca and everybody comes to worship it and stuff but he chugged some more frothy beer but being a lifeboat its sent out a distress signal right he laughed obviously greatly taken with his own freewheeling inventiveness and its like taken all this time until now for the distress signal to get back to aliens and them to get here but as our story begins i mean we might have had some sort of pretitles stuff featuring the firefight between the spaceships and the lifeboat streaking down through the atmosphere watched by shepherds tending their flocks by night or whatever anyway as our story begins properly the motherships like here and theres these alien guys inside the escape pod and theyre just starting to wake up he sat back eyes wide with enthusiasm he spread his arms what do you think i mean like thats just the start but what do you think of it so far i stared at dwight jebbet e dessous seemed to be gauging the width of his forehead with his hand eastil was blowing across the neck of his beer bottle producing a low breathy note i cleared my throat do you have any more of the story na dwight waved one hand they have scriptwriters for that sort of stuff its the concept that matters what do you think huh be honest i looked at his eager smiling face for a few moments and then said you want to make a movie in which the holiest shrine of what is arguably the worlds most militant and fundamentalist religion turns out to be an alien artifact dwight said nodding i mean uncle jebs concerned that people might be upset by it but im telling you kate this is a great idea i know people in hollywood whod kill to produce this movie i watched dwight carefully at this point for any sign of irony or even humour not a sausage i looked at mr dessous who was shaking his head dwight i said does the word fatwa mean anything to you dwight started to grin or the name salman rushdie dwight hooted with laughter aw kate come on he was an islamic im not actually i think he was sort of lapsed at the time i said well he came from an islamic family or whatever i mean he was from india or something wasnt he the point is ive got nothing to do with their religion hell im not sure what i am lapsed baptist or something yeah uncle jeb your mother was a baptist i think dessous nodded i have no idea what your father thought he was see dwight said to me as though this explained everything uhhuh i said dwight i think the point is that you might be seen as dissing their faith that might not go down too well regardless of your own belief or lack of it kate dwight said suddenly looking serious im not saying this movie isnt going to be controversial and cutting edge i want this movie to be impactful i want people to onboard this bigtime to sit up and think and overstand you know i want them to think hey what if like our religions dont just come from above at this point dwight mugged staring nervously up at the nearblack sky what if they come from like the stars you know he smiled widely and threw back the last of his beer i took a deep breath well thats not exactly a new idea dwight but if thats what you want to say why notwell do it through a different religion or even invent one invent one dwight said frowning i shrugged it doesnt appear to be that difficult but this idea needs the kaaba thing kate it needs this escape pod dwight if by some miracle you get to make this movie youll be the one who needs an escape pod bullshit kate dwight dessous said tiredly dwight looked genuinely sad i thought you at least would understand im an artist artists have to take risks its my job its my calling i have to be true to myself and my gift true to my ideas or what am i bothering for i mean why are any of us bothering i have a responsibility here kate i must be true to my muse your muse dessous said almost choking yeah dwight said glancing from his uncle to me otherwise im just like a fake and i wont be a fake kate dwight ah theres a movie out at the moment called the siege yeah yeah yeah dwight said smiling tolerantly and patting the air as though pacifying an invisible dog i know completely different sort of movie altogether this movies going to be big budget and ultraspectacular but its going to be like thoughtful the people who made the siege probably thought it was thoughtful too they probably didnt mean to upset the entire arabamerican community and have movie theatres picketed across america well across new york city anyway dwight said shaking his head at my lack of understanding you really on uncle jebs side he asked me disappointed frankly i was hoping you might help me talk him into putting some money into this project this time dessous did choke on his beer i think youd be mad to go ahead with this dwight i told him dwight stared at me aghast then he leant towards me eyes narrowed but you do think its a great idea brilliant its a breathtakingly good idea but if you really want to put it to good use find somebody in the movie industry you hate and would like to see ruined or dead and suggest the idea to them in a way that would let them claim it as their own and watch them pick up the academy award dwight laughed at my naïveté i think not dessous and i exchanged looks dinner an hour later was in jebbet e dessous own home an italianate villa overlooking a broad lake on the outskirts of the deserted town which was just what it appeared to be premier nebraska had been a declining township on the fringe of dessous ranch for years before hed taken over the spread on its other side hed bought the place up lot by lot and gradually moved people out until hed created his own ghost town the main reason hed done this he explained while showing me round the villa before dinner was so that he had the sort of room a man needs when hes using heavy ordnance jebbet e dessous was into weaponry the way uncle freddy was into cars hand guns rifles automatics mortars heavy machineguns tanks rocketlaunchers he had everything including a helicopter gunship stored out at the airfield where id landed and a motor torpedo boat which he kept in a large boathouse on the lakeside most of the heavier stuff like the tanks housed in a warehouse in the town was old second world war vintage or not much later he grumbled about the governments reluctance to sell taxpaying citizens main battle tanks and antiaircraft missiles dwight and i followed him round the stables attached to the main villa this was where dessous kept his collection of howitzers and field pieces some dating back to the civil war see this he patted what looked like a load of long open pipes mounted on a trailer stalins organ pipes they used to call these the wehrmacht were terrified of them so were the red army used to fall short too often you cant get the rockets any more but im having a bunch of them made he slapped one of the dark green metal tubes with his giant hand again make a hell of a noise apparently looking forward to letting these suckers off let me tell you whats the biggest missile youve got jeb i asked as innocently as i could thinking of the scuds he was supposed to have bought he grinned he was dressed in a white tuxedo now dwight had thrown on a jacket too but dessous still looked like a bucolic farmer dressed up and in town for a dance ahhah was all he would say he winked goddammit telman i thought you of all people would agree with that so i was telman now i had kind of thought that when mr dessous had said hed call me miss telman until he knew me better he meant that in the fullness of time he might get round to calling me kathryn or kate apparently not or maybe that would come later the point at issue was how easy it was to bootstrap yourself out of poverty why jeb because you came up out the slums didnt you well if not slums certainly a degree of deprivation but you did it thats my point youre here here was the dining room of the villa which was fairly big and untidily sumptuous as well as myself dwight eastil and dessous there was mrs dessous who was a stunning los angelino redhead about dwights age sheathed in silver and called marriette there were a dozen other people on dessous immediate staff and a similar number of technicians and engineers to whom id been introduced en masse the long table was stratified with dessous at the head dispensing pétrus and the junior technicians somewhere at the far end swigging beer the food had been mexican served by small and wondrously deft and inconspicuous mexican men i wondered if dessous themed all his meals so that if wed eaten chinese wed have been surrounded by pigtailed chinamen while an italian dinner would have been served by dark slimhipped young men called luigi the main course had been some very fine lean flag steak from one of dessous own herds though id had to leave most of mine because there was just too much of it i was extraordinarily lucky jeb i said mrs telmans car blew a tyre near where i was playing with my pals if it hadnt been for that piece of luck id probably still be in the west of scotland im thirtyeight by now id have had three or four kids knocked out of me id weigh another twenty or thirty pounds id look ten years older id smoke forty a day and eat too much chocolate and deepfried food if i was lucky id have a man who didnt hit me and kids who werent doing drugs maybe id have a few highschool qualifications maybe not theres an outside chance id have gone to university in which case it might all have been different i might be a teacher or a social worker or a civil servant all of which would be socially useful but wouldnt let me live the sort of life ive come to appreciate but its all based on luck no you dont know youre just making assumptions dessous insisted thats the brit in you coming out there this selfdeprecating stuff i knew liz telman she told me when she found you you were selling candy at fifty per cent markup you trying to tell me you wouldnt have learned something from that perhaps id have learned how easy it was to rip people off and decided never to do it again maybe id have ended up working in a citizens advice bureau or this is perversity telman the obvious lesson to draw is how easy it is to make money how easy it is to use initiative and enterprise to pull yourself out of the environment you find yourself in youd have done it anyway with or without liz telman and thats precisely my point dammit the people who deserve to will get out of their deprivation theyll rise above any goddamn social disadvantagement whether its in scotland honduras los angeles or anywhere else but its not the people who deserve to i said how can you condemn the vast majority who dont get out of the slums or the schemes or the barrios or the projects arent they going to be the ones who put family friends and neighbours first the ones who support each other the ones who rise are more likely to be the ones who are the most selfish the most ruthless the ones who exploit those around them exactly dessous said entrepreneurs or drugdealers as we call them these days thats evolution too the smart ones sell the dumb ones use its vicious but thats the state and its dumb laws what are we really saying here jeb societies are made up of a mix of people obviously there will always be people who basically accept their lot and those wholl do anything to improve it so youve got a spectrum of behaviour with total compliance at one end people who just want a quiet life who really only want to be left alone to raise their families talk about the ball game think about their next holiday and maybe dream about winning the lottery and dissidence at the other within the dissidents some people will still identify strongly with their friends and family and struggle to improve the lives of all of them some will only be out for themselves and theyll do anything to achieve material success including lying stealing and killing what im questioning is who amongst this lot could be termed better than the others basically what youre saying is the scum rises and im saying the cream rises now you tell me whos got the more optimistic vision here and whos being defeatist me and you mr dessous in that order dessous sat back youre going to have to explain that to me telman well scum and cream both rise i guess depending on the context actually i dont think either analogy is particularly helpful the comparison you choose to make shows which way youve already decided however what im saying is more optimistic because it supposes a way forward for everybody in a society not just its most viciously competitive percentile youre being defeatist because youre just giving up on nine people out of ten in a poor society and saying theres no helping them and that the only way they can help themselves is individually by climbing out on top of those around them thats evolution telman people get hurt people strive people succeed some strive and dont make it and some succeed without striving but theyre the exceptions and if you dont at least make the attempt then you dont deserve to succeed youve got to have struggle youve got to have competition youve got to have winners and losers you cant just even everybody out thats what the communists thought you could do and look what happened to them you can have fairness dessous roared with laughter telman i cant believe im having to tell you this but life isnt fair no the world isnt fair the universe isnt fair physics chemistry and mathematics they arent fair or unfair for that matter fairness is an idea and only conscious creatures have ideas thats us we have ideas about right and wrong we invent the idea of justice so that we can judge whether something is good or bad we develop morality we create rules to live by and call them laws all to make life more fair of course it depends exactly who draws up the laws who those laws are most fair to but selfishness is what drives people on telman not fairness and you accuse me of being pessimistic jeb i said it with a smile im being realistic i think i said that a lot of successful people are actually less hardhearted than they like to think they know in their hearts that people suffer terribly in poor societies through no fault of their own the successful people dont want to admit that to themselves they dont want to accept that really theyre just the same as those poor people and they certainly dont want to face the horror of even suspecting that if they had been born into those societies they might have been stuck there and suffered and died young and unknown after a miserable life any more than they want to face the alternative of knowing that they could only have got out by being more competitively brutal than everybody else around them so to save their consciences they decide that the people in the slums are there because they somehow deserve to be and if they just tried hard enough they could get out its nonsense but it makes psychological sense and it makes them feel better you accusing me of selfdeception telman dessous said looking surprised but not angry i hoped i was getting the correct impression here that he was enjoying all this i dont know jeb im still not sure what you really think maybe you secretly agree with me but you just like an argument dessous laughed he slapped the table and looked round the others a few of the people nearest us had been following the argument down in their own relatively impoverished area at the end of the table where the beer was nobody was taking a blind bit of notice too busy having a good time in the lounge after dinner fuelled by fine wine and brandy dessous talked with some of the technicians whod been at the other end of the table he came back to where i was sitting with dwight and eastil rubbing his hands and positively glowing mechanisms ready he announced screens up ready for some target practice betcha eastil said and knocked back his drink ive got to see this dwight agreed kateyou ought to come ought i yeeha said dessous turning and marching off yeeha i said to dwight who just shrugged about a dozen of us drove to the drivein movie theatre in three sport utes the sky was clear and dessous shucking off his dj and pulling on a quilted jacket ordered the other two drivers to leave their lights off he drove in front tearing along the road to town using only the moonlight and starlight startling jack rabbits and discussing over the radio which way the wind was blowing we pulled up by the dark bulk of the projection building while dessous was cursing everybody for forgetting to bring a flashlight i pulled one from my pocket and clicked it on well done telman dessous said you always so well prepared well i usually carry a torch dessous smiled ive got friends whod tell you that aint a torch telman thats a flashlight a torch is what you burn niggers with would they and are they really racist scumbags or do they just enjoy trying to shock people dessous laughed and unlocked the door the lights flickered on in the projection building bright after the blackedout journey in the fourwheel drives people flicked more switches starting fans and heaters and powering up the two big mm projectors which were aimed out through small windows at the distant screen which was now in place i didnt notice anything odd at first the place was all very techy in an oldfashioned sort of way with exposed cables and ductwork and racks of film canisters against the walls and whole boards of clunkylooking industrial switches and fuses the size of your hand at each of the two big projectors two guys were loading film into the complicated pathways of rollers and guides then i saw what stood in between the projectors i stared what the fff oerlikon twentymillimetre cannon telman dessous said proudly single mount isnt it a beauty dwight standing on my other side and holding a halffull glass of wine just chuckled where a third projector might have stood there was indeed a very heavy machinegun it stood on a fluted mount bolted to the concrete floor it had two padded brackets at the rear where it looked like you were supposed to rest your shoulders and a big almost circular drum of ammunition on the top its charcoalcoloured metal gleamed in the overhead lights the long barrel disappeared out of a small window into the night facing the huge screen in the distance the righthand projector whined up to speed somebody handed out bottles of beer somebody else dispensed earprotectors the first reel was a second world war dogfight it was black and white and looked like real cameragun footage dessous took his place at the cannon and after a deep breath started firing even with the earprotectors on and the muzzle of the gun outside the building the noise was pretty intense i could see dessous grinning like a loon and mouthing what i suspected were more yeehas but his voice was entirely lost in the racket a duct above the cannons chattering mechanism sucked most of the smoke away but the projection room soon stank of cordite and a thin grey mist filled the air a big limp sack hanging on the other side of the gun from the magazine shook and pulsed as though there were a bunch of scared kittens inside it people were crowded round the remaining small windows facing out to the screen i squeezed in beside dwight who put his arm round my waist he bent his head to mine and shouted is this fucking crazy or what to my left the surface of the projection booth was lit by the stuttering muzzle flash of the cannon across the gulf of darkness above the abandoned parking lot the lines of tracer flicked disappearing into the black and white skies of wartime europe where mustangs and messerschmitts dived and rolled and formations of flying fortresses laboured onwards through the clouds smoke drifting from the cannon in the near still air picked out the projectors beam then the gun fell silent there was a moment of quietness then people cheered and clapped and whistled dessous radiant stepped down from the cannon rubbing his shoulders his face slick with sweat he accepted congratulations and shook eastil and a few of the technicians by the hand his wife silvery sheath of dress topped by a quilted jacket went up on tippytoes to kiss him eastil was next at the cannon once it had been reloaded the sack full of spent cartridge cases had been emptied and another reel of film spun up to speed in the other projector we appeared to be progressing historically this was korean war footage of migs and sabres the cannon went crackcrackcrack fast as a speeding heart i watched the screen there were a few small tattered holes starting to appear youre our latest guest telman dessous said when eastil had had his turn care for a shot i looked at him i wasnt sure whether i was expected to say yes or not thats very kind i said i watched another reel of film being loaded into the first projector i imagine were up to vietnam by now dessous shook his big head not much dogfighting there weve gone straight to yom kippur i had a very brief lesson in how to shoot the gun this basically consisted of hold on dont close your eyes and press this trigger here hard the cannon had a fairly crude sight which looked like the wire frame taken off a dartboard and shrunk to about the width of a hand the gun smelled of oil and smoke it gave off heat like a radiator i settled into the padded shoulder rests and for some reason couldnt help thinking of the stirrups in a gynaecologists my mouth i have to say was quite dry the image across the drivein lot flashed with those reversesweeping clock roundels in between counting down then we were in full colour above the sands of the sinai peninsula and the skies were full of migs i squinted through the sights and pulled on the trigger the cannon shuddered and kicked back at me nearly tearing my fingers away from the trigger tracer bullets lanced towards the screen and disappeared into the darkness beyond i tried aiming at the aircraft swirling in front of me but it was hard as long as i kept the bullets going through the screen and not into the framework holding it up i thought id be doing fine the gun clattered to a stop at first i thought it must have jammed then i realised that id used up all the shells i staggered as i stepped down my ears ringing my arms tingling my shoulders aching and my whole body seeming to buzz dessous grabbed me briefly by one elbow whoa you all right there telman im fine i laughed some kick yup the screen was starting to look a little frayed in the centre when we had our finale another three people had taken turns at the gun both dwight and mrs dessous had declined dessous took his place again the projector powered up and before the gun started firing i could hear a mixture of cheers and boos from the people clustered round the windows the unmistakable image of saddam husseins face appeared on the screen monolithically lugubrious fixed and still the gun launched mm cannon shells at it the rest of the short reel was hussein in various settings sitting talking to his military commanders walking past crowds of cheering people inspecting troops and so on then it went back to the still of his face looming a hundred feet high above the deserted lot dessous fired into the eyes until the silvery material of the screen there started to fall away and flap and tumble dark silver dark silver towards the ground holes appeared in the vast nose the deep brush of moustache and across the broad expanse of forehead finally peppering the line between dress shirt and adams apple dessous must have hit some part of the framework around the screens lower edge because sparks burst out and two of the tracer rounds suddenly ricocheted upwards into the night in a bright red v the cannon fell silent again as flames started to lick up around the giant face still displayed on the screen while flaps and scraps of screen folded and fell or were caught in up draughts and floated skywards more cheering and whooping and laughter dessous looked like a child locked in a candy store he nodded and wiped his brow and took a lot of pats on the back and handshakes and just appeared utterly pleased with himself across the lot flames licked up around the huge frayed unsteady image back in the villa long past midnight we sat in dessous den just the man himself and me the walls were covered in swords handguns and rifles all polished and gleaming and resting in little chrome cradles the place smelled of gun oil and cigar smoke dessous drew on his cigar levered himself back in his giant leather seat with a creak and thumped his shoes on to his broad desk you ever think of yourself as a socialist telman you sure sound like one briefly at university do i really i tried the cup of coffee which was all id felt like still too hot yup you know how much youre worth roughly guess you can afford to be a socialist i guess i can dessous rolled the fat cigar round his mouth a couple of times not taking his eyes off me you believe in communities dont you telman i suppose so were all part of communities all part of society yes are we your community the business i asked he nodded yes youre committed to us i think ive shown that over the years just because of mrs telman not just thats the sentimental reason if you like i have others such as i admire what the business stands for its what do you think it stands for he said quickly i took a deep breath reason i said rationality progress respect for science belief in technology belief in people in their intelligence in the end rather than faith in a god or a messiah or a monarch or a flag hmm right okay sorry telman i interrupted you there you were saying i admire its success its longevity im proud to be part of that even though were vicious capitalist oppressors i laughed well were capitalists sure but i wouldnt put it any stronger than that theres a lot of the youngsters level six through four whod think what you were saying earlier about initiative and drive and success and so on was something close to heresy something close to treason but we arent a religion or a state yet so it cant be either can it dessous studied the end of his cigar how proud are you to be part of the business telman im proud i dont know of any internationally accepted scientific unit of measurement of pride you put our collective good above your own interests i tried my coffee again still too hot are you asking me to surrender some of my stock options jeb he chuckled nope im just trying to find out what the business means to you its a collection of people some i like some i dont as an institution like i said im proud to be a part of it would you do anything for it of course not would you no so i guess were all in it for ourselves arent we yes but we rely on the support and cooperation of everybody else to help us achieve our individual goals thats what communities are all about dont you think so what wouldnt you do for the business oh you know the usual stuff murder torture maiming that sort of thing dessous nodded i guess that kind of goes without saying what about this idea of selfsacrifice what would you sacrifice something of your own for if not for the business i dont know other people maybe it all depends on the circumstances dessous grimaced and stared at the ceiling looking suddenly bored with the whole conversation yeah i guess it always does doesnt it i woke up very dark where the hell was i the air outside the bed was chilly the bed itself feltunfamiliar i heard a chinking noise like something hitting a window i sniffed the air suddenly afraid not in my house not in london not inglasgow or blysecragdessous place big bend i was in nebraska the cabin on the ridge the noise came again i felt for the light switch and touched the little netsuke monkey the light was very bright i stared at the curtains over the windows i felt groggy and my head hurt not badly but enough to let me know id drunk too much the noise at the window came again i looked at the telephone on the other bedside table kate said a muffled voice i fastened the top button on my pjs top and went to the window and drew the drapes dwights pale face stared back at me i opened the window cold air spilled in dwight what are you doing he was wearing a thick jacket but he looked cold can i come in no but its cold out here so you shouldnt have left your cabin i wanted to talk to you havent you got a phone no thats why that cabins so great no phone you can write what you mean a letter i asked confused now he looked bewildered no i mean write treatments and shit without distraction oh and what about your mobile i leave it switched off butnever mind please let me in no what did you want to talk about i cant talk out here its freezing im freezing too so keep it brief aw kate dwight ive had your uncle beating my ears all evening if you have anything to say id really appreciate you saying it as concisely as possible so i can get back to sleep im very tired he looked pained i was going to ask youif you wanted to come to the première of my play on broadway he said he scratched his head your play yeah he said grinning finally got my name above the title on something its called best shot its brilliant youd love it when is it next monday ill try you will you promise no i cant promise but ill try right he hesitated i shivered dwight is that it uh yeah i guess i shook my head right good night umm okay he said he started to turn away i started to close the window he turned back hey ah kate what do you ahdo you like want we should maybe like you know spend the night together maybe i stared at him i thought of lots of things to say but eventually i just said no dwight but kate jeez wed be great together no we wouldnt we would im just so admirative of you dwight thats not a word or if it is it shouldnt be but kate i just find you so attractive and i mean i never go for women your age good night dwight dont reject me kate let me in im not going to be heavy im not going to aggress on you or anything no now go home but no his shoulders slumped within the big jacket his breath smoked down he raised his head again youll still come to the play if i can aw come on promise i cant now go home my feet are turning blue i could warm them up for you thanks but no but you will try and come yes youre not just saying that to get rid of me no as my guest as my date only if you cant find somebody your own age now good night excellent he turned to go switching on a flashlight i started to close the window again he turned back again you really think my idea about the escape pod inside the kaaba is that bad not bad just potentially fatal he shook his head as he turned away into the night shit my feet really were cold so were my hands i drew six inches of warm water in the bath and sat on the rim with my pj cuffs rolled up soaking my feet and hands to bring some blood back into them i dried them and returned to bed and slept like a very tired log chapter six it snowed later on during the night and when i opened the curtains the next morning it was still snowing turning the countryside softer brighter and silently beautiful i watched it snow for a while then showered and dressed the cabins phone rang while i was drying my hair telman jeb good morning you want breakfast yes please okay dishing up in twenty minutes this is at your place yes yup the villa right how will i get there should be a truck in the garage ah there was a big chevy blazer i climbed in it fired first time and rolled out into the snow the garage door swung down automatically behind me there was sat nav cb radio and a phone but i vaguely remembered the way and only took a couple of wrong turnings we were still in a mexican groove foodwise i sat in the big bustling kitchen of the villa with everybody else and tucked into my huevos rancheros while dwight sitting next to me boasted loudly about all the famous people hed met in hollywood enthused about his broadway play and just generally acted like somebody shooting for mostfavoured nephew status you ski telman dessous shouted from the head of the table a little i said heading for the slopes in about an hour if the weather clears like its meant to like you to come happy to i said feeling myself slipping into the way of dessous clipped syntax mind if i tag along dwight asked with a grin wouldnt want to cut into your muse time there nephew thats all right i could use a break actually son i was being polite theres only room for one more in the choppers and telmans just taken that seat oh dwight looked crestfallen still up for it telman yup the weather cleared from the west two dozen of us flew from the big bend airstrip in a british aerospace into a vast blue space divided perfectly into blue sky and white earth we landed at sheridan just east of the big horn mountains two bell s were waiting on the tarmac we loaded our skis into pods attached to the legs and were lifted to pristine snowfields lying beneath the high peaks the bells dropped us in the middle of their own little snow blizzard their skis suspended just a foot above the surface while we jumped out and unloaded ours then they lifted away again and clattered down the valley dessous got me to help him with a recalcitrant binding while everybody else swept off down the heft of icingsugar white in a blur of multicoloured shapes when we were alone i said theres nothing wrong with this binding is there nope dessous said he looked around our companions had disappeared into the broad valley beneath the only moving things we could see were the fastreceding black dots of the helicopters already too far away to hear you want to sit down we sat down in the snow our skis planted curved tips like plastic talons scratching at the blue dessous pulled out a leather cigar case smoke i shook my head only after a drink but dont let me stop you well i got a hip flask too but thats normally only for medical emergencies i quite agree he prepared and lit a long cigar with some care then said how you think youre doing telman i dont know whats the context well impressing me i guess then ive really no idea why dont you tell me because i want to know how you think youre doing dammit all right i think you think im an opinionated socialist feminist whos half american half european combines what you would regard as the worst aspects of both mentalities has lucked out with some offthewall predictions and doesnt really respect the traditions of the business the way i ought dessous laughed and coughed too hard on yourself telman good i was hoping so this made him chuckle a little too so what is all this about jeb not me whos going to tell you sorry then who maybe nobody telman maybe tommy cholongai know him another level one a chinesemalay shippingline owner i said weve met tommy and i have an agreement given there aint much we ever agree on this is something of an event in itself involves you telman if we both agree then what he blew out a cloud of bluegrey smoke then we might ask you to do something which would be cant tell you yet why not cant tell you that either i sat and looked at him he was staring up at the tall summit of the highest mountain cloud peak hed said it was called on the way up thirteen thousand feet tallest of the big horn range custers last stand had taken place a hundred klicks due north in montana you know i said all the secrecy surrounding this thing you cant tell me about might put me off whatever it is in the first place if i ever do get to find out what the hell it is yup know that all the same he looked at me and grinned i hadnt really inspected his teeth before they were uneven yellowwhite and so probably his own actually telman id tell you now and get it over with but tommy wouldnt appreciate that and an agreement is an agreement so now i have to go see mr cholongai would that be right fraid so i crossed my arms and looked around for a while i was waiting for the cold to seep through my glossy red skisuit and make my backside numb jeb i said im junior to both you guys but i am on sabbatical and anyway i thought id worked my way up in the company sufficiently not to getpassed around like this better passed around than passed over dessous chuckled better looked over than overlooked i quoted mae west i believe i added when he cocked an eye at me finelooking woman just so we skied down to meet the others were taken back up to more virgin powder and repeated the process if not the conversation soon it was time for lunch which we took in a vietnamese restaurant in sheridan dessous regaled us with his plans to develop the drivein movie theatreshooting gallery which meant having a whole sequence of stacked screens ready to be dropped into place or even a sort of roller system like a giant scroll once youd shot the blue blazes out of one bit youd just haul it up or drop it down until you had a fresh area the conversation became even more ridiculous when dessous talked about another project hed been taken with the sort of wheeze megalomaniac dictators were so fond of involving a stadium full of compliant welldrilled subjects and lots of big coloured boards the idea was to use the big coloured boards to display what looked like a picture of something when seen from far enough away the other side of the stadium usually id seen tv pictures of this sort of thing as far as i could see the standard image was a portrait of whatever powermad shitforbrains was in control at the time dessous thought this would be a fun thing to do but he wanted to take it a step further and have moving images displayed the head technical guys whod come skiing started to get excited discussing how this could be done the consensus seemed to be that youd need a third world country to get the requisite numbers of people and that maybe it would be best just to hire an army division or so big cubes of expanded polystyrene with six different colours or hues on them just big enough to twirl round without interfering with a neighbours would give you some degree of flexibility though itd be hard to get any control of saturation unless you could light them from inside which would make them kinda heavy the control system would be a bitch youd have to treat every goddamn person as a single pixel and theyd never be able to memorise more than a few changes some sort of individual signalling apparatus would be required serious programming of some sort i suggested they might call it a lumpen crowd display or possibly large ego display lcd or led this they thought a hoot and only encouraged them what would be their refreshment rate could you use all rasterfarians hey what if they all wanted a screen dump while the technical guys got on with this dessous was chairing another discussion group which was trying to work out what images you could show on this widest of wide screens great sporting moments seemed to feature strongly i slipped away stayed longer in the toilets than i really needed to then stepped into the street outside where no one from the party could see me and checked my phones signal strength hi kate how are you oh sorry stephen ii didnt mean to call you i lied wrong button thats okay you all right yeah yeah you fine okay then sorry no problem where are you anyway place called sheridan wyoming i think you skiing with dessous yup howd you know ah just masculine intuition ive been there myself where are you now ah still in dcand it looks like ive got where im supposed to be i heard the noise of traffic behind his voice as he said yeah okay to somebody else then ive got to go to me you take care now okay okay dont break anything yeah you too i said only my heart i thought the following day i took the same huey back to omaha those big olivegreen headphones again for someone who tried to avoid helicopters i seemed to be spending a lot of time on the damn things then a united to lax stodgy muffin steward with neat butt brief snooze and a braniff to san francisco mercifully quiet but overflowingly obese woman in seat alongside smelled strongly of french fries a hired car took me home to woodside the place was warmer than nebraska but the house felt cold i watered my longsuffering cactuses and made a few calls i met with some old friends in quadrus a menlo park restaurant popular with some of the parc guys i ate too much drank too much and smoked too much and babbled happily about nothing of consequence at all i invited pete wells back to my place hes a research analyst and an old pallover still a goodtime guy and up for the occasional friendly fuck though he is engaged to some lucky lass in marin and so not for much longer we made hazy stoned welltempered love to glen gould playing j s bach listening to the man humming and singing along i slept well apart from a weird dream about mike daniels searching my garden for his missing teeth the next morning with pete already gone and me both a little bleary and not particularly well rested i repacked my bags with dkny mostly and took the buick back to meet its buddies at san francisco internationals alamo then it was a jal to tokyo via hawaii twenty minutes late leaving due to two tardy suits i joined in the mean group stare when they finally stumbled into first trying not to look sheepish and studiously avoiding everybodys eyes sushi very good played both garbage albums separated by madonnas ray of light slept well cathay pacific airbus from tokyo to karachi shown how to play with game console in seat by japanese kid very good sleep later worry that i may be turning into woman in a song i heard once who only slept on planes bumpy landing i had a feeling that whatever passport i chose for karachi it would be the wrong one but i decided on the british one and was pleasantly surprised whisked through the place was packed the air was thick with a medley of smells the humidity was stifling and the lighting in the arrivals hall was terrible over the crowds i spotted a board being held up with a rough approximation of my name on it i hadnt been able to find a trolley so i held my suit carrier out in front of me and used it to work open a path in the right direction mrs telman said the young pakistani man holding the sign up i am mo meridalawah very pleased to meet you its ms telman but thank you how do you do very well thank you let me he took my bags off me follow me please this way out of the way there coarse fellow no really he did hiltonised overnight and restless i got up kicked the previous days newspapers out of the way booted the thinkpad and spent some time on a few techyoriented news groups before going back to more disturbed sleep mo meridalawah reappeared midmorning and drove me back to the airport through some of the most chaotic traffic i had ever seen it had been just as bad the evening before but i had assumed then it was rushhour there was no such excuse now and it was even more terrifying in daylight unbelievable numbers of bicycles trucks belching black diesel fumes garish buses motorised trikes and cars driven seemingly at random in any direction as long as it was either directly across our path or on a collision course mo meridalawah waved his hands about and chattered ceaselessly about his family cricket and the incompetence of his fellow road users karachi airport was almost a relief yet another helicopter one of those ancient tall sikorskys with the engine in the bulbous nose and the flight deck up a ladder the cabin was actually quite comfortably kitted out but it all looked worryingly oldfashioned and well worn mo meridalawah waved goodbye from the tarmac with a white handkerchief as though he for one never expected to see me again we chopped out over the city across dense green mangrove swamps along the coast and then across the lines of surf and out over the arabian sea the lorenzo uffizi had been a cruise ship for nearly thirty years before that it had been one of the last transatlantic liners now it was out of date its powerful but old engines were hopelessly inefficient and the vessel as a whole was just too old to refit again economically it was only worth scrapping and it was to complete that process that it had come here from the yard in genoa where its more valuable and salvageable fittings had been removed sonmiani bay is where a lot of the worlds ships end up the broad beach slopes smoothly into the sea so that the vessels can be aimed at the sands put to full speed ahead and then just run aground on the vast beach theres plenty of room for whole fleets of obsolete ships and in the countryside around there are hordes of impoverished people willing to work for a pittance cutting the ships up with torches attaching chains and hawsers to sections of hull and then if theyre quick enough getting out the way in time when the giant winches further up the shore haul the pieces of ship off more cutting more dragging by winches then the bits are craned on to rail flatcars and hauled to a quay side thirty miles away where the scrap is loaded aboard ships bound for anyone of a dozen steel mills throughout the world i had heard of sonmiani bay i had read about it in a magazine twenty years earlier and just a couple of years ago id seen some tv footage but id never been there now i was going to get to see it first hand and id be arriving by ship tommy cholongai was a level one exec who could fairly be described as a shipping magnate the first time id used this phrase in front of luce shed asked did that make him anything like a fridge magnate normally id have said something but as i recall id just asked her if she was still looking for mr cannon and so my lips were tied today id been told mr cholongai was going to fulfil a lifelong ambition by being at the controls when the lorenzo uffizi hit the beach at full speed the lorenzo uffizi was still an impressive sight it was about fifty klicks offshore lying still in the water a few hundred metres from the comparatively toylike shape of mr cholongais own motor yacht we circled the liner level with its two tall funnels the ship was creamy white streaked here and there with rust the funnels were blue and red and the stern funnel was the source of a thin streamer of grey smoke windows glittered with reflected sunlight empty lifeboat derricks stood like lampposts along the boat deck there was just one lifeboat left on each side up near the bridge and its two drained swimmingpools gaped pale blue beneath the dazzling cloudless sky ballardesque the sikorsky landed on the broad curve of a stern tier still marked out for deck games one of cholongais assistants a small thai called pran whom i vaguely knew from a company conference a few years earlier slid the helicopters door open for me and mouthed a welcome over the scream of the engine i have wanted to do this for years tommy cholongai said captain with your permission certainly mr cholongai cholongai took hold of the brass handle and with a big grin on his face moved the bridge telegraph indicator all the way down to the full ahead position the telegraph made the appropriate ringing chiming noises he brought it back to all stop to the sound of more bells and then set it back to full ahead again and left it there the rest of us including the lorenzo uffizis captain and first officer and the local pilot as well as cholongais personal staff looked on a couple of cholongais pas started clapping enthusiastically but he smiled modestly and waved them to be silent beneath our feet the ship began to shudder as the engines spun up to speed mr cholongai stepped to the ships wheel followed by the rest of us the wheel was a good metre across each handle tipped with brass when the ship had some way on her moving steadily across the gentle swell and still slowly gathering speed cholongai asked the pilot for the heading and then spun the wheel watching the compass display in its overhead binnacle the ships course curved gradually her bows turning to face the sands of sonmiani bay still out of sight over the horizon at nearly thirty knots our arrival ought to coincide with high tide satisfied that we were pointing in the right direction with approving nods from our captain and pilot mr cholongai relinquished control of the wheel to a small smiling chinese seaman who didnt look remotely big enough to handle it you take good care now mr cholongai said to the seaman patting him on the back and grinning broadly the little chinese guy nodded enthusiastically ill be back in an hour yes more nodding and smiling he turned scanning the faces gathered round him until he saw me ms telman he said and indicated the way off the bridge we sat on the sun deck just beneath the windows of the bridge shielded from the ships selfmade wind by tall sloped panes of glass all streaked by dried salt and spattered here and there by birdshit above us a parasol provided shade its edges rippling in the breeze the two of us sat on cheap plastic seats around a white plastic table a whitecoated malay steward delivered iced coffee the air felt thick and hot and the faint breeze curling over the glass barrier didnt seem cooling at all id dressed in a light shotsilk suit the coolest outfit i had with me but i could feel sweat trickling down between my shoulderblades my friend jeb tells me you are concerned ms telman cholongai said he sipped his iced coffee he was a denselooking man of average height and bulky but smoothskinned with spiky grey hair hed put on sunglasses when wed come outside with so much sunlight and white paintwork around it was very bright even within the parasols shade and i was glad id remembered my own raybans i seem to be i looked round at the paintworks glare getting kept in the dark mr cholongai i smiled i tried the iced coffee very cold very strong i shivered the sensation of cold and the white blaze of light suddenly taking me back to the snowfields of wyoming he nodded this is true one cannot tell everybody everything well that was suitably gnomic of course i said cholongai was quiet for a moment he sipped at his coffee i resisted the urge to fill the silence your family he said eventually do you still see them very often i blinked behind the shades i suppose i have two families i said truly you are blessed cholongai said without any obvious irony im afraid i dont see either often i was an only child my mother was a single parent she was also an only child and she died some time ago i met my father just once mrs telman was like a mother to memore like an aunt perhaps i only met her husband once on the day of the court hearing when she they adopted me i was not of course telling cholongai anything he couldnt find out from my personnel file i didnt doubt that some underling had already briefed him on all this that is very sad yes but ive been very lucky in your career do you mean well that as well but i meant that i was loved i see by your mother you mean yes a mother should love her child of course but i was still lucky she made me feel loved and made me feel special and she protected me there were many men in her life and some of them were violent sometimes but none of them ever touched me and she did her best to hide from me what they did to her so though we were poor and things could certainly have been easier i had a better start in life than some then you met mrs telman i nodded then mrs telman came along and that was the single luckiest thing that ever happened to me i knew mrs telman she was a good woman it was sad she could have no children of her own do you have a family yourself mr cholongai one wife five children two grandchildren third grandchild on way mr cholongai said with a big smile then you are blessed indeed he sipped his iced coffee there was an expression on what i could see of his face that might have meant the coffee was giving him a toothache might i touch on a personal matter ms telman i suppose so he nodded for a while then said you have never thought of having children of your own of course ive thought of it mr cholongai and you decided not to so far im thirtyeight so im not in my prime for childbearing but im fit and healthy and i reckon i could still change my mind in fact i knew i was fertile id gone to a clinic when i was thirtyfive just out of curiosity and been again a few months ago and gotten a clean bill of reproductive health both times nothing wrong with my eggs or any part of the system which made not having children my choice rather than an imposition cholongai nodded ahhah this is awkward i know but may i ask was it simply that the right man did not come along i tasted my iced coffee glad to remain inscrutable behind my glasses that depends what you mean you will have to explain please it depends on how you define the right man the right man did come along as far as i was concerned from a purely selfish point of view but he turned out to be married so not the right man after all i see i am sorry i shrugged one of those things mr cholongai i dont cry myself to sleep every night he nodded you are not perhaps a very selfish person you give a lot of money to deserving causes i think this is the sort of thing you have to live with in the business that old financial transparency means theres no feeling quietly superior to somebody about things like this if they have the slightest interest in your private affairs theyll already know exactly what causes you feel most strongly about or what system of checks and balances youve put in place to square your conscience with your functional life actually i said im very selfish i only give to charities so that i can sleep easily at night in my case the proportion of my disposable income i find i need to jettison is about ten percent a tithe more coffee its the closest i come to religious observance cholongai smiled it is good to give to charity as you say all benefit some think otherwise i was thinking of a few mostly usbased execs id met who had nothing but contempt for anybody who gave any money to any cause with the possible exception of the national rifle association perhaps they have their ownindulgences perhaps mr cholongai please call me tommy all right tommy if i may call you kathryn id be honoured but id like to know tommy what all this has to do with anything he shifted in his seat he took his sunglasses off briefly rubbing one knuckle into the corner of one eye can we talk in confidence kathryn i assumed we already were but yes of course it has to do with thulahn thulahn that threw me yes we would like to ask you to change tracks what maybe hed meant change tack but it worked either way how do you mean in your career i felt a coldness sweep over me as though id drenched myself in iced coffee i thought what have i done what can they do to me i collected myself and said i thought my career was going just fine it is that is why it is difficult for us to ask this of you my initial panic had subsided but i was still not at all sure i liked the sound of this my heart was racing it suddenly struck me that a light silk blouse and unlined jacket were bad things to wear when your heart was thudding people could probably see the fabric quivering maybe women and fat men suffered more this way some sort of resonant frequency setup magnifying the effect in your breasts breeze i thought theres a breeze should cover any signs calm down girl i cleared my throat what exactly are you asking me to do tommy to become in a sense our ambassador to thulahn ambassador it is more than that more than that how could it be more than that at first we would ask you to go there to report to look at the place and try to work out where it might be heading to spot trends in other words social trends if you like in the same sort of way that you seem to be able to spot trends in technology at the moment do you see the connection i think so but why because we are entering a unique situation in thulahn by adopting it as our base we will be exposing ourselves in a way we have not done before we will be making ourselves vulnerable in a manner we have not been since the fifteenth century this was a switzerland reference of course the late fourteen hundreds was when the place became effectively independent and the business always attracted to havens of stability no matter how relative had started to put down roots there cholongais chronology ignored a dodgy moment in when the armies of revolutionary france invaded but never mind dont we have people to do that sort of thing i asked surely either we did or we could employ the best this was the sort of thing you could just throw money university professors and battalions of postgrads at sociologists loved places like thulahn not at the appropriate level kathryn we need someone whom we can trust that of course means someone in the business whom we know to be profoundly committed to it there are probably hundreds of people at the right level using that criterion alone but we also need someone who can see things from a perspective outside the company someone who will feel sympathetic towards the people of thulahn someone who will be able to empathise with them and advise us how best to incorporate their needs and wishes with those of the company itself cholongai sat forward clasping his hands on the surface of the white plastic table beneath our feet the deck buzzed and around us the plates and glass of the superstructure vibrated as the ship powered onwards heading for the shore thulahn is not fenua ua cholongai said there are nearly a million thulahnese we cannot evacuate them all or provide all of them with apartments in miami they seem a docile people and devoted to their royal family but if we are to make the sort of commitment to their country that we are anticipating making then we need to be able to predict how they will feel in the future and move to accommodate those feelings such as what if they decide they would like democracy that sort of thing so id be spying on them no no cholongai laughed lightly no more than you already spy on those companies we consider investing in what you would do would benefit the people of thulahn as much as ourselves perhaps more and only i can do this i tried to sound sceptical it wasnt difficult we think you would be the best person to do so what would it involve it would mean that you would have to relocate to thulahn it might be possible also to continue performing your present function for a while but i would think that before too long it would become impossible to carry out both tasks satisfactorily you mean id have to live in thulahn cholongai nodded indeed thulahn memories of my few days there came tumbling back thulahn or at least thuhn the capital because i hadnt really been anywhere else mountains lots of mountains and rain mountains that when you could see them through the clouds made you crane your neck to see their snowy summits even when you were already a mile or two high almost nothing level that fucking football pitch that doubled as a landing strip lots of smoke the smell of burning dung tiny brighteyed children plumped out by thick clothes small men bent under huge bundles of firewood old women squatting fanning stoves shyly hiding their faces goats and sheep and yaks a surprisingly modest royal palace the few dirt roads and the single stretch of tarmac they were so proud of bizarre tales about the dowager queen id never met huge monasteries barnacled across cliff faces waking up in the middle of the night feeling breathless the creak of prayer windmills the bitter taste of warm milk beer not to mention my fan the prince i took a deep breath i dont know about that it would seem to be the only way what if i say no then we would hope that you would continue to do your present job kathryn we would have to find somebody else perhaps a group of people rather than an individual to take on thulahn in the way i have outlined i like my life tommy now i was trying to sound regretful i enjoy feeling part of the buzz in the valley i like staying in london and travelling in europe i like travelling i like the view over cities at night and room service and long wine lists and twentyfourhour supermarkets youre asking me to settle down in a place where theyre still struggling to come to terms with the flush toilet that is understood if you took up this offer you would have complete freedom to work out the proportion of time you would spend in thulahn and the proportion you spent elsewhere we would trust you to resign if you found that the amount of time you felt able to spend in thulahn was inadequate to fulfil the role you had taken up he paused you would be made very comfortable we could recreate your house in california if that was what you wanted you would have a company plane at your disposal and a choice of staff of course those sound like the sort of privileges a level two could expect level two status would be assured good grief assured the importance of our association with thulahn will surely be obvious to our colleagues at every level once the deal has been struck and we are able to let everyone know i cannot imagine that they would fail to promote you to a level your position in the country and importance to the company would befit this was indeed as good as saying it was mine but the deal with the prince isnt done yet not quite technically there are still a few details to be ironed out would me agreeing to all that youre proposing happen to be one of those details cholongai sat back looking surprised no he looked up the notquitevertical slope of white superstructure towards the bridge of the ship we are not sure if the prince is simply holding out for better terms or whether he is genuinely beginning to have second thoughts it is vexing it may be that he is being struck by the enormity of what he is doing he is ending several hundred years of tradition and taking something away from his own family after all just as well hes childless then i was still a bit taken aback by all this what exactly would be the setup if we do take the place over how do we make sure its ours cholongai waved one hand the details are complicated but it would involve a sort of governing trust of all the level ones the prince would remain head of state and after him if he has no children there is a tenyearold nephew who is next in line he is in one of our schools in switzerland cholongai smiled he is making good progress bully for him i tapped my fingers on the plastic table i was thinking whose idea was this tommy what do you mean kathryn whose idea was it to involve me in this way he sat still for a moment i do not know that is i cannot remember the suggestion was probably made at a board meeting but when exactly and by whom i do not recall detailed minutes are not kept that also is in confidence by the way why does this matter just curious may i ask who knows about this cholongai nodded as though hed anticipated this question level one executives i do not think anybody else does j e dessous and i have been delegated to take responsibility for the analysis anddecision he looked to one side as the steward approached with a large silver tray and what at first i thought was a laptop sitting on it it was a satellite phone excuse me mr cholongai said to me and lifted the handpiece hello he said then shifted into either rapid chinese or malay i couldnt tell which he put the phone down and waved the waiter away there is someone coming to see you he told me there is here yes they have something for you a present i looked at him for a moment glad that the raybans were hiding at least some of my confusion i see the noise of a helicopter thudthudded unseen somewhere behind us anyone i know i asked mr cholongais head tipped to one side perhaps his name is adrian poudenhaut pran and i watched poudenhauts helicopter land where mine had set down his was a sleek bell with retractable undercarriage i felt jealous poudenhaut stepped out dressed in a light blue suit he held a slim halliburton pran moved to take the aluminium briefcase off him but poudenhaut clutched it to his chest we walked away and the bell lifted off stowing its wheels and dipping its nose towards the land which was just visible as a dark line on the horizon ms telman poudenhaut said hello again thank you thatll be all he said to pran who smiled and nodded and walked away across the deck poudenhaut reached into one pocket and extracted a sizeable mobile phone then into another and took out an lshaped attachment for it together they made an even dinkier satellite phone than mr cholongais he pressed a couple of buttons then held the phone to his ear looking at me all the time i inspected my own sunglassed image in his shades the phone made a noise im on the ship sir he said he handed me the phone it was quite heavy hello i said it was as id expected hazletons voice on the other end ms telman kathryn yes mr hazleton is that you it is i have something for you adrian will show you the disc is yours afterwards is it right i had no idea what the hell we were talking about thats all nice to talk to you goodbye the line bleeped and went dead i shrugged and handed the instrument back to poudenhaut there was a bead of sweat in the hollow of his upper lip i hope you know whats going on here i said because i certainly dont poudenhaut nodded he looked around then pointed at a line of tall windows forward of where we stood in here will do the place must have been a lounge perhaps a restaurant the floor was bare metal plate with just a few strips of worn carpet and underlay strewn about the suspended ceiling had been taken down and the light fittings removed we sat in the gloom at the back by a small table attached to a metal column supporting the roof surrounded by a forest of grey cables hanging from where the lights had been all swaying slowly in the gentle swell poudenhaut took off his shades and looked about all around us were the grey fronds of the hanging wires forward of us there was a bulkhead with various hatches and doors set in it in the other three directions daylight glared through the windows like a vast strident striplight he flipped open the cover of the combination lock and clicked the three little wheels he sprang the catches opened the briefcase and lifted a little portable dvd player out oh my i said thats very neat isnt it hmm he said i craned my head there was nothing else in the briefcase poudenhaut frowned at me and clunked the case shut he spun the little player so that it was facing me hinged the screen up and reaching over the top stabbed at a button the machine made discreet whirring noises and the screen lit up though it stayed blank ive been asked to show you what youre about to see poudenhaut said i need your word you wont say anything to anyone about this okay i guess he looked like he wasnt sure whether this was really sufficient but then said right he leant over and hit another button the screen flickered only i could see this poudenhaut was facing the rear of the screen there was no sound the picture was better than vhs nearly broadcast quality it showed a woman entering a building on a busy street the woman was caucasian youngish and darkhaired she wore sunglasses a summer dress and a light jacket traffic was driving on the righthand side of the street and i guessed this was in the us somewhere from the automobiles i got the impression the camera had been inside a vehicle small figures to the bottom right of the display indicated it was that would be april the way brits show the date but october if this was american exactly a month ago the scene switched to a bedroom lit by sunlight on closed net curtains the drapes moved slightly as though the window was open behind them it looked like the camera was sitting on top of a wardrobe or a cupboard angled downwards the image quality had deteriorated a little no datetime display the same woman probably led a tall man in a business suit to the bed and started kissing him he was white tanned had black hair and a neatly trimmed beard they slipped each others jackets off then they fell together to the bed they started undressing each other quickly i looked up at poudenhaut raising my eyebrows he stared back impassive they both had good bodies she sucked his dick a little stubby for my taste and with a distinct rightwards curve but there you are then they sixtynined then they fucked missionary position for a couple of minutes without protection looked like they both enjoyed it i cleared my throat my but it was hot in here the screen flickered and the couple were screwing again him taking her from behind they were both approximately facing the camera but i got the impression neither of them knew it was there i studied their faces i had a vague feeling i knew the guy but i wasnt sure he took longer this time it looked like real sex and not pornography because they just humped away with no cutaway shots of her face or his backside and when he came he did so inside her not over her face or her tits or anything crass like that another few shots of them lying on the bed together on top at first then under a sheet both talking and smiling and playing with each others hair another flicker then him leaving the apartment hailing a cab a yellow cab so almost certainly the us possibly nyc flicker then her leaving and walking away the datetime display indicated theyd been together for just under two hours then the end blank screen i sat back poudenhaut sat looking at me yes i said its finished would you eject the disc and take it out i sat forward and inspected the machine finding the eject button the disc appeared and i slipped it out please keep it i popped it into a side pocket in my jacket do you know what youve just shown me i asked poudenhaut shook his head briskly as he turned the dvd player off closed it and put it back in the briefcase no he said i just have this feeling it might not be what i was supposed to be looking at this was becoming more than slightly ridiculous poudenhaut with his fancy helicopter and his hollywoodvillain briefcase and minuscule sat phone and spanking new dvd machine coming all the way out here just to show me a few minutes of amateur porn at least he had the decency to look confused what he began then frowned youi believe you were supposed expected to recognise a person i thought back to the guy in the bedroom did i recognise him i didnt think so i shook my head you sure poudenhaut sounded worried now i may forget a face i never forget anever mind poudenhaut held up one hand would you wait a minute he moved about ten metres away through the pale grey fronds of the hanging wires he stood with his back to me and tried to use the sat phone it didnt work he shook it which was somehow an encouraging thing to see then tried again once more fruitlessly youll probably find you have to go outside i called over to him he looked at me satellite i said pointing upwards he nodded once and headed for the line of windows he stood in the sunlight talked briefly and then started waving at me motioning me to join him i left his briefcase where it was and strolled out he handed me the phone he was really quite sweaty about the face now kathryn mr hazleton he laughed ah the bestlaid schemes eh gang aft agley i agreed hmm one should not make too many assumptions you arent just teasing poor adrian are you you really didnt recognise anyone in that little film did i see what i was supposed to see a man and a woman having sex in a hotel yes i smiled at poor adrian who was dabbing at his forehead with a handkerchief i see well no i really didnt recognise either of them how embarrassing after all that secrecy a pause i suppose i could just tell you i suppose you could perhaps its better if i dont for now you may remember of your own accord given time id rather you just told me hmm id appreciate it if you kept this to yourself for the moment kathryn dont show the disc to anybody else you may well find it extremely useful in due course mr h if youre not going to tell me i might be tempted to post it on the web and see if anybody else can tell me who these two young lovers are now kathryn that would be very irresponsible please dont be petulant i was supposed to know by now why not just tell me another pause the ships horn blared above and forward of us poudenhaut and i both jumped what was that hazleton asked ships hooter i said very loud yes wasnt it so who was i supposed to recognise mr hazleton i suppose i am being overly secretive its just that theres no need for adrian to know i smiled at poudenhaut fine by me i turned and walked a few steps away then smiled back at poudenhaut his mouth set in a tight line he retreated into the shade of the lounge and crossed his arms watching me i heard hazleton take a breath you didnt even start to recognise her so it was the woman i thought hard no when you met her she may have had blonde hair quite long blonde i thought of the womans face annoyingly the image that had chosen to etch itself on my memory was of her just as she was achieving orgasm her head thrown back her mouth open in a shout of pleasure i tried to ignore this and to edit out the shoulderlength black hair and substitute blonde maybe i was starting to think i had seen her once or met her maybe i had a bad association with that face something i didnt want to think about ohoh no further forward kathryn hazleton asked he sounded like he was enjoying this i might be i said uncertainly she might ring a vague bell definitely a bad association here shall i tell you yes i said you bastard was the bit i only thought her first names emma emma very definitely a bad association yes id met her just once maybe but who the hell was she and why the bad association then i realised just as he spoke her second name half an hour later i stood on the bridge of the lorenzo uffizi braced along with the others against one of the equipment consoles still ranged beneath the windows while the coast swept forward to meet us at thirty knots the lorenzo uffizi was headed straight for a broad gap between a halfdemolished bulk carrier and a wide unidentifiable hull that was all ribs and missing plates spread out on either side of us for kilometres in each direction were dozens of ships of every size and type and in every stage of dismantling some freshly beached and barely touched others reduced to little more than the spines of their keels and a few girders tiny figures dotted the vast slope of oilstained sand and infinitesimal sparks glowed sporadically amongst the hulks while slanted pillars of smoke rose from a hundred different sites on the remains of the ships the salvagelittered shore and deep inland the faintest of tremors shook the vessel i watched the bows start to rise as the edge of the console pressed against my pelvis and belly the telegraph rang for all stop a few people cheered tommy cholongai still holding on to the wheel laughed and wheezed as the deceleration forced him forward into it the ship groaned and creaked around us and from somewhere below there came a distant crashing noise like hundreds of pieces of crockery falling shuddering mightily the lorenzo uffizis bows rode further and further up the beach gradually obscuring the view of the land dead ahead looking to port i watched our wash go piling up against the ruststreaked hull of the bulk carrier in a great white sine of surf bangings and thuds sounded all around us the deck seemed to flex beneath my feet and a window out on the far end of the bridges starboard wing suddenly popped out of its frame and disappeared towards the glistening sands below the creaking and groaning and the steady pressure went on for a few more seconds then with a final pulsing shake and a kind of softly transmitted thud that left me bruised for days and nearly hit my head on the window glass the old cruise liner settled into her last resting place the crashing noises ceased and the console stopped digging into me more cheering and applause tommy cholongai thanked the ships master and the pilot and then with a flourish set the bridge telegraph to finished with engines i looked over at adrian poudenhaut who had decided to stay aboard for the beaching but had looked distinctly green around the gills for the last ten minutes or so calm seas or no still clutching his briefcase he smiled wanly i smiled back and as i smiled i thought emma buzetski because that was her name buzetski is her second name hazleton had said on the satellite phone half an hour earlier just before he rang off shes emma buzetski you know stephens wife chapter seven just had a horrible thought you had a dream where you woke up and somebody had removed all your teeth last week michael i have some bad news for you no im serious but its about that you recall the party i was going to see on the morning after that happened yes what about him he has a daughter very pretty very westernised very pleased to see me once when her dad wasnt there if you know what i mean gosh youre such a rake actually youre a fucking cretin you risked jeopardising a deal that size by getting involved with a ceos kid i cant believe youre telling me this is this meant to endear me to you mike make me think hey heres one worth promoting spread the word around the level fours are you mad are you drunk dickhead mikey boy calm down will you look it just fucking happened all right she came on to me i mean shes not a child or anything i think but i was practically raped yeah right except she wouldnt actually let me how shall i put it go the hole way go on i used my mouth ah see your problemworry except what was done to you was done at this end not that end of the journey i mean not your bod still i mean dont you think you said the party concerned wasnt too bothered about your lack of dentition quite unfazed bad sign think back to your previous few encounters with him post your tryst with his lil girl how was his attitude then umm well frostier maybe i remember talking about that it felt like wed slipped back a rung or two in the negotiations thought it was just a ploy but he was always really polite to me i mean really you idiot so hes frosty then you lose half your teeth and hes the one wreathed in smiles didnt you ever suffer because of somebody and even if you had to tolerate them because of business be really cold towards them and then have your secret revenge on them and suddenly find it was easy even more satisfying to be all sympathetic towards them i am in the presence of the master arent i or the mistress truly you are yoda yodette anyway displeased with you i am i cant believeno come to think of it i can youre a man were probably lucky you didnt try to shag his wife or have carnal knowledge of his favourite golf course or something i mean eighteen holes the possibilities actually i dont know why im making light of this in all seriousness im very disappointed in you that was a very stupid thing to do the deal is totally done isnt it there isnt some last little tiny detail that could explode oh sorry could that be ejaculate in our faces yuk totally done signed sealed delivered and set in reinforced ferroconcrete look ive said im sorry but at least i did tell you as soon as i realised ferroconcrete is reinforced and i bet you did not just think of this and as i seem to recall telling you adrian g is your immediate superior while im on sabbatical not me plus i just scrolled back through all this and you have not said youre sorry all right im sorry really look i dont have to tell ag do i he really doesnt like me say it aint so ill make it up to you this is all off the record obviously helps to say that at the start you do have a lot to learn how did you get to be an l anyway i wont tell ag but in the event that anything does happen with the deal concerned youre going to have to confess all to the relevant authorities as the deals done and the ceo was apparently happy were probably ok honour satisfied but like i say in the event youll have to own up and another thing have you talked to the girl since has she said she confessed all to her pa i mean it looks like he found out but through her she wont return my calls im starting to regret telling you this look if something did go wrong later this could end my career you wont grass on me will you kathryn please im not promising anything if all you pay for this is losing a few teeth well all have got off lightly whos this we white man might i point out that ive taken all the shit here as far as the biz is concerned the phrase scot free comes to mind my little caledonian chum you ie the company has lost fuck all yes and youd better pray it stays that way i thought you were an atheist its just a form of words dont get hot under your dog or any other collar where the hell is your dumb ass sorry arse anyway home in a dark and rainswept chelsea you im in karachi and a quandary oh isnt that the new toyota never mind you should be asleep do try not to fuck up any important megadeals or lose any major body parts while in the land of nod make it so number one oh forgot adrian g changed story again apparently it definitely and definitively was not our large secure friend mr walker he saw in that taxi the other day my fault for getting totally the wrong end of the stick allegedly just thought id tell you right so now we know night and then again night wed been lifted off the lorenzo uffizi by the helicopter from tommy cholongais yacht for a while id wondered whether wed be taken straight to the yacht and never actually set foot on the sands of sonmiani bay but we did plucked from the deck and lowered to the beach in groups of four and stood in the shade of the enormous stem of the old liner while mr c gladhanded the bossmen of the shipbreaking concern that would be scrapping the vessel even while we stood there the water still drying on the vessels patchy red hullbottom paint and draining from the weeds and encrusted growths that had accumulated under the waterline since her last scraping a squad of little men and skinny boys pushing oxyacetylene cylinders on trolleys came jogging past us they split into groups of two stationed every hundred feet or so down the length of the hull exposed above the now retreating tide ignited their torches flipped dark goggles down and started cutting into the ships plates to form a series of beachlevel doors the pakistani bosses were all smiles and politeness and invited us to take tea in their offices further up the beach but i got the impression they just wanted rid of us so they could get on with the job of taking the ship apart mr cholongai declined their offer gracefully and we were all ferried out to the yacht in the little hughes apart from adrian poudenhaut who was picked up by his fancy bellwiththeretractableundercarriage the swine there was a feast arranged on board the yacht and something of a party the lorenzo uffizis captain and first officer and the local pilot received presents from mr c they didnt unwrap them but they seemed very happy with them all the same gorgeously attractive malay girls wandered the teak decks and main lounge serving cocktails and seafood mr poudenhaut did not stay long tommy cholongai observed joining me at the port deck rail most people were either in the airconditioned lounge or on this side in the shade even in the shadows with a gentle breeze produced by the yacht heading parallel with the coast towards karachi it felt fiercely hot and humid a man with a mission i said and sipped my margarita a present i understood he held a glass of iced coffee yes i said aware of the weight of the disc in my jacket pocket from mr hazleton it would be obvious to infer cholongai said nodding thoughtfully he smiled forgive me if im being too nosy wont you thats all right mr poudenhaut was delivering something mr hazleton thought i ought to see i take it you werent aware of what it was indeed no mr poudenhauts visit was as much a surprise to me as it was to you he glanced at me it was a surprise to you wasnt it yes i thought so he looked out towards the shore we had left behind the last of the scrapped ships ragged outlines a few minutes ago a thin dark line of mangrove trees had replaced the tawny sands of course he said given what i have told you about today and given that the level one executives all know of this matter there is bound to be oh how would one say it some jockeying for position i think im starting to appreciate that tommy we shall be staying in harbour in karachi for a day or two i have to entertain various worthy but not very sparkling industrialists this evening you are certainly invited though i think you might be bored however i would be honoured if you would join me for lunch tomorrow if i have time to do a little shopping when we get ashore ill happily join you for both boring industrialists hold no terror for me tommy cholongai looked pleased he glanced at his watch it would be quicker to send you ahead in the helicopter oh i said good having been met by mo meridalawah at the airport and transported across the ocean of poverty that was karachi to the archipelago of shops where serious money could be spent i had time to buy a new frock a satellite phone and a dvd player hello mr hazleton yes who is that kathryn telman well hello have you a new telephone kathryn yes a satellite phone thought id test it out this is my first call oh i suppose i ought to feel honoured oughtnt i you rang off rather abruptly yesterday did i im sorry why did you want me to see that mr hazleton what the scene in the hotel oh i thought it might come in useful for you its blackmail material mr hazleton it could be used as such i suppose i hadnt really thought of that you werent thinking of using it as such were you why should i use it at all mr hazleton oh thats up to you kathryn i simply thought to provide the material how you use it is up to you but why mr hazleton why did you provide it id have thought it was rather obvious kathryn so that you would feel beholden to me so that you would be well disposed towards me it is a gift im not asking for anything specific in return but i know about the task that tommy and jebbet will have outlined to you by now and it is a very important one for the company that will make you a very important person in a sense it already has even if you have not yet come to a decision have you by the way not yet im still thinking that is sensible it is a big step a step that i like the others would like you to take but youre right not to make the decision without serious thought im sorry if ive given you even more to think about did you set this up mr hazleton i mean the filming not i you might say that the material fell into my hands and why do you think that i in particular might be interested in it kathryn its not exactly common knowledge but i think i know how you feel about mr buzetski oh you do do you yes i like stephen too i admire his integrity his principles it would be a pity if those principles were founded as it were on false premises though wouldnt it i thought that as this piece of film existed it might be of value to you the truth can hurt kathryn but it is usually preferable to falsehood dont you think mr hazleton do you hold any evidence of a similar nature concerning me good heavens no kathryn this is not something i have any regular part in or wish to encourage as i said the film fell into my hands and what exactly makes you think i feel anything in particular for stephen buzetski in the first place im not blind kathryn and i am human the same goes for the people who work for me they understand emotions they can empathise with people of course they make it their business to know how people in the company feel about their colleagues so that one doesnt accidentally place together people who hate each other just good business practice really and of genuine benefit to the individuals concerned too im sure you can appreciate that in the circumstances one doesnt have to try to discover whos attached to whom to find out en passant as it were it just happens im sure it does quite so you have the film or video disc or whatever its called frankly all this technology is beyond me how you use it is up to you though of course i entirely understand that you may wish not to use it directly as it were you may think it would be better if stephen found out what has been going on without any reference to you in which case im sure that a way could be found for him to discover the truth without you being involved in any way all you would have to do would be to let me know you make it all sound very reasonable mr hazleton good im glad stephen help how im in a quandary where are you anyway home where are you karachi pakistan everybody ok there fine wow you are trotting that old globe what seems to be the problem maam new job offer new job offer what the hell can it be well for one thing its in confidence you got it and also its in thulahn you have got to be kidding no youve got to be being kidded thats the place in the himalayas right the same explain i cant wait this isnt demotion is it you havent done anything foolish have you oh its not demotion and i have done lots of foolish things but enough about my sex life they want me to well its hard to explain scout the place out i cant give you all the details but they want me to settle there live there get to know the people try and suss how theyre going to react to future changes anticipate their collective mood i guess but theres nothing there is there mountains lots and lots of mountains and nine hundred thousand people how much cant you tell me rough idea promise itll go no further shit well its important and it would be good for my career im told but its a totally radical change it means giving up the way i live my life it means giving up what im good at jobwise it probably means giving up seeing my friends as much as i do at the moment and thats already barely enough with the job i dont know id ever be able to step back into it i mean what i do now is all so techy and its all moving so fast i probably cant leave it for more than about you guess maybe a year eighteen months max and everything i know will probably be obsolete what theyre proposing is well big so itll easily go over that eighteen months cutting to chase the point is this is one of those warning not undoable decisions lordy mama dont know how to advise sounds like only you are in possession of the full facts wish same could be said for my faculties it can whats your gut feeling i must have become a ruminant because i seem to have at least two different gut feelings one says fuck it take it other just scrunches up into little ball in corner and squeals no no no no no but which is the real me i know which one id go for ah stephen if only emmas here at my side so ill just ask heronly kidding when do you need to give them a reply indefinite theyd like some sort of provisional idea in the next couple of weeks but i could probably stall into if i wanted youre in karachi close to thulahn worth taking a few days there well about km but yes wasnt that convenient ah well youre right i probably will only the prince could be a problem oh yes he greatly admires and respects you doesnt he has the hots for me yes oh kate you dismiss any and all professions of love as just lust maybe one of these guys is genuinely head over heels for you maybe they all are its a subtle form of selfdenigration youre indulging in here kate oh suddenly im on line to dr frasier crane youre listening id no idea so defensive kate well maybe in the words of the immortal whitney houston im saving all my love for somebody else anyway im sure you can handle the prince ahem im sure too but seriously its a consideration take that holiday or whatever you want to call it youre still on sabbatical arent you doesnt feel like it but yes so go good idea hey id get to choose staff you wouldnt want to move to thulahn would you i mean not now but if all this happens just kidding really kind of got commitments here schools you know plus emma not too keen on any incline beyond one in twenty probably a girl thing high heels and stuff yeah commitments like i said just kidding you could always visit though yeah yeah huh huh surely dont call meactually you can call me anythingtime you want ah dear i think tiredness is catching up on me bed beckons i shall to my sheets thinking of you have a nice day and from this end good night you are a rascal sweet dreams sweet dreams indeed i put a finger to my lips and kissed it then touched the tip to the screen on the words sweet dreams then i laughed at myself and shook my head i closed the laptops lid the machine beeped at me and the glow of light from the screen cut out just before it came down to meet the keyboard only the tvs screen was left on now tuned to bloomberg sound off i looked out at the lights of the city and then up at the cornice of the room between wall and ceiling everything was built in nowhere to just plonk a camcorder come to think of it it had probably been something more sophisticated that had spied on mrs b and her lover you could put a camcorder lens into a pair of glasses these days so maybe the camera had been concealed in a smoke alarm or something and the rest of the mechanism housed somewhere its bulk didnt matter i lifted the laptops lid up again the screen flicked back on i looked at the last few lines wed exchanged commitments oh stephen i whispered what am i to do the dvd player was still in its box i hadnt had the time or the inclination to try connecting it to my laptop yet the disc poudenhaut had given me was still in my jacket pocket hung up inside the wardrobe and smelling of smoke all the industrialists on mr cs yacht were heavy smokers i didnt need the disc or the dvd player i could see mrs buzetski silently mouthing oh oh oh very clearly indeed thank you i didnt save our exchange to the laptops hard drive i just powered down first the machine then after a shower me well now here was an interesting little treat that nice mr cholongai had loaned me his company lear it was a good one too actually had facilities the first time i was offered a lift on a private jet i was appalled to be told it might be an idea to visit the airport loo before we left as the plane didnt have a toilet finding that your ultimate corporate status symbol has less in the way of amenities than a modern express coach can take the gloss off the experience i should be old enough not to want to do this sort of thing but well i discovered my ordinary mobile phone would work and attempted to call my pal luce back in california voicemail i tried another of my girlfriends in the valley she was on an exercise bike in the gym and was suitably impressed when i told her where i was but too breathless to be able to talk much still in a telephonic mood i drew various blanks machines and more voicemails then got through to uncle freddy guess where i am frederick no idea dear girl in a lear jet all by myself flying across india good heavens id no idea you knew how to fly you know what i mean uncle freddy oh youre a passenger i am the passenger i am outnumbered two to one by the crew well good for you i suppose there are times when its good to be in the minority oh really name one other ummtroilism given that only a few months earlier both india and pakistan had been trading underground nuclear tests it was probably a sign of how good our relations were with both states that the lear was cleared straight through across both air spaces to a small airport at siliguri situated in the little bit of connective tissue that winds round the northern frontier of bangladesh and beneath the southern limits of nepal thulahn and bhutan to join the main body of india with the appendage of assam the himalayas visible in the distance to the north throughout most of the flight as a deep sweep of glaringly white peaks gradually disappeared under a layer of haze i started playing jagged little pill but it was entirely inappropriate besides id grown fed up with alanis morissettes little endofphrase gasps and hadnt forgiven her for entirely confirming the brit prejudice that north americans dont know the meaning of the word irony i looked through my discs and decided i didnt have any music suitable for this view instead i fired up the dvd at last and put it through the laptop glancing at the film of mrs b and her lover like emma it did come with sound the volume just hadnt been turned up before then clicking through the documentary and photo files on the rest of the disc depressing soon enough we dipped towards the ambiguous landscape that was neither plains nor foothills around siliguri i had to change planes here the lear couldnt land at thuhn it needed about four times the length of runway there and it also wasnt really happy landing on anything other than smooth tarmac as thuhns airstrip was composed of the sort of uneven gravelly earth that was pretty crap as a football park let alone an airfield this meant that the very nice young norwegian copilot had to lug my bags across to the scruffy twin otter i recognised from the last time id made this trip this twoengined portacabin was the pride and joy of air thulahn and indeed the only aircraft it actually possessed there was a little socket just outside the pilots sliding window jamming a stick in there with the thulahnese royal flag attached instantly converted the plane into the royal flight the plane was wittily nicknamed otto it didnt really look all that primitive well apart from the props and the fixed undercarriage and the odd dent or two in the fuselage until the ground staff opened up the nose which id fondly assumed might contain radar direction finders instrument landing gear that sort of thing and dumped my luggage in the empty space revealed the last time id climbed aboard otto at dacca airport in bangladesh fresh off a pia dc terrible flight perfect landing id had to share the cabin with a gaggle of drunken thulahnese bureaucrats there were six of them i later discovered this constituted about half of the entire thulahnese civil service two saffronrobed priests with funny hats and plastic bags full of dutyfree cigarettes a couple of peasant ladies who had to be dissuaded from lighting up their kerosene stove for a bowl of tea while inflight a small but pungent billy goat and a pair of vociferously distressed and explosively incontinent piglets oh and there was a crate of hens every one of which looked distinctly dubious about trusting their necks to such a patently unairworthy craft what a fine old time we had on this occasion i was the only passenger though there was a pile of crates secured by webbing behind the last row of flimsy seats and various sacks of mail occupying the front two rows the pilot and copilot were the same two small smiling thulahnese guys i remembered from the last time and they greeted me like an old friend the preflight safety briefing consisted of telling me they suspected the last seatpocket safety instruction card had been eaten by either a goat or a small child but if i did happen to find another one on the floor or anywhere could they have it back please they were due an inspection soon and these civil aviation authority people were such blinking sticklers i promised that in the unlikely event i opened my eyes at any point during the flight id keep them peeled for laminated cards or indeed photocopies floating past on the breeze or stuck to the ceiling during a section of an outside loop they thought this was most amusing while my new flightdeck crew tapped gauges scratched their heads and whistled worriedly through their teeth i stuck my nose as close as i dared to the suspiciously smeared surface of the window and watched the sleekly gleaming lear swivel its electronicscrammed nose round briefly gun its twin jets and taxi towards the end of the runway i suspect my expression at that moment would have displayed the same despairing regret of a woman who has in some moment of utter madness just swapped a case of vintage krug for a litre of asti spumante you want we leave the door open the copilot said leaning round in his seat hed been eating garlic why would you do that i asked you get better view he said i looked out between him and the captain at the tiny windscreen only a metre and a half away imagining it entirely full of rapidly approaching snow and rocks no thanks okay he pulled the door to the flight deck shut with an uneven flapping thump the sun visor on your average family saloon gave a greater impression of solidity uncle freddy kathryn where are you now in a flying transit van heading straight for the highest mountains on earth thought it sounded a bit noisy in tarka are you tarka oh no wait that was the plane before this new one this is the new one oh yes tarka crashed years ago everybody killed well thats encouraging i hope im not disturbing you uncle freddy not at all dear girl sorry if im disturbing you dont worry i wont pretend this isnt partly to take my mind off the flight quite understand but also i forgot to ask about the scottish thing we discussed remember when we were fishing fishing oh yes whod have thought you could nab a trout at this time of year eh who indeed you do remember what we were ah talking about of course what was that air pocket or something hold on a mail sacks just landed on my lap im going to strap it into the seat beside meright did you get in touch with brussels oh yes your man is on his way to umm where you were good jesus christ you all right kate mountainkind of close there ah yes it is a rather spectacular flight isnt it thats one word for it your pal suvinder back there yet apparently not hes in paris back in a few days i may leave before he arrives dont forget to watch out for the prayer flags what the prayer flags at the airport all around it terribly colourful they put flags wherever they think people need spiritual help really still its true what they say isnt it youre more likely to be killed in a car than a plane not when youre in the plane uncle freddy oh well i suppose if youre going to look at it that way right just thought id check how are things in yorkshire bit rainy gto needs a new big end does it right okay you sound a bit tense old girl ha really try having a snooze a snooze works wonders or get absolutely filthy drunk of course you have to do that a good while before the flight uhhuh yes equip yourself with such a bloody awful hangover that a fiery death in the mangled wreckage of an aircraft seems like a merciful release i think im going to ring off now uncle freddy right you are get some shuteye good idea the final precipitous rollercoaster descent into thuhn was even more terrifying than i remembered for one thing i could see it this time on the previous occasion wed been in cloud until the last thousand feet or so and id ascribed the wildly uneven flying of that part of the flight to yet more severe turbulence approaching in midafternoon on a clear day it became all too obvious that going into a succession of stomachchurning nosedives and standing the twin otter on its wingtips was simply the only way for the tiny craft simultaneously to lose enough height and avoid a succession of towering knifesharp obsidian cliffs and seemingly nearvertical boulder fields full of vast rocky shards like ragged black sharks teeth it was probably just as well there was an air of unreality about the flight i felt woozy i had the beginnings of a headache it was probably the altitude and the thin air they said it was better to take your time getting to somewhere as high as thuhn drive up or take a donkey or even walk that way your body adjusted gradually to the thinning air flying in from sea level was precisely the way not to do it still at least we were descending now i shivered id dressed in jeans and a cotton blouse and kept a few clothes by my side which id gradually put on during the flight a plaid shirt a jumper gloves but i still felt freezing the plane levelled out in that last thousand feet of its approach if you can call hurtling down at an angle of about fortyfive degrees levelling out i watched a stone shrine a stupa flashing past the window on a spur of rock level with the plane i looked down if we were at fortyfive degrees the slope was at about fortyfour i did not need to be a geometrician to know that the brown blur of broken ground was getting closer all the time the shadow of the plane worryingly sharp and close to lifesize flickered over rocks lines of prayer flags and straggling walls made from rough round boulders some of the tall bamboo masts anchoring the lines of prayer flags were about twice as far off the ground as the twin otter i pondered uncle freddys words about the siting of prayer flags and the possibility of dying in a plane crash caused by wellmeaning believers hoisting a fresh set of flags in the last obvious space around the airport only to snag the plane and cause the disaster they were hoping to avert suddenly there were buildings underneath opposite and above us i glimpsed an old man looking down at us from a window and could have told you the colour of his eyes if id been paying attention and then i was terribly heavy then light and then there was a thump and a furious shaking and rumbling that meant wed landed i opened my eyes as the plane rattled and banged across the landing ground raising dust there was a cliff edge about three metres away and a drop into a deep wide valley where a whiteflecked river wound through sinuous fields of grey gravel its banks terraced with narrow fields and dotted with sparse trees grey black and then utterly white mountains rose beyond their peaks like a vast white sheet hooked in a dozen different places and hauled sharply up to heaven the plane wheeled abruptly engines roaring and then cutting out that left only the roaring in my ears then the copilot appeared looking pleased with himself through the planes windscreen not far in front i could see a set of soccer goalposts he kicked open the door which whammed down and jerked on its chain like a hanged man here we are he said i unbuckled rose unsteadily and stepped out on to the dusty brown ground i was suddenly surrounded by a sea of knee and thighhigh children kitted out to resemble small cushions while a crowd of adults dressed in what looked like colourful quilts appeared and started congratulating the flight crew on another safe landing the terminal building was still the fuselage of a usaaf dc that had crashlanded here during the second world war it was closed a wind as cold and thin and sharp as a knife cut across the landing strip raising dust and goose pimples i patted a selection of worryingly sticky little heads and looked up past the jumbled buildings of the town to the steep slope of chaotically fractured rocks over which we had made our final approach prayer flags everywhere like bunting round a used boulder lot beneath my feet were the markings for one of the football grounds penalty boxes one of the male quiltpeople came up to me put his hands together as though in prayer and bowed and said ms telman welcome to thuhn international airport i successfully resisted the urge to laugh hysterically in his face i say did you know that you can count up to over one thousand just using your fingers really yes can you guess how i bet you cant youduse a different base i suppose not ten ah of course binary yes itd beone thousand and twentyfour one thousand and twentythree actually zero to one thousand and twentythree gosh though well done that was very quick i must have bored you with this before have i no mr hazleton then im impressed and you know my name and here i am and ive very rudely forgotten yours though im sure we were introduced earlier i do hope youll forgive me kathryn telman mr hazleton kathryn how do you do i do believe ive heard of you we shook hands it was november in berlin the week the wall came down id squeezed myself into a lufthansa flight from london jump seat snooty stewardesses just that day determined to be there for a bit of history that had seemed unthinkable just a few years earlier a whole bunch of the more adventurous business highups had had exactly the same idea tempelhof and tegel must have been doubleparked with executive jets for those few days and as a result almost by default there was a sort of impromptu meeting of various level twos and ones set up for that evening id decided to try and gatecrash that as well and succeeded we were sitting down to dinner in a private room in the kempinski after a chaotic evening in a collection of limos and taxis touring the various places where people were swarming over the wall attacking it demolishing it wheeling bits of it away and pocketing it everybody was a bit drunk and i suppose infected with the heady almost revolutionary make that counterrevolutionary atmosphere of that particular time and place i had indeed been introduced to hazleton at the reception before dinner he was a level two at the time but marked out for still greater things hed looked me over in an automatic unfocused way i was twentynine already a four thanks to my inspired guesses about computers and it i looked pretty good better than i had at nineteen hazleton might have forgotten my name but he hadnt forgotten what i looked like hed made straight for the seat at my side well fairly straight he bumped a couple of goldpainted chairs on the way hed just nodded at me as hed sat down and then ignored me throughout the first course as though hed really chosen this seat at random or had taken it reluctantly then suddenly hed come up with this unlikely chatup line about digital digits i had become used to this sort of thing from upperclass englishmen at least he had used the second person rather than one and if one used ones toes he said one could go up to over a million oh so we were using one were we impractical though i said yes youd have to take your socks or stockings off back to you then i was thinking i said of the difficulty of articulating your toes oh yes how do you mean well you can use your fingers to count because you can alter their state bend each one to show whether its a zero or a one but very few people can do anything similar with their toes they just sort of sit there dont they he thought about this i can put my little toes over the ones next to them really on both sides yes good eh then assuming you can put each of your big toes over the one next to them you could count to what just over sixteen thousand i suppose so he contemplated his entrée for a moment i can wiggle my ears you know never yes watch good heavens we amused each other with a selection of childish antics like this for a while then got on to puzzles ive got one i said what are the next two letters in this sequence s t n d r d he sat back i had to repeat the letters for him he looked thoughtful s d he said no yes it is its standardised with all the vowels taken out no it isnt why not he asked indignantly thats a perfectly good answer the correct ones much better he made a noise which sounded suspiciously close to a harrumph and sat back with his arms crossed well so you tell me young lady want a clue oh if you insist first clue ill write it down i took my napkin and lipstick and wrote s t n d r d he bent over the napkin then looked up at me sceptically thats a clue the gaps the spacing thats the clue he looked unconvinced he carefully extracted a pair of halfmoon glasses from his breast pocket and put them on he peered at the napkin over the top of them want another clue wait wait he said holding up one hand all right he said eventually second clue its a very simple sequence really hmm the simplest thats your third clue actually its your fourth clue too and ive already given you the answer uhhuh he gave in at last well i think the answer is s d and youre just being a tease he told me folding the glasses and putting them away the answer is t h he looked at the napkin i wrote the last two letters into the space no he said i still dont see watch i wrote a large in front of the letters st i didnt need to add the the or the ah he said nodding very clever havent heard of that one before you wouldnt have i made it up myself really he looked at me you are a clever little thing arent you i used my wintry smile i woke up in darkness breathless i was gasping for air drowning in what felt like a semivacuum beneath a huge and terrible weight darkness not just ordinary darkness but total darkness profound and utter and somehow intensifying the breathlessness where was i berlin no that had been a dream or something remembered blysecrag chilly enough for one of the turret rooms i looked for my watch the bed felt small and cold and odd nebraska the air outside the bed as well as feeling absurdly cold didnt smell right the bedclothes were far too heavy my breath hurt my throat there was a very strange smell in the air where the hell was i i extended my left hand and found cold stonesolid wall i reached up and touched wood i saw a small glowing circle nearby on my right and leaned across to it it felt like i was wearing all my clothes my fingers closed around the watch it felt very cold according to the breitling it was four fifteen i tried to remember whether id reset it for the right time zone clattering across an uneven wooden surface my fingers encountered the familiar lumpy shape of the netsuke monkey figure and then the ribbed casing of my little flashlight i clicked it on my breath smoked in front of me i was in some sort of bed alcove the ceiling of the room was painted bilious yellow and livid green a row of demonic faces glared down at me painted red purple black and orange their brows were arched their ears were pointed their eyes were huge and glaring their moustaches were curled like waxed black hooks and their fanglike teeth were bared behind snarling carmine lips under cheeks as round and green as avocados i stared at them the little aspherilux threw a tight even spot of light the spot was shaking i must still be dreaming i really needed to get back to sleep properly and wake up again then i remembered thulahn i was in thulahn in the capital city of thuhn in the palace of a thousand rooms which had exactly sixtyone rooms the bizarre painted wooden heads were there to ward off demons while the honoured guest slept there was no light because a it was night b there was no moon c the rooms window was covered by both curtains and shutters and d the palace electricity generator shut down at midnight when the prince was in residence at other times like now it was turned off at sunset i was cold because i was in a place where central heating meant having a full stomach i was breathless because id come from hot and humid sea level yesterday morning to nine thousand feet by teatime by the side of the bed there was a small oxygen cylinder and mask just in case no tv of course i remembered the airstrip being welcomed by a polite little quilted thulahnese guy of indeterminate age called langton something or other walking with him at the head of a procession of adults and chattering children and being shown around the ramshackle town entering the palace complex through brightly painted wooden gates and having a tour of its impressive state rooms before sitting down to dinner at a long table with what looked like a bunch of monks dressed in primary colours none of whom spoke english id sampled various consistencies and hues of beige food drunk water and fermented milk beer then suddenly it was dark and apparently it was time for bed id felt wide awake bewildered dizzy not connected to the world but wide awake until id seen the little cotbed and then id suddenly conked out i clicked the torch off my feet felt down to the bottom of the bed and touched the corkstoppered china hotwater bottle it was still warm i hooked it with one foot and brought it up towards my bum as i curled up again and closed my eyes why had i been dreaming of berlin and hazleton because id been talking to hazleton the day before i supposed because that dinner was the first time wed exchanged more than a few words obvious really except that it wasnt some bit of my brain didnt like this explanation and kept insisting there was more to it i put it down to lack of oxygen hazleton had felt my knee beneath the table later and insisted he would see me back to my room that evening id run away why couldnt i dream of stephen stephen married to emma emma who went oh oh oh in total silence emma who was having an affair with frank erickson a corporate lawyer for hergiere corp who lived in alexandria va with his wife rochelle and three children blake tia and robyn he and emma had met in various hotels within the dc beltway usually around lunchtime and had managed two weekends together one in new orleans when he was attending a convention and she had claimed to be visiting an old schoolfriend and one at the fearington house an elegant country inn tucked away in the woods near pittsboro north carolina i had the zip code and the telephone number for the inn i even knew what theyd had to eat for dinner on the friday and saturday night and which wines theyd chosen to accompany their meals i could have called the place up and asked them to reserve the same suite and put a bottle of the same champagne on ice there were no videos of their tryst there but i had a scanned copy of the bill the dvd poudenhaut had given me contained photographs of that bill various restaurant cheques all matched to still photos or other short pieces of video of the adulterous couple in those restaurants receipts for flowers to be delivered to mrs buzetskis office in the graphicdesign company she worked for a receipt for a fivehundred dollar négligée in mr ericksons name which i suspected his wife had never worn and a whole variety of other bits and pieces of film and documentation that chronicled their affair in excruciating detail the film of them fornicating in the dc hotel room the hamptons hotel bethesda room to be precise was just the cherry on the cake somebody had gone to a huge amount of trouble over a considerable period of time to gather that evidence and the more i thought about it the less i believed hazleton that the disc had just fallen into his hands how much of this sort of stuff went on was it just hazleton or were the rest at it as well did they have anything similar on me unlike stephen id never taken any vows never made any promises legal or otherwise but what about the people id slept with i tried to review the list of sexual partners id had over the years looking for any that could be blackmailed or otherwise compromised as far as i could remember there shouldnt be a problem id always tried to avoid married men just as a matter of course and on the few occasions when id ended up in bed with one it had been because the bastard had lied well once or twice i might have suspected but never mind come to think of it stephen ought to be grateful and flattered i was prepared to make an exception for him maybe this had all been done for me i thought maybe hazleton really didnt make a habit of this sort of thing but had set up this particular surveillance operation because he knew how i felt about stephen knew how stephen felt about adultery and had seen a way perhaps to give my beloved to me and so leave me for ever in his debt i was too hot the air outside the bed was still sharply chilly but underneath the himalayan pile of bedclothes it had suddenly become sweaty i pulled off my jumper and thick socks i kept them in the bed with me in case i needed to put them on again later what the hell was i going to do should i tell stephen about his wife shit it wasnt just the dishonesty or any advantage i might gain it was safety emma and frank hadnt used any protection that i could see i could phone stephen right now i could tell him the truth that i had the evidence and hazleton had given it to me that was the most honest course the sort of thing you could imagine justifying in court but if i did maybe he would blame me maybe hed stick by her maybe hed think i was just trying to wreck his marriage no win or i could even more easily because it would take a single sentence with no angst no trauma involved ring hazleton and say okay do it let it happen let stephen find out the truth and see what he did next hoping that hed turn to me sooner or later maybe even arrange to be nearby when he heard the news and so be the most obvious shoulder for him to cry on up my chances at some little risk or do nothing maybe hed find out anyway maybe mrs b would be discovered some other way or mrs erickson would find out and tell stephen or mrs b would grow tired of living a lie and announce she loved somebody else and wanted a divorce hell she knew a good lawyer that was the best outcome doing nothing and still coming out ahead a low reading on the guiltometer but that still left me knowing and not doing anything i tossed and turned in the bed still too warm despite the chilly air i slipped off my loose cotton pants and rolled them up i had my pjs on underneath the palace of a thousand rooms with sixtyone rooms ha blysecrag had more than that in one wing that would be the other reason id recalled my first proper meeting with hazleton and the thing about counting to a thousand on your fingers the palace of a thousand rooms was called that because whoever had first built it had counted in base four not base ten so that if you chose to translate it that way and they had their sixteen was our hundred and their sixtyfour was our thousand so the palace had been built with sixtyfour rooms except that three rooms had dropped off during an earthquake in the nineteen fifties and they hadnt got round to replacing them yet different bases that must be the explanation that was why id had that dreammemory of dinner in berlin the week the wall came down only it still wasnt in all my billions of neurons and synaptic connections it seemed like it only took a few determined troublemakers to distract me from the sort of things i ought to be thinking about like whether to tell my beloved he was being cuckolded or whether i should abandon my brilliant career and move to thulahn what was i mad think around the problem dont call stephen call his missus call mrs b tell her you know no call her or have somebody else call her anonymously and let her know only that somebody knows bring things to a head that way maybe shed confess all yes and then stephen just gee a big soft galloot forgives her and heck if their relationship doesnt like gather strength from the experience i could see that or maybe shed leave him i could see that too maybe shed leave him and take the children maybe shed leave him and take the children and leave the poor gorgeous sap with nobody to turn to but wait whos that in the background yes her the attractive thirtyeightyearold blonde oh but looks younger with the scottishbay area accent well heck a girl could dream shit none of this was getting me anywhere and i wasnt even sleepy any more tired yes but not sleepy i felt for the flashlight again i switched it on let the beam travel round the room while i took in where everything was then switched it off again i pulled on my socks trousers and jumper stuck my head under the covers the warm air smelled muskily pleasantly of perfume and me i took a few deep breaths then jumped out of bed putting the covers back i felt my way to the window i pulled back the thick quilted drapes folded the creaking wooden shutters to each side and opened the woodenframed windows with their bottlebottom panes no moon but no clouds either the towns roofs the river valley crumpled foothills and crowding mountains were lit by starlight with eight and a half thousand feet less atmosphere in the way to filter it than i was used to i couldnt see any other lights at all a dog barked faintly somewhere in the distance the breeze flowed into the room like cold water i stuck my hands into my armpits and suddenly remembered that when i was a little girl we used to call our armpits our oxters and leaned forward sticking my head out into the view what little of my breath the altitude hadnt already taken was removed by the sight of that darkly starlit gulf of rock and snow i stayed like that until i started to shiver then shut everything up with numbed fingers and crawled back into bed keeping my head under the covers to warm it up again i shivered in the darkness the capital city and not a single artificial light tommy cholongai had given me an encrypted cdrom with details of what the business was planning for thulahn there would be another allyear road to india a university and a modern wellequipped hospital in thuhn and schools and clinics in the regional capitals wed build a dam in the mountains behind thuhn that would provide hydro power and control the waters that washed over the broad gravelly valley id seen from the airstrip allowing the waters there to be channelled to one side so that a bigger airport could be built one that would take jets big jets during the summer months the hydro plant would produce much more electricity than thuhn would need the surplus would be used to power giant pumps which would force specially salinated water into a huge cavern hollowed out in a mountain high above the dam the idea was that this water wouldnt freeze and in the winter when the main hydro plant was useless this saline solution would flow down through another set of turbines and into another dam so that thuhn would have power all year round all power lines would be underground wherever possible a minimum of disfiguring poles and wires also on offer was a network of tarmac roads connecting the capital with the main towns plus streetlights a water treatment plant drains and a sewage works for thuhn initially with similar improvements scheduled for the regions later the plan was to skip conventional wire or terrestrial microwave telephony entirely and go straight to satellite phones for every village and every important person the footprints of various satellites we controlled would be adjusted to take in thulahn and so provide additional digital web and tvbased information and entertainment channels for those who wanted them then there was the stuff the business intended just for itself a whole network of tunnels and caverns in mount juppala metres a few kilometres northeast of thuhn in the next valley that was where if possible the pwr would go ah yes the pwr at no point in the cdrom was that particular acronym explained even in a cdrom that had serious encryption ran to maybe a dozen copies in the world and was restricted rigidly to those who needed to know it seemed we didnt want to spell out the words pressurised water reactor this was the westinghouse unit wed bought from the pakistanis and had mothballed there was some serious engineering involved in all this basically wed be turning quite a lot of mount juppala into something resembling a swiss cheese a handpicked team of our own engineers and surveyors armed with everything from rock hammers to magnetic and gravitometric arrays had already probed drilled sampled analysed shaken mapped and measured the mountain to within a millimetre of its life only we knew it was three and a half metres higher than the guidebooks and atlases said the cd held several impressive sets of plans drawn up by some of the worlds foremost engineering firms each of whom had carried out feasibility studies on turning this vast lump of rock into a small selfcontained city none of whom however had been told where this mountain actually was it was a big job wed be buying a couple of specially modified antonovs to move all the heavy plant and machinery in we reckoned wed built up a fair knowledgebase concerning heavy engineering in extreme cold thanks to our antarctic base but even so the whole mount juppala project might take a couple of decades just as well we thought longterm was any of this something i wanted to be part of were we doing the right thing in the first place was the whole thulahn venture just a huge act of hubris by billionaires with a bee in their bonnet about having a seat at the un did we have any right to come in here and take over their country in theory we could build our new hq with almost no impact on thulahn there was a contingency plan for building the new airport in the same valley as mount juppala it would mean levelling off a smaller mountain but it was less than had been done for the new hong kong airport and we could afford it doing all we could do undertaking every improvement we were prepared to offer would change the entire country and especially thuhn probably for ever which sounded terrible given how beautiful and unspoiled it was and how happy the people seemed to be but then you looked at the infantmortality rate the lifeexpectancy figures and the numbers who emigrated if we only offered these changesimprovements rather than imposed them how could it be wrong i had no idea at the very least before i decided anything i needed a while here just to start getting the feel of the place this process was due to start tomorrow with a visit to the apparently fearsomely weird queen mother in her own palace further up the valley legend had it she hadnt left her bed for the last twentysix years i curled up under the weight of bedclothes and cupped my still cold hands rubbing them and blowing into them and wondering why staying in bed for as long as humanly possible was considered even remotely weird in thulahn chapter eight you rise with the sun in thulahn the same as any place where artificial light is still a novelty i suppose i woke to find a little fat quilted lady bustling around my room slamming open the window shutters to let in some eyewateringly bright light talking away either to herself or possibly to me and pointing at the washstand where a large gently steaming pitcher now stood beside the inset bowl i was still rubbing my eyes and trying to think of something rude to say like when were your people thinking of inventing the door lock or even the knock when she just bustled straight out again and left me alone and grumpy i washed with the warm water in the bowl there was a bathroom down the end of the hall with a large fireplace in one corner and a rather grand scrolltopped bath on a platform in the middle of the room but it took a lot of waterpitchers to fill it and the palace servants clearly required advance notice to organise both the fire and the water technically my room was en suite if a cubicle the size of a telephone box with the end of a pipe sticking up between two shoeshaped tiles counts as en suite there was real toilet paper but it was miniaturised and unhelpfully shiny i flushed with the water out of the washing bowl breakfast was served in the room by my little fat quilted lady who arrived talking talked as she plonked down the plates and jugs and kept talking as she nodded to me and left i could hear her talking all the way down the hall maybe it was a religious thing i thought the opposite of a vow of silence breakfast consisted of stiff fried pancakes and a bowl of watery porridge i tried a little of each recalled the variety of monotaste beige food from the evening before and was reminded that managing my weight and indeed even losing quite a few pounds in a matter of days had proved remarkably easy the last time id visited thulahn her royal highness is looking forward to meeting you is she thats nice i grabbed a strap and hung on thulahn had cars before it had roads somehow this came as no surprise well it had a car if not in the plural a rollsroyce silver wraith purchased in india by the princes greatgrandfather when he was king it had been dismantled and carried across the mountain paths by teams of sherpas and eventually reassembled in thulahn the following summer there was however nowhere to drive it a point which had perhaps escaped the then king when hed made the purchase at the time a main road in thulahn consisted of a boulderstrewn pathlet wandering along the side of a steep hill with broader bits every now and again where two heavily laden porters or yaks could pass without one knocking the other off the cliff while a principal street in thuhn was basically a shallow v between the randomly sized and sited buildings with a streamcumsewer in the bottom and lots of little paths strung out along the sides as a result the roller sat within the main courtyard of the palace for five years where it was just about possible to run it in a figure of eight providing the wheel was kept at full lock the whole time and the transition from left to right or vice versa was accomplished without undue delay hours of fun for the royal children meanwhile a road of sorts was constructed from the floor of the valley where most of the farms were through thuhn and on up to the glacier foot where the old palace and the more important monasteries clung like particularly determined limpets to the cliffs i was in that car on that road now my driver was langtuhn hemblu the man whod greeted me at the airstrip the day before and given me the rapid guided walking tour of the city and palace before abandoning me to the colourful monks you mustnt worry langtuhn shouted about what why about meeting her royal highness oh all right then well i hadnt been langtuhn caught my eye in the rearview mirror and smiled in what was probably meant to be an encouraging manner as far as i could tell his title was important steward i strongly suspected hed never taken a driving test it wasnt even as though there was no other motorised traffic around any more registered in thuhn alone there were now at least seventeen other cars buses vans and trucks to have collisions with most brought in during the heady days of thulahns motoring golden age between the summer of when a supposedly permanent road had been completed direct from thuhn to the outside world and the spring of when a series of landslides and floods had swept it away again there were a few more roads within the kingdom nowadays and except in the depths of winter when they were blocked by snow or during the monsoon when they tended to get washed away you could drive from thuhn down the valley through various other lower towns then on down the course of the kamalahn river and into sikkim where season permitting you actually had a choice turn left for darjeeling and india or right for lhasa and tibet there was still a track direct from thuhn back over the mountains that almost encircled the capital and which allowed a very determined driver to bring a fourwheel drive in over the passes from india but even that meant sliding the vehicle across in a cradle slung under a wire hawser over the river khunde the roller bounced and lurched i clung on it felt very strange to sit in a car with no seatbelts grabhandles and straps didnt give even the illusion of safety id dressed in as many layers of the clothes id brought with me as i could even so i was glad of the little woodburning stove in one corner of the cars rear compartment this looked like an aftermarket accessory and i doubted the boys at rr would have approved but it helped stop my breath freezing on the windows i made a mental note to buy some warmer clothes in the afternoon assuming i survived that long the road which wound up through the capital consisted of big flat stones laid across one of the main vshaped streetscumstreamscumsewers langtuhn had explained that as there was just the one main road it had been designed to take in as many important buildings as possible en route hence the tortuous nature of the course it took which often involved doubling back on itself and heading downhill again to take in buildings of particular consequence such as the foreign ministry the important consulates this seemed to mean the indian and pakistani compounds an especially popular temple or a muchloved tea house most of the buildings in thuhn were constructed for the first one or two storeys at least from large dark blocks of rough stone the walls were almost vertical but not quite spreading out at the base as though theyd started to melt at some point in the past they generally looked worn but tended and most had freshlooking twotone paint jobs though a few sported patches and friezes of brightly painted plaster depicting scenes from the thulahnese version of hinduisms idea of the spirit world which from the gleeful illustrations of people being impaled on giant stakes eaten by demons torn to pieces by giant birds sodomised by leering prodigiously endowed yakminotaurs and skinned alive by grinning dragons wielding giant adzes looked like the sort of place the marquis de sade would have felt thoroughly at home in the top storeys were made of wood pierced by small windows painted in bright primary colours and strewn with long prayer flags twisting sinuously in the wind we skidded round a corner and the wraiths engine laboured to propel us up the steep slope people ambled or jumped out of the way depending on how soon they heard us coming as we rumbled and bounced across the uneven flagstones oh i have your book langtuhn said please here what book i reached out to the opening in the glass partition and accepted a small dogeared paperback with a twocolour cover the book you left on your last visit oh yes a guide to thulahn the cover said id picked it up in dacca airport four years earlier and vaguely recalled leaving it in my room in the grand imperial tea room and resting house a sort of deglorified youth hostel which had been my base the last time id been here i remembered thinking at the time that i had never encountered a book with so many misprints mistakes and misspellings as quickly as i could without taking my gloves off i flicked to the works notoriously unreliable top tips and handey phrases section and looked up the thulahnese for thank you khumtal i said gumpo langtuhn said with a big smile i had the worrying feeling that this was the sixth marx brother but it turned out to mean youre welcome we cleared the city the road stopped twisting wildly at random and started twisting wildly at regular intervals zigzagging steeply up the boulderlittered side of the mountain dotted along the roadside amongst the houses were more tall masts prayer flags squat stone bellshaped stupas and thin wooden prayer windmills their sails painted with dense passages of holy script the houses themselves were sporadically spaced turfroofed and from a distance easily mistaken for piles of stones people walking downhill under dripping small but heavylooking packs or trudging uphill under huge and heavylooking bundles of wood or dung stopped and waved at us i waved back cheerfully do you yet know how long you will be staying with us ms telman langtuhn shouted back im still not sure probably just a few days only a few days yes oh dear but then you might not meet the prince really oh what a shame why when is he due back not for a week or thereabouts i am told oh well not to worry eh he will be most disappointed im sure really you cannot stay any longer i doubt it that is a shame i suspect he cannot come home any earlier he has been away on business looking after all our interests has he now yes i understand he has said that soon we may all start to benefit from greater outside investment that will be good will it not i dare say though of course he is in paris or some such french place we must hope he does not gamble it all away is the prince a gambler i asked id watched him at the blackjack table in blysecrag if he was a gambler he wasnt a very good one oh no langtuhn said and took both hands off the steering wheel to wave them as he looked back at me i was making a joke our prince enjoys himself but he is most responsible yes good i sat back in my seat well not a despot then the road grew tired with making wild zigzags up an increasingly steep slope and struck out ambitiously along a notch cut in a vertical cliff a hundred metres below the river lay frozen in the bottom of the gorge like a giant icicle fallen and shattered amongst the sharp black rocks langtuhn didnt seem to have noticed the transition from a steepbutordinary road to a slotinacliff he kept trying to catch my eye in the rearview mirror we have been hoping that one day the prince would come back from paris with a lady who might become his new wife he told me no luck yet i looked away hoping this might encourage him to return his attention to the business of keeping the car on the narrow road the view down into the chasm was not an encouraging one none whatsoever there was a princess from bhutan he seemed most sweet upon a few years ago they say but she married a taxconsulting gentleman from los angeles usa smart girl oh i do not think so she could have been a queen hmm i rubbed the red tip of my nose with one gloved hand and looked in my guidebook for the word for frostbite the old palace canted out over a deep icechoked gorge a mile down from the glacier foot its haphazard jumble of offwhite blackwindowed buildings supported from beneath by a halfdozen enormous charcoaldark timbers each the size of a giant redwood together they splayed out from a single jagged spur of rock far below so that the whole ramshackle edifice looked like a pile of ivory dice clutched in a gigantic ebony hand this was where the dowager queen lived the princes mother even higher up the mountainside at the head of tumultuously zigzag paths monasteries lay straggled across the precipitous slopes in long encrusted lines of brightly painted buildings we passed a few groups of saffronrobed monks on the road they stopped and looked at the car some bowed and i bowed back langtuhn parked the car in a dusty courtyard a couple of small thulahnese ladiesinwaiting in dramatic carmine robes met us at the doors and led us into the dark spaces of the palace through clouds of incense to the old throne room you will remember to address the queen as maam or your royal highness wont you langtuhn whispered to me as we approached dont worry guarding the doors was a massively rotund chinese man who wore camouflaged blackgreywhite army fatigues and a jacket made of what looked like yak fur he was sitting in a chair reading a manga comic when we approached he looked up and rose carefully taking a pair of minuscule glasses off his nose and leaving the comic open on his seat this is mihu langtuhn whispered to me the queens manservant chinese very devoted mihu moved in front of the double doors barring the way to the queens chamber the two ladiesinwaiting bowed and spoke to him in slowerthannormal thulahnese while gesturing at me he nodded and opened the doors langtuhn had to stay in the antechamber with the two ladies mihu came into the room with me and stood with his back to the door i looked around i hadnt really believed that the dowager queen had stayed in bed for the last two and a half decades since the death of her husband but then i hadnt seen the bed the ceiling of the huge state room was painted like the night sky its two longer walls were lined by bizarrely proportioned sculptures of snarling warriors two storeys tall these were covered in gold leaf which had started to peel so that the sootblack wood underneath showed through like dense sable skin under flimsy gold armour tissuelight the strips and tatters of glittering leaf waved in the faint draughts that swirled through the vast room setting up a strange halfheard rustling as though hidden legions of mice were all crumpling lilliputian sweetwrappers at once snowwhite daylight spilled in from the wall of windows which looked across a terrace to the valley its glare glittered back from the rustling scraps of gold like ten thousand cold and tiny flames spread out across the walls the bed sat in the centre a painted wooden construction for which the term fourposter was entirely inadequate i had seen houses smaller than this it took three tall steps just to get level with the base from there more steps led up through lush velvet drapes and heavy brocade hangings to the surface of the bed while from the cantilevered canopy a network of dyed ropes and loops of printed silk hung like a profusion of jungle creepers big bed big bedspread a vast embroidered purple cover stretched from each corner and edge of the bed rising like a perfect mount fuji of lilac to its central summit where the queen mothers head pale and surrounded by ringlets of white hair stuck out of a hole in the middle like a snowy summit from the angle of her head it was hard to tell whether she was lying sitting or standing i imagined it was perfectly possible to do all three in there according to langtuhn the queen mother didnt even have to stay inside if she didnt want to the whole bed was mounted on trolley wheels running on rails leading to the tall wide set of double doors set in the westfacing wall of windows beyond which lay the wide balcony with the view over the valley below trundling the whole apparatus out to the sunlight would be a task for mihu i imagined with the bed out there and the beds canopy rolled back the old lady could get a breath of fresh air and take the sun there was nowhere to sit so i stood facing the foot of the bed the little snowball head about a metre higher than me in the centre of the bed spoke miss telman her voice was thin but still strong the queen mother spoke excellent english because she was she had been the honourable lady audrey illsey until shed married the late king in ms yes maam what i prefer the title ms rather than miss your highness are you married no ma then you are a miss i think well i said wishing now that for once i had shut the hell up about the msmiss thing theres been a change in the way people relate to each other your highness in my generation some of us decided to take the title ms as a direct equivalent of mr to i dont need lessons in recent history young woman im not stupid or senile i have heard of feminism you know oh have you i thought perhaps there was a commotion in one side of the slope of the mauve hillside of bedcover just down from where the dowager queens right shoulder must be as though a volcanic sidevent was about to erupt after some flapping and muttering a small white hand appeared from an embroidered slit in the cover clutching a rolledup magazine a thin arm clad in lacy white waved hand and magazine i can read miss telman she told me the post may take a while but subscriptions do arrive eventually i am rarely more than a month behind the times another thin white arm appeared from the bedclothes she opened the magazine out there you are last months country life i dont suppose you take it do you you sound rather american i have met one or two us citizens who subscribe to the magazine maam however i am not one of them so you are american im british scottish by birth i have dual britishus nationality i see well i dont see really i dont see how one can be of dual nationality apart from purely legally both arms and the magazine disappeared under the covers again i mean to say who are you loyal to loyal to your highness yes are you loyal to the queen or tothe american flag or are you one of these absurd scottish nationalists im more of an internationalist maam and whats that supposed to mean it means my loyalties are contingent your highness contingent she blinked rapidly looking confused upon what behaviour maam i have always thought that believing in ones country right or wrong was at best sadly misguided oh you have have you i must say you are a very opinionated young woman thank you maam i watched her eyes narrow one arm reappeared with a pair of glasses through which she surveyed me come closer she said then added if you please i stepped up to the base of the giant bed there was a strong smell of incense and mothballs the fluttering scraps of gold leaf on the walls set up a distracting shimmer on either side the queen brought out a white handkerchief and polished her glasses with it you have met my son yes maam what do you think of him i think he is a credit to you your highness he is charming andresponsible responsible ha either you know nothing or youre one of the useless ones one of the lying ones the ones who say what they think i want to hear perhaps youre confusing lying with politeness maam what well i dont really know your son all that well your highness as far as i can tell he seems a gentleman wellbred politeoh and a very good dancer great poise and extremely light on his feet the queens brows furrowed at this so i didnt continue with the topic ah he seems sad sometimes and he is a little flirtatious perhaps but not rudely or aggressively so i thought back to what langtuhn had said in the car he doesnt seem to be too extravagant which is always a good thing in a prince i think especially when they are away from home ah i said struggling to end on a positive note and failing i suspect the responsibilities of his inheritance lie heavily on him the old queen shook her head as though to dismiss all this when is he going to get married thats what i want to know im afraid i cant help you there maam not many can young lady do you have any idea how few princesses there are in the world these days or even duchesses or ladies i have no idea maam of course you wouldnt youre just a commoner you are just a commoner arent you i have to confess that any position ive achieved has been attained through merit and hard work maam so yes im afraid so dont flaunt your inverted snobbery at me young woman im not usually given to flaunting maam perhaps its the altitude and dont be downright cheeky either i cant imagine whats come over me maam you are a very disrespectful and impertinent girl i did not mean to be disrespectful your highness is it so terrible for a mother to worry about her son not at all maam it would be terrible not to i think it would indeed hmm do you think hes marriageable material well of course your highness im sure he will make some lucky princess or lady a wonderful husband platitudes miss telman that is the sort of thing my courtiers tell me i wondered if mihu and the two little redclad ladies counted as her courtiers the palace had seemed quite empty apart from them i cleared my throat and said he is your son maam even if i thought hed make an absolutely awful husband id be unlikely to say so right out without at least softening the blow a little the queen mother sounded exasperated then just tell me what you feel hell probably be fine maam if he marries the right person isnt that all one can say of anybody he is not just anybody any mother would say the same maam yes and it would be sentimentality motherly instinct or whatever you want to call it suvinder is heir to a throne your highness im not sure how much help i can really be to you in this im not married i dont expect to marry and so i dont tend to think in those terms plus i dont know your son or the international royalmatrimony circuit well enough to comment hmm the queen put her glasses away again why are you here miss telman i thought i had been summoned your highness i meant here in thulahn you idiot then she sighed and her eyelids fluttered closed for a moment i beg your pardon miss telman i should not have called you an idiot do forgive me of course maam i am here in thulahn to decide whether i ought to accept a post which will mean coming here to live yes you are one of these mysterious business people my son talks about in such admiring tones who are you really are you the mafia i smiled no maam we are a commercial concern not a criminal one my son says that you want to invest what sound to me like most unlikely amounts of money in our country whats in it for you wed like to use thulahn as a sort of base your highness i said trying to choose my words with care wed hope that we might be welcomed by your people and that some of us might become citizens there would be more trade and more dealings in general with other countries thanks to the improvements and investments wed like to offer and so we hope and we think it would be appropriate that some us might be allowed certain diplomatic posts so that we could represent thulahn abroad youre not backed by those bloody chinese are you i wondered if mihu still standing by the door understood english no maam were not backed by anybody in the way i think you mean if anything i thought we were the ones who tended to do the backing hmm well it all sounds jolly fishy to me we mean only to help thulahn your highness the improvements to the infrastructure and so on would be offered not family faith farms and fealty the dowager queen said releasing one arm to wag a finger at me i beg your pardon maam you heard thats what matters to these people those four things nothing else everything else is irrelevant well perhaps better water supplies a few more primary schools more primary health care too and they have water no one dies of thirst they have all the education they need do you need a degree to walk behind a plough no and health it will always be hard to live here its no place for the weak we all have to die young woman better to work hard accept the consolation of ones faith and then go quickly all this hanging arounds just vulgar people are so greedy these days accept your lot and dont insist on extending the misery of those whod be better off dead there thats what i believe oh and you neednt try to hide your feelings i know what youre thinking well for your information i have not seen a doctor since i took to my bed and i will not in the future no matter what ive been waiting to die for a quarter of a century miss telman i believe the good lord is keeping me alive for his own good reasons and so i shant hasten the process of dying but i shant do anything to delay it either once it begins i nodded thats very stoic of you maam i hope anybody would respect your choice yes she said slowly suspiciously but ithink it would only be right to offer the thulahnese people a choice as well a choice of what will they want television burger bars jobs in factories and supermarkets salaries in offices motor cars they will doubtless choose all that if theyre offered it and before you know it we will be just the same as everywhere else and well have homosexuals aids socialists drugdealers prostitutes and muggers that will be progress wont it miss telman by now even i was beginning to suspect that there was no point in continuing this argument i said im sorry you feel that way your highness are you are you really try telling the truth i am truly the queen looked down at me for a while then she nodded she leaned fractionally towards me it is a hateful thing to grow old miss telman it is not an enjoyable process and it will come to you one day i dont doubt you think me an appalling old reactionary but there is this consolation for me that there may not be for you i will be glad to leave this stupid hurtful degrading world she straightened again thank you for coming to see me i am tired now goodbye mihu i turned round to see the big chinese man silently opening the doors for me i looked back to say goodbye to the queen but she had closed her eyes and her head had drooped as though she had been a marionette in a fairground booth all the time and now my money had run out i took a last look round the strange room with its glittering whispering walls of flaking leaf over black wooden flesh then turned and left langtuhn hemblu almost had to run to keep up with me as i strode back to the car my you had quite a long time with the queen mother did i yes you are very privileged isnt she a treasure oh yes a treasure i said pity shes not buried i thought when i got back to my room in the palace at thuhn all my stuff had gone i stood in the doorway and looked around the little cot bed in the alcove had been made up the cupboard where id hung my suit carrier and clothes was open and empty the satellite phone my computer my toiletries all gone the little table by the bed had been cleared too my netsuke monkey had disappeared with everything else a swimmy sort of feeling came over me no phone no contact just what i stood up in in my pockets a billfold and two shiny discs had i been robbed id assumed this was one of those places where you didnt need to lock anything and that was why there was no way of securing the room door but then how much were the satellite phone and the thinkpad worth compared to what the average person here made in a year maybe somebody had been just too tempted and i too careless or had i made that bad an impression on the queen mother was this some sort of instant revenge of hers for speaking back to her i turned to try and find somebody to help and heard a voice in the distance coming closer the little quilted lady who didnt stop talking appeared at the end of the corridor she came up took my hand and still talking led me off to another part of the palace the door had a lock the floor was carpeted my suit carrier hung in a wardrobe that could have come out of a holiday inn the window was a tripleglazed sealed unit under the window was a radiator plumbed into pipes which disappeared discreetly through the carpet the bed was a standard double with ordinary pillows the netsuke monkey had been placed alongside my flashlight on the bedside table the computer and satellite phone sat on a little writing table with a mirror over it through an open door i could see a tiled bathroom with a shower and glory be a bidet still no tv mind you the little quilted lady bowed and left talking there was a business card on the writing table beside the sat phone joshua levitsen honorary us consul would like to meet me tomorrow he suggested breakfasting at the heavenly luck tea house at eight i went to the window same view a storey higher the room was warm a faint thermal was drifting up from the radiator i turned it off and tilted the heavy window open my email included a plaintive note from dwight litton reminding me that i was missing the première of his broadway play i didnt bother to reply how you doin that line work on all the girls so they say i wouldnt know no of course not stephen so how is shangrila cool think you might want to stay too early to tell yet saw the queen today a character ill tell you about it later you wont believe ive been moved within the palace from a rather spartan but characterful room to something that looks like its been filched wholesale from the nearest ramada hows things with you fine working on a big restructuring exercise for two of the biochemical multis also taking part in mostly email discussions about mai fallout domestically looking after bambinos while emma visits old girlfriend in bostonhello kate you still there sorry sorry for the hiatus some sort of glitch at this end had to reconnect i awoke breathless again where was i where had i been i couldnt even remember what the original problem had been what slight or remark what insult or minor injury had occasioned the incident all i remembered was that i had gone to mrs telman for comfort and received a strange sort of it she held me i sobbed into her bosom it was probably a very expensive blouse i was soaking with my tears but at least i was too young to be allowed to wear mascara the marks of my fury and despair would soon dry and leave no mark we were in the hotel in vevey where mrs telman stayed whenever she came to visit me at the international school lac léman was a dark presence in the night its whiteflecked surface visible by moonlight between the wintry showers that fell upon the waters from the mountains i was fourteen or fifteen young enough still to need to be held sometimes old enough to be troubled by even ashamed of such a need she smelled of the exotic perfumes i remembered from her car six years earlier but its not fair life is not kathryn youre always saying that when it stops being true ill stop saying it but it should be fair of course it should well then why cant it be why cant we all live in palaces and never have to work why cant we all be happy and never have to cry i dont know i said defiantly id begun to get used to this sort of rhetorical defence why cant we mrs telman smiled and offered me her handkerchief there are two schools of thought i rolled my eyes dramatically she ignored me and went on some people will tell you that we can never have true fairness or justice or happiness or freedom from having to work we are sinners and we deserve no better anyway however if we do as were told we may achieve perfect happiness for ever after our own death that is one point of view another is that we may begin to attain all those goals in this world if we apply ourselves even if the final fulfilment of those dreams will certainly take place after our own death i prefer the second outlook though i accept i could be wrong but kathryn in the meantime you must understand that the world is not fair that it does not owe you a living or even an apology that you have no right to expect happiness and that all too often the world can seem like a mad bad place to be when people behave rationally kindly generously and lovingly towards you or those you care about be grateful appreciate it and make the most of it at the time because it is not necessarily the normal way of things at all reason kindness generosity and love can seem like very rare resources indeed so make the most of them while they are around i just dont know why people have to be horrible to other people kathryn unless you are a saint you must know but i dont you mean youve never been horrible to anyone never teased other girls never been unkind never been secretly delighted when something bad happened to somebody you dont like or are you going to tell me theres nobody you dont like but they were horrible to me first and they probably thought they had their reasons youre very clever some people resent clever people they think theyre showing off whats wrong with being clever i asked indignantly a lot if youre not a very clever person yourself and you feel that a clever person is showing off or trying to make you look stupid its like a strong person showing off how strong they are but i dont care if people are strong they can show off how strong they are as much as they like i wont care ah yes but then youre clever but thats not i did not say the word fair i balled the handkerchief she had given me in my hand and thudded my head against her chest again thats not right i said lamely its right to them she held me and patted me on the back and thats all that matters to themselves people are usually right i felt for the bedside table i was in thulahn in thuhn in the royal palace i found the little monkey and rubbed it between my fingers in my dream the old queen had been a cross between one of the demonwarriors that guarded her bedchamber and the netsuke monkey that guarded my bedside there was some sort of fading thing about monkey guards my subconscious had probably filched from the wizard of oz but it was all already pretty vague and strange and just not of this world in my dream i had been trapped inside a dark cold palace carved within a mountain it was full of smoke and i had been stumbling around trying to find the queen but then id been chased through the fumefilled halls bysomething or a lot of somethings i could hear them whispering but i couldnt make out what they were saying because somebody had pulled out half their teeth they kept the removed teeth in little pouches on their belts where the teeth clicked and rattled in a jittery accompaniment to their lisping voices whatever they were i knew that if they touched me there was something in their touch in their sweat that would burn and burrow down to my bones and poison me and make me one of them dark wraiths of pain consigned to wander the hollowedout palace for ever they could run faster than me but there was some sort of rule or some sort of effect or gift that i had that meant they couldnt bear the gaze of my eyes and so i had to run backwards keeping them always one corner or room or corridor or door behind and running backwards had been slow and difficult and scary because i couldnt be sure that there werent any of them behind me too lying in wait for me to run backwards into them and so i had to keep glancing over my shoulder to make certain and that gave the ones i was running away from in the first place a chance to catch up all the time i kept shouting its not fair its not fair its not fair while my feet clattered in the silence of the shadowy halls the dream ended unresolved before they could catch me or i could finally make my escape to the world outside i awoke remembering my meeting with the queen and the words of mrs telman and needing to touch the little monkey which was my guardian just to know that it was what it was something inanimate and fixed and incapable of malice or love but if anything something on my side as well as by it something made reassuring just by its familiarity and talismanic by the illusory fidelity gained through the long continuity of its presence chapter nine id shopped in the afternoon picking up a trail of small pillowchildren whod seemed determined to follow me everywhere as soon as id stepped outside the palace gate the last time id been here shopping in thulahn meant forgetting about credit cards and using cash luckily i thought id remembered this and brought vast amounts of us dollars from karachi only to discover that some of the more uptodate retailers in the capital did now take plastic the main foreigners outfitters in thulahn was the wildness emporium a huge stone barn of a place which smelled of kerosene and was full of very expensive western hiking and climbing gear it was run by two turbaned sikhs whod looked like they were fed up explaining that no it wasnt meant to read the wilderness emporium id picked up a very thick and muchpocketed mountaineering jacket in yellow and black a matching pair of insulated dungarees and another set of padded thermal trousers in vivid red id also bought a pair of nononsense hiking boots that looked like old timberlands but had less fiddly laces that went through hooks instead of eyes at the top a complicated multicoloured hat with ear flaps velcro chin flaps and an adjustable peak and a pair of stiff black skigloves with drawstrung gauntlet extensions that came up to my elbows a fleece in aquamarine a couple of pairs of thick socks and two sets of vests and long johns completed my new wardrobe the two sikhs brothers as it turned out once wed got talking had happily relieved me of a bothersomely bulky wad of bills and urged me to come again anytime id staggered into the street wearing some of this gear and carrying the rest and been mobbed by children once more theyd insisted on helping me carry my stuff heading back up to the palace id taken a different route and discovered a shop that sold native thulahnese gear so we stopped off there and left with a gorgeous black fur hat i felt only a little guilty about buying a matching hand muff a pair of black hide boots with fur on the inside and fiftymillimetrethick soles made from layers of auto tyres which makes them sound horrible but actually they were beautifully stitched and finished a little satin jacket with mandala designs and a long red quilted jacket with matching trousers and all for not very much money at all really in fact for so little that id tried to leave a tip but the old thulahnese couple who owned the place had just looked mystified id felt so bad id taken another turn round the stock and come back to the counter with the most expensivelooking thing i could find and trust me im good at spotting this sort of thing a long slim silk and satin jacket jet black with gold and red dragons sewn into it delicately quilted and sparkling with gold thread seeing what id selected the old couple had made a show of having synchronised heartattacks puffing out their cheeks and shaking their heads and bustling amongst the racks to bring me much cheaper jackets that were almost as nice but id clutched the one id chosen to my breast and refused to let it go regardless of all cajolings and remonstrations until eventually with much puffing and shaking and handwaving id been allowed to buy this beautiful beautiful thing for well still not very much money the only thing i forgot to buy was a big bag or rucksack to carry it all back in usually i remember to do this when ive made a lot of purchases abroad but for the children id have needed a wheelbarrow to take all my new clothes back to the palace i didnt know whether to offer them money or not and in the end theyd just left me at the gates with lots of bowing and smiles and nervous giggles i confess that i had briefly worried that one of my bags might not make it all the way back with me or that something would disappear from one of them and so felt quite utterly mortified when in my room after checking the bags were all there i opened them up and discovered that not only did they contain everything id bought several of them held more little homemade sweets and savouries wrapped in carefully folded greaseproof paper and tied with ribbon and tiny artificial flowers made from wire and cut silk the weather early the next morning was appalling a furious snowstorm whirled outside my triple glazing i could hear it through the glass through the stone walls i had mixed feelings about this sort of weather it would make getting around difficult but on the other hand it might hold off the prince for another day or two at least it hadnt stopped the palace generator from working electric power hot water and a working hairdryer i treated myself to my second shower in twelve hours lost myself within the comforting hum of the hairdryer then hesitated when it came to dressing western or ethnic i chose western so pulled on the dungarees seriously pocketed jacket and fake timbies and plonked the complicated hat upon my head as an afterthought just before i left the room i stuck one of the little wire and silk flowers in the velcro fastening of one of the jackets pockets by the time i was squeaking through the snow in the main courtyard the weather had abated somewhat the wind had dropped and only a few flakes were falling though the mass of cloud above the valley looked low and dark and heavy with more snow children met me at the gates again appearing from every direction to my shame i realised i had no idea if they were the same ones as yesterday or not it was time to stop treating them as a mass i guessed i hunkered down and smiled and started trying to find out names me kathryn i said pointing at myself kathrin they giggled and looked down and snorted and shuffled their feet eventually i worked out what i hoped were a few of their names and got them to understand i wanted to go to the heavenly luck tea house i tied a few pointy hats on properly and wiped a couple of snotty noses with a paper handkerchief i stood up took two of the offered chubby little hands and we tramped downhill through the snow ms telman hi josh levitsen how do you do we shook hands mr levitsen was not what id been expecting at all he was young though his tan skin was deeply lined he was fullbearded blond and wore a slightly grubby fawn parka with a matted fur hood lining and a pair of leathersided circular mountaineering glasses with surfaces like oil on water fine just fine you having breakfast ive got tea here for both of us the heavenly luck tea house was within a skyed penalty shot of the football fieldairstrip with a view over that and the snowfilled valley it was warm and steamy and full of people mostly thulahnese polished wood was everywhere and the floorboards creaked like a swamp full of demented frogs what do you recommend rikur saraut champe and thuuk whats that corn pancakes they keep syrup behind the counter just for me and my guests porridge and thick noodle soup kampa spicy if you like perhaps a very little of each im not terribly hungry he nodded waved one arm and shouted the order he poured us both some strong tea into cups with no handles but little ceramic tops we exchanged a few pleasantries and agreed to use first names before he sat forward and lowered his voice a little just to let you know kate i used to be with the company the cia i asked quietly he grinned yeah but now im with the business he lowered his glasses to wink i see this had of course been mentioned in the cdrom tommy cholongai had given me mr levitsen wasnt actually an employee of ours but we did pay him quite a lot of money and he had a vague idea that we were interested in the place for more than the odd diplomatic passport you let me know if i can be of any help he spread his arms wide i am at your disposal kate i have a lot of contacts smoke he pulled a little painted tin from one pocket of the grubby parka and took out a slim handrolled cigarette no thank you mind if i do i glanced round at the counter i take it youre not expecting the quickest of service ten fifteen minutes on a good day he lit the rollup with a zippo some smoke rolled across the table not a cigarette then a joint he must have seen me sniff you sure he asked through a smokewreathed grin a little early in the day for me i told him he nodded heard you saw the old lady yesterday the queen mother yes is that a weird fucking setup or what weird just about covers it she say anything about the prince she wanted my opinion on his marriageability yeah shes been talking about that a lot recently do you visit her often na just been the once when i first got posted here three years ago but like i say i got contacts everywhere above the oilonwater glasses his sunbleached eyebrows arched so whats happening with the business here i keep getting hints theres some sort of major shit coming down or maybe not shit maybe more like major manna coming down you know he pulled the mountaineering glasses down again and gave me what could almost have been a leer you part of that bet you cant tell me even if you are right but youre here and youre what a level three yeah best looking lthree ive ever seen by the way uh hope you dont mind me saying so no im flattered so whats happening he leaned closer again what was all that stuff out on juppala last year and down on the valley floor here and upstream all that laser rangefinding and drilling and surveying shit whats all that about infrastructure improvements i said on mount juppala you kidding me i sipped my tea yes he laughed you arent going to tell me a damn thing are you kate no so why did they send you why do you think anybody sent me im on sabbatical i can go where i like weird time of year for a holiday a sabbatical isnt a holiday so why did you come to see what the place is like at this time of year but why why not he sat back shaking his head he attached a roach clip to the remains of the joint and sucked hard brows knotted with either concentration or the sharpness of the hot smoke whatever he said on an indrawn breath on top of what hed already smoked he pinched the roach out and left it folded in the teacups saucer so where do you want to go when whenever i got a jeep get places langtuhns limo wont anywhere you want to go let me know thats very kind i may take you up on that are you free this afternoon sure where to youre the local knowledge suggest somewhere well theres ahhah hey that was quick heres breakfast uncle freddy kate dear girl you made it to thulahn then yes yes managed to avoid the prayer flags been having a look round done the palace and bits of the city seen the old queen and

worry heard shed gone a bit batty actually if not totally gaga how did she seem to you eccentric in that sort of feral way that old english ladies go sometimes probably the altitude probably who was your guide if the prince isnt back the honorary us consul youngish chap secondgeneration hippie secured me a breakfast that was surprisingly edible and then took me down to joitem in his jeep its a bit like thuhn except lower down and flatter and surrounded by rhododendron bushes visited an abandoned monastery saw a few farms and prayer windmills nearly skidded off the road into ravines a few times that sort of thing sounds terribly exciting and you ive tried you a few times and you never seem to be in oh just faffing about as usual driving you should get a mobile what one of those things you hang above cots no freddy a phone pah and disturb a good drive by having a phone go off in my ear i should cocoa the skies were clear the next day though confusingly for me and probably no one else in thuhn snow swirled everywhere for a few hours beneath that cloudlessness a stiff freezing wind blasted down from the mountains and across the city and the palace and seemed to scour most of the snow away brushing it off down the valley in tall white dragging shrouds and gathering it into huge drifts beneath the rivers steeper banks josh levitsen had warned me about wind chill the day before and anyway this wasnt the first time id been in a cold place i made sure i had a scarf over my mouth and nose when i went out dressed in western gear again but even so the ferocity of the chill was stunning the children were nowhere to be seen the city seemed deserted my eyes watered in the icy blast and the tears froze almost instantly on my skin i had to keep turning and bending and brushing drops of salty ice away and rubbing feeling back into my cheeks i pulled the scarf up higher and eventually found my way down to the wildness emporium where the sikh brothers fussed over me and poured me warm paurke tea with roasted barley flour and sugar in it it tasted much better than it should have there also i bought a polarised ski mask for my eyes and a blue neoprene thing that fitted over the rest of my lower face and made me look a little like hannibal lecter but which was much more effective than the scarf suitably kitted up with not a square centimetre of bare skin left exposed to the elements i left the brothers happily counting even more of my dollars and set off into the wind again people were keeping indoors it was the best time to see the city just as a set of buildings and the spaces in between them i walked all over it until hunger and chance brought me within sniffing distance of the heavenly luck tea house around lunch time and then sat extremities tingling tucking into dhal bhut sticky rice with lentil soup poured over it and jakpak kampa spicy stew with mystery meat a watery yoghurt called dhai pretty similar to a plain lassi washed it all down the other diners all seriously quilted mostly male some still wearing pointy hats laughed and grinned and talked at me in machinegun thulahnese and i just grinned like an idiot and laughed when they laughed and made dumb faces and fanned my mouth in what was apparently a quite hilarious manner when i bit on a chilli in the stew and nodded and shrugged and mugged and whistled and just generally behaved like a complete cretin for about forty minutes and then finally left the place with a huge smile on my face under the blue neoprene hannibal lecter mask feeling full content and warm as well as perfectly blissfully happy and with the sense that id just spent one of the most pleasantly communicative and lifeaffirming lunches id ever experienced kathryn mr hazleton you are well i hope im fine and your stay in thulahn is that going well very well ive never been would you recommend a visit that depends on your tastes mr hazleton its fine if you like lots of mountains and snow you dont sound very enamoured of the place kathryn i like lots of mountains and snow i see i was wondering i was trying to decide whether youd decided trying to make up my mind whether you had made up your mind or not uhhuh youre being very reticent kathryn am i is there somebody else there in the room with you no youre upset with me arent you upset mr hazleton kathryn i do hope you believe me when i say i had nothing to do with the contents of that disc it came into my possession and i confess i thought to turn it to my advantage but what else was i supposed to do kathryn if im wasting my time with this call tell me and ill hang up perhaps we can talk again later what was the purpose of your call mr hazleton i wanted to know if youd come to a decision regarding the contents of the disc i had delivered to you have you decided to do nothing or are you still mulling it over oh im mulling mulling away furiously here are you kathryn would i lie to you mr hazleton i imagine you would if you thought it was the right thing to do kathryn well im still thinking the problem hasnt gone away im afraid right now even as we speak mrs buzetski is boston shes in boston and shes not really visiting an old school chum at all ah you know you must have spoken to stephen how is he do you think he suspects anything yet im sure i couldnt say mr hazleton id better go kathryn give my regards to the prince when he gets there will you in the late afternoon langtuhn hemblu appeared and announced he was to take me to the foreign ministry for the formalities to be completed i was to bring my passport i asked him to wait and changed into my ethnic clothes then we took the roller a short distance down into the crowded city to a squat building with plainpainted walls i was shown into a large room where a bulbously tiled cylindrical stove in one corner radiated heat and four young yellowrobed clerks perched on high stools behind tall desks all four stared at me and then put their heads down and scribbled furiously when a tall bald orangerobed man appeared from a door to one side of the big stove announced he was called shlahm thivelu senior immigration officer and invited me into his office we sat on either side of an impressive desk topped by a curved gallery holding lots of compartments containing rolledup documents mr thivelu put on a dainty pair of glasses and inspected both my passports as though hed only ever seen one or two such odd documents before the last time id been here id gone through immigration control and customs in the arrivals hall at the airfield this had consisted of ducking through the cargo door of the crashed dakota giving my name to an adolescent sitting behind a tiny rickety desk and shaking his hand obviously things had become a lot more formal since then mr thivelu nodded searched about the desk for a while muttered something about a damned stamp then shrugged and wrote something into my uk passport before handing both back and wishing me a pleasant stay as i stepped out of the ministry i looked at what he had written hed printed the date and welcome to thulahn langtuhn held the rollers door open for me he was smiling widely you look happy i said as we set off back up the hill oh yes ms telman langtuhn said his face positively radiating happiness from the rearview mirror his holiness the prince will now be returning tomorrow yes unfortunately im not sure what i jerked forward in my seat tomorrow id thought id have at least three more days here before having to worry about suvinder showing up yes isnt that wonderful news now you will get to see him after all he too will be happy to see you im sure yes yes i expect he will i watched the wildness emporium slide past one of the sikh brothers saw me he smiled and waved enthusiastically i waved back feebly i couldnt even get the plane out it had been and gone again since id arrived and tomorrows inbound flight bringing the prince was the next one the alternative to flying was finding some motorised transport and taking the long road north and west and eventually south and back to india days of hairraising travel and nights in dubious resthouses from what id heard or i could hike straight out if the passes were open which was unlikely at this time of year id done some trekking in nepal in my early twenties so i wasnt totally inexperienced but i wasnt hill fit either or that young any more anyway i supposed it would look terribly rude what brings the prince back so early i asked we do not know langtuhn admitted hauling the ancient car straight as we passed a butchers and skidded on a patch of what looked like chicken entrails he laughed perhaps he has run out of money in the paris casino ha ha i said i sat back suvinder oh well maybe having the prince here wouldnt be so terrible he wasnt that difficult a guy to deal with and he would i assumed make it even easier for me to travel round the country and gain access to well whatever i needed to gain access to so not such a bad thing after all look on the bright side i told myself the prince arrived back the following morning what seemed like most of thuhn turned out to watch the plane land it was another clear but bitingly cold day though the wind was barely more than a breeze langtuhn hemblu wearing a slightly threadbare chauffeurs outfit which was a size or two too big for him and which included tall boots jodhpurs and a peaked grey cap drove me down to the airfield in the rollsroyce but explained apologetically that i would have to make my own way back to the palace as the car would be required by the prince and his entourage i told him this was fine by me and joined the crowd on the banking above the football pitchairfield like everybody else theyd removed the far set of goalposts i noticed some of my little pillow friends appeared dulsung graumo and pokuhm if id got their names right and we stood together though they couldnt see very well over all the adults in front dulsung was the smallest so i lifted her on to my shoulders she giggled and slapped a pair of sticky hands on to my forehead below my black fur hat the two boys looked up enviously at her put their pointyhatted heads together and conferred for a moment then each tugged at the nearest pair of quilted trousers pointed meaningfully up at dulsung and after some teasing were duly hoisted on to neighbouring sets of shoulders everybody else seemed to see the plane before me people started pointing and a few cheers rang out then i saw the tiny scrap of metal against the greyblack rocks of the mountains high above and away to one side its dark shadow flickering over ridges and gullies as it tipped and fell towards us it looked about the size of a small bird of prey the sound of its engines was still lost in the spaces between the mountains i looked up towards dulsung pointed at the aircraft and said aeroplane roplane the plane raced down wheeling and stooping through the winds no longer making straight for us but heading diagonally across the sky above the icechoked gorge it curved out to one side of the city turned sharply over the gravel beds in the valley downstream and came flying back straight towards us the wind i realised must be in the opposite direction from when id landed the squaresectioned hunchedlooking craft seemed almost static in the air the drone of its engines audible now the plane jiggled riding waves of wind and shaking its wings as though it was shrugging it seemed to be about to overshoot and go round again then it dipped suddenly and flared wheels smacking the far end of the field in a cloud of dust and gravel with a thud just about where the goalposts would have been everybody seemed to take this as a cue to start clapping even dulsung removed her hands from my forehead to slap them together a few times over this racket the planes engine note had changed and swelled and the machine seemed to bow compressing the nose wheels landing gear as it rushed towards us with a swirling greybrown cloud rising behind it i could see the two pilots in their seats i got ready to run the engines screamed the whole plane shuddered and slowed and then it turned tipping slightly and skidding to a halt still not quite into the nearer penalty box and a good fifty metres away from where i stood i joined enthusiastically in the applause while the cockpit window slid open and a thulahnese flag on a stick was jammed into its hole a small line of welcoming officials formed up on the gravel and langtuhn hemblu manoeuvred the roller on to the touchline near a couple of fourwheeldrives and then got out and stood cap under arm by the rear door the prince was first out of the plane waving from the doorway dressed in what looked like a niftily tailored dark blue version of the traditional quilted trousers and jacket people waved back some were drifting away already presumably those who came only to watch the plane or hardline republicans disappointed to have witnessed another safe royal landing more people spilled out of the aircraft behind the prince i glanced up at dulsung her muddy boots were leaving marks on my quilted red jacket i pointed the prince i said thirp rinse suvinder looked around seemingly distracted as he progressed down the line of bowing officials he motioned langtuhn hemblu over while everybody else was getting themselves and their luggage organised langtuhn and the prince talked briefly then langtuhn pointed at our bit of the crowd and they both shielded their eyes and stared in our direction they werent looking for me were they then langtuhn looked right at me waved and called out he touched the princes sleeve and gestured in my direction in front of me heads were starting to turn the prince caught my gaze smiled broadly and waved shouting something shit i breathed shit said a little voice quite clearly above me it is so good to see you again the prince enthused clapping his hands and smiling like a schoolboy he wasnt wearing any rings i noticed there were seven of us squeezed into the back of the roller bouncing uphill to the palace i was thightothigh with suvinder who was relatively comfortable in the middle of the rear seat with b k bousande his private secretary on the other side hisa gidhaur the exchequer and foreign secretary whom id last seen at blysecrag sat directly across from me hokla niniphe the home secretary was sitting sweating next to the cabins stove while jungeatai rhumde the prime minister and srikkuhm pih commander of the militia had been the last two to get in and so had to squat each with their backs to a door id have assumed theyd be better off in one of the two fourwheeldrives following us up the hill but apparently there was some big protocol thing about travelling with the prince id been introduced to the officials and dignitaries i hadnt met before and theyd all been very polite and cordial before we clambered into the back of the car but i sincerely hoped i wasnt inadvertently treading on as many metaphorical toes as i had physical ones at least they all seemed happy enough sitting or squatting hunched in their thick clothes with big smiles on their round hairless faces nodding at me and making appreciative noises i put it down to the understandable euphoria of at last having their chunky thulahnese asses only half a metre above the ground in a vehicle travelling at little more than a fast walk which if it broke down would just sit at the roadside decorously wisping steam rather than plummeting abruptly towards the nearest patch of icy rock you have seen my mother suvinder went on she is well yes i think so how did you get on i thought carefully we had a full and frank discussion oh very good suvinder looked delighted i glanced round the others the cream of the thulahnese hierarchy looked appreciatively on nodding their approval the princes suite was in the same recently modernised section of the palace as my room though a floor higher the whole royal complex was suddenly full of people dashing about slamming doors waving bits of paper carrying boxes and clattering open shutters i stood with b k bousande in the lounge of the princes private suite watching servants id never seen before rushing round the room distributing bits of luggage and straightening pictures the lounge was relatively modest even restrained plain walls held a few gauzy watercolours a polished wood floor was scattered with intricately patterned carpets a couple of big creamcoloured settees and a few pieces of what looked very old and elaborately carved wooden furniture including a low central table a servant carrying a bunch of fresh flowers appeared through the door and set them in a vase on a sideboard i straightened the little wire and silk flower id worn the day before and had transferred to my red quilted jacket then noticed again the muddy grey marks dulsungs boots had left by my lapels i brushed them off as best i could and dusted my hands you must tell me all you have done since you arrived the prince called out from somewhere beyond the bedroom door judging from the echo from the bathroom oh just sightseeing you will not be rushing away i hope i would like to show you more of thulahn i can stay a few more days i guess but i wouldnt want to interfere with your duties sir there was a pause then the prince stuck his head round the door from the bedroom frowning you do not call me sir kathryn to you i am suvinder he shook his head and disappeared again bk deliver my invitation would you b k bousande bowed to me and said we are holding a reception to celebrate his highnesss return this evening would you be his guest certainly id be honoured oh good the prince called out the high valleys were torn ribbons of scrappy green rammed between the force of mountains pitched tumultuously against the sky in them was a whole raised world of tenaciously adapted bushes trees birds and animals somehow able to grow and multiply in this winded sweep of gusteroded ice naked rock and barren gravel the reception was held in the palaces main hall a relatively modest space not much larger than the throne room in the old palace but much less bizarre in its decoration with a stalactitically carved wooden ceiling and walls covered by what looked like crosses between afghan rugs and tapestries after consulting with langtuhn hemblu on the propriety of the little blueblack versace regretfully deemed too short id chosen a long green silk sleeveless number with a high chinese collar this is the sort of dress that makes me look long and hard at myself however i passed the inspection of my own inbuilt bodyfascist program and happily people did later compliment me on the dress in that way that means they think you look good in it and not in the way that means theyre astonished how tolerable a job its doing of making mutton look like lamb there were perhaps two hundred people present at the reception the majority were thulahnese but there were a couple of dozen indians and pakistanis and a smattering of chinese malays other oriental people whose nationalities i wasnt so sure of and some japanese a lot of westerners seemed to have crawled out of the woodwork too i hadnt known there were so many in thulahn let alone thuhn i was introduced to the indian high commissioner the pakistani and chinese ambassadors and various consuls honorary and otherwise including josh levitsen who looked awkward in a threepiece suit that had probably last been fashionable about the time of his senior prom perhaps to take his mind off this he was already quite drunk when we shook hands the prince guided me round his ministers advisers and family members this last category included his rather subdued brother and sisterinlaw whose son was the heir to the throne if suvinder didnt have any children and who was at a businessrun school in switzerland i also met representatives of the other noble families of which there were about a dozen all told a swathe of subtly varied saffronclad lamas a couple of hindu priests clad in borderlinegarish and i was introduced to the remainder of the thulahnese civil service that i hadnt met in either the twin otter four years earlier or the foreign ministry the day before i made a point of bowing and smiling a lot a gift ive always been very grateful for is never forgetting a name so i was able to greet people like senior immigration officer shlahm thivelu home secretary hokla niniphe and prime minister jungeatai rhumde without having to be prompted they all seemed pleased i spotted a female face i knew id seen before but couldnt place until i realised it was one of the old queens ladiesinwaiting the remaining foreigners included a clutch of vso brits and peace corps americans all appropriately young enthusiastic naive and full of energy a few teachers mostly english and french a couple of ozzie doctors and one indian surgeon some canadian roughdiamondtype engineers and contractors engaged on relatively smallscale infrastructure work a handful of sweaty mixedeuropean businessmen hoping to land contracts with the various thulahnese ministries and a physically attractive but corrosively smug milanese geology professor with his own little entourage of students all female only when you started to look only once youd had your fill of gazing at the dazzling white peaks above and refocused your sight to what was really around you did you see the variety of forms displayed they are very bad workers are they impossible quite useless they cannot keep time i think sometimes they cannot tell time the speaker was a tall bulky austrian businessman with a tight grip on his cocktail glass oh dear i said yes we have a factory just a very small concern you understand something quite tiny really in sangamanu making eyeglasses and ethnic jewellery we received funding from the world bank and various ngos and the project was seen as a way of providing muchneeded employment it could be acceptably profitable but the employees are quite hopeless they forget to turn up many days they wander off before the clockingoff time comes they seem unable to understand that they must be there five or six days out of seven they go ploughing fields or gathering wood it is quite unacceptable but what is one to do this factory means nothing to my company i say nothing of course it means something but really it is so small in scale that it means next to nothing but you see in sangamanu it is the biggest employer these people should be grateful that it is there and do their best to make it a success as we have done but they do nothing they are just pathetic they are a very childish sort of people i think they are immature yes like children are really i said shaking my head and looking as though i found this fascinating i created an excuse to get away from the guy shortly afterwards leaving him agreeing sternly with a german surveyor that yes the people here were just impossible i went in search of anybody not conforming to their own national or cultural stereotypes i spotted srikkuhm pih the militia commander standing stiffly in his rather grand ceremonial uniform which looked as if it might have been fashionable in the british army about a hundred years earlier mr pih i said bowing ah miss telman srikkuhm pih was old slightly stooped shorter than me and had the greyest hair of any thulahnese id seen so far i very much like your outfit you look terribly grand that swords quite wonderful mr pih responded very well to flattery apparently as well as being commander of the militia he was minister of war secretary of defence and chief of staff of the armed forces after hed shown me the dazzlingly bright and beautifully inscribed sword a present to one of his predecessors from an indian maharaja at the turn of the century we were soon talking about the ticklish nature of his job and the generally unwarlike nature of the average thulahnese male we very bad soldiers he said with a happy shrug well if you dont need to fight very bad soldiers monks best monks he nodded monks have competition of this he mimed drawing a bow archery competitions i asked that right four time year each season that right four time year they competition all sampal all monkhouse against all other arch but always get drunk first they get drunk first drink khotse this was the local brew a fermented milk beer that id tried exactly once when id come to thulahn the first time i think its safe to say that even its greatest fan would agree it was an acquired taste get drunk srikkuhm pih continued then they fire arrow some very good hit middle of the target bang spot on but start good then drunk end not good laugh too much fall over he shook his head sorry state of affairs you cant use the monks as soldiers then he mugged horror and dread rinpoche tsunke head lama chief priest man they not let me none of would they are most he blew out his cheeks and shook his head didnt you have sort of samurai or something i thought i read about a warrior caste what were they called the treih they no good either worst all gone soft very soft peoples now too much of living in houses they say just not officer material dont you know he shook his head again and regarded his empty glass sorry state of affairs what about the rest of the people where do you get your soldiers not got soldiers he said shrugging got none not a bean none at all we have militia i am commander men have guns in house we have more gun to give here in palace also in government house in each towns but not barracks not standing army not professionals or territorials he tapped his chest this only army uniform in country wow he gestured to where suvinder was talking to a couple of his ministers the prince waved i waved back i ask prince for money for uniform for men the militia commander went on but he say no i am afraid not yet srikkuhm old fellow must wait maybe next year well i am very patient guns more important than uniforms not wrong there but if say the chinese invaded how many men could you put up what would be the maximum government military secret he said slowly shaking his head very top secret he looked thoughtful about twentythree thousand oh well that is a fairly respectable army or militia he looked dubious that how many guns men not supposed to sell them or use them for other thing like for plumb in house but some have he looked glum sorry state of affairs i said sorry state of affairs he agreed then brightened but prince always is saying he happy to have me most unemploymented man in thulahn he looked around then leaned closer and dropped his voice i bent to hear i get performancerelate bonus every year there no war do you i laughed how splendid well done the militia commander offered to refresh my glass which didnt need refreshing then wandered off in the general direction of the drinks table looking pleased both with himself and the financially agreeable absence of war i did some more circulating and found myself talking to one of the teachers a young welsh woman called cerys williams oh cerys like the girl in catatonia thats it same spelling im sure you get asked all the time but whats it like teaching here cerys thought the thulahnese children were great the schools had very little equipment and the parents were inclined to keep children away from lessons if there was anything that had to be done on the farm but generally they seemed very bright and willing to learn how long do they get in school how many years just primary really there is secondary education but you have to pay for that it isnt a lot but its more than most of the families can afford usually they educate the oldest boy up to third or fourth year but the rest tend to leave when theyre eleven or twelve always the boy even if theres an older girl she gave a rueful grin oh well almost always im trying well were all trying really but i think im trying hardest to change that but youre up against an awful lot of generations of tradition see ill bet but theyre not stupid theyre coming round to the idea that girls might benefit from higher education weve had a few successes it still usually means only one child per household goes to secondary mind you i imagine there might be a few eldest boys who feel resentful because of that she smiled oh i dont know theyre happy enough to leave school when the time comes i think most of them would much rather it was their sisters who had to stay on more circulating the prime minister himself filled me in on the workings of the thulahnese governmental system there was a form of democracy at the most local level where people in each village and town elected a head man or mayor who then chose town constables to uphold the law or didnt bother there was very little crime and certainly i hadnt seen any sort of police presence in thuhn so far the chief of each noble family and the head men and mayors formed a parliament of sorts which met irregularly and could advise the monarch but after that it was down to appointees of the monarch and appointees of appointees anyone in the kingdom could appeal to the throne if he thought hed been hard done by in the courts or elsewhere suvinder took this part of the job seriously though jungeatai rhumde thought people were inclined to take advantage of the princes good nature hed suggested a sort of supreme court setup instead but suvinder preferred the old system aw shit no theyre great people you wouldnt want to confuse them with anybody who gives a fuck mind you rich was an ozzie civil engineer he laughed some of the fellas disagree but i think theyve got a great attitude to life but then they think theyre going to be reincarnated or something like that you know i smiled nodded who needs crash barriers if gods looking after you and you might come back as something better next time anyway you know fucking hard little workers though dont know when to stop and more circulating michel was a french doctor moodily goodlooking but one of those people who makes no effort to be attractive or even interesting beyond keeping their good looks kempt he was a bit dour as we say but provided an overview of medicine in thulahn which was pretty basic high infant mortality poor ante and postnatal care in the outlying villages whole population prone to influenza epidemics which killed a few thousand each winter some malnutrition a lot of preventable andor easily treatable blindness goitres and other deficiency conditions a problem in some of the valleys where they didnt get a full spectrum of minerals and vitamins in their diet no sign of genderbiased infanticide aids known but not common on which negative but happy note the good doctor propositioned me in a bored sort of way that left it open whether he was so used to women falling into his arms that hed got out of the way of putting much effort into it or was so frightened of rejection he thought it wise not to invest the suggestion with too much significance i did my impression of the roman empire and declined blue pine and chir pine prickly leaved oak himalayan hemlocks and silver firs juniper and scrub juniper filled the crannied spaces where any soil had gathered the last stunted blasted by the wind burned by frost but still just growing only finally petering out at five kilometres above sea level this is a pluralist society we respect the beliefs of our hindu brothers and sisters buddhists tend not to see themselves as being in competition with others the hindu faith is like judaism providing an ancient set of rules by which one may live ones life and order ones thoughts ours is a younger religion a different generation of thought if you like grafted upon a set of much older traditions but having drawn lessons from them and respectful of them westerners often see it as more like a philosophy or so they tell us yes i know a few buddhists in california you do so do i do you know i smiled we swapped a few names but predictably came up with no matches sahair beies was rinpoche or head lama of bhaiwair monastery the biggest in the country i had already seen it albeit from a distance strung across the rock faces above the old palace a few kilometres out of thuhn he was slight indeterminately old shaved bald and wore very deeply saffron robes and little wireframe glasses behind which intelligentlooking eyes twinkled you are a christian ms telman nope jewish then i have noticed that many people whose names end in man are jewish i shook my head evangelical atheist he nodded thoughtfully a demanding path i suspect i asked one of your compatriots what he was once and he replied devout capitalist the rinpoche laughed we have a lot of those most are less open about it life as acquisition whoever dies with the most toys wins its a boy thing he gave me a lecture on the dynamic nature of the west and the united states of america in particular it was most illuminating but it didnt persuade you to move to new york city and become a venture capitalist or a stockbroker no he laughed what about other faiths i asked do you for instance get mormons and jehovahs witnesses turning up here i had a sudden comical image of two guys in sober suits and shiny shoes covered in snow shivering outside the giant doors of a remote monastery very rarely the rinpoche looked thoughtful usually by the time we see them they arechanged he said his eyes bulged oh i find physicists much more interesting there have been some famous american professors and indian nobel prize winners i have talked to and it struck me that we were as one says on the same wavelength in many ways physics thats our brahmin faith you think so i think a lot of people live as though thats true even if they dont think about it to us science is the religion that works other faiths claim miracles but science delivers them through technology replacing diseased hearts talking to people on the other side of the world travelling to other planets determining when the universe began we display our faith every time we turn on a light switch or step aboard a jet you see all very interesting but i prefer the idea of nirvana as you said sir its a hard path but only if you think of it one of your american professors said that to study religion was merely to know the mind of man but if one truly wanted to know the mind of god you must study physics that sounds familiar i think ive read his book the rinpoche pinched his lower lip i think i see what he meant now but i could not explain to him that the thoughts of people and the phenomena we seek to explain through physics might all be revealed assubsidiary to the attainment of true enlightenment which would be like the result of one of those experiments which use high energies to show that apparently quite different forces are in fact the same do you see what i mean that having achieved nirvana one might recognise all human behaviour and the most profound physical laws as being ultimately indistinguishable in their essence i had to pause while i let this sink in then i stood back a pace from the rinpoche and said wow you guys dont just wander into this job do you the rinpoches eyes sparkled and he held one hand over his mouth while he giggled modestly amongst and above them snow pigeons sunbirds jungle crows barbets choughs warblers babblers grandalas accentors himalayan griffon vultures and thulahnese tragopans hopped flitted scurried dived wheeled or stooped i was on my way back from the toilet i nodded and smiled at the little ladyinwaiting as she headed where id just been then spotted josh levitsen letting himself out of a door and on to a terrace overlooking the dark town i followed him he stood by the stone parapet swaying hands cupped in front of his mouth as he fumbled with the zippo his face suddenly yellow in the flame as the lighter flared he looked up as i approached hey ms telman youre going to catch your death of cold out here you know that nice dress did i say that earlier youre a babe you know that if you dont mind me saying so that is here you wanna toke suns over the yardarm and shit right thanks we leant on the stonework it really was quite cold though at least there was no wind i felt the hairs on my arms prickle goosebumps rising the grass was strong i held it in for a while but ended up coughing on the exhale i handed the skinny joint back to levitsen good shit local thulahns finest every pack comes with a sanity warning from the lord high surgeon general do they export much ive never heard of thulahnese na me neither for consumption on the premises only he studied the joint before handing it back to me maybe just as well prices might go up we smoked in silence for a while it true they have opium poppies in some of the lower valleys i asked yeah some that leaves the country but its minimal he sucked smoke and handed the j back compared to other places tried that stuff once he said pronouncing the words as he sucked more air in then he grinned and shook his head until he blew out a cloud of fragrant smoke just the once though toooo nice faaar too nice i shivered absolutely moderation in all things here couldnt agree more thanks silence what you looking at can you see the old palace from here na further round the valley there higher too right silence breeze yup wind getting up shell be fine until the east wind blows what nuthin silence jeez the stars cool huh hey you look cold i am absolutely fucking freezing better get back in people will talk indeed good grief my teeth are chattering i didnt think that really happened a stiff vodka martini gave the impression that it was counteracting the effects of the joint probably doing nothing of the sort but i felt like i needed it anyway i didnt entirely trust myself not to slur my words or babble so i circulated in minimum speech mode for a while standing on the outskirts of groups and listening or just nodding knowledgeablysympathetically as somebody else sounded off i narrowly escaped being collared a second time by the boring austrian with the factory but in the course of this manoeuvre bumped into the prince kathryn you are enjoying yourself having a total hoot of a time suvinder what a swell party this is how about you princey baby ah well kathryn still in potential babble mode then just shut up you idiot ha ha you are a scream kathryn oh yes it is good to be back and i am enjoying this party very much now listen as i was saying i would love to show you more of the country langtuhn hemblu is keen to take a fourwheeldrive and take us all over the place we might need a week it is such a beautiful country kathryn can you spare us that long he put his hands together in a beseeching sort of way oh kathryn please say you can ah what the hell why not i heard myself say my that grass was strong ah you wonderful girl you have made me so happy suvinder went as though to take my face in his hands but then changed his mind and just grasped my hands theyd more or less warmed up by now with no visible signs of frostbite and shook them together until i thought my teeth would start chattering again that night i slept very very well indeed i had half thought that i might not be spending it alone there had been a few attractive possibles in the crowd at the reception which had had a pretty good social conducive buzz about it plus i was feeling pleasantly mellowly receptive and sort of generally well disposed to men which always helpedbut in the end well i was just too tired i guess it had been a good party id met lots of people encountered an only slightly smaller number of interesting people gathered a lot of information and overall just had a fine old time i didnt even feel id made a mistake accepting suvinders offer to show me round the country i was aware i might come the chill light of morning but not then not right at that moment not yet here too was a mostly unseen rainbow of animals grey langurs red pandas blue sheep black bears and yellowthroated martens their presence like the leopards tahrs gorals musk deer muntjacs pikas and serows that shared the mountains with them usually witnessed only by their droppings prints or bones the prince and i visited the towns of joitem khruhset sangamanu and kamalu and gerrosakain langtuhn hemblu trundled the old land cruiser slowly through dozens of huddled villages where people stopped and grinned and nodded formally children ran away laughing goats limped hobbled sheep wandered indifferently and chickens pecked at dirt in the ruins of the great monastery of trisuhl we took tea the rhododendron bushes flourished everywhere in the lower valleys their leaves glossy thick and so deeply green they were nearly black the valleys had once been much more heavily forested and here and there mixed woods still lay across the folded hills and lined the steeper slopes where the forests had been now farms were strewn across the undulating countryside their terraces looping along the pitched gradients of the land like contour lines made solid relatives noble families lamas and government officials greeted the prince with a variety of reactions that ranged through polite affection restrained respect simple friendliness and what certainly looked like unalloyed joy there were no great crowds of people brandishing the national flag and shouting hiphurrah but no cloaked anarchists lobbing bombs either people waved a lot and smiled we visited one hospital it was clean but sparse just a building with many beds in many rooms with little of the equipment the average westerner associates with institutional medicine suvinder took little presents for the patients i felt rudely healthy as though my own constitution which felt pretty sturdy and glowing was an insult to these sick people we went round a couple of schools too which were much more fun we visited the yak market in kamalu saw a hindu marriage near gerrosakain and a buddhist funeral in khruhset we took short hikes into the hills to visit halffrozen waterfalls abandoned forts picturesquely ancient monasteries and picturesquely ancient monks in the lower valleys we crossed the milky rush of rivers by open wickerwork tube bridges the prince puffed and panted up the trails using a couple of tall walking sticks perspiring freely and apologising profusely for it but he always made it and we never had to stop and wait for him langtuhn carried whatever picnic or other stuff he thought we might need and wouldnt let me carry anything other than the pair of binoculars and the canon sureshot id bought in joitem i was pleased to be able to keep up with langtuhn even though he was loaded down with all the gear had ten years on me at least and i suspected was throttling his pace way back to make life easier for us it was on one of these walks i lost the little artificial flower dulsung had given me kkatjats were snacks we nibbled on a lot of kkatjats pancakes featured strongly jherdu was roast millet flour pikho roasted wheat flour id been studying my guidebook and knew words like pha for village thakle for innkeeper kug for crow muhr for death that sort of thing some words were easy to remember because they bore a similarity to their english indian or nepalese equivalents like thay for tea rupe which was the local currency and namst which was the everyday form of hello we stayed in two thulahnese stately homes one warm and unfriendly the other the opposite a government resthouse minimalist big rooms but a padded hammock for goodness sake still very good nights sleep the gerrosakain grand hotel guest tea and bunk house long on sign short on grandness and a monastery where i had to sleep in a special annex hung out over the walls because i was female somewhat to my surprise and much to my relief suvinder was a perfect gentleman no flirting no hands on knees no tappings on my door at midnight all in all it was a very restful and relaxing holiday in a pleasantly tiring sort of way id deliberately left my laptop and both phones back in thuhn the ordinary mobile was totally useless here anyway it was like a sabbatical within a holiday within a sabbatical or something anyway i felt very good i thought of stephen a few times and took out the two discs i had the cdrom with the businesss plans for thulahn and the dvd with the evidence of my beloveds spouse cheating on him and held them up to whatever light was available and watched their rainbow surfaces shimmer for a while before putting them both back in my pocket maybe i thought everything will have changed when i get back to thuhn and make a few calls and send a few emails stephen will have found out about emmas infidelity shell have taken the children and hell be winging his way to thulahn to forget the business would have suddenly discovered somewhere even better to buy but donate billions to thulahn just to say thanks somehow being away from all electronic contact even if only for a few days made this seem much more likely as though there was a capacitance for change and difference in my life which was constantly being shorted away to ground by all the calls i made and emails i exchanged but which left alone for a while and allowed to charge up fully would when finally released blast through all problems and light up all and any darkness well hoping is always easier than thinking i stayed up talking to the prince a couple of nights over a whisky or two he talked about the longmooted change to becoming a constitutional monarch about better roads schools and hospitals about his love for paris and london about his affection for uncle freddy and about all the changes that would inevitably ensue if and when because he talked about it as though it was unavoidable the business came in and took over his country it is a mephistophelean thing what he said sadly staring into the flames of the resthouses sittingroom fire everybody else had turned in for the night there were just the two of us and a decanter of something peaty from islay well i said if you were thinking about this constitutional monarchy thing anyway you arent losing so much maybe in some ways you gain the business will probably prefer to deal with a single ruler than a chamber full of politicians so remaining i tried to think of a polite alternative to the word that had first occurred to me but it had been a long day and i was tired so i couldnt undemocratic for as long as possible will suit them fine and any pressure for reform well theyll just buy that off with improvements if not outright bribes you should look on it as securing your position suvinder i did not mean for me kathryn he said swirling his whisky round in his glass i meant for the country the people oh i see boy did i feel shallow you mean they dont get a say in whether all this happens yes and i cant really tell them what it is that might happen who does know the cabinet rinpoche beies has a sort of idea and my mother managed to get wind of it too somehow what do they all think my ministers are enthusiastic the rinpoche ishmm indifferent is not the correct word happy either way yes my mother has only the vaguest notion but despises the whole idea utterly he sighed heavily i thought she would well shes a mother she just wants whats best for her boy huh the prince drained his glass he inspected it as though surprised to find it empty i am going to have some more whisky he announced would you like to have some more whisky kathryn just a little very littlethats too much never mind i think she blames me he said morosely your mother what for everything everything everything what like the second world war toxic shock syndrome tv evangelists the single achey breakey heart ha but no just for not having remarried ah we hadnt ever touched on the subject of the princes shortlived marriage to the nepali princess whod died in the helicopter crash in the mountains twenty years earlier well one has to mourn i said and then these things take time platitudes i thought but this was the sort of thing you felt you had to say i read once that ludwig wittgenstein had no smalltalk no casual conversation at all how hellish suvinder gazed at the flames i was waiting to meet the right person the prince told them well hell prince your mother cant blame you for that i think mothers have their own idea of original sin to use the christian term kathryn suvinder said with a sigh one is always guilty he glanced round towards the door always i wait for her to come through the door any door whenever i am in thulahn and sometimes when i am further afield scolding me well she does seem kind of committed to her bed suvinder i know he shivered that is whats so scary he did touch me that evening but only in a friendly companionable way taking my arm as we walked to our respective rooms no attempt at a kiss or anything just as well i was set for a struggle with that damn hammock though once i was in it was very comfortable the next day was the last we headed back towards thuhn on a fine clear cold day and had a picnic lunch in the ruins of the old monastery at trisuhl langtuhn hemblu unpacked the little table and two chairs set the places arranged the food and brewed a pot of earl grey tea then went off to visit a relation who lived nearby the trees growing within the walls rustled where their tops stuck out into the light breeze and little rose finches and redstarts hopped and jumped around us almost but not quite accepting morsels of food from my hand choughs called out their cries echoing in the empty shell of walls suvinder chattered a little and spilled some tea on the table which was not like him i felt content and harmonious with everything i had mixed feelings about heading back to thuhn and i was surprised to find that while i was certainly looking forward to getting back to my emails and phones if anything given the chance id have chosen to continue the tour round thulahn but then it was a small country there was not much more to see perhaps and id been lucky to have had the undivided attention of somebody with as many responsibilities and calls upon his time as the prince it was the sort of time when it paid to remember what mrs telman had said back in the hotel room at vevey that night appreciate at the time enjoy the moment count your blessings kathryn suvinder said placing his teacup down somehow i just knew we were suddenly in formal territory i turned from feeding the little birds to sit square and upright plumped up in our thermal jackets we faced each other across the little table your highness i said i clasped my hands on the table he addressed them rather than my face have you enjoyed the last few days immensely suvinder one of the best holidays ive ever had he looked up smiling really of course really how about you what have you enjoyed yourself well of course there you are then hurrah for us yes yes he was looking at my hands again you have enjoyed my company i hope very much indeed prince youve been the perfect host im very grateful for your time i feel veryfavoured i just hope your subjects dont resent me monopolising you for so long he waved one hand dismissively good good iim glad to hear that very glad to hear that kathryn i he exhaled suddenly an exasperated expression on his face and sat back slapping the table oh this is no good i will come right out with it he looked me in the eye and dolt that i am i swear that i still had absolutely no idea what was coming next kathryn he said will you marry me i stared at him for a while wi will i i said eloquently then i felt my eyes narrow are you serious of course i am serious the prince squeaked then looked surprised of course he said in a normal voice iisuvinderprincei he searched my eyes oh dear this has been a complete surprise to you hasnt it i nodded well ah yes i gulped i mean it is have i made a complete fool of myself kathryn he asked his gaze dropping prince i i took a deep breath how do you really clearly kindly say to someone youve come to like even like quite a lot that you just dont love them and so no of course you dont want to marry them no of course you havent made a fool of yourself suvinder im very very flattered that you he turned sideways in his seat crossing his legs and arms and casting his gaze to the sky oh prince i said recalling the drunken call in blysecrag a few weeks earlier i know people have said this sort of thing to you before used these words but i mean it im not just trying to be kind i like you a lot and i know how much you must havebut hold on i mean you cant marry a commoner anyway can you i can marry whom i like he said resentfully scratching at the tablecloth with one fingernail as though trying to remove an invisible stain my mother and anybody else can go hang tradition implies i must marry a princess or someone similar but there is nothing but thissuccession of precedents from an age when there were many more princesses around this is the twentieth century my god it is almost the twentyfirst century i am not unpopular i have taken the precaution even though i have resented it of gauging the reaction of people to you ordinary people seem to like you my ministers do the rinpoche beies was most taken with you and thought we would be most happy so it would be a popular match he sighed but i should have known hold on they dont know do they he glanced at me of course well not the ordinary people but i told the cabinet members in the plane on the way to thuhn and the rinpoche before the reception the other night oh my god i sat back stunned i remembered them all nodding at me smiling and nodding at me they werent just being friendly they were sizing me up what about your mother her i was leaving till later suvinder admitted an appalling suspicion began to form in my mind who else knows i asked keeping my voice cold and flat he turned to me a few people not many all most discreet he sounded bitter as he said why are you so ashamed that i have asked you to marry me i said i was flattered i think i still am but i mean does anybody in the business know he looked defensive i dont know no i mean one or two perhaps knew that i that i might his voice trailed off i stood up this was all meant wasnt it he rose too reaching out to take my hands in his while his napkin fell to the grass oh kathryn he cried do you really think so i jerked my hands away no by the business you idiot he looked mystified and hurt what do you mean i stood there and looked very carefully into his eyes there was a lot of stuff going through my mind in those moments none of it nice and some of it positively paranoid so this was what they meant by thinking on your feet prince i said eventually is this the way the business makes sure that thulahn is really theirs by having me marry you did they suggest this did any of them dessous cholongai hazleton did they even hint that this might be a good idea suvinder looked as if he was about to weep well not not in so many words i suggested well i think they know ithat i have very strong feelings for you i did notand they did not i dont think i have ever seen a man look so abject sometimes you just have to trust your feelings i reached out and took his hand suvinder im sorry that the answer is no i like you and i hope you will stay my friend and i accept that it was a sincere offer from the heart and im sorry i called you an idiot his eyes glistened as they looked at me he gave a small and sorry smile then lowered his head until i couldnt see his eyes im sorry i didnt protest when you did suvinder mumbled at the table i looked down at the white tablecloth in the mans shadow directly under his face a clear droplet hit the linen surface darkening it and spreading he turned away with a sniff and walked off a little way pulling a handkerchief from his pocket suvinder yes he said still not turning to look at me he blew his nose i am so sorry he waved one hand and shrugged he carefully folded the handkerchief again look i said why not tell people that im thinking about it he looked back with a smile what would be the point of that it mightno youre right its a stupid idea he returned to the table pocketing the hanky and taking a deep breath his head high oh look at us eh i am ashamed at myself for spoiling a perfectly good picnic ruining a most pleasant holiday you havent ruined anything suvinder i said as he held my seat for me good i must say im still hungry let us eat shall we lets he hesitated as he was about to take his seat may i say one more thing then i promise never to raise the subject again all right i think i love you kathryn he paused but that is not why i asked you to marry me oh i said i asked you to marry me because i think you will make a wonderful wife and because you are somebody i can imagine being with for the rest of my life when perhaps love of a sort of a very important and special sort might grow between us i think it is wonderfully romantic to marry for love alone but i have seen so many people do so and live to regret it there are some lucky people no doubt for whom everything works out just perfectly but i have never met any for most people i think to marry for love is to marryat the summit as it were it must be downhill from there on to marry for other reasons with ones head and not just ones heart is to embark on a different sort of journey uphill i suppose he said looking embarrassed my goodness i do not choose my metaphors so well do i but it is a journey which offers the hope that things will become gradually better and better between the people concerned he spread his hands and gave a sharp sort of laugh there my thoughts on the western romantic marriage ideal i did not put it or rather them very well but there you are no more you put it just fine suvinder i told him i did he said pouring some more tea from the padded pot oh good please another sandwich we cannot feed them all to the birds even moving higher than thuhn scaling tracks that seemed to zigzag up for ever to still higher valleys you could find yourself beneath the lowest limit of an animals domain snow leopards that lived perpetually above the tree line and bharals that even in winter never descended below four thousand metres you what you go to this remote himalayan kingdom the prince proposes to you and you turn him down are you fucking insane of course i turned him down i dont love him ah so what say yes anyway what girl gets a chance to marry a prince these days think of your grandchildren i dont want grandchildren i dont want children yes you do no i dont you do too no ones mileage varies that much im telling you i dont dammit yeah right luce i wouldnt lie to you ive never lied to you oh come on you must have im your girlfriend not your analyst what a terrible attitude and i dont even have an analyst exactly what do you mean exactly that just shows how much you need one what not having an analyst shows how much i need an analyst yes youre mad yeah but at least ive got an analyst slowgliding in the air above them all slid the wingspread shapes of the boneeating lammergeiers forever cruising the bladethin winds that sliced across the frozen peaks mr hazleton kathryn i just had a funny thought funny how do you mean i thought youd be ringing about freddy mr hazleton ive just received a proposal of marriage from the prince am i supposed towhat about freddy you havent heard oh dear he was in a car crash hes in what do they call it nowadays intensive care kathryn im very sorry to be the one to tell you but they dont seem to think hes going to make it he was asking to see you though i dont know by the time youd be able to get there suddenly i remembered or halfremembered a joke uncle freddy had told me once something about a man a fanatical hunter who was a great marksman with a doublebarrel shotgun and was forever bagging vast quantities of grouse and pheasant but who in the end went mad and sincerely thought he was the piece of cotton on the end of a length of string that shotgun owners use to clean out the barrels of their guns the punchline was his wife saying but doctor do you think hell pull through this had sent uncle freddy into a tearful kneeslapping frenzy i could still see him hooting and guffawing and bending and struggling to catch his breath through his laughter i said tell them im on my way chapter ten i fussed and fretted throughout the rest of that evening and into the night making calls sending emails trying to sleep not sleeping suvinder looked shaken when he heard about uncle freddy he arranged for the twin otter to bring forward its flight the next day it would leave at dawn from dacca and turn around as quickly as possible luckily the weather forecast was fairly benign tommy cholongais lear wasnt available but there would be a company gulfstream waiting for me at siliguri by noon the prince had to pay a belated visit to his mother that evening i spent most of the time in my room on the phone my little quilted chattering lady who was called mrs pelumbu brought me a meal though i didnt eat much i called leeds general the hospital in the uk where uncle freddy had been taken and eventually persuaded them that i was both a relation and that i was the kate that freddy kept asking to see he was in intensive therapy as hazleton had said a road traffic accident on the a two days earlier during heavy rain four other casualties two discharged others not in danger they wouldnt actually tell me how bad he was straight out but they did say if i wanted to see him i should get there as soon as i could i tried blysecrag miss heggies answered how bad is he miss h itheyheyou miss h was reduced to little more than personal pronouns the small amount of sense i did manage to get out of her only confirmed that uncle freddy was very poorly indeed and in a sense i didnt even need that just hearing how emotional and distraught this former paragon of stainless rectitude had become was enough to tell me things must be fairly desperate it also made me wonder if she and uncle freddywell never mind hi stephen lost event horizon here kathryn i heard about freddy ferrindonald can you get back there to see him is there anything i can do im starting back tomorrow weather permitting you can tell me what the word is incompany any details yep thought you might ask so i found all this out he was driving to some place on the coast nearby scarboro during the evening it was raining he skidded on a corner and hit a car coming in the opposite direction wouldnt have been too bad but the whatever he was driving was so old it didnt have a seatbelt apparently he went through the windscreen and ended up wrapped round a tree or a bush or something lot of head and internal injuries wed have got him to one of our hospitals we had a swiss air ambulance waiting at the local airport for him the next morning but hes in too bad a way to move kathryn im sorry but from what i hear he isnt even fiftyfifty he keeps asking for you i think miss hs nose is out of joint and not just because hes not asking for her apparently theres another woman there keeping vigil this is the party he was on his way to visit in scarboro uncle f had a fancy woman well that figures look thanks for collating all that stuff do we have anybody on the ground i can contact lady called marion craston an l from gcm shes at the bedside too well there or thereabouts in case he changes his will or something i guess but also just to have a co presence too most likely gallentine cidentmuhel london genève new york tokyo are our lawyers wholly owned thanks we have a number for her i called marion craston at the hospital in leeds she wasnt much help the epitome of lawyerly obfuscation basically she confirmed what i already knew the line was very clear and i could hear that she was still clicking and tapping away on a keyboard as she talked sort of absentmindedly to me this i did not appreciate after i hung up i sat for a few seconds thinking about calling gcm and getting her replaced with somebody else then decided i was upset and possibly just taking it out on her i had done the same sort of thing myself on occasion though not when the person i was talking to was a couple of levels above me in the corporate hierarchy id always given them my full attention but what the hell one could be too severe hi again so want my analysts number no i do not listen more tribulations i told luce about uncle f they have autos without seatbelts jesus i suppose it was a right peasouper oi guvnor will you stop that the poor old bastards at deaths door and all you can do is come on like dick van dyke okay im sorry the cars a classic or was thats why it didnt have a seatbelt ive said im sorry dont go all pricklybrit defensive on me but why does the old guy want to see you were you that close well fairly i was like a daughter to him i guess yeah like a daughter in the closeknit downhome swigging moonshineontheporch and whistlingdixie sense this is still the old geezer who used to grope you up right is this some new valley phrase or are you in some continuing and pathetic attempt to sound british confusing grope and touch up answer the question look weve been through all this hes my uncle freddy who sometimes gives me an affectionate pat on the butt end of story hes a nice old guy and now it sounds like hes dying six thousand miles away from me and ive got to wait ten hours before i can even start heading to his bedside and i idiotically thought id call you for a little understanding maybe but instead all right all right so long as youre sure he never abused you oh not that again im hanging up no youve got hangups hello in my dream in the depths of that cold night the east wind blew mihu the chinese servant who looked just like colin walker hazletons security chief cracked open a window in the eastern wall of windows and the queen mother complained of a draught so the canopy on that side of the bed was dropped in the night while the queen slept he went out on to the terrace for a while then slipped back into the chamber and opened the western windows which led out on to the terrace the queen stirred and muttered in her sleep but did not wake then while josh levitsen and the little ladyinwaiting looked on mihuwalker opened the eastern windows to let the wind in the lowered side of the beds canopy acted as a giant sail bulging like a dark purple spinnaker and making the whole framework of the bed creak and flex the queen mother woke up groggily just as the bed started to move the giant statues with the frayed shining armour stared down their tattered gold leaf whispering wildly in the gale blowing through the long room a gibbous moon flared in the cloudless night sky pouring through the space and scintillating on the tiny strips of tinkling leaf as they tore and lengthened and ripped away and went flying through the moondark room like shrapnel confetti the bed began to move along its rails mihuwalker decided it wasnt moving fast enough and put his huge hands on the east side of its frame and pushed contained within a blueglittering cloud of golden flakes the bed rumbled along its tracks and out into the night the queen mother screamed the beds wheels hit the end of the tracks but there was nothing there to stop them the wheels clattered down on to the stones striking sparks the beds canopy loops and folds and curtains all flapped and snapped and fluttered in the goldenseeded breeze still picking up speed wheels and the queen mother still screaming the bed hit the terrace wall and crashed on through tipping momentously into the black gulf beyond somehow mihuwalkers hand stuck on to the bed and he could not let go and so he went with it and uncle freddy trapped in the bed by straps and tubes and wires screamed as he fell into the night i woke from that one with the sweats i checked my watch twenty minutes since the last time id looked at it after that it was a relief to lie and worry about everything uncle freddy suvinder stephen stephens wife in a bizarre horrendously guiltmaking way it was a relief to have something to have to do i remembered the feeling id had when id flown back alone from my italian school trip knowing that my mother was dead the tears did not come and i just felt numb surrounded by layers of insulation that even seemed to muffle the words of people i recalled the noise the jet made as we flew over the alps all feathers of white spread over the land far below i was having problems with my ears and gone slightly deaf the stewardesses were kind and solicitous but i assumed they must have thought they were dealing with a halfwit from the way i had to keep asking them to repeat things i really couldnt quite make out what they were saying there was a roaring in my ears a compound of the jets engines and the air tearing past the fuselage and the effects of the pressure on my inner ears that more than anything else was my insulation the thing that kept everything at bay then more than now you were isolated in a plane nowadays you can make calls from your seat phone then once you were up in the air that was it aside from the very unlikely possibility of a caller persuading air traffic control or somebody to patch them through to the flight deck once you took your seat you werent going to be disturbed you had that time that interval between the responsibilities that the ground beneath your feet implied to detach yourself from things to take an overview of your life or just whatever problems ailed you at the time it struck me only then that maybe that was why i always felt good on planes why i liked them why i slept well on them shit did it really go back to that flight from rome to glasgow and that roaring in my ears that strange numb knowing that i was cut adrift from my mother for ever and wondering what would become of me i knew i hadnt really worried or at least i hadnt worried that my biological father would come and reclaim me for himself and the life i thought wed left behind but i did get that detached now what feeling that impression that everything was going to change and i would too and so i kept myself awake all the way through the night thinking this sort of thing wondering if uncle freddy was going to live and if he didnt whether id get there in time before he died and what it might be if there was any specific thing that was so important he was calling for me and not anybody else and should i let hazleton let stephen know about his wife and her lover and would the prince despite all hed said hate me for turning him down and had it all been set up by the business as the ideal way of tying thulahn tightly to us and how else were we going to do it and should we do it did the people in the place deserve or need or want to have all that might happen to them happen and was this whole thing about planes born in that other flight back after catastrophe and did it go deeper than that to layers of insulation id been wrapping around myself all my life to all the hierarchies of contacts and business associates and good reports and executive levels and salary increments and payoff guesses and colours of credit cards and classes of aircraft cabin and higherlevel interest rates and even friends and lovers id collected around myself over all the years not to keep the world away from me because people were the world but to keep me away from me my last thoughts as dawn was coming up and i fell briefly asleep again were that all this stuff about flying beds and aircraft and sleeping on them was making certain that id be so tired and sleepdeprived that i was bound to sleep on the plane the gulfstream if not the twin otter then before it seemed i had really got back to sleep at all the alarm went off and it was time to get up feeling groggy and terrible and dizzy with the effects of interrupted sleep and stumble stickyeyed to the bathroom i stood beneath a tepid shower listening to the wind moan in the vent to the outside air and making my own moaning noise as i heard it pick up and start to gust i dressed ethnic in the long red jacket and matching trousers it was only after id put everything on that i remembered id meant to dress western oh well my bags were already on their way down to the airfield when i did my usual last look round the room for anything i might have forgotten just a formality really im a conscientious packer and i hardly ever forget anything the little netsuke monkey it was still sitting there on the bedside table how could i have missed you i thought i stuffed it in a pocket of my long red padded jacket the twin otter landed i thought spectacularly not an adverb i enjoyed settling on as the mot juste in the circumstances the prince bundled up against the cold stiff wind took my gloved hand in his the wind was making my eyes water so i guessed it was doing the same to his he asked will you come back kathryn yes i said dark clouds were moving fast across the sky torn to great rolling ribbons by the high peaks swathes of snow dragged down the slopes the pilots were hurrying the few pallid passengers off the craft and helping with the unloading loading and refuelling the crowd was small gravelly dust was picked off the footballlanding field and thrown into the air everything was late the plane had been delayed at siliguri with a burst tyre for an hour id used the time to do a bit of present shopping while the weather worsened when we heard the plane had taken off and was on its way i wasnt sure whether to feel relieved or terrified my insides settled on both which just seemed to leave my lower brain confused you promise i promise suvinder kathryn may i kiss your cheek oh for goodness sake he kissed my cheek i hugged him briefly he nodded and looked bashful langtuhn hemblu and b k bousande looked in different directions smiling i saw a way out of our mutual embarrassment and went over to where my little pointyhatted friends had appeared i squatted down to say hi dulsung wasnt there but graumo pokuhm and their pals shook both my hands and patted my cheeks with sticky fingers i tried to ask why dulsung wasnt there and they tried to tell me miming something that seemed to involve lots of twirling and fiddly work i distributed the gifts id bought earlier i gave graumo two presents and tried to make it clear that one of them was for dulsung but he looked suspiciously surprised and delighted and promptly disappeared i hailed langtuhn who came over with a big bag of boring but useful stuff like pencils erasers notebooks dynamo flashlights and so on we presented this to the children getting them to promise to share it all out wed just finished doing this and id given away the last of the presents when dulsung appeared breathless and smiling broadly she offered me a little homemade wireandsilk flower i squatted down so our faces were level accepted it from her and attached the new flower securely to my jacket i looked round for graumo but there was no sign of him i had nothing to present to dulsung id given everything away i checked my pockets for a gift i might have missed only one lump remained in any of the jackets pockets the little monkey that was all i had left my tiny dourfaced netsuke piece i pulled it out of my pocket held it in my fingers for a moment then offered it to her dulsung nodded then accepted it with both hands her face split into a huge smile and she reached up with both arms still squatting i hugged her the little monkey was in her right fist i could feel its chunky hardness against the back of my head then it was time to go and so i went i left as id arrived just me and the guys up front in the plane once the ground had dropped away along with my stomach i looked back to see the people id left but by the time we turned after takeoff all there was to see was the inside of a big black cloud full of jackhammer turbulence and glimpses of swirling snow the flight was horrific we got there we got to siliguri but it was pretty damn frightful one of those flights where you contemplate death and terror so closely that no matter what happens even if when you arrive safely the you that got on the plane really hasnt survived after all the you that gets off is different id given away my little netsuke monkey what had i been thinking of ah well never mind it had seemed like the right thing to do it still did anyway it was my own fault for almost leaving it in the bedroom otherwise it would never have been in my pocket in the first place a superstitious person would have thought that somehow the little carving had wanted to stay in thulahn a freudianwell never mind what a freudian would have thought luce had asked me once was i a freudian id told her no i was a schadenfreudian during one of the wilder bits of the flight i found myself touching and stroking the little flower in my lapel my hand was on the brink of jerking away again as my brain thought hello is this some sort of rosary scene going on here i looked down at my hand as though it belonged to somebody else then i thought no this is just a childish thing comfort not superstition same difference i thought of course a really superstitious person would have thought that the monkey supernaturally knew that the plane was going to crash in the mountains and had made sure it was safely on terra firma at the time in the hands of a new owner the plane dropped sickeningly and hit another seemingly solid wall of air i grabbed the flimsy seat arms with both hands yeah very fucking comforting i thought gulfstream all the way siliguri to leedsbradford just like that in a tad over eight hours would have been less but for head winds id assumed wed have to touch down somewhere to refuel but no the planes seats were big and broad and leather in a cabin gleaming with mahogany there was a rest room with gold and marble fittings up front there was a nononsense flight crew and back with me a welcoming but unfussy stewardess who served hot and cold food and drinks that would have earned a michelin star back on the ground plus there were todays papers this months magazines some of them womens magazines hot diggety and every tv channel under the sun and over the horizon i got myself a serious news fix oh and the flight was blissfully smooth i changed from thuhn haute couture to a smartly corporate blouse pinstripe skirt and jacket and shoes more suitable for hospital visits in europe in winter dulsungs little artificial flower went in an inside pocket contemplating myself in the generously sized and perfectly lit mirror above the deep marble basin my avaricious side stunned into shocked silence like most of the rest of me by the traumatic transition from thuhn to siliguri woke up briefly to look round the plane and say i want one while a side i didnt even know i had reared its curious head and with a shake of it said how sickeningly ostentatious and wasteful but then both these disputing demispheres fell promptly asleep as soon as i settled my occasionally fondled but assuredly never abused butt into my seat i awoke over the north sea looking down at the flares of oil and gas rigs the seat fully reclined and a cashmere stole wrapped over my legs the aircraft and the air roared and shushed around me i yawned and made my way past the smiling stewardess i nodded and said thanks to the rest room to tidy my hair and apply some makeup a frustrating delay waiting for a customs official to turn up at leedsbradford then a smooth journey in a chauffeused merc rear seat unforgivingly hard to the hospital the air smelled strange and felt thick somehow i hadnt noticed this back at siliguri but i noticed it now it was pretty late by then id let marion craston know i was on my way as soon as wed hit cruising altitude out of siliguri and shed told the medics but whether i got to see uncle freddy or not depended on how he was when i got to the icu they asked me to turn my mobile phone off i was allowed to set eyes on uncle f tiny skin yellowwhite head bandaged almost invisible from some angles because of all the machinery and wires and tubes and stuff then had to tiptoe away because he was asleep at last for the first time for any length of time since hed arrived here hed been told i was on my way maybe he felt able to sleep now i felt touched and flattered and worried all at once marion craston and the mysterious geriatric floozy from scarborough were nowhere to be seen having retreated back to their respective hotels i asked if there was any point my staying through the night i felt well enough rested from my extended snooze on the gulfstream to handle one of these allnight bedside vigil things but the medical staff said no better to come back in the morning they seemed marginally more sanguine about freddys chances than theyd sounded before i stayed half an hour just to make sure he really was safely asleep then left i still worried and let myself out of the hospital with a feeling of hopelessness and dread half certain that after all hed die in his sleep during the night and i never would get to talk to him mercedes to blysecrag a redeyed miss heggies very obviously keeping control of herself the house felt terribly empty it should have felt cold too and probably would have if id come from anywhere other than thulahn instead it felt warm but still empty and desolate i woke up in the middle of the night with a dream of drowning in warm water where was i warm warm air not in thuhn i felt for my torch watch and the little monkey then recalled where i was and flopped back york room blysecrag uncle freddy i lay looking up at the darkness wondering if my drowning dream counted as a premonition and whether i should ring up the icu to see if there was some sort of crisis but they had the number here theyd phone me or miss h if there was anything serious to report better not bother them hed be okay sleeping soundly bound to pull through i reached out for the netsuke monkey nothing there between the watch and the torch of course dulsung had it half a world away i hoped she looked after it actually there was something there between the torch and my watch a little homemade artificial flower i patted it turned over and went back to sleep kate my girl uncle freddy how are you feeling bloody awful wrecked the car you know i know breakfast had been interrupted by a call from the hospital to say that uncle freddy was awake and asking to see me there was still half an hour before the car was due to arrive so i suggested that miss heggies and i go together in her ancient volvo estate she just shook her head shed go when she was asked for we opened up the stablescumgarage and i drove the lancia aurelia into town miss h would phone the car company to tell them they wouldnt be needed marion craston was there in the icus small lounge and the mystery woman marion craston was tall athletic a little plain a little vague and mousy brown mrs watkins the object of affection in scarborough was there too younger than id expected petite plump nicely turned out lots of brassy dyed blonde hair soft yorkshire accent i thought we might all troop in together but uncle freddy asked to see me alone seeing the setup closer to i realised we couldnt all have trooped in anyway there was just about room for one person to squeeze in between all the machines and sit by freddys side the nurse who made sure i got settled in without tearing out any vital tubes or wires bustled off immediately afterwards called to some other emergency he looked shrivelled reduced lying there his eyes looked bright in the subdued light but seemed shrunken back inside their bony orbs the skin waxy and stretched thin around them his face and hair were the same yellowwhite colour i patted a few stray wisps of hair back into place lovely old delage it was he said his voice was soft and wheezy no buggerll tell me if its a writeoff or not could you find out for me of course oh i came in the aurelia hope you dont mind not at all they need to be used umm have you met mrs watkins just now shes out there with ms craston the lawyer uncle freddy wrinkled his nose dont like her marion craston hmm legal eagle more like legal vulture he coughed and wheezed for a couple of seconds before i realised he was really laughing or trying to i held his thin cool hand steady now youll shake your tubes out he seemed to find this funny too his other arm was in a cast he lifted the hand i was holding away for a moment to wipe at his eyes with a weak painfullooking delicacy let me do that i pulled out a handkerchief and dabbed at his eyes thank you kate youre welcome i hear youve been in thulahn just returned did i drag you back my dear well i was ready to come back mmmhmm and how is suvinder hes well did he ask you anything yes he did he asked me to marry him ah care to tell an old man what your reply was i said i was flattered but the answer was no uncle freddys eyes fluttered closed for a while i wondered if hed gone back to sleep and even if he was conking out on me but there was still a weak pulse in the wrist above the hand i was holding his eyes came slowly open again i told them it was a mad idea you told who uncle freddy oh shit i thought you were in on it too uncle f how could you dessous hazleton uncle freddy sighed he did his best to squeeze my hand there was more pressure from the weight of his thin hand than there was from his fingers thats one of the things i had to say to you kate what uncle freddy that you knew that im sorry dear girl i squeezed his hand gently no need yes there is they asked me which way youd jump kate how youd react they asked me not to say anything to you i agreed not to should have was this just dessous and hazleton or did the prince take part in these discussions just those two and tommy cholongai when they brought him in later they were only hoping suvinder would pop the question dropped a few hints maybe but i should have said something to you kate uncle freddy its all right theyre worried kate they thought they had this all tied up but then they realised that they were relying on suvinders word or more to the point on his greed and it gradually dawned on them he wasnt actually as selfish as theyd assumed not like them i suppose a cultural thing maybe hmm perhaps but either way they thought if they could get you in there theyd be going some way to guaranteeing the deal i bet they did i expect theyll still go ahead with the whole thing do you think so i have no idea i think they wanted to know howdamn i dont know what the word is minds going i dont know take your time oh i dont think so i dont think ive well anyway they wanted to know how you might react to the place to the country to the people i suppose would that maybe persuade you if suvinder himself didnt you see i think so take it their fiendish plan didnt work then oh i dont know i suppose i did kind of fall in love with the place but i cant marry the country he blinked a few times and looked oddly surprised have you met maeve what mrs watkins yes not bad dont you think he winked with a sort of feeble lasciviousness pretty good for an old codger like you i agreed smiling i havent really had a chance to talk to her but she seems very nice very dear to me kate very dear good thats nice have you known her long oh absolute yonks but weve only been you know involved for about a year he sighed lovely place scarborough you ever been no worth a visit roads not really that tricky either just impatient i suppose dont think maeve thinks it he seemed to lose the thread somewhat then shook himself out of it the prince was he upset i mean at you turning him down a little but still okay about it more sad than anything else the ironic thing is i like him a lot more now i mean i dont love him butoh its all so complicated isnt it freddy its like you just never get the one you want or you do at long last but then you go and crash your car on the way to see her and end up in somewhere like this well youll just have to get better wont you though i think well have to get you a chauffeur after this you reckon i reckon i think a chauffeuse dont you no uncle freddy i think a chauffeur i dont know kate he said looking away i dont think ill be leaving here alive oh come on now just stop that youll im being honest with you kate he said softly cant you be honest with me i am uncle freddy they thought you were going to go belly up until last night now they think you might just make it but then they dont know you the way i do in fact im going to warn them that they better surround you with male nurses from now on or at least make sure no female ones bend over within striking distance he coughed and wheezed again i dabbed at his eyes im sure you are well look if you i said making gettingreadytogo movements dont go stay a bit i have more to say kate okay but they dont want me to stay too long listen dear girl theres something going on you mean apart from trying to marry me off to suvinder yes that bugger hazletons up to something busy man isnt he i said thinking of the dvd disc kate i didnt get you into any trouble did i i mean by agreeing to invite you to blysecrag for the weekend it was miss h who told me they had people watching you and that american chap buzetski while you were there did they now well i wasnt sure whether to say anything or not they didnt i mean they didnt umm discover anything or or there was nothing to discover youre pretty attached to the fellow arent you even i could see that didnt need to be told pretty but sadly it isnt mutual im sorry me too but then he is married yes i gathered that thats why i was worried how that they might oh i dont know find something that they could use against you or him or both of you only it was a bit late by the time i found out again though i could still have said something i feel bad kate i should have been more open with you well nothing happened freddy i threw myself at the man but he pushed me away politely the most sensual we got was me watching him swim and him giving me a peck on the cheek no blackmail material if thats what you mean this was ignoring the fact id asked stephen to take me in no uncertain terms words any decent parabolic mike or something planted in his suit could have picked up with ease but apart from causing me a little embarrassment at sounding so desperate so what ah well no harm done then well what see this i pulled the dvd out of my pocket cd isnt it digital video disc it does have blackmail material on it not of me not of stephen buzetski but of somebody connected hazleton made sure i got this thinking that i might use it to get myself something i want in which case hazleton hopes ill feel beholden to him crafty beggar isnt he yes he is god i worry for suvinder kate what do you mean why because theyve got the boy his nephew in school in switzerland oh i dont know kate they might be exaggerating but they seem to think hes theirs willing to do whatever they suggest greedy the way theyd like him to be if thats true suvinder had better watch himself this took a moment to sink in you think they might have suvinder killed wouldnt put it past the blighters kate theyre very serious about this you know lot of money involved i know lot of people involved too in thulahn i dont think they care about the people there kate except as obstacles i think youre right oh uncle freddy sighed with surprising force he blinked up at the ceiling a few times youre looking tired freddy id better go no no just in case you have to listen he clutched at my hand suddenly strong its this silex thing silex i had to think the chip factory near glasgow it seemed like a long while ago what about it they nobbled our chap the fellow we had transferred from brussels what do you mean nobbled hes been bought off turned whatever you want to call it doesnt matter how i know but i do hes saying its all above board up there buggers lying and i think its hazleton again are you sure uncle freddy was starting to sound paranoid developing a hazleton fixation next hed be the one whod forced him to have the crash no no not sure but his people were there at the silex plant at least one of them he winked at me i had never seen the movement of an eyelid look so laboured and so difficult i had somebody else there somebody i knew i could trust said that poudenhaut fellow had been there our brussels chap met him at the factory but didnt mention it thats how i know i closed my eyes briefly this is getting too complicated uncle freddy ill have to think about it later come on you look pretty washed out i really think id better go kate he kept hold of my hand what freddy blysecrag what about it oh kate i dont know what to do he started to cry not sobbing but just crying quietly tears rolling down his cheeks freddy what is it come on dont upset yourself i dabbed at his eyes again id left it to you kate you did what id left it to you then i changed my will to leave it to the national trust because i didnt want to give you an added reason to stay in this country if you might be moving to thulahn but his voice sounded thin and desperate but now i dont know what to do i can change the will back again if you want the dreadful old pile i mean i dont know you could call in miss thing miss craston the lawyer i could do it now hey hey hey uncle freddy look im honoured you even thought of willing it to me but what would i do with a huge place like blysecrag anyway look after it kate thats all ive ever done well then im sure the national trust will do a much better job than i could but youve got to stop talking like this freddy youre not dead yet come on now i had no idea if this pullyourselftogetheroldbean stuff would work with uncle f i felt awkward with it but then how else are you going to feel when youre with somebody who might be dying and who seems convinced they are or are about to especially when hes already crying and you feel you might be about to ill be all right he said falteringly and unconvincingly are you sure you dont want it positive id just get lost look youre not going to die yet but i take it you have provided for miss heggies for when the time does come oh yes her flat is hers and theres money then theres nothing to worry about stop distressing yourself good grief give it a few weeks and youll be back there yourself trying to get the damn catapult to work again yes look at you you cant even keep your eyes open get some sleep yes he stopped fighting it and let his eyes close sleep he said groggily ill see you tomorrow i said rising i let go of his hand and let it rest on the pale green disposable sheet tomorrow he whispered i dont believe this youre making this up a fucking forreal prince offers to marry you and you turn him down and take the next jet out of town then barely a day later an uncle on his deathbed wants to give you some vast estate in england with a house the size of the fucking pentagon and you turn your nose up at that as well are you crazy oh right this from the woman who claims to believe sisters should do things for themselves and freddy is not on his deathbed look theres nothing unsisterly in letting somebody will you enormous amounts of realty especially when its an old man on his deathbed i mean thats perfect if he ever did expect you to put out in return he sounds far too weak to do anything about it now even if you were prepared to drop your precious selfrighteousness and your pantyhose which i doubt luce i swear talking to you cleanses my soul youre a fucking atheist you havent got a soul what are you talking about if ever i start to worry that i might be in any way deceitful shallow vindictive overly acquisitive exploitative or cynical i only have to talk to you for a few minutes to realise that i am something close to a saint in comparison bullshit dont you see luce youre the reason i dont need a shrink all i need every now and again is to be reminded that im not a bad person and you do that i should thank you actually i should pay you but im not that saintly kathryn get some help your brain has left the building book yourself into a clinic im serious youre not serious and im not ill you are too talk about denial apart from anything else youre denying yourself the chance to own half of north york state or wherever this blisscraig place is and youre denying yourself to be queen of an entire fucking country look can we come back to this some other time to talk about what the archangel gabriel appeared before you asking you to be the mother of god for the second coming and you turned that down too ha ha no its an opportunity i have i dont know whether to take it or not can i run it past you why bother the mood youre in at the moment youd turn down the offer of a cure for cancer and an end to world hunger welllook ive been given some blackmail material blackmail seriously seriously film of somebody fucking somebody they shouldnt be fucking somebody theyre not married to so this person is married yep she is ahhah anyone i know no thing is i only have to say the word and the husband gets to see the film and you get to see the husband well maybe ho ho so is this to do with your beloved yes i can probably destroy his marriage if i want of course whether he falls into my arms is another matter but okay you want to know what i would do yes let me just check are either of the people in the film richer than you eh no right so theres no point in like actually blackmailing them luce even for you im just checking okay sorry go on right well im very tempted to say whatever you do dont use the film just sit on it i feel i should say that because it seems like you always do the exact opposite of what i suggest anyway so if i apply a bit of reverse psychology and advise you to do whatever is most against your best interests youd end up doing the right thing through sheer cussedness whereas really you think i should give the word and let him know his wifes cheating on him yeah do it if you really want this guy and you really dont want to ascend to the yeti throne or whatever the fuck it is do it give that film the green light but then i could be blackmailed by the person who got the film to me in the first place hmm hold on ive got it what the solution what what is it its this be positive be affirmative say yes to everything say yes to everything yes take the mansion and half of york state sell it and buy hospitals and schools for the needy of whatsitcalled thulahn yeah thulahn which i think you should become queen of tell the prince youll be his wife but itll be one of these formal marriages the europeans used to have because you release the film too and do everything you can to be in the right place at the right time to get your guy and carry him off to thulahn as well to be your secret lover so i should suggest to the prince that we get married but its never consummated yeah a morganatic marriage or whatever its called i dont think thats what a morganatic marriage means isnt it shit and i used to think it meant a good marriage like rich from j p morgan yes no not that either but thats your suggestion it is and if it all works out i expect a damehood or something or a fucking tiara loaded with diamonds at the very least a castle would be nice hell leave blisscraig to me if you like it could be your embassy in england hmm i dont know that suvinder would be very happy with an unconsummated marriage oh suvinder is it okay then consummate it consummate it yes is he that gruesome hes a little plump how little maybe an extra twenty thirty pounds how tall is he about my height no a bit taller that is not grotesquely obese does his breath smell i dont think so does his body smell no well only of scent well i meannever mind teeth straight the teeth are good the teeth are an asset and hes a good dancer light on his feet even graceful you could say graceful well thats good yeah but theyre oldfashioned dances waltzes and shit the waltz may be making a comeback thats a neutral for now could become a plus okay what else full head of hair yup maybe too full slightly bouffant irrelevant hair on a mans head is like the opposite of salt in a dish you can take it away but you cant add it in that is so nearly profound its painful keep going is he slimy repellent actually like ugly none of the above can you imagine fucking him hello kathryn hello i just imagined it and it wasnt that good for me did you imagine having to fake orgasm yes probably maybe but you dont actually feel sick not sick possibly a little soiled why soiled i never imagined fucking a guy i didnt actively want to fuck before you havent never youre unreal but anyway it wasnt that awful right right but imagining fucking him isnt the same as actually fucking him is it thats what your imagination is for you idiot its like onboard vr if its not that terrible in your imagination itll probably be even better in reality so i marry him fuck him but keep my beloved as lover yes that may be a little sophisticated im not sure how thatll play someplace where a good wife is worth three yaks be discreet anyway hes a man hell want to play away too think reciprocity what about children what about children what if im expected to produce theres a royal line to be continued here wellmaybe youre not fertile i am you checked i checked so go on the pill tell him theyre headache tablets hell never know that is almost plausible anyway once youre in a stable relationship in fact once youre in two stable relationships with the kingprince and your beloved you may change your mind you may realise youve wanted children all along so you would have me believe hmm the prince his colouring is he ah darkcomplexioned compared to the beloved i mean could youwould it be possible no i dont think i want to look down that no youre right maybe not definitely not i could get beheaded or something they behead people for that sort of thing there actually they dont have the death penalty at all more civilised than the us in that respect yeah well fuck them how many aircraft carriers they got not a lot of call for aircraft carriers in landlocked himalayan states stealth bombers cruise missiles nukes youre right theyre pathetically illequipped to enter an escalating correctionalsystem conflict with old glory you do realise you could end up with three passports at the end of this dear holy shit i hadnt thought of that well you hold on i got a call waiting oh shit i got a bad feeling about this luce miss heggies was sitting on the parapet at the end of the milelong reflecting pool her feet dangling almost in the water her usually neatly bunned hair hanging down in grey lengths around her undone collar she didnt look round when i parked the old lancia on the gravel behind her i went up and sat with her on the stone my legs drawn up under my chin a very light rain what wed call a smir in scotland was falling from the bright grey overcast im very sorry miss heggies yes she said dully still staring at the flat water sorry i put my arm out tentatively she inclined millimetrically towards me she didnt exactly relax and start sobbing but she leant against me and put her arm round my waist patting me we sat like that for a while in scotland sometimes crying is called greeting and it only struck me then that it was odd that something you usually did when you were saying goodbye to somebody one way or another should also mean welcoming on the way back to the house i stopped and looked up at the place so did she gazing wonderingly at it as though taking in its baroque confections of stonework for the first time she sniffed buttoning the collar of her dress and tucking up her hair do you know whats happening to blysecrag ms telman apparently its going to the national trust but i think only on condition you get to stay she nodded i pulled a piece of paper out of my pocket and this is my inheritance she squinted at the note david rennell he used to be a gardener here nice lad mr ferrindonald found him a job with the company yes most recently just outside glasgow im sorry if this isnt a good time miss h but uncle freddy obviously thought this was important and id like to talk to mr rennell as soon as possible would you make the introduction of course ms telman i didnt really need the introduction from miss h apart from having my identity confirmed quickly uncle f had told david rennell to answer all my questions if i ever got in touch youve been in there yes ms telman there doesnt seem to be any big deal about it any more people are wandering in and out clearing up and that sort of thing he had a nice yorkshire accent call me kathryn ill call you david all right all right so david what was there what did you see just a big empty room there were containers for etching materials in there but i talked to one of the guys they were empty and just put in there the other day after everything was moved out what was moved out i dont know whatever it was it all disappeared in the middle of the night on the twentieth somebody saw a load of desks being shifted next morning i think some of them might still be around in the warehouse could you describe the room in more detail about ten metres by twenty ceiling the same height as the rest of the factory with the usual ducting and so on carpet tiles on the floor lots of cables lying around and coming out of opened conduits in the floor what sort of cables power cables lots of others like printer cables and that sort of thing ah i picked up a couple of connectors and plugs and so on ahhah well done could you possibly do me a favour david certainly and maybe take some time off i was to meet david rennell in the car park at carter bar right on the border between england and scotland it was a coolish blustery day the view from the shallow pass looking north into the undulating hills forests and fields of the scottish lowlands was moodily dramatic and changing all the time under the clouds that sped and tumbled above i got a veggie burger from a van at one end of the car park and sat eating it in the car very stakeout meeting on the border very cold war it had been a good drive id left the phone off for most of it just driving the aurelia across the moors on secondary roads thinking thinking a lot about uncle freddy about what a laugh hed been and how much i was going to miss him and the occasional invitation to blysecrag probably next time i wanted to go id have to pay and there would be a national trust shop and lots of those carminecoloured ropes with brass hookends attached to brass stands that corral visitors into the accepted circular route in your average english stately home ah well it would mean more people would get a chance to see the weird old place for the good in the end no grouching about that uncle freddy was another matter another one dead my real mother mrs telman last year her husband technically my adopted father according to the legal paperwork ten years earlier not that id seen him more than once now freddy i wondered if my biological father was still alive probably not the truth was i didnt want to know and if i was honest with myself id have to admit that id be relieved to discover he was no longer in the land of the living guilt about that was this the same as actually wishing him dead i didnt think so if id had the choice if somehow i could make him alive by thinking him so i would but i didnt want to meet him didnt want some bogus emotional reunion and anyway it didnt seem fair that he might have survived when the people id cared about most my mother mrs telman and uncle freddy were dead what had been his contribution to my life one drunken ejaculation then hed slapped my mother around gone into prison for theft come out to pursue his career as an alcoholic and turned up at my mums funeral to shout names at me and mrs telman at least hed had the decency not to contest the adoption or hed been bought off which was more likely and if he knew id become by his standards disgustingly rich hed never bothered me for cash i supposed i ought to make enquiries find out if he was still alive or not one of these days the drive went on the weather came and went sending rain and sun and sleet and slush the high roads across the moors were wild and grey one moment then sunbright and fresh with purple heather the next i stopped at hexham to put some fourstar into the aurelias tank and was reminded of the calibratory nature of travelling in a covetable car if guys in garages start to admire the car more than you youre getting old honours even then i drove on into the north david rennell arrived in a dark blue mondeo i bought him a burger and a soda and we sat in the steamedup aurelia for all the world like a marriedtoothers couple having a clandestine meeting towards the end of the affair rain beat on the roof david rennell was a tall wirylooking guy with short auburn hair bless him hed brought a couple of polaroids of the desks theyd moved out of the mysterious nolongertopsecret room in the middle of the silex plant not ordinary desks too many shelves lots of holes in the flat surfaces for cables hed brought a handful of the connectors and plugs that had been lying around the place that one looks like a phone jack except not he said hmm did you come up with anything else id asked him to have a think while he drove down here the usual nomatterhowtrivial stuff you see in cop shows i talked to somebody who saw one of the trucks that took the stuff away any hauliers name no they were just plain they didnt have any markings but the person i was talking to thought they looked like pikefrith trucks though he wasnt sure why means nothing to me im afraid pikefrith was a wholly owned subsidiary of ours one of the few european companies that specialised in shifting delicate scientific instruments and sensitive computer gear come to think of it their trucks did appear slightly different from your average lorry if you looked carefully enough or were into the subtleties of truck design air suspension i just nodded oh yes and the essex kids have all disappeared they all seemed glad to see the back of them up there he pronounced it oop there which was really rather cute who the hell are the essex kids its what the silex people called this lot that have just left they mostly worked in the room and they kept themselves to themselves bit brash though so they say had a big party on the friday and then never showed up on the monday all transferred i felt confused were they really from essex i think they were from down south dont know about essex and freddy said you saw adrian poudenhaut there at the factory yes just last week i felt my eyes narrow as i looked at him youre absolutely certain it was him david rennell nodded positive ive met him a few times helped him get some of mr ferrindonalds cars started reloaded for him when he was shooting did he see you no but it was him definitely things that make you go hmm we went our separate ways i drove back a different route to blysecrag still favouring the picturesque broads even when the sun went and night descended i had many more miles to think stuff over the lancia really was a hoot to drive uncle freddys funeral was in three days i had plenty of time to visit london chapter eleven suzrin house stands in whitehall in london the only nongovernmental building left on that stretch of the embankment it looks out over the river towards the sixties concrete brutalism of the national theatre complex like an ancient grizzled gunslinger regarding an upstart cowboy just arrived in town it is spectacularly ugly in a brooding noxious sort of way its main dark brown rectangular towerblock slopes inward slightly and is set back from the thames separated from it by a huge glassedin section several storeys tall whose roof rises from the embankment side towards the main block enormous ornamental windows stare from the very top of the main tower i used to wonder why the whole thing looked so familiar from a distance until i realised it was shaped like a giant oldfashioned cash register the place is part office part apartment block it was where adrian george worked i took the train from york to london the morning after freddy died calling ag en route and arranging lunch i was sorry to hear about old freddy ferrindonald yeah it was a shame do you have anything in particular in mind for lunchtime i thought italian i meant agendawise not particularly i lied we met in a fairly swish french place adrian george favoured in covent garden he wasnt big on italian food he wasnt big on drinking either citing a heavy workload that afternoon ag was shortish but trim and dark and handsome i could remember him when his eyebrows met in the middle but maybe hed lost out on too many girls whose mothers had warned them about men with hirsute foreheads because it looked as if now he shaved that centre line we conversed pleasantly enough company gossip mostly he was one of those people i got on best with through email just as luce was somebody i found it better to talk to on the phone i only mentioned his reported sighting of colin walker hazletons security chief in london a month earlier right at the end of our meal he tried not to react laughing it off as mistaken identity he insisted on picking up the bill i said id go back to suzrin house with him the weather was cool windy and dry and i thought we might walk along the strand or the embankment but he wanted to take a taxi he chattered i already knew all i needed to once wed gone through security in the lobby we went our separate ways he up to the exec floors me to the basement to see an old friend that ones a bellk connector allan fleming was as usual a mess hed been in a wheelchair for twenty years since a climbing accident in his teens and despite having a very nice wife called monica who was totally devoted to him and turned him out neatly every day it usually only took him minutes after he arrived at work to look as if hed spent the last month sleeping rough sometimes he accomplished this between the garage where he parked his converted mini and his workshop allan was suzrin houses resident computer nerd his workshop somewhere deep under the main building and way below the surface of the thames even at low water was like a museum of computing filled to its high ceilings with bewildering amounts of electronic hardware ancient and modern but mostly ancient which in computer terms for the truly seriously antediluvian stuff of course meant about the same age as him or me wed known each other since postgrad days when wed both been in that years security intake before id come to my senses and left to be a proper exec specialising in hitech allan was in charge of computer and it security specifically here in suzrin and the other outlying london offices but in effect along with a few other similarly gifted geekwizards in the states also anywhere the business had modems and computers he was our insurance against hackers if he couldnt worm his way into your system probably nobody else could either id shown him the plugs and other bits and pieces that david rennell had brought me from silex whats a bellk connector i asked staring at his cardigan and wondering how hed managed to get so many buttons done up through the wrong holes i bet he hadnt left the house like that its a specialist phoneline connector he said pulling absently at some of his curly brown hair and twisting it so that it stood out from his head like a tiny horizontal pigtail a dedicated land line probably very high capacity especially for the time better than isdn made by bell laboratories as you might expect in the states still copper technology however your next step up would be your optical what was its time oh just a few years ago sort of thing you might find in a chipmanufacturing plant hmm allan turned the little connector over in his hands then took off his unfashionably largeframed glasses and blew on each lens in turn holding them up to the light and blinking not particularly you wouldnt want it for telephony purposes id have thought and your standard parallel serial and scsi ports would handle most nonspecialist applications i thought this was specialist yes as i said but this is for specialist telephonic applications such as allan replaced his glasses asquint on his nose he rocked back in the chair and looked thoughtful actually the place youd most likely see something like this would be in the stock exchange or a futures market somewhere like that they use high capacity dedicated land lines so i understand i sat back in the ancient peeling plywood and black tubing seat an idea forming in my mind i pulled the polaroid of a desk out of my pocket see this allan sat forward and peered its a desk he said helpfully i flipped the photograph round and looked at it myself well my copy of janes book of fighting desks is not to hand but now you mention it he took the photo from my hand and studied it yes lots of holes for cabling and that extra level that raised shelf it does look a little like the sort of desk that might belong to a commodities trader or someone of a similar nature doesnt it yes yes it does doesnt it kate im in a fucking meeting what the hell is so important you have to get me called out of it im at your dentists mike mr adatai is quite rightly concerned i need you to tell him to let me see your file you what you pull rank on me for that look dont blame me i thought you were supposed to be here in london i didnt know you were going to go jetting off to frankfurt yes to meet some very important oh for christs sake what is all this about quickly kate please i need to get back in there its very important i see your dentalrecords file michael im going to hand you over to mr adatai now please authorise him to let me see it then you can get back to your meeting okay okay put him on the standard human mouth contains thirtytwo teeth mike daniels must have had good conscientious parents who got him to brush his teeth thoroughly after each meal and snack and in the evening before retiring because he had had a full set with just a couple of fillings in lower bicuspid molars when hed been drugged in a london club a month earlier had about half of his teeth removed and then been left in his own bed in his flat in chelsea i sat in mr adatais warm and luxurious waiting room with a bunch of recent vogues well this was chelsea national geographics of course and country lifes i thought of the dowager queen in her giant bed in the old palace and sitting in that warmth shivered i looked at the diagram of mike daniels teeth i took a note of those that had been taken and those that had been left i closed the file stared at a potted palm across the room and did some mental arithmetic in base ten a tenfigure number two point one billion and some change no need to use your fingers at all my mouth went dry from the start that morning id considered staying in london overnight and had brought a few bits and pieces in a travelling bag but in the end after leaving mr adatais in fact on the kerb while the taxi was pulling up i decided to head back to yorkshire i rang miss h to tell her id be staying at blysecrag that night we had dinner on the train my laptop and i looking through a load of files id downloaded about the pejantan island deal and the shimani aerospace corporation this was the deal that mike daniels had been flying out to tokyo to sign when hed been dentally assaulted hence the anguished call to me that night in glasgow pejantan island is a piece of guanocovered rock in the middle of the southern part of the south china sea between borneo and sumatra it is to put it politely undistinguished except for one thing it is almost bang on the equator shift the place three kilometres south and the zero degrees line would go straight over it its less than an hours flight from singapore just big enough for our purposes or rather the purposes of the shimani aerospace corporation for we were merely investors and it was uninhabited the idea was to build a spaceport there now this is highhorse territory for me though i do know what im talking about and it is my job but space and anything associated with getting into it is going to be so fucking big and soon its frightening space is already very big business indeed and its going to get a lot bigger in the near future the us through nasa europe through esa the russians the chinese the japanese and various other minor players are all desperate to grab as much of the launch market as possible and private enterprise is determined to catch up ive seen detailed plans of about a dozen different ways of getting into space even leaving out the exotic farfuture stuff like giant elevators rail guns and giant lasers using craft with helicopterlike rotors with rockets in the tips or well never mind the point is not that if were lucky one of them might just work its that all of them might work whatever method you use the best place to launch stuff into orbit is from the equator or as close to it as you can get which is why nasa chose southern florida for its spaceport and the su had to settle for the delights of kazakhstan the earth just through rotating gives you a free energy boost to help lob your payload above the atmosphere and that means you can lob more or use less fuel than you could if you launched from further up or down the curve towards the poles one spacelaunch concern in which i am delighted to say we have some investment is taking advantage of this by using two huge ships a commandandcontrol vessel and the rocketcarrying ship itself to send payloads up from the oceans on the equator the time before last that i was in scotland i got to clamber over the launch ship while it was in dry dock in greenock on the clyde it was just techy heaven these are real ships built for an entirely pragmatic unromantic unsentimental returnhungry consortium but they are just such a fabulous thunderbirdsstyle idea id have been seriously tempted to recommend investing in them just for the sheer mad beauty of the project happily it looks like a good business deal too but you never know the ships will only be able to handle stuff up to a certain size to be on the safe side were also the major investor in the shimani aerospace corporations pejantan island project which if all goes according to plan by will be sending stateoftheart rockets roaring into space with their valuable satellite cargoes this was heavy engineering cuttingedge technology and serious science the budget was jawdropping so were the returns if wed all got our sums right but the point was that the bigger the project and the bigger the budget the easier it is to hide things in both of them like this little item here a tracking station in fenua ua now why fenua ua i looked up a map of the pacific why not nauru or kiribati or even the fucking galapagos sipping my coffee somewhere around grantham i used the mobile and the laptops modem to do some more longrange web searching eventually as the train sped through the night picking up speed after doncaster deep in some otherwise entirely ignorable pr nonsense which just goes to show you never know where something useful will turn up i found a little video clip of kirita shinizagi chief executive officer of the shimani aerospace corporation visiting fenua ua earlier this year and inspecting the site for the new tracking station next stop york the guards voice said over the speakers while my head was somewhere between london tokyo fenua ua and pejantan island i disconnected the mobile from the computer the phone rang hazletons number came up on the display i hesitated two three rings before answering hello kathryn mr hazleton kathryn i was so sorry to hear about freddy thank you will you be able to make the funeral mr hazleton sadly no kathryn are you able to think straight or are you too distraught if this is a bad time to talk about things i can always wait i think i can still string two thoughts together mr hazleton what was it you wanted to talk about i wondered how you felt youd got on in thulahn i was going to ask before but of course we were rather overtaken by events when you realised that freddy was in hospital we never did finish that conversation no we didnt i recall that at the time i was about to ask you if youd had any hand in suggesting to the prince that he ask me to marry him you were i dont understand kathryn why would i want to interfere in your private life thats all right mr hazleton ive had more time to think since then the question no longer applies i see i confess i wasnt entirely sure id heard you right when you told me that at the time however ive spoken to suvinder since and yes he was and is very serious about it i understand you turned him down thats very sad of course its entirely your decision and you must do as you see fit but the prince did sound very dejected hes a better man than i thought he was at first mr hazleton ive come to like him but i dont love him ah well there we are then this has as you can imagine all become rather more complicated because of that development are you still thinking of the proposition jebbet and tommy put to you yes good the amount of power invested in whoever takes up the post there would be very considerable you might have decided not to become queen of thulahn kathryn but you could still be something like the president what do you think have you had any thoughts or would it now be too awkward with suvinder there oh ive had thoughts mr hazleton youre being very cryptic kathryn is there somebody there with you cant you talk theres nobody here i can talk im still thinking very seriously about taking up the post in thulahn but you havent come to a decision yet not yet you couldnt give us a balanceofprobabilities assessment even which way youre leaning as it were there are very strong reasons for going and very strong ones for staying where i am its too delicately balanced so no im afraid i cant but once ive made my decision ill stick with it and when do you think that will be kathryn i think another few days should do the trick well we shall just have to be patient shant we kathryn yes sorry about that of course there is the other matter isnt there i dont want to have to push you on that too but it has been a couple of weeks now you mean that bmovie you provided me with yes i was wondering if youd come to any decision on that too yes i have stephen we need to talk call when you can voice or this uncle freddy had a vikings funeral his coffin was placed in an old motorboat one of those polished wooden things with two tandem separate seating compartments and a stern deck that slopes in a curve all the way down to the water it had been filled with various flammable stuff and moored out in the centre of the lake where wed fished a few weeks earlier a crowd of us a big crowd too given that freddy hadnt had many relatives looked on one of his drinking cronies from the pub in blysecrag village was an archer he had one of those elaborate modern bows that looks much more complicated than any gun with balancing weights sticking out apparently at random and all sorts of other bits and pieces he loaded up an arrow with a big bulging head made of bound rags soaked in petrol another drinking chum lit it and then he shot it out towards the motorboat the arrow made a noise i will never forget as it curved up through the clear cool air uncle freddys pal was obviously very good or hed done this before because that one shot was all he needed the arrow slammed dramatically into the woodwork the flames caught and spread and the boat was soon ablaze from end to end i stood watching it burn thinking that there were probably all sorts of terribly british and very sensible rules and regulations about the proper disposal of bodies that were being flouted here well fuck them if they cant take a joke freddy the man who put the fun in funeral uncle f left me a small landscape painting id once admired not by anybody famous and not valuable just nice and something to remember him by what do you give the girl who has everything your undivided attention of course so having not bequeathed me the entire house and estate of blysecrag freddy did the next best thing and left me something i would be able to pack in a bag and take away with me the charm monsters the business conjurations and interludans division had been kept at bay by the terms of uncle freddys will i think miss heggies was grateful for that though there wasnt much she could do about the presence of maeve watkins still they seemed to get along politely enough miss h serving mrs w tea in the drawing room with a civility that was one notch up from frosty and mrs w seeming slightly embarrassed and modestly grateful the company was represented by madame tchassot the other level one apart from hazleton whod been at the weekend party at blysecrag three weeks earlier i asked to have a word with her alone we sat in blysecrags toweringly impressive library she settled her small elegant frame into a seat carefully smoothing her black skirt under her bony legs what is it that concerns you kathryn she looked around then pulled a small container like a powder compact from her handbag oh do you think it is permitted to smoke in here i dont know you dont mind if i do her accent was confusing halfway between french and german no i dont she offered me a cigarette which i refused she lit up the little container was a closable ashtray she placed it on the table at her side i understand you might be moving to thulahn she said tapping the end of the dunhill gently against the edge of the little ashtray though the ash wasnt ready to come off yet i watched this trying to judge how much to say trying to think back to what i knew of madame tchassot how close was she to hazleton the fact that she was supposed to have a thing going with adrian poudenhaut didnt mean much by itself if it did mean anything beyond the purely personal it might even mean that hazleton was using poudenhaut to keep an eye on her though it might mean something else too possibly she blinked behind her small glasses the rumour i have heard is that prince suvinder has proposed to you she smiled that is very interesting yes it is isnt it i wondered at one stage if that had somehow been set up set up how do you mean i mean that somebody or some people at the highest level of the business decided that having an agreement with the prince legal or otherwise wasnt good enough to guarantee that thulahn was really ours and that having one of our own highlevel execs married to the ruler would be a far more satisfactory way of cementing the relationship between us and thulahn ah yes i see but it would be something of a long shot yes not that long perhaps the people concerned already knew that the prince waskeen on me and i was sounded out first by mr dessous and then by mr cholongai i misinterpreted at the time i thought they were really trying to find out how suited i would be to becoming a sort of ambassador to thulahn which is the pretext that was used to get me to go there i thought they were worried that i was insufficiently committed not so much to the company as to the idea of personal monetary success and i suppose laissezfaire capitalism itself what they were really worried about i think is that i was too committed to those things she blinked can one be i think so if you are hoping that the person concerned might find something in a poor underdeveloped third world country that she cant find in her very comfortable existence in one of the richest parts of the richest state in the richest country in the world i have heard that thulahn is enchanting madame tchassot said persuading some ash to drop from her cigarette i have never been there she looked over her glasses at me would you recommend a visit in a personal or a business capacity she looked surprised i think one may only savour enchantment in a personal capacity no of course madame tchassot may i ask if what im talking about here is all new to you or did you already know of anything like this before but kathryn if all that you are speculating about had been spoken about at my level you would be asking me now to reveal what the board has discussed you must know that i cannot do that she smiled and put one hand to her tightly gathered hair however there are less formal occasions when such subjects arise between board members and in that context i can tell you that there was some talk of you being just the right person to represent us in thulahn and the point was made that the princes high regard for you would be to the good in this respect i do not think that any of us thought for one moment he would make you a proposal of marriage for my part and i mean no disrespect i would have imagined that he would want to marry or would be obliged to marry someone of a certain social class thats what i thought apparently not hmm that is also interesting she looked thoughtful have you made a decision yet kathryn i told the prince no oh the rumour i heard was that you were undecided well that might be unfortunate or fortunate would you still consider the post in thulahn i am still considering it good i hope you did not turn the prince down only because you thought that we had manoeuvred you into the position of being asked no i turned him down because i dont love him she seemed to think about this we are so lucky arent we she said to be able to marry for love this was probably as distracted as i was ever going to get her do you know anything about the silex thing madame tchassot she frowned no what is the silex thing im not sure i thought perhaps you could tell me im afraid i cannot then i may have to ask mr hazleton ah mr hazleton do you think he knows about it he may silex is a chipmanufacturing plant in scotland there seemed to be something odd about it i was looking into it i paused i think adrian poudenhaut was too i wondered if hed said anything to you why would he do that kathryn now there was a reaction she coloured faintly my bet was that madame tchassot was either an extraordinarily gifted actress or shed been telling the truth so far i hear rumours too madame tchassot i said i gave a small nervouslooking smile and lowered my eyes im sorry if ive embarrassed you adrian and i are close kathryn but we do not discuss businesshow should i say gratuitously of course i smiled in what i hoped was a friendly way i was hoping to have a word with adrian about the matter but please dont say anything to him ill go through mr hazleton we talked a little more after that madame tchassot smoked a few more cigarettes telman mr dessous hello how the hell are you telman what can i do for you and why did this call have to be scrambled yeah and why arent you calling me jeb like i told you im fine jeb you mad as hell im sorry to hear that whats happened damn feds took away my scuds thats what oh dear do you mean scud missiles of course what the hell else would i mean thought id hidden them too good those fornicating interfering scumbags must have been tipped off informer in the ranks telman least youre not on the list of suspects i never did tell you where they were hid did i not that i can recall where were they inside a couple of grain silos my idea grain silos missile silos clever huh thought that would be the last place anybodyd look if they ever did come snooping around didnt they do that in a man from uncle episode what im sure there was a man from uncle episode where the bad guys hid missiles in grain silos long time ago of course damn you mean it wasnt an original idea hells teeth telman no wonder they guessed never watched the programme myself serves me right for not being more into popular culture i guess one of those fbi bozos must have seen the same episode as you telman maybe we havent got a turncoat here after all maybe not so telman whats up freddy ferrindonald jeb oh yeah sorry to hear about that you there for the funeral yes its just finished so telman thulahn hazleton says you told the prince to go to hell that true no jeb i just refused his offer of marriage same thing to a guy telman you going to tell me old suvinder dont feel like hes been kicked in the teeth i hope he doesnt feel that we parted on what i thought were very good terms telman any guy with a nickels worth of brain cells thinks long and hard before asking a girl to marry him and if he isnt only asking because hes got her pregnant and he feels he ought to ask then he gets nervous as hell worrying about what shes going to say this guys a prince not only has he got his own future to think of hes got the future of his whole damn country to think about too plus the way the people round him see it and probably him too is hes doing you a big favour and making a huge sacrifice even thinking about asking you because youre not some princess or lady or something youre a level three exec youre probably a lot better off than the prince but that doesnt seem to be what matters to these people its breeding pile of horse manure if you ask me but thats the way it is and the fact remains that even if we bumped you up to level two youd still be just some kid out of a project in scotland schemes we call them schemes in scotland jeb but i take the point however i think i let suvinder down as gently as possible and i hope well still be friends hooey frankly telman you dont think thats possible i doubt it youve wounded the mans pride and if and when the prince does get hitched and youre around no selfrespecting wifes going to let him stay buddies with you well i may not be there anyway im still thinking about whether to take the post in thulahn or not so i hear well dont take for ever okay we aint got that long so what you going to do now im going to ask you if you know what happens to fenua ua once we complete the deal with thulahn jesus wept telman you be careful what youre saying will you this call might be encrypted or whatever you call it but what happens jeb what do you mean what happens nothing happens that bunch of foodcoupongrabbing goodfornothing welfare dumbasses get whatever they can from the us the french and the brits before the dung hits the fan we get the hell out and they go back to incest and alcoholism why the hell are you so concerned about them all of a sudden jesus telman you havent gone soft on us just because you saw a few sherpas and their cute little kids have you you might get to be our representative to thulahn telman you aint our ambassador to the fucking un goddamnit telman now youve got me swearing what the hells wrong with you jeb mr dessous what i suspect were getting couffabled there was a near silence at the other end of the line listening carefully through the odd lilt of white noise the scrambling circuit added to the connection i could just hear dessous breathing i hadnt even been sure that he would recognise the name of the french exec whod cheated the business out of what it saw as rightly its own over a century ago obviously he did he cleared his throat you serious telman im afraid so okay so how significant is the operation its at your level jeb another pause the hell it is huh i thought maybe you were in on it but now i dont think you are uhhuh but i dont know enough yet and i cant start accusing anybody i just wanted someone to know i see well you be careful what youre getting into there telman im trying to be in the evening after the funeral and after all the rest of the mourners had left miss heggies and i sat up round the fire in the little living room just off the main kitchen drinking whisky and reminiscing madame tchassot had been chauffeured back to leedsbradford and her lear jet the locals had retreated to the pub where uncle f had put a couple of grand behind the bar for them to have a proper wake to mourn his passing and mrs watkins had returned to her leeds hotel freddys few relations all distant had made themselves so despite having been invited to stay i got the impression miss h was relieved they hadnt accepted i hoped i wasnt spoiling things by being the only one to stay and after a couple of drams i said as much oh youre no trouble ms telman id suggested we might try first names but miss h had seemed almost girlishly embarrassed and shaken her head its always been a pleasure to have you here even the time i got stuck in the dumbwaiter ah well you werent the first or the last this had happened the second time id been brought to blysecrag by mrs telman when id been ten the first time id been so stunned and awestruck by the place id barely dared to sit down when id visited a second time id been a lot more blasé and had decided to explore the dumbwaiter id elected to do some of my exploring in had got stuck and it took several strong men a couple of hours to rescue me uncle freddy had thought it was all quite a hoot and had sent down supplies of cakes and lemonade to my intense embarrassment hed also hollered down that i was just to shout out if i needed a chamberpot lowered to me too has anyone ever explored every single nook and cranny of this place mr ferrindonald did when he first bought it miss heggies said and i think i have though im not sure you can ever be certain you never get lost not for years sometimes i have to think where i am mind miss heggies sipped at her whisky mr ferrindonald used to tell me he knew of secret passages that he wasnt telling me about but i think he was just teasing me he always said hed leave the map in his will but well im going to miss freddy i said miss heggies nodded he could be a rascal sometimes but he was a good employer and a friend to me she looked sad were you glad he never married she looked sharply at me glad ms telman im sorry i hope you dont mind me asking i just always felt that this was almost as much your house as his and if hed brought a wife here well youd have had to share the place with her too i hope id have got on as well with her as i did with him miss heggies said only a little defensively i suppose it would have depended on the wife but i would have done my best what if uncle freddy had married mrs watkins could you have got on with her she looked away i think so she seemed pleasant enough i thought yes pleasant enough do you think she loved him miss heggies drew herself up in her chair and smoothed her hair with one hand i really wouldnt be able to say ms telman i hope she did dont you it would be good to know that someone loved him everyone should have that she was silent for a while i think many of us did in our various ways did you miss heggies she sniffed and looked into her whisky glass i had a lot of affection for the old rogue whether youd call it love i dont know she looked me in the eye we were neverlinked ms telman she looked at the ceiling and around the walls except by this place i see any road in the end it isnt my house ms telman never was i am a servant he could have dismissed me at any time i dont mean that he ever threatened me with that or ever reminded me of it just that its always at the back of your mind well that cant happen now she nodded it was very good of mr ferrindonald to leave me the flat and to provide for me will you stay here once its handed over to the national trust she looked mildly shocked of course i imagine they might want to employ you actually i think theyd be foolish not to would you work for them i might she nodded it would depend if i was wanted id be happy to i suspect uncle freddy would have liked that do you definitely she looked round again took a deep breath and said this has been my love ms telman this place ive been in service here one way or another for nearly fifty years since i left school for your uncle his business the army and the cowle family ive never thought to marry never wanted to blysecrags been all ive ever needed she lifted her head up there are those here and in the village who think ive missed out on life but i dont think i have not at all theres plenty of others to fall in love and have lots of children ive given my life to this house and i havent regretted itwell not for more than an hour or two at a time and then not often she gave a small flickering vulnerable smile we all have our blues dont we but i wouldnt have changed anything if i could have she laughed lightly and swirled her whisky as she looked at it goodness me listen to me ill be dancing on the tables next i raised my glass to blysecrag i said and so we drank a toast to the place and maybe to places in general suvinder hi how are you oh kathryn im sorry i did not mean to call you i must have pressed the wrong button umm are you well you sound sleepy thats okay im fine you all right i am well but i had better go or you will be upset with me say you forgive me for calling you so late i forgive you i bid you good night kathryn good night sweet prince oh kathryn thats a quotation suvinder i know but you said it to me i shall sleep well good night dearest kathryn i rang adrian poudenhaut the following morning he was in italy picking up his new ferrari from the factory in modena hed be driving it back to the uk over the next couple of days i told him i wanted to meet up with him and he sounded surprised so i reckoned madame tchassot hadnt said anything to him we arranged to rendezvous in switzerland the following day chapter twelve miss heggies drove me to york in her old volvo estate i think we both had slight hangovers i took a gner train to london tea reasonable opened the laptop but beyond playing a few variations with the calculator on a certain tenfigure number didnt do anything just sat staring out of the window and decided the best bit of the east coast main line was definitely from york northwards not south played k d langs ingenue on the walkman and sang along in my head where is your head indeed kathryn taxi to heathrow annoying driver did not take im reading a newspaper hint and only finally shut up when i put the earphones in played kate and anna mcgarrigles matapedia all the way along the m folk not the sort of thing im usually into but just sublime degree of tearfulness at some of the tracks running repairs to face required in lounge rest room gave self talking to swissair flight to geneva service coolly correct and flawless as usual lwb silvercoloured series company car to château doex elderly but efficient driver called hans thankfully silent switzerland where the money comes i have mixed feelings about the place on the one hand it is sumptuously beautiful in a rugged blatant and snowy way and everything works on the other hand they shout at you for crossing the street when theres no traffic visible for miles just because the crossing signal is showing a red man not a green man and if you pass them in a car doing a kilometre more than the legal limit they honk their horns and flash their lights plus its where all the third world dictators and other assorted robbing bastards stash the loot theyve sucked out of their own countries and their own people this is a whole country where money goes to money this is one of the richest nations on earth and some of the dosh comes from some of the poorest countries who once theyve been bled dry by the latest thieving scumbag then get the imf stepping in with orders to tighten their belts somehow being whisked along the n towards lausanne in the midst of all the other beemers mercs audis jags bentleys rollers lexi and the rest it all looked even more selfsatisfied and opulent than it usually did the snowtopped mountains around the lake alone appeared aloof from it all even those though didnt look quite the same any more one of the things ive always liked about switzerland is that theyve civilised a lot of their hills you can get cable cars up there you can drive up them between them through them and underneath them or climb into a train and be clunked and trundled to cafés and restaurants at the top where the only things more breathtaking than the views are the prices then you can ski back down i always appreciated that that accessibility that refusal to treat each and every peak as something which absolutely had to be left pristine so that only the mountaineers and the local fauna ever got to appreciate it and i still liked the idea in theory yet now looking at the peaks across the lake i couldnt help comparing them unfavourably with those of thulahn and almost scorning them for being so compromised so tamed fuck me i thought im going native i gave a single snort of laughter through my nose hans the whitehaired driver glanced at me saw i wasnt trying to attract his attention and promptly looked away again i slipped joni ms latest into the walkman but only half listened id left my phone off for the journey as far as geneva id switched it back on when i got into the bmw but deliberately hadnt checked on any messages or previous callers it rang as we were passing vevey and turning up into the mountains for the long loop round to château doex i looked at the incoming number i found myself smiling hello kathryn suvinder how are you i am well i thought i might call at a more civilised hour and enquire how everything went at freddys funeral it was bad enough that i could not come myself but well there was so much to be done here and i had just come back did it all goi dont know the right word fittingly it did a vikings funeral i had to explain to suvinder about what a vikings funeral was and miss heggies sends her regards that is kind of her she always made me feel most welcome i used to find her scary at first but i had a good long talk to her at just last night i looked up at the mountains around us yes kathryn hello sorry yes a good talk suvinder yes nah nothing id been going to say i might be back in thulahn before too long but i didnt know how to say something like that to him without investing it with too much in the way of implication so i settled for how is everybody all here are well though my mother learned of my proposal to you and was highly upset she is still not speaking to me for which alone i owe you a favour i think suvinder shame on you for saying such a thing you should go to her and try to make amends i will not apologise for what i asked nor will i retract my offer to you not even to please her she must learn to move with the times and also that i am the ruler not her well good for you but you should still try to make up i suppose i should yes you are right i will see her tomorrow if she will see me well id send her my regards but i dont think it would be a good idea for you to mention that i think it would be politic not to i heard him sigh kathryn i must go okay suvinder you look after yourself all right i will you too i clicked the phone off i sat there tapping its little warm black body against my other hand looking out at the mountains and thinking château doex is as ive said the closest thing we have to a world hq the compound starts just above the town itself on the far side of the railroad tracks it doesnt look like much considering a big old château that looks like it cant decide whether it really is a château or a schloss lots of grounds the sort of grounds that get bigger the longer you look at them following walls and fences that are as discreetly concealed as possible and a mountainside scattered with smaller buildings and houses blysecrag is a far more impressive sight the bit above ground however is not even half the story some people have tried to nickname the place the iceberg because so much of it is hidden under the surface in the dusk château doex the town looked rich and neat and tidy as ever it had snowed recently and the place looked quite picturesque in a neat and tidy way i swear they clean the slush the road to the compound swept over the railway and up to a tall set of gates and a designer guardhouse one of the three guards recognised me and nodded but they checked my passport anyway the gates hummed open with an inertiarich deliberation that would make you wary of taking anything flimsier than a main battle tank through them uninvited the series purred upwards past the trees and the crisply white lawns and pastures its way lit by ornamental light clusters with three softly glowing white globes apiece and on about every fifth or sixth lamp a little cctv camera the château swung into view tastefully floodlit and looking chocolatebox pretty against the black and white of the wooded mountainside beyond above it necklaces of white road lights wiggled on up the slope to higher buildings the mostly male staff at the château went gliding around whitejacketed efficient seeming to do the old miss heggies trick of materialising and dematerialising at will i was welcomed with nods and clicked heels my bags disappeared apparently of their own volition my coat slipped silently and almost unnoticed from my shoulders and i was escorted through the baroque and glowing foyer towards the gleaming elevators in the dreamlike state that usually afflicted me here i nodded to people i knew exchanged travel pleasantries with the whitejacketed guy carrying my briefcase but it all seemed dissociated from reality if youd asked me when i got to my room and was settling in which language id been talking to the guy in the white jacket i couldnt have told you for sure my room looked down the slope of the mountainside towards the town the mountains across the valley were the colour of the moon the room was large the sort of space hotels tend to call a mini suite it had antique furniture two balconies a bigger bed than usual and a bathroom with a separate shower stall flowers chocolates and newspapers had been delivered and a halfbottle of champagne you become very sensitised to the minutiae of business perks and privileges over the years and the precise level of luxury that greets you at château doex is entirely the most accurate guide to how youre doing within your current status in the hierarchy this was up to level two standards the champagne was only a halfbottle but then i was by myself and it doesnt do to encourage ones guests to get too sozzled before dinner and it was vintage big plus the phone rang and the general manager of the château welcomed me and apologised for not being able to greet me in person i assured him everything was fine and to my taste i took dulsungs little artificial flower and stuck it in a glass on the bedside table it looked tiny and forlorn there even cheap what if the staff threw it out i picked it up and put it back on my jacket in the buttonhole but it didnt look right there either so i stuck it inside bending the stalk through the buttonhole in the single internal pocket so that it was secure dinner was promptly at eight in the main dining room there were maybe a hundred or so staffers i gossiped with the best of them before during and after the château is usually the place to find out whats going on in the business mostly people wanted to find out what was going on in thulahn from me the quality of the questions they asked indicated the accuracy of the rumours theyd heard and corresponded pretty accurately to their level in the company had i just come back from fenua ua no was there some backup deal being arranged in thulahn in case fenua ua went bellyup at the last moment i couldnt say was i going to be president of fenua ua unlikely was the deal done yet or not i really couldnt say had the prince really proposed to me yes had i accepted no so i answered a lot of questions but i was able to ask a lot in return and people were happier than they might have been otherwise to share all they knew or felt about a whole host of subjects at the end of that evening even if only for a short time i probably knew as much about the business as a whole as anybody did regardless of level madame tchassot who kept a house in the grounds was present at the meal and after it the only level one we talked for a few minutes over brandy in the drawing room and she seemed quite friendly she would be spending the next few days at her own place near lucerne adrian tells me youre meeting him tomorrow kathryn thats right i wanted to talk to him i smiled he seems very proud of his new car i think he said sounds nice she smiled thinly red is not his colour but he insisted well it is a ferrari i think its almost compulsory you are meeting for lunch yes in a place near the grimsel pass he recommended it she looked uncertain you will take good care of him yes of course i said what was she talking about she was staring intently at her glass she didnt think i had any designs on his tumid butt did she thank you he isimportant to me very dear of course i understand ill try to make sure he leaves me in one piece i laughed lightly why hes not a bad driver is he i was thinking of asking for a drive in the ferrari no no he is a perfectly fine driver i think well thats a relief i raised my glass to careful drivers indeed in my dream i was in a great house in the mountains there was bright moonlight and starlight but the stars were wrong and i remember thinking i must be in new zealand the great house was built on a vast rumpled landscape of spired and crevassed ice tipped between two mountain ranges it didnt seem in the least strange to me that the building had been constructed on a glacier though the whole place creaked and trembled as it moved with the rest of our immediate landscape down the vast slow river of ice with each rumble and creak beneath us a host of diamond chandeliers tinkled mirrors flexed and distorted and cracks appeared in the ceilings and walls sprinkling white dust whiteoveralled servants rushed to repair the fissures clattering up ladders and shinning up skinny poles to slap fresh plaster across the faults raining white damp dots this happened a lot we held umbrellas above us as we walked through the huge echoing rooms marble statues were real people who had stood too long in one place under the drizzle of plaster teams of yaks moved through constantly branching tunnels in the ice beneath us only surfacing at the great house where their smiling roundfaced minders thanked us for soup and their beds in the many tents scattered across the icy scenery a masked man i knew not to trust was doing a complicated trick with cups and hats and my little netsuke monkey shifting them around the table while people placed bets and laughed the masked mans mouth was visible and he was missing lots of teeth but they werent really missing at all some had been blacked out as though he was an actor i woke up wondering where i was again thulahn not cold enough but then id been moved to a more hotellike room but still not thulahn i remembered the smell of the heavenly luck tea house yorkshire no london no château doex ah yes nice room valley view alone nobody here i felt groggily across the bed no no one here monkey gone this monkeys gone to heaven wasnt that a pixies song dulsung why hadnt she been in my dream and whos this we anyway white man na nothing sleep again there was time to kill at the grimsel pass i sat in the series waiting for poudenhaut reading the herald tribune the phone rang and it was at last stephen kathryn hi sorry for the delay daniella was running a serious temperature and emma was away at one of her friends so i had to do the hospital thing shes okay now but well hence the delay thats all right its good to hear you what was it you wanted to talk about nothing too urgent i hope hold on i got out of the car only just beating happy hans my whitehaired chauffeur to the draw he had his cap on he was out of his door and reaching for the outside handle of my door while i was still pushing he drew the door fully open as i got out into the chill air of the early afternoon the car park was gravel uneven i nodded to hans and let him put my coat over my shoulders before i walked off heading away from the quaintly painted old wooden inn and the other cars and coaches kathryn i stopped at the low wall looking down the valley at the road winding into italy still here stephen i said listen what i have to tell you is pretty bad news oh yeah he sounded only a little wary at first what how bad i took a deep breath the air was cold i could feel its raw numbing touch in my nostrils and at the back of my throat and could sense it filling my lungs its about emma i told him he was silent mostly i told him all of it about the dvd hazletons involvement the dates and places and the obligation that hazleton expected of me he was so quiet i wondered if perhaps none of this was coming as a great shock at all maybe i thought they had an open relationship that hed never wanted to tell me about in case it encouraged me maybe hazleton had been upset that id told him id made my mind up but that i wasnt going to tell him what my decision was yet and he had told stephen but no stephen was just stunned he hadnt really started to guess or if he had entertained any suspicions whatsoever they had been the sort that occur to you unbidden as purely theoretical constructs the sort of thing that an imaginative mind throws up as a matter of course but which the moral self dismisses as preposterous and even feels shameful to be associated with he said yes once or twice and i see and right stephen im sorry silence thats hopelessly inadequate i know more silence i just hope youstephen ive thought about this for a long time two weeks i didnt know what to do i still dont know that im doing the right thing i think its all pretty horrible including hazletons part in it and making me have anything to do with it too i want you to know im not enjoying this im trying to be straight with you trying to be honest i could have got hazleton to let you know without me being all right he said loudly almost shouting then sorry all right kathryn i take the point i guess you did the right thing i looked up at the blue blue sky youre going to hate me for this arent you i dont know what im going to feel kathryn i feeli dont know winded yeah sort of winded like when you fall on your back and cant breathe buthey a lot worse you know yeah i know stephen im so sorry oh well i guess it had to be done jeez he sounded like he might be about to laugh or cry breath whistled out of him some start to the day is emma there no still awaywell just coming back today god the bitch you take it easy okay huh yeah sure sure ah and thanks i guess look call me whenever all right get your breath back but keep in touch call me later will you ah yeah yeah right ill goodbye kathryn goodbye good the phone clicked off bye i said i closed my eyes somewhere down the road in italy i could hear the muted rasp of a highperformance engine coming closer lunch was a disappointment poudenhaut couldnt stop talking about his car a shiny red softtop with a black hood hed driven me here in it keeping the revs below five thousand because even though the engine was meant to have been runin on the bench he just wanted to be sure hans and the bmw would appear here later to take me back to the château we were in a modern glass and steel restaurant in the trees above an archetypically twee village that looked like it was composed of scaledup cuckoo clocks on the hour you expected a door under the eaves to flap open and heidi to bounce out at the end of a giant spring we both drank spring water the food was swissgerman not my favourite cuisine so it was easy to save plenty of space for a pudding which was satisfyingly rich and chocolaty poudenhaut tore his gaze away from the ferrari again hed insisted on a table with a view of the car park yes why did you want to see me nettlegrasping time again i wanted to ask you what you were doing at the silex plant the other day his big puffy face stared at me over our gently steaming coffee he blinked a few times i wondered which way hed jump silex he said he frowned and concentrated on stirring some sugar into his espresso you know the chip plant in scotland what took you up there adrian i watched him decide he wasnt going for total denial something closer to the truth i was looking into something what was that well i cant say was this for mr hazleton he stirred his coffee slowly then brought the little cup to his lips mmhmm he said and sipped i see i said i take it he had his suspicions too then suspicions about what was going on in there he put on a serious face hmm his gaze flickered all over me come to any conclusions he shrugged how about you i sat closer leaning into the fragrant vapours rising from my coffee there was something hidden in there in the plant yes ideal place when you think about it chip factories have brilliant security anyway you know how much chips are worth more than their weight in gold so the places are really well guarded then theres the whole prophylactic rigmarole you have to go through to get into the production facilities all that changing and delay impossible to just charge in giving people inside time to hide stuff if you know somebody who might ask awkward questions is coming in plus there are all those deeply noxious chemicals they use the etching fluids the solvents and washes really nasty chemicalwarfare stuff any rational person would keep well away from so as well as all the usual security paraphernalia the guards and walls and cameras and so on and the sheer difficulty of accessing the place quickly youve got a serious health disincentive to go there in the first place its perfect the ideal place to hide whatever i took a look round three or four weeks ago but i couldnt find anything poudenhaut was nodding thoughtfully yes well thats what occurred to us too so what do you think it was or is oh its gone now but i think they had another assembly line going in there he blinked chips what else would you build in a chip plant hmm he said smiling briefly i see he pursed his lips and nodded staring at the table where the bill had just appeared ill get this i said picking up the check he reached out too late no please this is mine thats okay i got it i reached down for my handbag he snatched the bill out of my fingers male prerogative he said grinning i hid behind my best chilly smile and thought suddenly youre far too full of beans my lad he fished his company card out of his wallet so who do you think was cheating on us who was behind it the management at the plant ligence theyre our partners there right thats right obviously the upper management must have known you couldnt do it without them but i think it was somebody in the business he looked alarmed really oh dear thats bad any ideas what level your level adrian he paused blinking again his card poised halfway to the plate the check had arrived on my level level two i said reasonably spreading my hands oh yes the plate was taken away again so did you find out anything does mr hazleton have any ideas he made a clicking noise with his mouth we have our suspicions but it would be wrong to say anything at this point in time kathryn i waited until he was signing the card slip before i said of course it could be a level one conspiracy somebody at mr hazletons level his mont blanc hesitated over the tip line he added a round number that was a little on the mean side and signed mr hazleton has considered that possibility he said smoothly he nodded at the maître d and stood shall we grips like nothing else just listen to that engine isnt that wonderful i think you hear it better in a cabriolet even with the top up mmhmm i said id been reading the handbook i put it back in the glovebox with the spare set of keys and the purchase paperwork poudenhaut was a poor driver even allowing for the fact that he was trying to be kind to the engine he changed up too early and still didnt seem entirely to have the hang of the cars open gate his cornering was awful too and the fact the car was righthanddrive was no excuse either he seemed to think hitting the apex meant driving into the depths of the bend then jerking the wheel round in roughly the correct direction seeing where he was heading now then making any necessary corrections repeat as required until the road straightens we zoomed and dived along some wonderfully winding empty mountain roads in one of the best sports cars in the world but i was getting heartily sick of the experience he wouldnt even put the top down because clouds had moved in from the west and there had been a few flakes of snow id love a shot i said between corners would you let me drive just for a bit well i dont know theres the insurance it was the most worried hed sounded so far id love to let you kathryn but im insured but kathryn this is a ferrari ive driven ferraris uncle freddy used to lend me the daytona when i was staying at blysecrag sometimes oh well yes but thats frontengined you see quite different handling characteristics the is midengined much trickier on the limit he let me loose in the f too and of course i wouldnt be going anywhere near the limit he glanced at me he let you drive the f a couple of times i never drove the f he sounded like a disappointed schoolboy whats it like brutal brutal brutal we stopped at a semicircular gravel terrace on a wide corner near the summit of a pass just above the treeline he pulled the car up and tapped his fingers on the steering wheel then turned to me with a grin and let his gaze fall to my knees i was wearing a skirt and jacket silk blouse just businesslike nothing provocative if i let you have a shot of the car what do i get in return he reached out and put his hand on my knee it was warm and slightly damp i think i made my mind up then i lifted his hand off and put it back on his own thigh smiled and said well see he smiled shes all yours he got out he held the drivers door open for me i slipped in the engine was still running idling quietly the door closed with a thunk i felt in my bag pulled out my phone and checked the display we had signal i clicked the central locking while poudenhaut was moving round the front of the car he hesitated when he heard the locks click then tried the passengers door he bent down knocking at the window glass with one crooked finger hello may i come in he was still smiling i fastened my seatbelt i think youve been lying to me adrian i told him i tested the accelerator blipping the engine up towards the four thousand revs mark and letting it fall back again kathryn he said as though he hadnt heard me properly i said i think youve been lying to me adrian im not convinced you dont know more about this silex thing than youre letting on what the hell are you talking about i think you know exactly what im talking about adrian and id like to ask you a few more questions about what was really in there i reached into my bag and waved a piece of plastic and metal at him and needed lots of heavyduty phone connectors like this he stared through the glass with a look of utter fury then stood up glanced around and ran behind the car i watched in the rearview mirror while he found a couple of large rocks from the side of the road he ran back quickly and wedged them on either side of the cars offside rear wheel stamping them into place i reached over and tested the glovebox still open i pulled the keys out letting the engine die locked the glovebox on the key then restarted the engine poudenhaut clapped his hands free of dust as he came back to the window you were a bit slow there kathryn he said bending to look in at me he sat on the cars wing looking out at the road i could still hear his voice quite clearly through the hoods layers of fabric i suppose what we have here is a mexican standoff isnt that what they call it he swivelled at the hips and looked round at me through the windscreen come on kathryn if youre upset i put my hand on your knee if thats what this is all about well forget it ever happened i dont know what youre talking about with this silex thing and phone lines and so on but lets at least discuss it like adults youre just being childish come on let me back into the car what was really going on adrian was it a dealing room is that what you had in there was that what the hidden room was all about kathryn if you dont stop this nonsense im just going to have to he patted his breast pocket but his phone was in the car connected to a handsfree kit he smiled and spread his hands well i suppose ill just have to flag down the next car the swiss police wont be very happy about this kathryn if they have to get involved were you in on what happened to mike daniels adrian or was that just colin walker on his own well alone apart from the bimbo and the dentist he stared at me his mouth open he closed it and the wheeze of sending a number to mr shinizagi like that what was it a bank sort code account number that must have been mr hazletons idea right hes into numbers and puzzles and shit isnt he you can count to over a thousand using your fingers he ever mention that to you and of course if you use somebodys teeth as binary code you can count to over two billion or transmit up to a tenfigure number he came rushing around the car and started pulling at the passenger doors handle you just let me in now you fucking bitch you fucking smartassed bitch let me in now let me in or ill tear this hood off with my own hands your swiss army knifes in the glovebox with the spare keys ade oh what were you keeping the revs down to ade five thousand wasnt it i blipped the accelerator for longer this time the rev counters needle swung sharply up to six then seven thousand the rev counter was redlined at eight and a half thousand though it went up from there to ten thousand the engine screamed making a wonderful metallic spinetingling yowl a noise that must have echoed off nearby mountains and very possibly exceeded the driveby noise regulations of several swiss cantons what are you doing poudenhaut shouted stop that i stepped on the gas again the engine responded instantly producing another fabulous pulse of sound woah we were up to eight thousand that time adrian i told him nearly into the red hed given up pulling at the door handle possibly afraid that hed break it he was standing a couple of metres away looking utterly distraught and trembling whether with fear or rage it was hard to tell i stamped on the accelerator pushing it briefly to the floor this time the noise was crushing vast furious like a whole pride of lions screaming in your ear at once the needle on the rev counter flicked briefly into the red area on the dial then fell away again and clunked back towards the idling zone we hit the red zone there adrian cant be doing the car any good fuck off just fuck off fuck you fuck you you cunt its just fucking metal fuck you he looked like he was crying he turned on his heel and stamped off towards the road shoulders hunched i let him get to the metalled surface then floored the gas pedal and held it there for a few seconds the car quaked the engine screamed wailing like something in the utmost extremity of agony it would have been a hard thing to do for anybody with the slightest amount of mechanical sympathy and i wasnt enjoying it but then it was a means to an end and in the end our adrian was right it was just metal no matter what it sounded like the only real suffering was being done by him poudenhaut shook as he heard this noise then he spun round and came charging back he beat on the hood with his fists stop it stop it stop it my car stop it can you smell that adrian smells like burning oil or something dont you think oh look theres a red light on in here cant imagine that bodes too well i blipped the throttle again the engine caterwauled metallic and harsh that sound different to you i thought it sounded different that time more of a metallic edge seemed to me what do you think here have another listen stop it stop it youd better answer my questions adrian or soon im going to get bored and then ill just keep my foot planted pedal to the metal until the fucker seizes you fucking bitch here we go adrian all right what sorry i said i pressed a finger to the window lift depressing it slightly so that the window cracked open by about a centimetre he forced his fingers through the gap and tried to shove the window down further i hit the button again and the window started to lift trapping his fingers between the top edge of the glass and the fabriccovered metal frame of the hood he screamed shit i said i didnt think you could do that with a modern car i thought they were all supposed to have a sensor or something that stopped that happening poudenhaut tried to pull his fingers free but couldnt you fucking bitch my fingers what do you reckon adrian are ferrari above fitting that sort of nambypamby safety device or do you think its just not working i dont know im still not convinced that fiat have all the reliability concerns licked never mind going into the red again here ade another swinging rasping screaming bellow of noise all right what i lifted my phone and studied the display all right fucking let me go pardon adrian what was that i punched some numbers listened then hit some more i said all right cant you fucking hear me all right what i was still fiddling with the phone jabbing numbers i held it up to the window youll have to repeat that adrian it was a dealing room in silex yes so fucking what we could have fucking lost money too you know the value of your investments can go down as well as up i agreed it doesnt matter its all over we sent the money to shinizagi thats what he wanted daniels raped his daughter the fucker deserved worse who fucking cares anyway let me go ah my fucking fingers whats it all for adrian i asked still holding the phone up to the window what was the money for what is shinizagi supposed to do with it i dont know oh bad answer adrian could cost you a brand new engine i hit the throttle the engine zinged monstrously it really didnt sound right now i thought i caught a puff of ominously greyblue smoke in the rearview mirror i dont fucking know something to do with fenua ua maybe but he wouldnt tell me you fucking bitch my fingers are breaking hazleton wouldnt tell you no i didnt need to know its just a guess im just guessing hmm i said i let the window down a fraction you cunt he hissed and tried to shove his hands in towards my throat i leant back and pressed the window up again trapping him by the wrists he gurgled his fingers waving near my face like pink anemones i felt in my bag and brought out an aerosol can not wise adrian this is mace very bad for your eyes and mucous membranes could ruin your whole day i think you ought to back off ive already called the police if you behave yourself they may accept it was all a terrible mistake otherwise im going to get very tearful and upset and claim youve been trying to assault me put yourself in their place who would you believe you fucking bitch he sobbed ill fucking get you for this no adrian you wont because if you try to ill do much worse things to you than this now lean back lean back on your heels let your arms take your weight thats it i pressed the window lift button again down then up his hands pulled free as he staggered back he stood on the gravel rubbing his wrists and tenderly massaging his fingers his face streaked with tears i held the phone up so he could see it and hit the off button then dialled happy hans and told him where we were what about the police poudenhaut asked glancing warily up the switchback road dont worry i said i hadnt called the police just somebodys answerphone the mace wasnt mace either it was a can of armani i nodded at the low wall at the edge of the gravel semicircle why dont you go and sit down adrian i turned the cars engine off it sputtered down to silence then started to tick and click behind me poudenhaut kneaded his fingers and looked at me with an expression full of rage and hate but he went and sat down on the wall hans brought the series crunching on to the gravel about ten minutes later he parked opposite between me and poudenhaut then got out and held the door open for me i waved adrian goodbye and got in i looked back as we drove off when we were about a hundred metres up the road while poudenhaut was staring through the open door at the ferraris steering column and turning to look towards us i lowered my window and threw the s keys out kathryn mr hazleton ive spoken with adrian poudenhaut hes very upset yes i think id be upset in his situation too mr hazleton apparently you made some rather wild allegations about me which he might have seemed to confirm though of course it was done under considerable duress not the sort of thing that would stand up in court in fact the sort of behaviour that could very easily land you in court kathryn im not sure what you did to poor adrian isnt against the geneva convention where are you mr hazleton where am i kathryn yes mr hazleton we have these conversations on the phone and you quite often know where i am whether its in the middle of the himalayas or on an obsolete cruise liner but youre always just this placeless disembodied voice floating in from the airwaves for me i keep wondering where you are boston thats where you live in the states isnt it or egham on the thames thats your uk home isnt it maybe youre here in switzerland ive no idea id just like to know for once well kathryn im on a fishing boat off the island of st kitts in the caribbean weather nice a little hot whereabouts in switzerland are you im walking in the grounds of the château i lied i was nearby but not in the compound itself i was in a neat but damp little park in the town of château doex i could see the château through the trees on the other side of the valley if things were going according to plan hans the chauffeur would be there now picking up my things from the rather swish twobalcony room i walked across springy black rubber tiles and sat on a childs swing i looked warily around not so much for hazletoncontrolled business heavies like colin walker as for ordinary swiss citizens whod probably shout at me for sitting on a swing meant for persons of less than a certain height andor age nobody about i was probably safe i lifted my feet up and swung gently back and forth there hazleton said now we each know where the other is perhaps we can discuss more serious matters ah yes like your couffabling antics kathryn you are probably already in deep trouble i wouldnt make it any worse for yourself no mr hazleton i think youre the one in trouble youre way up ordure inlet with no means of nonmanual hydrokinetic propulsion and the sooner you drop this patronising nowlookhereyounglady bullshit the better what a colourful turn of phrase you employ kathryn thank you yes im firing on all cylinders mr h which is probably more than can be said for adrians ferrari indeed as i said he is very upset tough so let me run this past you mr h a senior executive in a venerable but still vital business organisation specialising in longterm investment sets up an unofficial and cleverly sited dealing room in a factory which the very people hes cheating on are keeping secure he makes oh i dont know how much money stashes it in several accounts probably here in the land of the oversize toblerone bar and then sends one of the account numbers to the chief executive officer of a japanese corporation via an unorthodox route involving somebodys mouth oh and this ceo according to my latest research has just resigned and bought himself his own golf course outside kyoto now that must have cost a pretty penny dont you think however most of the money will be used to buy a small and very lowlying piece of oceanic land a personal pocket state for our enterprising exec its all a doublebluff maybe even threecup trick the business is fooled once by its own decoy in the pacific while the seats are fooled twice once in the kathryn if i can just stop you there yes mr hazleton id just like to point out that the cia and other us agencies regularly monitor cellphone transmissions in the caribbean area theyre usually looking for drugdealers but im sure anything else of interest they happened to hear would be passed on to the relevant governmental department such as the state department exactly lets just say i understand what youre getting at without you having to go into any more detail its all very interesting indeed in a hypothetical sort of way but where exactly does this leave us it leaves you with a choice mr hazleton and what would you suggest that is i suspect youre dying to tell me beyond a confession extracted and recorded i might add under some duress a few specialised landline connectors and some circumstantial stuff i dont really have that much evidence yes and but but the evidence must be there im sure the essex kids could be traced easily enough for example with the right resources the essex kids thats what the regular people at silex called the eager beavers wheeling and dealing for you in the secret room ahhah it wouldnt take much to get a serious investigation going mr hazleton frankly im not entirely sure if there were other level ones involved but i guess just telling all of them would get things moving thats the sort of thing that might split the business kathryn if there were other board members involved thats a risk one might just have to take anyway i suspect our fellow was acting alone the point is that even if one or two others are implicated the entire board cant be involved or there would be no need to hide everything like this in the first place no matter how you cut it the person behind this scam would be in very serious trouble indeed of course they might be rich enough not to care they were rich enough not to have to undertake all this in the first place the sort of person whod organise this sort of wheeze does it because they love the organising the gamesmanship of it all the buzz of getting away with adding a zero to their personal worth just for the sheer hell of it not because they actually need the money to spend on anything you shouldnt underestimate the developing ambitions of rich people kathryn one might decide it would be interesting to take on rupert murdoch in the international media business for example that would take a lot of cash so would buying up a plot as expensive as the lowlying property were talking about and then what selling it on to somebody else who might want their own state keeping it banked whatever the person behind all this isnt going to be able to do any of that any more theyve been found out the game is up and the ball is most comprehensively on the slates it is scottish saying are you still with me mr h i think so so lets proceed on the basis of this hypothesis then for amusement value only of course of course thing is there might be a way out of a total loss situation for our hypothetical miscreant might there if the person involved were to present the deal he had struck selfishly for himself to the organisation he is part of if he were simply to give what he had worked for to his peers asking for nothing from them except perhaps their thanks then i think they might be surprised even shocked and suspicious but they would be grateful too it would be nodandawink stuff but they might decide not to investigate exactly how this coup was arrived at they might simply accept the gift in the spirit in which it was apparently offered hmm of course the person doing the presenting might be watched rather carefully in future by the others in case he got up to any more mischievous schemes a small price to pay for basically getting away with the crime even if not actually benefiting from it the alternative is much worse frankly if i were a fellow board member i might think about making a very terminal example of somebody who had betrayed my trust so comprehensively my you are unforgiving kathryn perhaps we had better all hope you never make it to the very top oh im not totally ruthless mr hazleton i told stephen buzetski his wife was cheating on him without expecting anything else in return more wasted effort kathryn you could have used that information so much more constructively call me a sentimentalist how did he take it he sounded as if he was in shock you realise he will probably hate you for ever for telling him yes but at least i feel better about myself than if id got him told on the quiet by your people so you are quite selfish in the end arent you kathryn just like me thats right it just takes a different form indeed well there we are i imagine if i was in the situation you describe i would start taking steps to do something very like what youve suggested as soon as possible deliver that present well before christmas that would seem appropriate of course there is a link in all this to that other diametrically not lowlying location i was coming to that i had never felt so frightened i thought i knew the way we worked i thought i had an idea what we would stop at or at least what we would stop at in what circumstances but i wasnt sure i felt vulnerable sitting there in the park waiting for hans to return with my bags what if the conspiracy went beyond hazleton what if in some bizarre way they were all behind it or just madame tchassot and maybe dessous and cholongai that only left a dozen other board members some of them very inactive what if i was up against too many of them what if this was their power base their stronghold what if id somehow missed some crucial undercurrent of meaning and threat the previous evening what if id totally misconstrued everything i swung back and forth looking through the bare branches at the distant château maybe there was a sniper lining me up in his sights right now would i get a glimpse of a laser flickering redly around the twigs of the trees between me and the château maybe a snatch squad was already an its way from the compound maybe id disappear into the vaults and catacombs that riddled the mountain behind the château maybe id end up old and out of my mind in the antarctic base in kronprinsesse euphemia land maybe hans had instructions only to drive me towards the airport and then stop suddenly at a lonely prearranged rendezvous where colin walker would suddenly appear looking regretful and carrying a silenced automatic was i paranoid or just being sensible i got a prickly feeling on my forehead and jumped off the swing walking towards the trees that would hide me from the château on the far slope i rang hans on the car phone yes ms telman how are things going hans i have your luggage ms telman where should i meet you at the avis office in town in twenty minutes very well i shall be there i walked to the hertz office hired an audi a and drove it round to a corner opposite the avis lot then crouched down and phoned dessous not available madame tchassot then put my side of the story assuming poudenhaut had gone straight to her answermachine tommy cholongai in a meeting i looked up the number for x parfittsolomenides the guy whod also signed the pejantan island deal but whom i suspected wasnt involved in hazletons scam not taking calls i was starting to get really worried now i actually started to call uncle freddy thulahn the prince all land lines out luce then luce please be there yup thank fuck what youre there why what is it hon oh just getting paranoid i think ive just committed commercial suicide what the hell are you talking about i told her as much as i could this probably only made the whole story even more complicated than it was anyway and it was pretty complicated in the first place but she seemed to get the gist maybe too quickly a part of me thought maybe shes in on it somehow maybe shes like some sort of deepentry spy put there bybut that was just too mad wasnt it where are you now luce you dont need to know that but are you still in switzerland or was this autodafé shit with the ferrari conducted in italy where it is probably a capital offence hold on my luggage has just arrived i watched hans pull up to the kerb across the street in the silver series no other cars seemed to be following him or drew up nearby at the same time nobody else in the bmw either hans got out and peered through the window of the avis office as he put on his cap i got out of the a keep talking to me luce if i get cut off suddenly call the police what the swiss police yeah or interpol or somebody i dont know okay but now i need to know where the hell you are yes you do dont you i

thanks call me really fucking paranoid but i left the hire car at montreux took a taxi to lausanne and used cash to buy a ticket on a tee to milano via the simplon tunnel good dinner pleasant talk to a terribly camp and charming textile designer and his gruffly butch partner relaxed cash again to buy a tourist ticket on a delayed alitalia to delhi via cairo upgraded once we were in the air using my noncompany amex stewardesses less glamorous and more efficient than last alitalia flight a few years ago coffee smelled tempting but avoided first so empty i could have got up to any amount of shenanigans if there had been a willing partner slept instead very well indeed in delhi going through the formalities i tried calling stephen the phone just rang and rang and rang the way phones do when the person at the other end is there hasnt got their answermachine or voicemail switched on but can see your number and name on their phones display and just doesnt want to talk to you stephen dont do this to me i whispered pick up the phone pick up the phone but he didnt i tried elsewhere mr dessous telman what in the hell is going on you tell me jeb was it that bastard hazleton is he the couffabling sonofabitch you were talking about i really couldnt say jeb hes called an ebm for wednesday in switzerland know anything about that sorry jeb whats an ebm extraordinary board meeting shows how often we have them if somebody like you doesnt know what they are good good what do you mean good its good youre having an ebm why dammit mr hazleton may have a pleasant surprise for you all oh it isnt to get you kicked out then theres an ugly rumour you assaulted adrian puddinghead or whatever the hell hes called poudenhaut actually it was more his car i assaulted what what did you do i used a search engine telman will you just tell me what the hell is going on im taking up the post in thulahn good not necessarily what does that mean i think the plan we have for thulahn may be too radical too destructive oh you do do you well im sure well thank you for sharing those thoughts with us telman but it isnt up to you what we do in thulahn youll be there in a purely advisory capacity understand you might get bumped up to ltwo but that still doesnt mean youre on the board am i making myself clear abundantly mr dessous right so well see you at château doex on wednesday ah probably not what do you mean probably not im telling you to be there im sorry mr dessous i cant ill be in thulahn cancel it i cant sir ive already assured the prince ill be there i lied hes expecting me could you possibly like unorder me to be in switzerland that way i wont be disobeying a direct command theres some delicate negotiating to be done in thulahn jesus okay get your ass to thulahn telman thank you jeb right i gotta go see how that idiot nephew of mines doing why is there something wrong you havent heard he got shot what oh my god when where yesterday new york city in the chest is he all right no he isnt all right but at least hes not dead probably isnt going to die either just cost me a fortune in hospital bills what happened the posters the posters yeah i saw one cant believe i didnt spot it myself what i dont understand you know that dumbass always wanted his name above the title yes so the posters for his play say dwight littons best shot oh good grief i said yeah some crazy asshole took it literally epilogue i dont know what is it that really matters to all of us were all the same species the same assemblage of cells with the same unarguable needs for food water and shelter the trouble is that after that it gets more complicated sex is the other big drive of course the one after the absolute necessities youd think we all need love in some form too but maybe some people can get along without it we are individuals but we need to cooperate we have family and friends allies or at least accomplices we always think we are right and search as i have there is no evil under the sun that somebody somewhere wont argue is actually a good no idiocy that hasnt got its perfectly serious defenders and no tyrant past or present no matter how bloody without some bunch of zealot schmucks to defend him or his reputation till the last breath in their bodies or preferably somebody elses so why am i doing this because it seems like the right thing to do how do i know it is i dont but at least i dont have to tell lies to myself to justify what it is i am doing i dont have to think well theyre not really humans or theyll thank me later or its us or them or my country right or wrong or history will vindicate me none of that sanctimonious bullshit im doing what im doing because i think good will come of it in the long run and that almost nothing bad will come of it in the short run anyway so even if im wrong maybe i can change my mind though i doubt i will either way nobodys going to die nobody is going to suffer maybe ill live to regret it and its possible some others will too but even then ill try to take as much of the hardship on myself what little of it i hope there may be this makes it all sound far too selfless actually theres a lot of self in this all the same part of me is recoiling in horror at all this part of me is thinking youre going to do what what is this shit because in one way of looking at it this is just another example of the same old sad selfsacrificial martyrdom crap ive lamented in my gender throughout my life we have spent so many generations thinking of others thinking of our families and thinking of our men when all they do in return is think of themselves just in the last few generations finally able to control our own fertility have we been able to act more like men and contribute more with our brains than our bodies i loved feeling that i was helping to make a case for my half of the species being worth more recognition than that due to a womb alone and yet here i am going back on all that or seeming to but what do we really want freedom i guess and i demand the freedom to do what seems right to me from first principles and not the freedom always to behave selfishly or always to do what a man would do in the circumstances or always to do the opposite suvinder kathryn where are you im in delhi airport delhi did you say delhi in india yes im trying to get a flight towell where would you suggest to connect with air thulahn you are returning so soon i ami am amazed my god this is wonderful youre really coming back yes ah about that flight oh yes fly to either patna or kathmandu let me know which flight you can get ill send the plane oh kathryn this is wonderful news how long will you be staying i dont know yet that depends will you be staying here in thuhn you would be very welcome to stay here in the palace thats very kind id love to ill have my old room if its still free see you later how wonderful yes youre kidding me no youre going to say yes thats the idea luce fucking yeah youre going to be a fucking queen i suppose ill have to be if im to take your advice about consummating the relationship what a total fucking twentyfourcarat weapongrade hoot can i be a bridesmaid look it still might not happen he might have already changed his mind or he might change it when he realises it could all really happen some guys are like that its the anticipation not the realisation what the hell are you talking about youre right im talking nonsense i guess i just dont want to take anything for granted im nervous you sure about this now you arent verbalising the chance of it not happening because deep down you really dont want it to happen are you im sure ive decided but you still dont want to fuck the guy not particularly but that isnt everything maybe not but you dont even love him thats not everything either its a hell of a lot i know i might be doing exactly the wrong thing but im going to do it anyway so why are you doing it because hes a nice guy because hes a good man and he needs somebody like me on his side youve met hundreds of guys like that you never married them they werent in the position hes in hold on so ultimately youre only marrying him because hes a prince and hes going to be the king umm yes jesus h christ thats not only like not romantic thats just like breathtakingly businesslike and selfcentred fucking hell id be having severe qualms about doing something like this and im a selfcentred monomaniacal bitch no thats not why im doing it im doing it because hes in a position of real power in a place i hardly know but im already half in love with and he is a good man but theres going to be so much change there not as much as some people were expecting but a hell of a lot and i dont know that suvinder can handle it all by himself i dont think he thinks he can either and id worry about whod be advising him dont you see luce for the first time in my life i can really do some good or fail in the attempt what youre saying is their country needs you i suppose i am sounds a bit presumptuous put like that but yes youre the fucking peace corps im the fucking marines luce yeah but seriously can i be a bridesmaid pip and james id learned the flight crews names this time whisked me over the hills and far away from kathmandu to thulahn bumpy but clear shared the plane with some monks and a lot of freight monks very friendly learned a lot more thulahnese words they giggled and looked away when i changed into my thulahnese clothes i made sure my little artificial flower was secure and looking spruce thuhn was sparkling under a fresh coat of snow langtuhn hemblu met me at the airfield with the ancient roller after the usual divebomber landing there were a few very tiny pointyhatted children with parents there but the rest were at school no suvinder he had to be at some important dedication ceremony downvalley i take you there langtuhn asked smiling why not we set off down the valley in the crystalline depths of a perfectly clear blue day suspended beneath the skyhigh peaks langtuhn and i had to walk the last bit up to the colourful crowd gathered round a giant newly refurbished prayer windmill the size of a house there were lots of flags lots of people lots of banners and bunting and braziers and fuming censers all fluttering or guttering in the cool thin breeze the crowd of smiling quilted people parted for langtuhn and me as we made our way up to the ceremonial platform where three walls of saffronrobed monks looked on and suvinder dressed in his own flowergarlanded robes stepped down from a throne on a dais and held out his hands kathryn welcome back thank you i said bowing i went up to him took his offered hands and kissed him on both cheeks his hands were dry and warm he smelled of incense i whispered if the offer still stands suvinder i accept the answer is yes i pulled away he looked confused for a moment then his mouth fell slackly open before forming itself into a huge smile his eyes glistened flags and banners snapped around us a hundred faces looked on beyond the prayer windmill still bound by ropes and cables creaked and strained in the wind waiting to be free suvinder nodded seemingly unable to speak and with my hand in his led me to the dais at the rear of the platform they found another chair for me so that i could sit at the princes side for the rest of the ceremony it was traditional for each guest to offer something to the fire in one of the braziers when my turn came i pulled a couple of shiny discs from my pocket and threw both of them into the flames end
