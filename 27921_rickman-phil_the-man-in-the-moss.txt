phil rickman the man in the moss i a cold midwinter fogbank lay on the moss it lay like a quilt on the black mattress of the peat and nothing moved not even the village schoolteacher standing on the promontory at the end of a ragged alley of graves where the churchyard seemed to overhang the bogs edge damp january was clamped across the teachers mouth and nose like a chloroform pad hed only been an hour out of bed but the cold made him tired and the sight of the moss only made him feel colder it was as hed explained to countless generations of pupils the biggest surviving peatbog in the north of england a gross product of violent death and centuries of decay vast forests burned and torn down by the barbarian invaders soaring greenery slashed and flattened and transformed by time into flat black acres bounded by the hills and the moors the peat was dead but because of its acids the peat had the power to preserve sometimes fragments of the ancient dead were found in there from ironhard limbs of trees to the arms and legs of corpses which were taken away by the villagers and quietly buried inside his long deeply unfashionable overcoat the teacher suddenly shivered not at the thought of the corpses but because he was waiting for the piper the piper on the moss the sad swollen drone the bleak keening of a lost soul had reached him on a sudden spiked breeze during his habitual morning walk before school and hed stopped disquieted the air had been still weighted by the fog no breeze at all except for this single quick breath as if it had been awoken only to carry the message that the piper was on the moss this worried him for the piping was never heard in winter as a rule it came on summer evenings when the moss was firm and springy and the sound would be serene rippling along the air currents mingling with bird cries plaintive enough to soften the clouds but the piper did not come in winter seeking reassurance the teacher turned around looking for the soft blue eye of the beacon over the village but the fog had closed the eye he could not even make out the outline of the norman church tower and while his back was turned it began a distant drifting miasma of music notes which sounded ragged at first but seemed to reassemble somehow in the air and harmonize eerily with the atmosphere cold music then with a razoredge of bitterness and more an anger and a seeping menace a violence unsuppressed which thrust and jabbed at the fog made it swirl and squirm trembling suddenly the schoolteacher backed away from it it was as if the fog and the frozen stillness of winter had combined to amplify the sound and the sound made vibrant pulsing images in his head it was as though the sky had been slashed and the rain bled from the clouds as though the cry had been physically torn from the ruptured breast of a bird in flight or the morning itself had been ripped open exposing the black entrails of another kind of night and then the piper himself came out of the fog with the black bladder like a throbbing tumour under one arm and the ground exploded around him a sound as dark as the peat under his plodding boots a black noise the piper in a black mood why cant you keep away the teacher whispered why do you have to haunt us he pulled his hat over his ears to muffle the piping and hurried away from it back towards the church until the beacons ghostly disc emerged from the fog and he could see the vacant smile on the face of our sheila who fingered and flaunted her sex on the church porch he rushed past her and into the church shutting the great oak door behind him removing his hat and clamping it to his breast staring up at the winter cross all jagged branches blunted thorns holly and mistletoe he couldnt hear the pipes any more but felt he could taste the noise that the oozing sound had entered his ears and been filtered down to the back of his throat where it came out tasting sourly of peat doesnt mean owt does it he called out to the winter cross well be all right wont we nowtll change and nothing would change for more than fifteen winters of fog and damp but fifteen years in the life of a moss was barely a blink of the eye of god and when the moss revealed what it had preserved then the changes would come too many too quickly and too horribly and the teacher in retirement feeling the kiss of the eternal night would remember the first time the piper had appeared on the moss in winter meanwhile later that week the fog would lift and there would be snow then ii they were all around her at the stage door like muggers in the night she could smell the sweat and the beer and a sour scent like someones rancid breath squirting out of the darkness and straight to the back of her throat coughing coughing at nothing for as long as she could remember hostility had occasionally come to her like this like a single piercing puff from a poisoned perfume spray but nothing there really there were maybe twenty of them but it was mostly ok wasnt it mostly warm wishes and appreciation just never happened to her before one of them had his jacket off eyeing her he was grinning and mumbling sign your what she said get used to it lass matt castle grinning too this is only the start of it for you now the guy was rolling up a chequered shirt sleeve in the subzero night handing her this thick black felttip pen oh your arm she tried to smile printing her name all the way up the soft hairless underside of his forearm moira cairns usually it would be just a handful of enthusiasts harmless as trainspotters chattering learnedly about the music and mainly to matt dropping away as they headed for the car park shouting see you again stuff like that mostly to matt you should be loving this hen she told herself real fans can you believe that youre a star willie and eric were loading the gear into matts old minibus wanting to be away more snow on the way apparently two girls in leather jackets held open the back doors for the tea chest willie kept his handdrums in she felt it again back of her throat nearly choked on it ta eric said moira saw little willie sizing up the girls for future reference tonight she knew he was worried he wouldnt get home across the moss if the snow came down matt got into the driving seat eric slammed the back doors and climbed in on the passenger side one of the girls in leather buxom piece opened a rear side door for willie willie rolled his eyes at her gave her his most seductively innocent grin see you sometime eh moiras throat was burning up the girl said yeah ill be around she held on to the open door gina she said the wirecaged light over the backstage exit threw a grille of shadows on to her pale puffy cheeks willie five and a bit feet tall liked his women big gina right he said ill remember the first sparse snowflakes hit the wet black asphalt and dissolved moira tucking her long hair down her coat collar smiled at the girl put out a foot to climb into the van next to willie and then the moment froze like lifes big projector had jammed moira turned in time to see the girls eyes harden glazing over like a dolls eyes as she whirled a big clumsy dancer and flung the door like the door was a wrecking hammer and moira was the side of a condemned building snarling traitor discoloured jagged teeth exposed fucking bitch willie had seen it with both hands he had pushed her back she stumbled fell over the kerb the door connecting with a shuddering crunch and this girl gina snarling bitch voice as deadly cold as the grinding metal and then the door reopened and willie was hauling her in and snatching it shut behind her the girl screaming go on feather your own nest fucking cow and beating on the panel into moiras ear as matt started the engine and pulled urgently away into the unheeding desultory night traffic jesus willie wagstaff said couldve had your fingers off screw up ma glittering career huh white face in the streetlight and a rasp of glasgow giving it away that moira was pretty damn shocked couldny play too well wi a hook matt said mildly dont let it bother you always one or two just jealous the snow heavy enough now for him to get the wipers going wasny about envy moira had her guitar in her arms im no exactly popular with your fans any more is the problem youre in good company matt said look how the purists shunned dylan when he went over to rock and roll called me a traitorous cow yeah well matt said weve been over this so damned nonchalant about it he seemed so determined she shouldnt feel bad that she felt a sight worse eric the mournful one who played fiddle and twelvestring eric the mediator the peacemaker said werent a bad gig though were it was a grand gig moira said good enough she thought heartsick to be the start of something not the end least her throat wasnt hurting so bad the guitar case was warm in her arms the snowflakes began to suck and cluster on the side windows as matt drove first to erics house at ashton under lyne where willie had left his minivan they switched the drum chest to the back of the little grey van and willie said i wont mess about if its snowing like this down here itll be thick as buggery over ttop he hung his arms around moiras neck and gave her a big kiss just wide of the lips tara lass dont lose touch eh then eric kissed her too mournfully and by the time she got into the front seat next to matt she was in tears both arms wrapped around the guitar case for comfort this is the worst thing i ever did you know that matt there was silence just the two of them now for the last time time for some plain talking dont be so bloody daft still his tone was curiously mild she was right that slag i should have ma fingers chopped off listen kid he tapped at the steeringwheel you made one sacrifice for this band when you threw up your degree course thats it no more dont owe us nowt its been nice cracking couple of years wouldntve missed it but youre not even twentyone were owd men us aw matt could anybody be this selfless gone as far as were going think i want to be trailing me gear around the country when im sixty no way its a good getout this straight up for all of us erics got his kids willies got his matt didnt finish the sentence covering up the break by changing down to third swinging sharp right and taking them through manchesters piccadilly bright lights couples scurrying through the snow snow was nice in the city moira thought for a while when it came by night think about the snow because matts got to be lying through his teeth but the silence got too heavy ok she said to change the subject what do you want to be doing eh you said you didny wanna be trailing your gear around when you were sixty what would you like to be doing matt didnt answer for a long time not until they were out of the city centre im not sure he said eventually were all right for money me and lottie thanks to you matt i cant stand this all right i dont know i dont know what i want to do but ill tell you this much i know where i want to be moira waited the snow was heavy now but they were not too far from whalley range where she lived and it wouldnt take matt long to get to his bit of cheshire and lottie what i want he said is to be out of these sodding suburbs want to go home across the moss the words feeling strange in moiras mouth yeah matt said across the moss willie and matt would often slip the phrase to each other surreptitiously like a joint across the moss was over the rainbow utopia the elysian fields lottie likes it fine where we are all the shops and the galleries and that but its not me never was dont belong no echoes so yeah im going home might take a year might take ten but thats where im ending up which didnt make her feel any better twenty years older than her and here he was talking about ending up did this happen to everybody when they turned forty this is willies village up in the moors yeah and willie stayed willies got family there my lot moved to town when i was a lad you never get rich up there not even the farmers but we were happy we were part of it willies still part of it drops down to town to play a gig or two get his leggo out with a woman moira smiled matt tended to be kind of proper like a father when they were alone but he keeps going back and his mother shes never spent a night away his ma the whole of her life some place huh special place he was staring unblinking through the windscreen and the snow its quite lonely and primitive in its way and the moss biggest peatbog in the north really vast and when you get across it its weird but theres a different attitude different values isnt that what everybody says about the place they were brought up do you she thought about this no she said maybe not the world outside was a finite place in the thickening snow matt was somewhere far inside himself across the moss she glanced at him quickly thickset guy coarseskinned nobodys idea of a musician brooding eyes the colour of brown ale most times you thought you knew him sometimes you werent so sure occasionally you were damn sure you didnt know him and couldnt after a while she said whats it called i forget bridelow matt said in a deliberate way rounding out all the consonants bridelow across the moss right she said vaguely dramatic place to look at never saw that till i started going back i take the little lad up there sometimes of a weekend when hes older were going to go hiking on sundays over the moors sounds idyllic like to see it sometime but mostly i go alone matt pulled up under the streetlamp in front of the victorian villa where moira had her apartment me and the pipes you take the pipes bagpipes the northumbrian pipes played sitting down had been matts instrument then hed started experimenting with different kinds of bag made of skins and things he called them the pennine pipes claiming theyd been played in these parts since before the romans came to britain the pennine pipes made this eerie haunting sound full of a kind of repressed longing releases me matt said she didnt want to ask him what it released him from takes it away matt said she didnt want to ask him what it was that piping took away on the moss matt said only on the moss the tips of her fingers started to feel cold the moss takes it away matt said the moss absorbs it he switched off the engine snow was settling on the bonnet but the moss also preserves it matt said thats the only drawback peat preserves you give it to the peat and youve got rid of it but the peat preserves it for ever he turned and looked at her she saw something swirling in his eyes and the truth exploded in her mind oh christ dont let me taste it god almighty dont let it come was the girl whats her name ginait was the girl it wasny you matt wasny you please dont let it be you in the silence the kind which only new snow seemed to make they looked at each other in the streetlight made brighter by the snow this is it then matt said flatly think i might cry again but she was lying now there was the residue of something unpleasant here something more than sadness swirling in matts eyes matt had his door open pass us your guitar huh oh right sorry the street was silent snow starting to make the three and fourstorey houses look like soft furnishings lights shone pastel green pink and cream behind drawn curtains matt took the guitar case snowflakes making a nest in his denim cap he pushed it back he said just as relaxed just as mild and just as offhand as hed been earlier one thing ive always meant to ask why do you always take this thing on stage with you the guitar no lass the case this old and cracked and not very valuable guitar case you never let the bloody thing out of your sight oh how long had he been noticing this she looked at him his eyes were hard hed never asked her questions everything he knew about her shed volunteered matt was incurious and because of that she told him theres kind of a wee pocket inside the case and inside of that theres like something my mother gave me when i was young he didnt stop looking at her its only a comb kind of an antique you know very old too heavy to carry around in your pocket it means a lot to me i suppose thats your mother the the gypsy woman aye ma mother the gypsy woman she shook snow off her hair theyre big on good luck tokens the gypsies throwm around like beads matt said roughly dont go making light of it huh youre trying to make it seem of no account traditions are important sometimes i think theyre all we have thats worthwhile he propped the instrument in its stiff black case against the wide concrete base of the streetlamp moira said look youre gonny get soaked he laughed scornfully like the noise a crow makes matt she said ill see you again yeh and she did want to she really did sure she did he smiled well be on different circuits now lass you in a suite at the holiday inn me over the kitchen at the dog and duck tell you what ill buy all your records even if it is rock and roll hows that she took a step towards him hesitant he was only a wee bit taller than she was this was it the final seconds of the last reel two years in the band building up her reputation on the back of his matt watching her with some pride a touch supervisory at first then graciously taking half a pace back until even the wee folk clubs were announcing the matt castle band with moira cairns and a couple of times to her embarrassment moira cairns in bigger letters and now she was leaving off to london for the big money traitorous bitch matt it was the worst moment she should kiss him too but that would seem perfunctory demeaning and pretty damn cheap also for the first time she didnt want to go that close to him hed pulled down his cap she tried to peer under the peak to find out what his eyes were saying nothing his eyes would show no resentment no disappointment she was leaving the band which had changed her life made her name leaving the band just when she was starting to put something back and matt felt he felt nothing because jesus did you go on the peat today she asked him in a very small voice the snow falling between them did you go on the peat with the pipes did you let the damn peat absorb it and then the projector stuttered and stalled again images shivering on the screen of the night and she saw him suddenly all in white maybe just an illusion of the snow he was very still and framed in white it wasnt nice the white was frilled around him like the musty lace handkerchiefs in the top dresser drawer at her grans house and a whiff of soiled perfume death for the first time there was a real menace to him too transient to tell whether it was around him or from him her throat swelled she coughed and the tears came the wrong kind of tears she felt the snow forming on the top of her own head it was almost warm maybe she looked like that too shrouded in white matt held out his right hand and she gripped it like a lifeline but the hand was deathly cold she told herself cold hands warm heart yeah and tried to pull him closer but all the time wanting to keep him away and hating herself for that he dropped her hand and then put both of his on her shoulders his arms were rigid like girders but she felt they were trembling his whole body quivering with some titanic tension something strong holding out against something potentially stronger like a steel suspension bridge in a hurricane then he said going to show me voice colder than the snow she wanted to squirm away she made herself remain still trying to find his eyes no please dont spoil this ill buy it youre a selfless self sacrificing guy i dont want to know any more this famous comb he said with a smile that was faintly unpleasant its no famous she said quickly almost snapping his brown eyes were steady hey come onthis is matt castle whats he gonna do steal it off you snatch it out your hand and drive away keep it safe never take it out for show never treat it as a trinket or a wee souvenir you understand child no see all it is he wants a link a special moment something between us and no one else you owe him you owe him that you owe him nothing she stopped searching his eyes didnt want to know what they might have to tell her about matt castle the kindly father figure that matt castle whod said take your chance grab it while you can lass never mind us were owd men dumbly moira laid the guitar case on the pavement in the snow and hands shaking with the cold and the nerves flipped up the chromium catch it was like opening someones coffin only the guitar lay in state in a panic she felt beneath the machineheads for the velvet pouch which held the ancient metal comb i have to i owe him mammy im sorry but i owe him part one the spring cross from dawbers book of bridelow introduction this little book bids you the visitor a cordial welcome to bridelow across the moss a site of habitation for over two thousand years and the home of the famous bridelow black beer bridelow folk would never be so immodest as to describe their tiny lonely village as unique but unique it is both in situation and character although little more than half an hours drive from the cities of manchester and sheffield the village is huddled in isolation between the south pennine moors and the vast peatbog known as bridelow moss so tucked away as the local saying goes its a wonder the sun knows where to come of a morning a spring morning a hesitant sun edging over the moor out of a mist pale as milk only when it clears the church tower does the sun find a few patches of blue to set it off give it a bit of confidence the sun hovers a while blinking in and out of the sparse shreds of cloud before making its way down the village street past the cottage where ma wagstaff lives bluetits breakfasting from the peanuts in two mesh bags dangling from the rowan trees in the little front garden the cats bob and jim sitting together on mas front step donkeystoned to a fullmoon whiteness observe the bluetits through narrowed green eyes but resist their instincts because ma will be about soon and while ma understands their instincts all too well she does not appreciate blood on her step milly gill shedding her cardigan at the post office door thought the mist this morning was almost like a summer heathaze which wasnt bad for the second week in march it made milly feel excited somewhere deep inside her majestic bosom it made her feel so energetic that she wanted to wander off for long walks to fill up her reservoirs after the winter and to go and see the little man see what he had in his reservoir and of course it made her feel creative too tonight shed be pulling out that big sketch pad and the coloured pencils and getting to work on this years design to be done in flowers for the dressing of the holy well it was she decided going to reflect everything she could sense about her this morning milly gill thought im fortynine and i feel like a little girl this was what the promise of spring was supposed to do thank you mother milly said aloud with a big innocent grin and you too sir the moss a vast bed hangs on to its damp duvet as usual until the sun is almost overhead behind temporary trafficlights about half a mile from the village a highways authority crew is at work widening the road which crosses the peat a longoverdue improvement although not everybody is in favour of improving access to the village its close to midday before the foreman decides its warm enough to strip to the waist this is the man who finds the chocolate corpse the splendour of the morning dimmed a little for the rector when on getting out of bed he felt a twinge it was as more often than not in the area of his left knee we really must get you a plastic one the doctor had said last time i should think the pains pretty awful isnt it oh the rector flexing his creasedup walter matthau semismile could be worse then the doctor ruefully shaking his head making a joke about the rector being determined to join the league of holy martyrs i was thinking of joining the squash club actually the rector had said and theyd both laughed and wondered how he was managing to keep this up the answer to this was ma wagstaffs mixture standing by the window of his study with sunshine strewn all over the carpet pleasant around his bare feet the rector balanced a brimming teaspoonful of mas mixture and his eyes glazed briefly at the horror of the stuff it looked like green frogspawn he knew it was going to make his throat feel nostalgic for castor oil the bottle as usual was brown and semiopaque so he wouldnt have to see the sinister strands and tendrils waving about in there like weed on the bottom of an aquarium but still it worked not a miracle cure of course ma wagstaff who promised nothing would have been shocked at any such suggestion might just ease it a bit shed say gruffly leaving the bottle on his hall table by the phone through the study window the rector saw sundappled gravestones and the great norman tower of st brides he rubbed his feet into the sunshiny carpet raised his eyes to heaven the spoon to his lips and swallowed out on the moss the foreman stands in the middle of the trench in front of the jcb waving his arms until the driver halts the big digger and sticks his head inquiringly round the side of the cab owd on a bit jason ive found summat the trench at this point is about five feet deep if its money says the jcb driver just pass it up ere and ill hide it under tseat well said mr dawber as its such a lovely day wed best be thinking about the spring now think back to last year what does that mean some of them had the good manners to put their hands up but two little lads at the back just shouted it out the spring cross mr dawber didnt make an issue of it aye he said the spring cross and the two troublemakers at the back cheered at that because it would get them out of the classroom into the wood and on to the moors so said mr dawber who can tell me what well be looking for to put in the spring cross the hands went up as fast and rigid as oldfashioned railway signals ernie dawber looked around singled out a little girl yes meryl catkins aye thats right catkins what else sebastian pussy willows yees what else benjamin acorns they all had a good cackle at this benjamin was the smallest child in the class and had the air of one who found life endlessly confusing ernie dawber sympathized hed always reckoned that the day he retired hed be able to sit back job well enough done and start to understand a few basics but everything had just got hazier with them all looking at him giggling and nudging each other benjamin seemed to get even smaller mr dawber had a little deliberation about this while the class was settling down now then he said thoughtfully who can tell me when we find acorns autumn four or five of the cleverer ones chorused scornfully thats right so what im going to do and dont forget to remind me when the times comes lad im going to put benjamin because he knows all about acorns in charge of making the autumn cross the clever ones looked aghast unable to find any justice in this and ernie dawber smiled to see it corning in just a few hours a week to teach the children about nature at least gave him more time to consider the psychology of the job now then he clapped his hands to change the mood what else do we need for the spring cross tom birds eggs mr dawbers voice dropped an octave we most certainly do not take birds eggs to put into the spring cross or for any other reason thomas garside and if it comes to my notice that any of you nave disturbed any nests theres going to be trouble there was silence and dont anybody think i wont find out about it said mr dawber and they knew he would because one way or another mr dawber found out about everything and if it was important enough he put it in the book of bridelow the foreman tells the jcb driver to switch his engine off his voice is shaking come down a minute jason come and take a look at this the driver a younger man swings looselimbed to the ground his boots shudder on the surface of the moss what you got im not sure the foreman seems reluctant to go back in the trench the driver grinning shambling over to the pit and balancing expertly on the rim cant make it out at first looks like a giant bar of dark chocolate then while the foreman is attempting to light a cigarette and nervously scattering matches over the peat the driver suddenly realises what hes staring at and when the thought lurches into his head its eerily echoed by the foremans fractured croak looks like a dead un to me jason the driver falls over backwards trying not to topple into the trench just eliza horridge and shaw now and the drawing room at the hall was too big he was taller but slighter than his father who used to stand legs apart in front of the fireplace lighting his pipe belching dragons breath and making it seem as if the room had been built around him when arthur horridge spoke the walls had closed in as if the very fabric of the building was paying attention the wwwworst thing about all this shaws thin voice no more emphatic than the tinkling of the chandelier when a window was open is that when derderdad wanted to expand terten years ago the bank wouldnt back him and now well ride it liz horridge told him firmly we always have weve got twentythree people depending on us for an income tertertoo many said shaw ferfar no the first time ever that she hadnt waited politely for him to finish a sentence thats not something your father would have said she turned away from him glaring out of the deep georgianstyle window at the brewerys grey tower through the bare brown tree trunks its stonework badly needed repointing one more job they couldnt afford when sales were sagging liz said as shed said to him several times before arthur always blamed himself and it was our belt the familys that was tightened i remember when he sold the jag to it was derdifferent then shaw almost shrieked making her look at him there was no competition to serspeak of whwhat did they need to know about mermermarket forces in those days and its all changed so quickly has it in the six months since your fathers death it was cherchanging yeryears before he just couldnt see it he didnt wwant to sersee it he knew what his duty was liz snapped and her son began to wring his hands in frustration the sun shone through the long window a cruel light on shaw the top of his forehead winking like a feeble flashlight if baldness was hereditary people doubtless asked why had arthur managed to keep most of his hair until the end while shaws had begun to fall out before he turned twenty behind the anger liz felt the usual sadness for him while acknowledging that sympathy was a poor substitute for maternal pride mother shaw said determinedly listen to me weve gergot to do it sersoon weve got to trim the workforce sersersome of them have gergot to go or else never said liz horridge but she knew that such certainty was not her prerogative shaw was the owner of the bridelow brewery now he glared mutinously at her thin lips pressed tight together only too aware of how much authority he lost whenever he opened them or else what liz demanded what happens if we dont trim the workforce she looked down at herself at the baggy jeans she wore for which she was rather too old and a little too shapeless these days realising why she was wearing the jeans spring cleaning an operation which she would for the first time be undertaking alone because when josie had gone into hospital she hadnt taken on another cleaner for economic reasons thus trimming her own workforce of one the berberbrewerys not a charity mother shaw said pleadingly jim ford says we could be out of berbusiness inside a year or else what liz persisted or else we sell it shaw said simply liz laughed to whom terterto an outside one of the big firms thats not an option liz said flatly you know that beers been brewed in bridelow since time immemorial its part of the local heritage and still cercould be sell it as a going concern why not and you could live with that could you he didnt answer liz horridge was shaking with astonishment she faced him like an angry mother cat narrowing her eyes penetrating whos responsible for this whos been putting these thoughts in your head nernobody but he couldnt hold her gaze he was wearing a wellcut beige suit over a buttondown shirt and a strange leather tie he was going out again hed been going out a lot lately he had no interest in the brewery and he wasnt even trying to hide this any longer and what about the pub is this fancy buyer going to take that on as well sersomebody will shaw shrugged uselessly backing towards the door anyway well talk about it later ive got to where are you going i im he went red and began to splutter pulled out a handkerchief and blew his nose wiped his lips for years shed worried because he didnt go out enough because he hadnt got a girlfriend although this had hardly been surprising now at last at the age of thirtyone he was feebly groping for control of his own destiny and floundering about unbalancing everything liz horridge turned away from him and walked to the other window the one with the view of bridelow which summer would soon obscure she could see the humped but still sprightly figure of mrs wagstaff in the distance lugging a shopping basket across the cobbles to gus bibbys general stores her breast heaved and she felt tears pumping behind her eyes arthur its not my fault mrs wagstaff stopped in the middle of the street and although it was too far away for liz to be certain seemed to stare up through the trees at the hall at this very window as though the old girl had overheard lizs thoughts as though she could feel the agony when liz turned around weteyed she found she was alone shaw had quietly left the room although hell be cool enough when the press and the radio and tv reporters interview him in a few hours time the county highways foreman is so shaken up right now that he has to be revived with whisky from the jcb drivers secret flask what hes discovered will come to be known as the bridelow bogman or the man in the moss important people are going to travel hundreds of miles to gaze with reverence upon its ancient face and what was your reaction when you found it asks one of the reporters what did you think it was thought it were a sack o spuds or summat the foreman says quotably his moment of glory but out of his hands soon enough so old and so exciting to the experts like one of them egyptian mummies that nobody else seems to find it upsetting or horrifying not like a real body but though hell never admit it the foreman reckons hes never going to forget that first moment and what did you think when you realised what it was dunno really thought it were maybe an owd tramp or summat were you shocked nah you find all sorts in this job but that night the foreman will dream about it and awake with a whimper reaching for his warm missus and then fall asleep and wake again his sweat all over both of them and his mind bulging with the moment he bent down and found his hand was gripping its cold and twisted face his thumb between what might have been its teeth part two black glow from dawbers book of bridelow the firsttime visitor to bridelow is strongly urged to approach it from the west from which direction a most dramatic view of the village is attained from a distance of a mile or two bridelow appears almost as a craggy island when viewed from the narrow road which is virtually a causeway across bridelow moss a number of legends are attached to the moss some of which will be discussed later in this book chapter i in early summer bridelow hopefully dolls herself up puts on a bit of makeup and an obliging smile for the sun but the sun doesnt linger on warm cloudless evenings like this it saves its final pyrotechnics for the moor sunset lures hues from the moor that you see at no other time sensual pinks and melodramatic mauves which turn its stiff and spiky surface into velvet a delusion thought joel beard soon to leave theological college a red light tenderizing the face of an old whore he had his back to the sinking sun to him it seemed agitated tonight throwing out its farewell flames in a long dying scream as well it might most of the lonely village was below the moor and the suns flailing rays were missing it the stone houses hanging from the hill were in shadow and so was the body of the church on its summit only the spikes of the church tower were dusted with red and gold joel dismounted from his motorbike in the centre of the tower was a palely shining disc like a rising full moon it sent sneering signals to the sun as you fade it promised gleefully ill grow ever brighter joel glared at the village across the sullen scabby surface of the moss he imagined bridelow under moonlight stark and white as crowpicked bones its true self the disc at the centre of the tower was actually an illuminated clock face from which the hands had long ago fallen often said to be a friendly face which turned the church into a lighthouse at night across the black ocean of the moss you see at one time mr beard very few people dared to cross the moss except those for whom the devil lit the way have you heard that legend it was no legend on a dark night all you would see of the village would be this silver disc bridelows own permanent full moon was this how the devil lit the path was this the devils light shining from the top of the stairs in gods house a false beacon for the weak the uncertain and the disturbed joels black leathers straightened him like armour and the hard white collar lifted his eyes above the village to the luminous moor its lurid colours too would soon grow dull under the night like a harlots cheap dress from the village across the barren moss he heard voices raised a shriek of laughter the village would be alive tonight a new landlord had installed himself at the decrepit local inn the man ith moss thus saving it from closure a sideeffect of the widely condemned sale of the bridelow brewery joel waited astride his motorbike his charger until the moor no longer glowed and the illusion of beauty was gone everyone saw shadows in the blackened cities those obvious pits of filth and fornication where evil was scrawled in neon and the homeless slept with the rats and yet the source of it was up here where citydwellers surged at weekends to stroll through the springy heather picnic among the gorse young couples families children queuing at the roadside icecream vans pensioners in small cars with their flasks of tea its all around you mr beard once you know what youre looking for look at the church look at the pub look at the people youll see the signs everywhere beneath him the bike lurched into life his strong gauntleted hands making the engine roar and crackle spitting holy fire he rode away from the village back into the hills shades ma wagstaff would say later that night thems whats kept this place the way it is shades of things of all mas famous sayings these were the words that would keep coming back at ernie dawber during the short anxious days and the long chill nights of the declining year and when as local historian he tried to find the beginning as in what exactly started the first world war what caused the first spark that set off the great fire of london hed keep coming back to this particular evening a vivid evening at the end of may the evening hed blithely and thoughtlessly told ma wagstaff what hed learned about the death of the bogman and ma had made a fateful prediction but it started well enough with a big turnout for the official reopening of the man under its new proprietor the two bars couldnt hold all those come to welcome him home so several dozen folk including ernie dawber best suit waistcoat watchchain were out on the cobbled forecourt having a pint or two and watching the sun go down over the big hills beyond the moss a vivid evening at the end of may laughter in the streets hope for the future most enmities sheathed and worries left at home under the settee cushions a real old bridelow night that was how it ought to have been enshrined in his memory all those familiar faces a schoolteacher all his working life ernie dawber had known at least threequarters of this lot since they were fiveyearolds at the front of the school hall eager little faces timid little faces few belligerent ones too always reckoned he could spot a future troublemaker in its pram he remembered young frank manifold in the pram throttling his panda well well twentyodd years on young frank strolling up to his boss all jutting chin and pint mug clenched like a big glass knuckleduster its mr horridge shaw said nothing whats that youre drinking mr horridge sneering down at shaws slim glass shaws smile faltered but he wont reply ernie thought because if he does hell start stuttering and he knows it thered been a halfsmile on shaws face as he stood alone on the cobbles a nervous forcedlooking smile but a smile none the less ernie had to admire the lad summoning the nerve to show himself tonight not a month since andy hodgson died especially with more than a few resentful brewery employees about looks like vodka frank observed that what it is mr horridge vodka a few people starting to look warily at frank and shaw a couple of men guiding their wives away course i forgot bloody gannons make vodka on tside gannons will make owt asll sell that gannons vodka that what it is mr horridge shaw sipped his drink not looking at frank this could be nerves or it could be an insult shaw pointedly pretending that young frank was not there whichever ernie decided he ought to break this up before it started to spoil the atmosphere but somebody better equipped than him got there first wheres your dad frank milly gill demanded putting herself firmly between him and shaw like a thick flowery bush sprouting between two trees be around somewhere frank staring over the postmistresss head at shaw who was staring back now franks knuckles whitening around the handle of his beer mug i think youd better find him frank milly said briskly see he doesnt drink too much with that diabetes frank ignored her too tankedup to know his place fancy new car i see mr horridge porsche int it andy hodgson just got isself a new car day before he fell well im saying new austin maestro dont even make um no more he were chuffed wi it easily pleased andy werent he milly it was an accident milly said tightly as you well know aye sure it were im not accusing mr horridge of murder only why dont you ask him why andy were suddenly ordered to reconnect a bloody old clappedout pulley system for winching maltsacks up to a storeroom right at top of tbuilding as isnt even used no more except by owls you ask this bastard that milly weve had the inquest milly said go and see to your dad inquest fucking whitewash ill tell you why andy were sent up on account of place were being tarted up to look all quaint and oldfashioned for a visit from tgannons directors right mr horridge wasnt c not quite like that said shaw quietly oh aye how were it different lad dies for a bit of fucking cosmetic youre all shit you shit the air between them fizzed shaw was silent hed been an expert at being silent during the three years ernie had taught him before the lad was sent to prep school and still an expert when he came back from university poor bugger and this porsche young frank popped out the word with a few beery bubbles how many jobs gannons gonna axe to buy you that eh frank milly gill told him very firmly big floral bosom swelling ill not tell you again careful lass ernie thought dont do owt youre a jammy little twat frank spat dont give a shit you never was a proper horridge a widening circle around them conversations trailing off right millys eyes went still thats enough ill not have this occasion spoiled am i getting through now millicent ernie said knowing from experience what might happen if she got riled but shaw horridge startled them all its quite all right miss gill he smiled icily at young frank yes it is a perporsche held up his glass yes it is vodka yes its mermade in sheffield by a ssubsidiary of gannons ales he straightened up taller than frank now his voice gaining in strength gannons ales without whom yes i wouldnt have a porsche and stepping around millie he poked young frank in the chest with a thin but rigid forefinger and without whom you wouldnt have a job mr manifold ernie saw several men tense ready to hold young frank back but frank didnt move his eyes widened and his grip on the tankard slackened lads as astonished as me ernie thought at shaw horridge coming out with half a dozen almost fully coherent sentences one after the other the red sun shone into shaws eyes he didnt blink the selling of the brewery was probably the worst thing that had happened to bridelow this century but not apparently the worst thing that had happened to shaw horridge he lowered his forefinger just remember that please he said looking rather commanding where he used to look shyly hunched and this remarkable confidence as though somebody had turned his lights on letting them all see him smiling and relaxed after perpetrating the sale of the brewery bridelows crime of the century and indirectly causing a death took some nerve this did from stuttering shaw arthurs lad at last maybe excuse me shaw said dismissively i have to meet someone he turned his back on young frank manifold and walked away no quicker than he needed to the sun turning the bald spot on the crown of his head into a bright golden coin by eck ernie dawber said but he noticed that milly gill was looking worried and she wasnt alone now then ernest whas tha make of that then he hadnt noticed her edging up behind him although hed known she must be here somewhere she was a presence just a little old woman in a pale blue woollen beret an old grey cardigan and a lumpy brown woollen skirt well ernie dawber said arthur might have been mortified at what hes done with the brewery but i think hed be quite gratified at the way he stood up for himself there dont you aye said ma wagstaff grimly im sure his fatherd be right pleased ernie looked curiously into the rubbery old features anybody who thought this was just a little old woman hadnt been long in bridelow he took a modest swallow from his half of black whats wrong then ma everything ma sighed all coming apart oh said ernie nice night though look at that sun aye said ma wagstaff pessimistically going down int it well yes ernie straightened his glasses it usually does this time of night ma wagstaff nodded at his glass whats that ale like now its gannons nowt wrong with it as i can taste this wasnt true it didnt seem to have quite the same brackish bite or was that his imagination ma looked up and speared him with her fierce little eyes got summat to tell me ernest dawber ernie coughed not as i can think of she was making him uneasy anythin in the post today this and that ma this and that like one of them big squashy envelopes for instance a jiffybag you mean aye said ma wagstaff wi british museum stamped on it ernie fumed you couldnt keep anything bloody private in this place time that millicent kept her damn nose out never mind that lad whats it say now look ernie backed away pulling at his waistcoat in my capacity as local historian i was able to provide dr hall and the british museum with a considerable amount of information relating to the moss and as a result following their examination of the body theyve kindly given me a preview of their findings which thought thatd be it ma wagstaff nodded satisfied which will be published in due course until which time im not allowed if you know why shouldnt we know its not allowed ma its whats called an embargo oh mas eyes narrowed thats what its called is it means educated fellers like you get to know whats what and us common folk common folk ma wagstaff ernie kept backing off looking around for friendly faces please ma dont push me on this youll find out soon enough but the nearest person was a good ten yards away and when his back hit the wall of the pubs outside lavatory block he realised shed got him into a corner in more ways than one now then ma said kindly hows that prostate of yours these days nowt wrong with my prostate ernie replied huffily ma wagstaffs eyes glinted not yet there int chapter ii this is mermadness shaw said no said therese its exciting youre exciting he mumbled thats all he pushed a hand through her sleek hair and she smiled at him tongue gliding out between her small icewhite teeth he was almost crying she had him on the edge again he pushed his back into the cars unfamiliar upholstery and clenched both hands on the wheel shall we go then i cant i promise you therese said youll feel so much better afterwards and he would he knew this from experience once not long after theyd met shed made him go into a chemist and steal a bottle of chanel perfume for her ill buy it for you hed almost shrieked but that wasnt good enough he was rich buying her perfume what would that demonstrate so hed done it stolen it slipped it into the pocket of his sheepskin jacket and then bought himself two bottles of the shops most expensive aftershave as an awkward sort of atonement but the awkwardness had just been a phase he remembered lying awake all that night convinced someone had seen him and the police would be at the door dont worry shed said itll get easier jewellery next antique jewellery from a showcase while therese had distracted the manager youll feel better shed say she was right for the first time ever he was getting whole sentences out without stammering although his mother hadnt said anything it was obvious shed noticed and been impressed hed felt quite wonderful couldnt wait to see therese again to tell her his confidence had increased daily soon hed found he could speak openly to groups of men in the brewery like his father used to do instead of slinking into his office and only communicating with the workers through the manager and when gannons had made their approach hed found it surprisingly easy to make his decision with a little help from therese do you want really to stay in bridelow all your life couldnt bear it myself couldnt live here for a week and he knew it was true she wouldnt spend any time here if they went for a walk it had to be up on the moors if they went for a drink it had to be at some pub or club in manchester or somewhere he wanted desperately to show her off to show that stuttering shaw horridge could get himself a really beautiful girlfriend but she seemed to find bridelow beneath her dismal little place she said dont you think i like lights and noise and people so it hadnt been difficult the decision to let gannons have the brewery biggest thing hed ever done and all over in a couple of weeks all over before anyone in the village knew about it fait accompli youll feel better she said and he had he always did sometimes the terror of what was happening would still flare and for a moment it would blind him hed freeze become quite rigid like tonight facing the oaf manifold whod wanted to fight wanted to take on stuttering shaw beat him publicly to the ground make a point in front of all his mates and shaw had thought of therese and felt his eyes grow hard watched the effect of this on the thug manifold start the car shaw therese said softly shaw laughed nervously started the engine good she said now pull away gently we dont want any screeching of tyres it was a saab turbo a black one shed blown the horn once and hed known it was her it was a different car but he wasnt unduly surprised shed often turn up in quite expensive ones her brothers shed say or her fathers tonight shed stopped the saab in a layby the other side of the moss saying i feel tired you drive would i be insured therese laughed a lot at that who owns it exactly how should i know i stole it interferin devils be unfair perhaps to say the old girl was xenophobic about southerners but no on second thoughts it wouldnt be unfair ma was suspicious of everybody south of matlock aye ernie said i know you dont think he should have been taken to london but this was a find of enormous national nay international significance and they are the experts after all he chuckled by eck theyve had him or bits of him anyroad all over the place for examination wembley harwell and this report well it really is rather sensational if you ask me going to cause quite a stir you see what they did putting on his precise headmasterly tone ernie explained how the boffins had conducted a complete postmortem examination submitting the corpse to the kind of specialized forensic tests normally carried out only in cases of suspicious death so they now know for example what he had for dinner on the day he died some sort of black bread as it happened ma wagstaff sniffed obviously disapproving of this invasion of the bogmans intestinal privacy fascinating though isnt it ernie said that theyve managed to conduct a proper autopsy on a chap who probably was killed back when christ was a lad he stopped whats up owd lass ma wagstaff had gone stiff as a pillarbox killed she said starkly aye ritual sacrifice ma so they reckon but it was all a long time ago ma wagstaff came quite dramatically to life eyes urgently flicking from side to side she grabbed hold of the bottom of ernies tweed jacket and dragged him well out of everybodys earshot into a deserted corner of the forecourt into the deepest shadows tell us she urged the weakening sun had become snagged in tendrils of low cloud and looked for a minute as if it might not make it into the hills but plummet to the moss from where ernie thought in sudden irrational panic it might never rise again he took a few breaths pulling himself together straightening his jacket this is not idle curiosity ernest i could tell that ma when you were threatening to bugger up my prostate how much of a coincidence had it been that hed shortly afterwards felt an urgent need to relieve himself which seemed to dissipate as soon as he stood at the urinal eh that were just a joke ernest cant you take a joke any more from you ma but this is deadly serious ma said soberly the sun had vanished ridiculously ernie thought he heard the moss burp all right he said from the inside pocket of his jacket he brought out some papers bound with a rubber band and swapped his regular specs for his reading glasses be public knowledge soon enough anyroad ernie cleared his throat seems our lad he said was somewhere around his late twenties quite tall too for the time bout fivefive or six peat preserves a body like vinegar preserves onions the bones had gone soft but the skin was tanned to perfection even the hair as we know remained anyroad medical tests indicate no reason to think he wasnt in good shape generally speaking get to tpoint ma said irritably well he was killed in no uncertain manner thats to say they made sure of the job blunt instrument first of all back of the head then er strangulation garotte eh garotte well he wondered if she ever had nightmares probably wouldnt be the usual kind if she did little benjie mas grandson had wandered across the forecourt with that big dog of his hey ernie scooped a hand at him go away he lowered his voice they probably put a cord leather string sinew around his neck and inserted a stick in the back of the cord and as it were twisted it the stick thus tightening the sinew around his that is fragments of the cord have been found actually embedded in his neck ma wagstaff didnt react like a normal old woman didnt recoil or even wince well she said well what said ernie anythin else ernie went cold how could she know there was more to it he looked over her head at the bloodied sky well seems they theyd have pulled his head back his throat was suddenly dry hed read this report four times quite dispassionately at first and then with a growing excitement but an academic excitement which was all right emotionally hed remained unmoved it had after all happened a good two thousand years ago almost in prehistory so the headd be sort of pulled back with the the garotte when theyd brought the bogman out a little crowd had assembled on the edge of the moss ernie had decided it would be all right to take a few of the older children to witness this historic event thered been no big ceremony about it the archaeologists had simply cut out a big chunk of peat with the body in the middle quite small half his legs missing and his face all scrunched up like a big rubber doll thatd been run over not very distressing more like a fossil than a corpse theyd wrapped him in clingfilm and put him in a wooden box ernie was staring into ma wagstaffs eyes those large brown orbs glowing amber out of that prune of a face and he was seeing it for the first time the real horror of it the death of a young man two thousand years ago hed be helpless ernie said semiconcussed by the blow and he couldnt move couldnt draw breath because of the garotte ma nodded that was when they cut his throat ernie said hoarsely ma nodded again behind her out on the pub forecourt a huge cheer suddenly went up the new landlord must have appeared you knew ernie said he could feel the blood draining out of his face you knew it were the custom ma wagstaff said voice very drab three times dead see ernest i were holding out the hope as thisd be just a body some poor devil as lost his way and died out on tmoss she sighed looking very old i knew really i knew it was goin tbe what it is a sacrifice it was growing dark not just any sacrifice were in trouble ernest sometimes shaw wanted to say i feel like just being with you is illegal some mornings hed be thinking ive got to get out of this ill be arrested ill be ruined but then all through the day the longing would be growing and as he changed to go out as he looked in the mirror at his thin pale face his receding hairline and his equally receding jawline he saw why he could never get out not as long as there was anything she wanted from him not as long as he continued to change they drove to a country pub and parked the saab very noticeably under a window at the front being careful to lock it and check the doors he wondered how exactly shed stolen it and obtained the keys but he knew that if he asked her she would simply laugh at him in the pub as usual he couldnt prise his hungry eyes from her she sat opposite him wearing an old fox fur coat demurely fastened to the neck shaw wondered if underneath the coat above and inside her black tights she was naked with that thought he felt his desire could lift their heavy glasstopped castiron table a good two inches from the floor you could arouse the dead he said almost without breath would you like to thereses lips smiled around her glass of port pardon arouse the dead he laughed uncomfortably quite often she would say things the meaning of which in due course would become devastatingly apparent later two miles out of macclesfield town shaw driving again she said all right lets deal with this shall we what but she was already unzipping his trousers nuzzling her head into his lap he braked hard in shock panic and uncontainable excitement yes shaw she said voice muffled you can stop the car somebody somebody might see us you know somebody walking past well therese said burrowing i suppose somebody might see you five minutes later while he was still shivering she said now lets get rid of the car she had the interior light on reapplying lipstick using the vanity mirror her fur coat was still fastened he would never know if she was naked underneath it how are we going to get home taxi theres a phone box across the road ill ring up for one while youre dispensing with the car a shaft of fear punctured his moment of relief disp how i seem to remember theres a bus shelter along here what about a quarter of a mile just take it and ram it into that he just stared at her through the windscreen he could see high evergreen suburban hedges sittingroom lights glimmering here and there through the foliage shaw said weakly why dont we just leave it somewhere parked you know discreetly therese said under a tree with the keys in yes he said inadequately she opened her door to the pavement looked scornfully back at him because it wouldnt do anything for you your whole lifes been tidy and discreet im trying to help you shaw his fingers felt numb as he turned the key in the ignition a car slowed behind them what if theres somebody in the bus shelter therese shrugged got out slammed the car door shaw dug into his jacket pocket pulled out a handful of tissues and began feverishly to scrub at the steeringwheel and the gearlever and the doorhandle and anything else he might have touched hed been doing this for a couple of minutes when a wetness oozing between his fingers told him he was now using the tissue hed employed to clean himself up after therese had finished with him and they could trace you through your semen now couldnt they dna tests genetic fingerprinting oh no banging his forehead against the steeringwheel nonono the passenger door clicked gently open the police the police had been surreptitiously following them for miles that car going slowly creeping up hed be destroyed shaw reacted instinctively he flung open his door threw his weight against it hurling himself out into the middle of the road a heavy lorry grinding past less than a couple of feet away across the roof of the saab he looked not into a police uniform but into thereses dark calm eyes ill be listening out she whispered for the sound of breaking glass chapter iii matt castle was standing on the pub steps with an arm around the shoulders of lottie his wife looked a bit awkward ernie noticed on account of lottie was very nearly as tall as matt lottie castle long time since hed seen her by eck still a stunner hair strikingly red although some of that probably came out of a bottle nowadays aye thats it lad ernie encouraged himself think about sex what you can remember nowt like it for refocusing the mind after a shock how had she known was the bogman part of the bridelow tradition was that it by eck it needed some thinking about did this but not now ill stand here matt castle was smiling so hard he could hardly get the words between his teeth sos you can all hear me inside and out can you all hear me whats he say somebody bleated to merry laughter from about three yards in front of matt ernie noted rather disapprovingly that some of this lot were halfpissed already yes we can ernie called helpfully from the edge of the forecourt thank you mr dawber ernie smiled all his expupils from no matter how far back insisted on calling him mr dawber when theyd first met he was a babyfaced twentyone and matt castle was eleven in the top class so hed be fiftysix or seven now talk about time flying i just want to say said the new licensee shockhaired and stocky that well its bloody great to be back and of course a huge cheer went up on both sides of the door matt castle bridelowborn had returned in triumph like the home team bringing back the cup except this was more important to the community than a bit of local glory looks well doesnt he ernie whispered to ma wagstaff who didnt reply always wanted a pub of me own matt told everybody never dared to dream itd be this pub the man ith moss hung around him like a great black overcoat many sizes too big ernie hoped to god it was all going to work out draughty old pile too many rooms cellars attics take a bit of upkeep absorb all the contents of your bank account by osmosis to me like to everybody else i suppose this was always bridelow brewerys pub matt was dressed up tonight suit and tie we thought it always would be at which point quite a few people turned to look for shaw horridge whod long gone but everything changes matt said fortunes rise and fall and this village owes the horridge family too much not to make the effort to understand why in the end they were forced to part with the puband of course the brewery weve all made the effort ernie thought as others murmured and we still dont understand why eeeh matt said his accent getting broader the more he spoke eeeh i wish i were rich rich enough to buy the bloody lot but at least i could put together enough for this place couldnt stand seeing it turned into a berni inn or summat no lad ernie thought left to rot but we got ourselves a bit of a bank loan and we managed it lottie castles fixed smile never wavering ernie noted when matt switched from i to we covering the money aspect matt went on about how he didnt know much about running a pub but what he did know was music they could expect plenty of that in the man ith moss matt grinned i know theres a few of you out there can sing a bit and i remember when i was a lad there used to be a troupe of morris dancers whered they go to orthopaedic hospital somebody said bugger off said matt theres to be no more cynicism in this pub all right anyroad this is open house from now on for dancers and singers and instrumentalists if there arent enough in bridelow well ship them in from outside big names too and well build up a following a regular audience from the towns and brewery or no brewery well make the man ith moss into a going concern again at which point somebody asked as somebody was bound to whether matt and his old band would get together in bridelow good point matt accepted well me old mucker willies here erics not far off and im working on a bit of a project which might just interest well somebody we used to work with eeeh must be fifteen years ago late seventies everybody listening now not a chink of bottle on glass or the striking of a match outside the sun was just a rosy memory matt broke off hey up for them as cant see lotties giving me a warning look she thinks i should shut up about this until we know one way or tother lottie smiled wryly ernie dawber was thinking what the eck was her name the girl who used to sing with matts band and then went off on her own very popular she used to be or so hed heard but what the hell matt said if im going to do this right ill need your help fact is it was this business of the bogman got me going lottie reckons ive become a bit obsessed he laughed selfconsciously but the thing is here we are literally face to face with one of our forefathers and its my belief theres a lot he can teach us ernie dawber felt ma wagstaff go still and watchful by his side i mean about ourselves about this village how we relate to it and each other and how weve progressed theres summat special about this place ive always known that moira cairns ernie remembered that was her name scottish very beautiful long black hair right matt bawled back over his shoulder into the bar lets have a few lights on like a flamin mausoleum in there ma wagstaff stiffened and plucked at ernies jacket the sun wasnt ever going to get out of that low cloud he thought wont know till tomorrow if its made it to the hills or if the moss has got it by eck he said ruefully as if his fanciful thoughts were printed on the misting mackerel sky where ma wagstaff could read them im getting a bit whimsy ernie laughed through his discomfort she made it sound like a digestive problem not before time ma said never any talking to you when you was headmaster jumpedup little devil knew it all what teacher ever dont still better late than not now then ernest dawber ill try and teach thee summat he let ma wagstaff lead him away to the edge of the forecourt from where terraced stone cottages plodded up to the hightowered church a noble sentinel over the moss what do you see this a trick question ma now with the sun gone all the houses had merged you couldnt tell any more which ones had fresh paintwork which had climbing roses or new porches only a few front steps stood out the ones which had been recently donkeystoned so they shone bright as morning to be honest ma i cant see that much cant even see colours what can you see then its not light ernie said halfclosing his eyes and its not dark everythings melting together go on i cant see the individual houses i suppose i can only see the people who live in them young frank and susan and the little lad alf beckett millicent gill at the post officegus bibby maurice and dee at the chip shop and i suppose if i look a bit harder aye you do that if i look harder i can see the people who lived in the house beforethe swains arthur swain and his pigeons alf becketts mother fortyodd years a widow i can bring them all back when ive a mind specially at this time of day but thats the danger as you get older seeing things as they were not as they are the trick said ma is to see it all at same time as it was and as it is and when i says as it was i dont just mean in your lifetime or even my lifetime i mean as far back as yon bogmans time ernie felt himself shiver he pushed the british museum papers deeper into his inside pocket whatever secret knowledge of the bogman ma possessed he didnt want to know any more ma said you stand here long enough you can see it all the way back and you wont see no colours you wont see no hard edges now when youre out on tmoss bridlo dont look that welcoming does it all cold stone you know that youve written about it enough but its not cold to us is it not when were inside no hard edges no bright colours never owt like that no only shades ma said almost dreamily thems whats kept this place the way it is shades of things shades old colours all run together no clashes know what im telling you ernest harmony ernie said is that it which is not to say theres no bickering or bits of bad feeling but fundamentally i spose bridelows one of those places where most of us are happy to be home and theres no defining that not everybodys found it were lucky weve been lucky luck something was kindling behind mas eyes eightyfive if she was a day and still didnt need glasses luck you dont see owt do you ernied had glasses fulltime since he was thirtyfive whats it got to do wi luck just a figure of speech ma balls said ma luck what this is its a balancing act very complicated for tlikes of us comes natural to nature ernie smiled as it would dont you mock me ernest dawber im sorry ma she was just a shade herself now even her blue beret faded to grey beware of bright glaring colours she said but most of all beware of black and beware of white i dont know what you mean you will said the little old woman youre a teacher she put a hand on his arm ernest im giving you a task oh eck youve to think of it as the most important task youve ever had in your life youre a man of learning ernest man wi authority used to be ma im just a pensioner now like you he was going to say then he noticed how sad and serious she was looking get that man back who but he knew how he said aghast like i said ernest thas got authority not that kind of authority for gods sake nobody there he swallowed nobody not in or near the bus shelter it was on his nearside which was no good he might get hurt so he drove further along the road reversing into someones drive heading back slowly until he could see the glasssided shelter an advertisement for martini on the end panel lit up like a cinema screen in the headlights a handsome man with wavy hair leaning over a girl on a sofa topping up her glass he was mentally measuring the distance what am i doing what am i bloody doing i could park it just here leave it walk away too far anyway for her to hear the impact in his mind he saw therese standing by the telephone kiosk about to phone for a taxi in his mind she stopped she was frowning shed be thinking what a miserable frightened little sod he was he could say there had been somebody in the bus shelter two people get angry was he supposed to kill them was he supposed to do that but she would know he stopped the car the engine idling the bus shelter had five glass panels in a concrete frame the glass would be fortified he would have to take a run at it from about sixty yards if he didnt she would know he remembered the occasions shed lost her temper with him he shivered stabbed at the accelerator with the car in neutral making it roar clutching the handbrake a slippery grip too much to lose gritting his teeth until his gums hurt too much to lose and youll feel better afterwards took his foot off closed his eyes breathed rapidly in and out the road was quiet now the hedges high on either side high as a railway embankment shaw backed up twenty or thirty yards pulled into the middle of the road felt his jaw trembling and to stiffen it retracted his lips into a vicious snarl he threw the saab into first gear realised as the stolen car spurted under him that he was screaming aloud on the side of the bus shelter the handsome man leaned over the smiling girl on the sofa topping up her glass from the bottle in the instant before the crash the dark beautiful girl held out the glass in a toast to shaw before bringing it to her lips and biting deeply into it and when she smiled again her smile was full of blood youll feel better the big lights came on in the bar and were sluiced into the forecourt through the open door where matt castle stood grinning broadly with his tall redhaired wife behind them was the boy big lad now early twenties must be not one of ernies old pupils however dic had been educated in and around manchester while his dads band was manhandling its gear around the pubs and clubs happen he will bring a bit of new life ernie said hes a good man goodness in most of us ma wagstaff said is a fragile thing as youll have learned ernest ernie dawber adjusted his glasses looked down curiously at ma as the mother of little willie wagstaff longtime percussionist in matt castles band the old girl could be expected to be at least a bit enthusiastic about matts plans ma said look at him see owt about him ernest matt castle had wandered down the steps and was still shaking hands with people and laughing a lot he looked to ernie like a very happy man indeed a man putting substance into a dream lottie castle had remained on the step half inside the doorway half her face in shadow she knows ma wagstaff said eh i doubt as she can see it but she knows anyroad ma look at him look hard look like you looked at tstreet matt castle grinning accepting a pint local hero i dont understand said ernie dawber he was beginning to think hed become incapable of understanding fortyodd years a teacher and hed been reduced to littlelad level by an woman whod most likely left school at fourteen ma wagstaff said hes got the black glow ernest what on top of everything else shed come out with tonight this jolted ernie dawber so hard he feared for his heart it was just the way she said it like picking out a bad apple at the greengrocers a little old woman in a lumpy woollen skirt and shapeless old cardigan what are you on about ernie forcing joviality bloody hell he thought and it had all started so well a real old bridelow night moira matt castle was saying aye i do think shell come if only for old times sake people patting him on the shoulder he looked fit and he looked happy he looked like a man who could achieve the black glow ernie whispered the black glow what had been banished from his mind started to flicker the images of the piper on the moss over a period of fifteen to twenty years echoes of the pipes gentle and plaintive on good days but sometimes sour and sometimes savage black glow his voice sounding miles away ma wagstaff looked up at him im buggered if im spelling it for thee part three bog oak from dawbers book of bridelow bridelow moss is a twomileswide blanket of black peat much of its native vegetation has been eroded and the surface peat made blacker by industrial deposits although the nearest smutexuding industries are more than fifteen miles away bisected by two small rivers the moss slopes down more steeply than is apparent from the foothills of the northern peak district almost to the edge of the village of bridelow in places the peat reaches a depth of three metres and although there are several drainage gullies conditions can be treacherous and walkers unfamiliar with the moss are not recommended to venture upon it in severe weather but then on dull wet days in autumn and winter the gloomy and desolate appearance of the moss would deter all but the hardiest rambler chapter i october with the rain hissing venomously in their faces they pushed the wheelchair across the cindered track to the peats edge and then dic lost his nerve and stopped further matt insisted itll sink dad look matt laughed a cawing dic looked at his mother for backup lottie looked away through her dripping hair and the swirling grey morning to where the houses of bridelow clung to the shivering horizon like bedraggled birds to a telephone wire mum in the pockets of her sodden raincoat lottie made claws out of her fingers she wouldnt look at matt even though she was sure the reason shed left her head bare that you couldnt distinguish tears from rain right abruptly matt pushed the tartan rug aside looks like ill have to walk then oh christ dad still lottie didnt look at the lad or the withered man in the wheelchair just went on glaring at the village at the fuzzy outline of the church coming to a decision then she said tonelessly do as he says dic mum lottie whirled at him water spinning from her hair will you just bloody well do it she stood panting for a moment then her lips set hard she thought she heard dic sob as he heaved the chair into the mire and the dark water bubbled up around the wheels the chair didnt sink it wouldnt sink it wouldnt be easy to get out even with only poor wasted matt in there but it wouldnt sink maybe matt was hoping they wouldnt have to get it out that hed be carried away leaving the chair behind suspended skeletally in the moss slowly corroding into the peat or maybe preserved there for thousands of years like the bogman fine matt said thats fine thanks the chair was only a foot or so from the path embedded up to its footplate in bridelow moss dic stood there tense arms spread ready to snatch at the chair if it moved go away lad matt said quietly he always spoke quietly now so calm never lost his temper never as lottie would have done railed at the heavens screaming at the blinding injustice of it stoical matt dying so well sometimes she wished she could hate him it was sunday morning as theyd lifted matts chair from the van a scrap of a hymn from the church had been washed up by the windpowered rain tossed at them like an empty crisppacket then blown away again theyd moved well out of earshot lottie looking around thinking that on a sunday there were always ramblers up from macclesfield and glossop manchester and sheffield relishing the dirty weather the way ramblers did if it belonged to anybody bridelow moss belonged to the ramblers and they made sure everybody knew it but this morning there were none the bog treacleblack under surface rust fading to a mouldering green where it joined the mist and not a glimmer of anorakorange as if somehow they knew as if word had been passed round silently like chocolate before the ramble avoid the bog avoid bridelow moss so it was just the three of them shadows in the filth of the morning go on then matt was saying trying to pump humour into his voice bugger off the pair of you lottie put out a hand to squeeze his shoulder then drew back because it would hurt him even a peck on the cheek hurt him these days it had all happened too quickly a series of savage punches coming one after the other faster and faster until your body was numbed and your mind was concussed i dont think i need to tell you do i mrs castle that hes going to die no there were signs oh small signs but i wanted him to come and tell you weeks months ago he wouldnt he has this what can i call it fanatical exuberance if he felt anything himself he just overrode it if theres something he wants to do get out of his system everything else becomes irrelevant i did try doctor but he wouldnt come please dont blame yourself i doubt if wed have been able to do much even if wed found out two or three months before we did however this business of refusing medication drugs its not a dirty word mrs castle if you could persuade him i think hes angry doctor he wont take anything that he thinks will dull his perceptions hes this is not anything youd understand hes reaching out for something go on matt said get in the van in the dry youll know when to come back and what did he mean by that as they walked away the son and the widowinwaiting she saw him pull something from under the rug and tumble it out into his lap it looked in this light like a big dead crow enfurled in its own limp wings the rain plummeted into marts blue denim cap the one he wore on stage dic said hell catch his dea stared suddenly stricken into his mothers eyes i dont understand any more he said panicked where he is ive lost him is that i mean is it any place to be in his state move lottie speaking in harsh monosyllables go the only way she could speak at all turning him round and prodding him towards the van is it the drugs mum is it the drugs responsible for this lottie climbed into the van behind the wheel slammed the door with both hands wound the window down keeping the rain on her face she said nothing dic clambered in the other side he looked more like her than matt the way his dark red hair curled defying the flattening rain matt didnt have hair any more under his blue denim cap mum no lottie said theres no drugs listen it was beginning faint and fractured remote and eerie as the call of a marsh bird familiar but alien alien now to her but not she was sure to the moss she saw that dic was crying helpless shoulders quaking an aggressive thing like little kids put on i cant cope with this i refuse to cope take it away take it off me she couldnt she turned away stared hard at the scratched metal dashboard blobbed with rain from the open window because she didnt understand it either nor she was sure was she meant to which hurt the sound which still pierced her heart which had been filtered through her husband like the blood in his veins for as long as shed known him and some years before that it had begun for the last time please god she looked out of the windowspace unblinking cheeks awash fifty yards away hunched in the peat bound in cold windingsheets of rain the black bag under his arm like a third lung matt castle playing on his pipes eerie as a marsh bird and all the birds were silent in the rain the tune forming on the wind and falling with the water the notes pure as tears and thin with illness dic rubbed his eyes with his fingers i dont know it he said i dont know this tune petulant as if this was some sort of betrayal he only wrote it a week or so ago lottie said when you were away he said trying to smile said it just came to him actually it came hard hed been working at it for weeks lament for the man hed called it shed thought at first that that was partly a reference simply to their pub the man ith moss adrift on the edge of the village cut off after all these years from the brewery but no it was another call to him wherever he was as if matt was summoning his spirit home or pleading for the man to summon him matt i cant stand this dic said suddenly dic who could play the pipes too and lots of other instruments who was a natural in his blood too his dad more proud than hed ever admit but not so proud that hed encouraged the lad to make a profession of it christ said dic is this bloody suicide is it his way of you know him better than that figuring he just wanted a row another way of coping with it its not as if hes got an audience only us only us lottie said although she knew that was wrong matt believed why else would he be putting himself through all this that there had to be an audience but it was true they were not it all right what if he dies dic said sullenly brutally what if he dies out there now lottie sighed what a mercy that would be what i mean is how would we even start to explain she looked at him coldly until he subsided into the passenger seat sorry he said the piping was high on the wind so high it no longer seemed to be coming from the sunken shape in the wheelchair from the black lung she wondered if any people could hear it back in bridelow certainly the ones who mattered wouldnt be able to the old ones ma wagstaff ernie dawber theyd be in church perhaps matt had chosen his time well so they wouldnt hear it the ones who might understand dic said how long until he stops you think this is easy for me dic you think i believe in any of this flaming stupid oh my god the piping had suddenly sunk an octave meeting the drone the marsh bird diving or falling shot out of the sky lottie stopped breathing and then with a subtle flourish of matts old panache the tune was caught in midair picked up and sent soaring towards the horizon she wanted to scream either with relief and admiration or with the most awful inexcusable kind of disappointment instead she said briskly im going to call moira tonight ive been remiss i should have told her the situation he wouldnt dic said bitch thats not fair he was twenty he was impulsive things were black and white she leaned her head back over the seat i can understand why she didnt want to get involved ok if shed known about his illness shed have been down here right away but at the end of the day i dont think that would have helped do you the end of the day funny how circumstances could throw such a sad and sinister backlight on an old cliche dic said it would have taken his mind off his condition maybe lottie shook her head its an unhealthy obsession this whole bogman business theyd never really spoken of this shed have made things worse she probably knew that he said sourly why you mean because of his other unhealthy lottie suddenly sat up in the driving seat and slapped his face hard stop it stop it now she closed her eyes on him im tired the pipes spun a pale filigree behind her sad quivering eyelids across the black moss where the rain blew in greybrown gusts take him she prayed to god to the man away was this so wrong was it wrong was it sinful to pray to the man god the man the fairies santa claus what did it matter a thrust of wind rattled the wound down window pulling behind it an organ trail from st brides the final fragment of a hymn it lay for a moment in strange harmony upon the eddy of the pipes no lottie decided its not wrong take him please anybody chapter ii three hours three hours and he hadnt touched her chrissie had heard of men who paid prostitutes just to sit on the edge of the bed for half the night and listen to them rambling on about their domestic problems maybe she should demand overtime the other one roger said the one they found in lindow i mean they christened him pete marsh they had this instant kind of affection for the thing chrissie had been dr roger halls temporary admin assistant for nearly a fortnight and was a lot more interested in him than bog people she poured coffee watching him through the motel mirror unfortunately he looked even more handsome when he was worried well i mean theres no way roger went on that i feel any kind of affection for this one its about knowledge so why not just let him go after all he must be pretty bloody creepy to have around said chrissie who shared an office at the field centre with a woman called alice she tried to imagine the situation if alice was a corpse its not creepy exactly roger sat up in bed carefully arranging the sheet over his small paunch spooks me chrissie said to be honest and i never have to see him thank god no its just its as if he knows how badly i need him how much i need to know him where hes coming from youre getting weird you tell your wife stuff like this youre kidding my wifes a doctor that was a novel twist chrissie thought my wife doesnt understand me shes too intelligent chrissie didnt care for the underlying message roger was sending out here ok he was tall he had nice crinkles around his eyes everybody said how dishy he looked on the telly and ok she was seducing him with a bit of luck but in the end onetoone was the only kind of relationship chrissie was basically interested in no need to pout he said i wasnt suggesting you were a bimbo just that a corpse is a corpse to janet regardless of its history she brought him coffee outside coming up to pm on an autumn sunday evening traffic was still whizzing up the m roger said he felt safe here the one place he could count on people he knew not showing up was the local motor lodge chrissie had booked in hed arrived later leaving his car on the main service area away from any lights he was a very cautious man he was supposed to be in london until tomorrow evening on bogman business they were reexamining the stomachlining or something equally yucky roger look chrissie lit a cigarette i know how important hes been to you for your career and everything and i take your point about him giving the field centre a new lease of life obvious we were being wound up the amount of work we were actually doing i mean ive been wound up before i bet you have roger said looking at her tits putting down his coffee cup but he still didnt reach out for her chrissie tried to find a smile but shed run out of them sunday she said sadly didnt know you were religious im not shed just suddenly thought what a way to spend a sunday evening in a motel no more than two miles from where you live with a bogmans minder do you touch him much you make it sound indecent of course i touch him he feels a bit like a big leather cricket bag you should pop in sometime be an experience for you chrissie shuddered he grinned not that youd get much out of it he hasnt got one any more what no penis chrissie wrinkled her nose dissolved or something no they must have chopped it off and his balls part of the ritual oh yucky chrissie wrapped her arms around her breasts and eased back into bed bottom first what i like best about your body roger said not moving is that its so nice and pale all over actually i had quite a deep tan in the summer still there in places not as deep as his tan ill bet thats what you call being tanned literally tanned and pickled its what it does to them the acids i like you youre pale its not healthy chrissie thought the way he brings everything back to that ancient thing its like love me love my bogman oh well roger she said hesitantly looking at the gap between them probably just about the size of the bloody bogman can i ask you something sure he said tiredly but if you want me to do anything complicated youll have to dont worry i just want to know something about you and him just to clear the air then maybe we can relax thing is thereve not been all that many bogmen found have there all right that pete marsh and before him a bunch of them in denmark but when ones discovered in this country its still a major find isnt it in archaeological terms hes worth more than the average spanish galleon yes hot property very so what said chrissie very slowly is he really doing in a littleknown university field centre behind a school playingfield in the north of england why did the british museum experts and all these london people why did they let you bring him back rogers eyes closed in on one another this is where he starts lying chrissie deduced the more university degrees a man had shed discovered the more hopeless he was at concealing untruths what i mean is she said airing the bits of knowledge shed rapidly absorbed from the press cuttings file they like to keep these things dont they they go to harwell and oxford for this radiocarbon dating and then well hes been to harwell hes been to oxford and hes been to the british museum and hes come back said chrissie whys that the archdeacon poured himself a cognac offered the bottle to the rev joel beard but wasnt entirely surprised when joel declined only we poor mortals have need of this stuff the archdeacon thought hes above all such vices sadly he thought between them on the leather threeseater chesterfield sat a shining white dome like a strange religious artefact it was joels crashhelmet hes deliberately placed it between us the archdeacon thought hes heard about me and so you know the place well i gather he said hoarsely you know hans and his family well i remember his daughter catherine joel said a wilful girl all right thought the archdeacon so youre one hundred per cent hetero i can take a hint damn you he edged back into his corner of the chesterfield and looked into his drink at the pictures on the wall out of the window at the bare front garden sepia under a victorian streetlamp anywhere but at golden joel the diocesan adonis of course joel said hes been in better health erm quite and it isnt you know that we think hes failing in some way hes been an excellent man in his time hes a very tolerant man perhaps thats part of the problem ah not that im decrying his tolerance the archdeacon snatched a sip of his brandy oh dear why did he let joel beard do this to him joel smiled or at least he exposed both rows of teeth look perhaps i can clarify some of this simon i dont think tolerance is such a fundamental virtue any more i think weve been tolerant for so long that it looks as if i mean what increasingly is the publics idea of a typical anglican clergyman you dare you brute the archdeacon thought you dare a ditherer said joel an ineffectual ditherer oh the archdeacon relaxed quite theres a big game going on you know simon we the church ought to be out there but where are we ah where indeed we arent on the pitch we arent even on the touchline perhaps not were in the clubhouse making the bloody tea said joel beard well i theres real evil about you know its all around us and its insidious a burglary somewhere in britain every thirty seconds or so an assault a rape a husband beating his wife sexually abusing his small children we talk of social problems or if we use the word evil its social evil were making excuses for them and were excusing ourselves when i was a gym teacher oh please the archdeacon saw beneath the cassock to the tensed stomach and the awesome golden chest before each rugby lesson thered be the same pathetic collection of little notes dear sir please excuse my son from games he has a minor chest infection this sort of nonsense same ones every other week the wimps well im afraid thats what we look like sometimes dear people please excuse me from confronting satan this week but my steeples developed stonefatigue and i have to organize a garden party this is what weve come to weve reached the point where were ashamed to wield the weapons forged for us by god the archdeacon refused to allow himself to contemplate the weapon god had forged for joel beard he took a mouthful of cognac and held it there while joel talked of the churchs manifest obligation to confront the ancient enemy again lord but he was a magnificent sight when firedup that profile hard as bronze those rigid golden curls upstairs in his files the archdeacon kept seven photocopies of the famous picture of joel in the sheffield star the one of him brandishing his outsize pectoral cross at the time this dramatic pose had only reinforced the diocesan consternation expressed when joel still at college had been on local radio threatening physical disruption of certain halloween festivities planned by the university students union the archdeacon had managed to placate the bishop whod been suggesting immediate efforts ought to be made to interest this turbulent mature student in a period of foreign missionary work the colombian jungles or somewhere equally dangerous known his type before the bishop fumed more trouble than theyre worth these selfpublicists nonsense said the archdeacon with respect men like beard must be considered the churchs future if the church is to have one during these discussions about his future joel had apparently received a series of telephone calls alerting him to inbred evil in a small village in the southern pennines anonymous of course but werent they always and wasnt the archdeacon himself becoming just a little tired of hans gruber the oldfashioned rural priest treading his own sheeptracks totally immersed in his parish oblivious to the diocese mustnt be afraid to get physical joel thumped the back of the chesterfield and the archdeacon almost fainted or indeed metaphysical well then the archdeacons hand was shaking so much he had to put down his glass if youre determined to face this thing headon well delay no longer theres just this question of accommodation in bridelow not had a curate for so long we let the house go i understand said joel that theres accommodation in the church itself in the ch you dont mean this priests hole sort of place under the floor youre not serious well said joel shortterm i see no reason why not it was originally intended as emergency accommodation for visiting clergy i gather and how often does a priest get the opportunity to experience a night in the house of god quite said the archdeacon quite he was remembering the old story about an itinerant bishop of sheffield a century or so ago whod spent a night under the church at bridelow and was supposed to have gone potty silly story but still was it wise for joel to sleep down there alone the archdeacon tingled finally chrissie said admit it youre getting a bit obsessed thats ridiculous not much conviction there im just stressed thats all im not good at deception no youre not i meant with janet look would you mind putting that thing out he reached over her took the cigarette from between her fingers and dropped it in an ashtray on the bedside ledge well honestly its not an obsession he said not the way you think look ill tell you ok but youve got to keep it to yourself not a word ok thing is ive ive had approaches lucky you when a few minutes ago hed put a hand experimentally on her thigh it had felt like a lukewarm wet sponge he said when you were young thank you very much roger no no i mean when you were a child did you ever read stanages books sta oh john peveril stanage she felt a mild stirring of interest not his usual type of stultifying archaeological tome well who didnt he wanted to see me roger said or rather he wanted me to go and see him good god is he still alive very much so not yet sixty id guess course hes been a published writer since his early twenties which makes him very rich i suppose chrissie said you wouldnt know it to see where he lives end of one of those rundown georgian terraces in buxton sort of seedy palatial inside but im assured hes loaded you remember much about his stuff i wasnt much of a reader chrissie admitted but you didnt need to be much of a reader to get into his books really exciting and interesting you know because they were usually about places we knew king arthur in manchester i remember that one castle fields it was called i think that right thats right and the bridestones chrissie sat up in bed gosh yes and blue john blue johns way god i remember when i was yes thank you chrissie anyway turns out stanage is quite a serious antiquarian in an amateur sort of way obsessed for a long time with the celtic history of the northwest albeit in a fanciful mystical fashion roger sniffed so naturally hes quite excited about our friend from the peat god chrissie thought another one what is it with this corpse and hes talking about establishing some son of foundation through the university to set up an official celtic museum keep this under your hat wont you chrissie im not wearing a bloody hat she thought im not wearing anything in case you havent noticed with the bog body as a centrepiece oh she was starting to see money big money said roger and stanages foundation would also support continued research which would keep us all in work to say the least so naturally im keeping him to myself were going to work out the logistics of it between us and then present a complete package an arrangement nobody not the university nor the british museum can afford to turn down and what does he get out of it stanage i mean what does the great man get out of dealing exclusively with you and keeping it all under wraps until youre ready to turn it to your advantage er he just likes being in on it i think roger said trying to look as if this aspect hadnt occurred to him before he gets access to the bogman pretty much whenever he wants which explained why roger had been so keen to bring the body back to the field centre chrissie gave him a wry look he didnt appear to notice so im having to keep all these balls in the air juggle stanage the university the british museum and now those sodding bridelow people who want the bloody thing put back sorry chrissie had been thinking ruefully about balls in the air who wants it back roger snorted theyre superstitious we know that our friend himthat he was sacrificed for some reason maybe to persuade the gods to keep the romans at bay after the celts were driven out of the fertile lowlands of cheshire and clwyd and into the hills barbaric times chrissie said thinking of arnold schwarzenegger in skins and a headband so incredible as it may seem that serious archaeological research in this day and age should still be complicated by this kind of crap it appears some people in bridelow feel that by taking the thing away well bring bad luck down on the village as simple and as primitive as that sort of like tutankhamens tomb if you like chrissie wanted to laugh it was preschwarzenegger more like one of those old hammer films peter cushing as roger hall keep getting pestered by this man dawber who admittedly was quite useful at first used to be head teacher at the local school sort of amateur historian roger said the words amateur historian like other people would say dog turd oh of course i know him chrissie said mr dawber tubby little chap rather cute i suppose you think hes an eccentric whereas stanage stanage knows roger said strangely he seemed to remember his coffee it was cold he put the cup down looked uncomfortable dawbers trouble he says we should get this now weve done all our tests and found out everything we can we should put the thing back in bridelow moss in a secret location of their choosing this is the bloody villagers on the scientific basis that if the peat has preserved him for two thousand years its probably the best way of keeping him in good nick for another two thousand he laughed bitterly the crackpot elements you have to deal with when you unearth something that catches the public imagination oh youll deal with crackpots roger chrissie thought youll deal with crackpots if theres something in it for you after about half an hour roger tried again disastrously stress he explained the stress of keeping your balls in the air they lay in the dark and talked some more talked about her exhusband who drank talked about his wife who was brilliant and capable and seemed to power an entire hospital on an average of twentyeight hours sleep per week talked about him roger and him him look what i said about stanage forget it will you forget i even mentioned stanage all right chrissie said forehead roger said to the ceiling sometimes when janets on nights at the general i wake up in the early hours feeling really sort of cold and clammy which didnt exactly augur well chrissie thought for the next few hours and you know i can almost feel it in the bed with me lumps of it jesus she said lumps peat lumps of peat roger slid a damp and hopeless hand along her left thigh thats stress for you chapter iii central scotland the earls place was nineteenthcentury gothic a phoney draculas castle with a lofty great hall that stank the american thought of aristocratic bullshit domination and death he could tell the woman hated it too especially the skulls or maybe she had something else on her mind she was worried he could tell that much still he wasnt about to miss this opportunity he kept glancing at her over dinner at the long baronial table a couple of hours ago all that wonderful long black hair with the single streak of grey hed never seen her before not in concert not even on the tv but he knew the face from the album covers and hed know the voice she was standing alone by the doorway frowning at the gruesome trophies on the walls not talking to anyone although there were people all around her expensively dressed people crystal glasses hanging from their fingers like extra jewellery he supposed shed be a couple of years older than he was which only added to that mysterious lustrous glamour pretty soon shed pick up her guitar and take her place on the central dais to sing for them all which didnt give him much time what he needed was a neat elegant opening line kind of imagining her general aura being so magical that one would come naturally he carried his glass across stood alongside her following her gaze around the overloaded walls he said uh and followed up with something so dumb he could only hope to attribute it to the impact of fifteenyearold malt on an uncultured brain impressive huh he said she looked at him coldly looked at him like she was thinking yeah well you would have to be impressed by this kind of victorian shit where you come from pal this most likely is what passes for ancient right after its fashion she said mildly from the middle of a cluster of people the earl was watching them or rather watching him because he was american and therefore could maybe buy this place and everything else of its kind between here and pitlochry many times over the earl was a sleek man english all the way down to the tip of his sporran but the earl wanted to be a real celt and no doubt was counting on the american wanting that too all the way down to the deepest part of his wallet a discreet buffcoloured card handed to him several weeks ago by his mother who also unfortunately was his boss had said the celtic bond a major conference of politicians and poets writers broadcasters and business people to establish an international support mechanism for the regeneration of a submerged european culture hosted at his scottish family seat by shit hed said in some dismay youre kidding arent you she wasnt since she lost the use of her legs the single most important element in his mothers life had become her scottish ancestry we are celts mungo shed say above all never forget that by which she meant her side of the family hence he bore her family name rather than that of his longgone longforgotten father if i can say this he said now politely trying to recover some credibility you dont seem too relaxed no she wore a long black dress very plain he could sense no perfume i mean i cant imagine youd be nervous about performing she wasnt looking at him she was still looking at the heads huge sets of antlers protruding from bleached fragments of skull all over three walls from just above headheight to within a couple of feet of the lavishly moulded ceiling and i guess you arent the nervous kind anyway he said so wherever you sat the remains of three or four dozen butchered stags were always in view on the central wooden dais where shed sit to sing shed probably feel herself constricted by some grisly necklace of bone gross i was just wondering she said at last when it must have been clear he wasnt going to go away why people should be proud of being a celt killing things for fun and showing off about it a good work popped up in the americans head like somebody had flashed him a promptcard pantheistic he said the old celts were highly pantheistic so im told that means they had respect for animals she said scornfully she had a soft scottish voice but not too much of an accent a bit like your red indians native americans he smiled to be politically and ethnically correct the smile was supposed to say i may be devilishly attractive with my untamed curly black hair this cool white tuxedo thistle in the buttonhole but you can trust me im a sincere guy can i get you another drink no she said no thank you i ah he hesitated i have a couple of your albums oh she didnt seem too interested which ones well uh my favourite i guess is still the one you did with the philosophers stone thatd be quite some years ago oh she glanced away as if looking for someplace else to put herself uh i also have your first solo album he said quickly how i recognized you from the sleeve you havent changed oh ive changed believe me look i you never did cut your hair though he said urbanely displaying his knowledge of the albums prime cut what never let them cut your hair he quoted or tell you where listen i i just wanted to say its real good to meet you moira no one said youd be here makes me glad i came after all she said im a lastminute replacement for rory mcbain hes sick we have the same agent a flunkey needed to come past with a tray of drinks and he took the opportunity to manoeuvre her into a corner unfortunately under two pairs of huge yellowing antlers he said listen that album with the stone it had some magic he has bronchitis moira said huh rory mcbain he smiled see when i hear you sing it always sounds to me like that album she said with an air of finality was a mistake i was too young too stupid and i never should have left matt castles band huh she shook her head wideeyed like she was waking up matt castle he had his elbow resting on a wooden ledge below another damned antlered skull he was he was just the guy who taught me about traditional music when i was a wee girl look i dont know why i said that i her poise wavered she looked suddenly confused and vulnerable something inside of him melted with pure longing while something else something less admirable but more instinctive tensed like a big cat ready to spring the album cover hadnt lied even after all these years she was sensational traditional music he said looking into her brown eyes thats interesting because thats all you do these days right you used to write all your own songs and now youre just performing these traditional folksongs like youre feeling theres something that old stuff can teach you is that this uh matt castle his influence no no matt was a long time ago when i was in manchester he look if you dont mind he was losing her he couldnt bear it he tried to hold her eyes babbling manchester thats the north of england see why i find that interesting this guy was telling us at the conference this afternoon how the english are the least significant people culturally that is in these islands unlike the scottish the welsh the irish the english are mongrels with no basic ethnic tradition she smiled faintly look im sorry i see this guy this irish professor mcgann mcguane he said there was nothing the english could give us best they could do is return what they took but its soiled goods at which point this other guy this writer no first off it was this cornish bard but he didnt make much sense then this writer stanton stanhope hes on his feet and is he madthis guys face is white i thought he was gonna charge across the room and bust the first guy the professor right in the mouth hes going listen where i come from we got a more pure undiluted strain of uh heritage traditionthan youll find anywhere in western europe and the guy this stanfield hes from the north moira cairns said im sorry i really do have to make a phone call and she turned and glided out of the doorway like the girl in the irish folksong who went away from this guy and movd through the fair the north of england the american said to the stags head this wasnt a new experience for him but it was certainly rare you blew it he told himself surprised she could feel him watching her through the doorway all the way down the passage was he the one she took a breath of cool air the man was a fanatic probably one of those rich new yorkers bankrolling the ira surely there was some other unattached female he could find to sleep with tonight why were fanatics always promiscuous and was he the one whose examination she could feel all over her skin like she was being touched up by hands in clinical rubber gloves phone she said to a butlertype person in the marbletiled hallway next to the drawing room madam ill take you dont bother yourself ill find it dong shed found herself for no obvious reason while this smoothie american was trying to come on to her hearing the name matt castle then saying it out aloud apropos of nothing and then dong this was the dong the hollow chime not the link not the ping aw hey no please the phone turned out to be in the room where shed left her guitar where it would be safe the black case lying in state like a coffin across two jacobean chairs safe here shed thought surely this is a castle but shed take it with her when shed made her call she stood in front of the phone picked it up and put it back a couple of times she didnt know who to ring malcolm if in doubt call malcolm she was planning anyway to strangle the bastard for tonight youll enjoy it hed insisted youll find it absolutely fascinating rorys mortified she rang him at home in dumbarton malcolm she said i may never convince myself to forgive you for this i may even cast about in the sharkinfested waters you inhabit for a new agent he didnt say a word had he heard all this before from her more than once was she becoming querulous creeping middle age she felt tired woozy she shook herself straightened her back raised her voice listen there are socalled celts here not only from ireland and wales and brittany but from switzerland and italy with mafia connections no doubt and america and some wee place nudging up to turkey and they are to a man malcolm they are a bunch of pretentious elitist possibly racist wankers racism malcolm said i thought it was about money ec grants cultural exchanges more ec grants aye well is it not a good fee for you is it the same fee as rorys fee would have been oh moira come now forget it listen the real reason i disturbed you on the sabbath not my sabbath as it happens is my answering machine is on the blink and i suspect someones trying to get hold of me and its no my daddy because i called him nothing urgent that im aware of moira dont you worry your head no messages none at all he paused you arent feeling unwell again you im fine her left hand found the guitar case clutched at it she had that feeling again of being touched she shivered she felt cold and isolated but also crowded in under detailed examination too many impressions the hollow chime the eyes the touch impersonal like a doctors too much too close she had to get out of here its none of my business of course said malcolm who believed in the agents right to know but what was it exactly that made you think someone wanted to contact you just a feeling just a feeling aye she said wearily there was nothing touching her now the room was static and heavy no atmosphere the furniture lumpen without style a museum nothing here nothing right he said you are a strange witchy woman moira malcolm moira said go fuck yourself huh from dawbers book of bridelow religion i bridelow is dominated by the ancient church dedicated to saint bride and built upon a small rise thought to be the remains of the low or burial mound from which the village gets the other half of its name the tower is largely norman with later medieval embellishments although there was considerable reconstruction work to this and to the main body of the church in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries the clock was added to the tower following a donation by the bridelow brewery in and was subsequently illuminated enhancing the role of the tower as a beacon for travellers lost on bridelow moss the churchyard offers a spectacular view over the moss and the surrounding countryside which to the rear gives way to a large tract of moorland uninhabited since prehistoric days chapter iv during evensong though he still didnt know quite what had happened with matt the rector said a short prayer for the dying landlord of the man ith moss holding on to the lectern eyes raised to the bent and woven branches of the autumn cross he said carefully grant him strength o lord and a peaceful heart not quite sure what he meant but he felt it was the right thing to say you learned to trust your instincts in bridelow sure enough several members of the congregation looked up at him conveying tacit approval briefly he felt the warmth of the place again the warmth hed always remember a quite unexpected warmth the first time hed experienced it unexpected because from the outside the church had such a forbidding fortresslike appearance especially from a distance viewed from the road which traversed the moss he remembered his first sight of the building close on thirty years ago not inspiring in those days for a novice minister hard and greyblack with too many spiky bits and growling gargoyles and our sheila perpetually playing with herself over the porch this was the s when what the young clergyman dreamed of was a bright modern church with a flat roof and abstract stained glass after ten years it would look like a lavatory block but in the sixties one imagined things could only get better and better amen the congregation said as one the old schoolmaster ernest dawber glanced up at the rector and gave him a quick sad smile the warmth sometimes it had seemed as if the church walls themselves were heating up under the pale amber of the lights they were old gasmantles converted to electricity like the scattered streetlamps outside and at christmas and other festivals it felt as though the great squat pillars either side of the nave had become giant radiator pipes but the warmth was rarely as apparent now the rector wondered if it would even be noticeable any more to a newcomer perhaps not hed gone to the expense of ordering more oil for the boiler and increasing the heat level knowing all the same as he went through the motions that it couldnt be that simple thered been a draught in the pulpit today he certainly hadnt known that here before the draught was needlethin but it wasnt his imagination because every so often the autumn cross would sway a little over his head rustling it rustled now as he read out the parish notices and something touched his hair startling him when he reached out his flingers found a dead leaf it crackled slightly reminding him of the furious flurry of leaves blasted against his study window at dusk like an admonishment you must not watch us you must turn your face away a strikingly cold autumn october frost nearly all the trees were bare his arthritis playing up giving him a hard time tonight difficult keeping his mind on the job wanting only to get it over and limp back to his study even though since judys death this had become the loneliest place of all and on wednesday evening therell be a meeting of the morrismen in the function room at the man thats the congregation numbered close on seventy tonight not a bad turnout a few regular faces missing including several members of the committee of the mothers union but that wasnt too surprising theyd been here this morning couldnt expect anyone to attend twice even the mothers he rounded off the service with a final hymn accompanied as usual by alfred beckett on the harmonium a primitive reedy sound but homely thered never been an organ in bridelow church despite its size well done lad ernie dawber said at the church door patting his shoulder keep thi chin up fifteen years his senior bridelow born and bred ernie dawber had always called him lad when the rector had first arrived hed expected a few problems over his name it had still seemed too close to the war for the locals not to be dubious about a new minister called hans gruber the schoolmaster had repeated slowly rolling it round his mouth like a boiled sweet yes thats german isnt it hans had nodded but i was actually born near leighton buzzard ernie dawber had narrowed his eyes giving the new minister a very hard look word of advice lad keep quiet about that i should thing is glancing from side to side theres a few folks round here whore not that keen on dropping his voice southerners the rector said now thinking of his lonely study come back for a glass ernie i dont trunk so lad ernie dawber pulled on his hat not tonight ill never forgive you for this he was gripping the stiffened edge of the sheet like a prisoner clutching at the bars of his cell his final appeal turned down we should never have let you go home mr castle the nursing sister said matt please lottie put her cool hand over his yellowed claw dont say that you never listen feebly shaking his head inconsolable all the way here in the ambulance lottie holding his hand hed been silent away somewhere still on the moss perhaps his eyes shone with the tears that wouldnt come no moisture left in his body the nurse said i think he should have some sleep dont you mrs castle sleep matt was bleakly contemptuous no real sleep in here comes out of the bloody drug cabinet only sort sleep you can get in here he looked past the nurse wheres dic i told you matt lottie said gently he wouldnt come in hes too confused hes probably walking round the grounds walking it off hell come in tomorrow when hes might be too late tomorrow lottie smiled at him dont be soft there was a small commotion behind her a nurse and a young porter putting screens around a bed opposite matts another one gone matt grunted bath time thats all the nurse said unconvincingly give you any old crap in here look tell dic his faltering voice forming words as dry and frail as an ancient cobweb tell him he can be in the band if he wants to then when moira comes he can play but you wont will you you never do owt i say you tell him lottie said tell him when you see him in the morning matt castle made no reply he seemed too dehydrated to sweat or to weep it was as though somebody had talcumed his face like a lottie swallowed hard useless bitch matt fell asleep shrivelled leaves unseen chattered on the windowpane the dead leaves said go away draw the curtains put on the light its not your affair the dead leaves said the rector didnt move just as he hadnt moved in the late afternoon at dusk when the warning flurry had hit the pane as if flung at the top end the vicarage garden almost vanished into the moor when the light faded the low stone wall between them dissolved into shadow and the garden and the moor became one on the other side of the wall was a public footpath it was along this they came and sometimes over the years around dusk the rector had seen them had made himself watch them tonight resting up before evening service sitting in the window of the darkening study wedged into a hard chair his swollen foot on the piano stool hed watched three of them enter the churchyard from the footpath passing through the wooden wicket gate they were black shapeless hooded and silent a crescent moon had wavered behind smoky cloud it was all over though as was usual when he walked out across his garden through the gate and into the churchyard half an hour before the evening service now he was back in his study listening to the leaves with the lights out all he could see through the window was the reflection of two bars of the ineffectual electric fire when judy his wife was alive thered been a coal fire in the study every night from the end of september until the end of april the rector was cold eleven years now since judys death where had all the warmth gone the warmth which before had only increased with the drawingin of the days where had the smiles gone the smiles which lit the eyes while the mouths stayed firm and why for that matter had ma wagstaffs herbal preparation had so little effect this time on his arthritis he stood up hobbled close to the window cupped his hands to the pane and peered through at the gardens edge a few graves lurched giddily on the slope and then the church loomed like an enormous black beast lately hans gruber had been wondering if life would not have been a good deal simpler in one of those modern churches where ones main headache was gluesniffing behind the vestry us and them good and evil god and satan hans thought wouldnt that be wonderful after his wife had left theyd wheeled mr castles bed into a the ward where unless anyone was brought in suddenly hed be alone until until morning the young nurse whispered reassuring herself mr castle was sleeping she was glad she was still afraid of people who were dying who were in the actual process of it she wasnt yet sure how to talk to them how to look at them and the awful suspense what it would be like the atmosphere in this small comparatively quiet space in the moment the very second when it happened she was never going to get used to this she was supposed to comfort the dying but more often than not it was the dying who comforted her old ladies all skin and bone and no hair patting her hand one actually saying dont worry luv i wont keep you long less bothered it often seemed than she was sometimes it was like they were just waiting for a bus she sat at the desk by the door under the angled metalshaded lamp the only light in the room there were four beds in the side ward three of them empty it was the only part of this hospital where you could usually count on finding a couple of spare beds it being the place where terminal patients were often brought in the final stages so they wouldnt distress other patients who were not quite so terminal tamsin the other nurse a year or two older was out on the main ward sister murtry would pop in occasionally see if they were all right sister murtry had been very firm with mrs castle who was a tall stronglooking woman only sister murtry would have dared come on now he needs his sleep and you need yours mr castle waking up suddenly and chuckling in a ghastly strangled way when she said he needed sleep she looked across now at his face on the pillow his skin was like cold lumpy wrinkled custard he wasnt so very old fiftyseven it said on his chart not even elderly will you be sure to mrs castle had been in the doorway sister murtrys hands on her shoulders pushing her out yes ill ring you myself if theres any change but there probably wont be you know just go and get your sleep or well be seeing you in here too she imagined mrs castle lying wide awake in a cold double bed waiting for the phone to ring the wind howling outside they lived up by bridelow moor didnt they the wind always howled up there he was quite a famous man mr castle thered been dozens of get well cards when he was in last year for tests and things dr smethwick the registrar who was a folk music fan had been thrilled to bits to have him in pioneer of the pennine pipes she remembered him saying and dr bun had said dry as a stick oh he works for the water authority does he and shed rushed out scared to giggle because she was still a student then and dr smethwick was senior to dr burt dr smethwick had moved on to a better job in liverpool now there was nobody left who knew anything about mr castle or the pennine pipes all he had tonight was her and she was afraid of him because he was dying she wondered how many folk had died here in this small space over the years passed away they still preferred you to say that to the relatives she said it to herself passsssed awayyyy soft like a breath of air she jumped mr castle had released a breath of air but it wasnt soft it was phtttt like a cork popping out of a bottle or like a quiet fart one of the regular noises of the night here mr castle whispering rising rapidly to her feet with a rustle of the uniform bumping her head on the edge of the metal lampshade all right mr castle matt a hairgrip dislodged by the lamp fell to the desk she felt her hair corning loose at the back im here but when she reached the bedside he was breathing normally again well not normal normal but normal for a man who for a man in his condition holding her hair in place with one hand the grip in her teeth she went into the main ward to collect her mirror from her bag plenty breathing out here and snoring and a few small moans everything hospitalnormal up the far end of the ward tamsin was bending over miss watelys bed miss wately the retired headmistress who wouldnt be called by her first name which was eunice tamsin straightened up saw her and raised a hand to her lips tilting her head back as if the hand held a cup she nodded and smiled and pointed over her shoulder to the side ward and tamsin nodded and held up five fingers ger yer owd bugger an old man rasped in his sleep it was supposed to be a mixed ward but because of the attitude of patients like miss wately the men tended to be at one end and the women at the other best really at their age no kimonostyle dressinggowns and babydoll nighties on this ward she found the mirror slipped it into her pocket went back to the side ward and sat down her eyes moving instinctively from bed to bed four beds all empty moira all empty oh she spun round her hair unravelling down below her shoulders he said youve come then eh god help us he was hanging over her like bones in pyjamas mr ca what was holding him up shed seen his legs his muscles wasted gone to jelly been in a wheelchair for weeks and weeks theyd said to watch him he might even die in the night and here he was standing up oh god his lips all pulled back and frozen into a ricrictus tarn trying to shout for the other nurse but her voice was so dry the name just dropped out of her mouth like a piece chewing gum sin hardly heard herself his eyes were far back in his head black marbles like the eyes had already died then one of his hands reached out it was all shrivelled and rigid like a chickens foot and he started he started playing with her hair pulling it down and fingering it looking down at it in his fingers mumbling moira moira eventually she managed to say im not your wife mrmr castle but remembered sister murtry saying her names charlotte i think and then later come on charlotte lets be having you cant stay here all night not good for either of you she couldnt move the metal bars on the bed heads made hard shadows on the walls the little ward was like a cage if only sister murtry would come now bustling in short and dynamic nobody sister murtry couldnt handle oh god this was the wrong job she hated dying people their stretched skin their awful smell especially this one the damp stench of ripe putrid earth the grave she began to shiver and tried to stand up drawing back away from him but there was nowhere to go her bottom was pressed into the edge of the desk and mr castle was still hanging over her like a skeleton in a rotting sack and smelling of wet earth how could he smell of earth of outside tam sin her scream was a whisper but her mouth was stretched wide as his greenish chickenfoot hand whipped out and seized her throat chapter v central scotland the scuffed sixteenyearold ovation guitar with its fibreglass curves was a comfort its face reflected the great fire blazing on the baronial hearth ladies of noble birth adjusting the microphone in those days they didnt have too much of a say in it when it came to husbands this is thumbing an aminor tweaking the top string up a fraction this is the story of a woman whos found herself betrothed to a titled guy much younger than she is however gliding over a c i doubt if were talking toyboys as we know them this is like nine or ten right tuning ok i mean you know theres a limit to the things you can get from a boy of nine or ten no reaction you bastard malcolm and you rory mcbain one day you really will be sick anyway shes stuck with this kid and shes standing on the castle walls watching him playing down below working out the dispiriting mathematics of the situation and wondering if shuffling on the stool tossing back the black wings of her hair the weight of it down her back pulling her upright so that she could see the audience and the gleaming stag skulls all round the walls of neatly dressed stone with spotlit banners and tapestries the black eyeholes in the skulls and the eyes of the conference delegates looking from five or so yards away just as opaque and unmoving anyway dont expect a happy ending ok this is a traditional song you dont get many happy endings in traditional songs its called lang agrowin the bastard mcbain would have handled this better for the sake of ethnic credibility hed do a couple of songs in the gaelic of which he understood scarcely a word what she had these days was a different kind of credibility sophistication fancy nightclub ethnic low and sultry vocals folk tunes with a touch of jazz guitar strictly rationed to what she could handle without fracturing a fingernail hes young hearing her own voice drifting vacuously on the air the words like cigarette smoke but hes daily growin over an hour ago shed called lotties number a guy answered obviously not the boy dic the guyd said lottie was at the hospital in manchester muffled voices in the background this was a pub right shed asked no more questions shed call back the hospital in manchester oh hell the great hall was huge the acoustics lousy when the song was over applause went poppoppop like a battery of distant shotguns the stags heads gathered grimly below the ceiling so many that the antlers looked to be tangled up splendid she heard the earl call out magnanimously how many wee staggies did you pop yourself my lord your grace whatever maybe you invited members of the royal family to assist traditional right moira did a bit of fine tuning on the guitar she was wearing the black dress and the cameo brooch containing the stained plaid fragment that was reputed to have been recovered from a corpse at culloden credibility this song you may not know the title most of you but the tune could be slightly familiar its the lament of a girl whose mans gone missing at sea and she waits on the shore accosting all the homecoming fishermen as they reach land the songs called cam ye oer frae campbelltoon its er its traditional traditional my arse me and kenny savage wrote it still halfpissed at a party in kennys flat in like hey i know how about we invent a totally traditional celtic lament she told them the assembled celts the chorus is very simple so feel free to join in and by christ they did join in probably with tears in their eyes all these scots and irish and welsh and bretons and the folk from the wee place up against turkey writers and poets and politicians united in harmony with a phoney chorus composed amidst empty yugoslav riesling bottles at the fag end of kenny savages decree absolute party in dawnstreaked stranraer what a sham eh i mean what am i doing here and matt castle dying tears in her own eyes now last year hed told her on the phone that hed be ok the tests had shown it wasnt malignant and shed believed him so much for intuition the damn tears would be glinting in the soft spotlight theyd put on her and the celtic horde out there maudlin with malt would think she was weeping for the girl on the shore at stranraer and weeping also naturally for the plight of scotland and for the oldest race in europe trampled into the mud of ages thank you she said graciously as they applauded not so much her as themselves a confusion of racial pride with communal selfpity and that makes it nine songs over an hour gone corning up to time to wind this thing up yeh lifting the guitar strap out of her hair lets get the hell out of here at which point someone called out smoothly would it be in order to request an encore she tried to smile maybe you could play the comb song it was him it would have to be the new york supplier of semtex money to the ira aw thats just a kiddies song standing up the guitarstrap halfoff well i dont know about the other people here the voice said and it was not the american but its the song i most associate with you and i was rather disappointed not to hear oh hell its a good long time ago i dont think i even remember the words who the fuck was this if you go wrong im sure we could help you out she couldnt make out his face behind the spotlight she looked up in search of inspiration but her gaze got entangled in antlers also she said miserably it isnt exactly traditional and its awful long see i dont want to bore your friends here miss cairns the earl himself took a step towards the dais into the spotlight the light making tiny dollarsigns in his eyes i doubt if any of us could possibly be bored by any of your songs a touch of threat under the mellifluousness some flunkey had replaced the empty guinness glass by her stool with a full one she picked it up put it down again without drinking there were murmurings what the hell am i going to do now she felt their stares the more charitable ones maybe wondering if she was ill aw shit what she didnt feel any more were the eyes of the watcher this had maybe been a mistake sometimes you made mistakes it probably had been the american and it probably was no heavier than lust i warn you moira said as the ovations strap sank back into her shoulder this is the longest song i ever wrote and to the accompaniment of a thin cheer from the floor her fingers found the chord and she sang the rather clumsy opening lines trying not to think about it trying to board up her mind against all those heavyweight memories tramping up the stairs her father works with papers and with plans her mother sees the world from caravans the song telling the story of this shy drab child growing up in the suburbs of a staid clydeside town with the everpresent feeling that shes in the wrong place that she really ought to be some other person bad times at school no friends brought up at home by the grandmother restrictive oldfashioned presbyterian i wish to god you hadna been born your hairs a mess get it shorn get it shorn then the song becoming a touch obscure one night around the time of her adolescence the child seems to be in this dark wood when the moon breaks through the clouds and trees and she finds shes holding this curious ancient comb its a wonderful magic comb and apparently is the key to the alternative reality which for all these years has been denied to her she runs it through her hair and becomes electrified metamorphoses into some kind of beautiful princess fairytale stuff she sees herself in colours and she weighs her powers in her hand dead silence out there she had them oh it had its magic this bloody song which intelligent people were supposed to think was all allegorical and the comb a metaphor for the great celtic heritage most likely this was how the american saw it and the other guy whod demanded the song a bastard to write the words wouldnt hang together sign of a song that didnt want to be written the song knew from the start some things are too personal chorus never let them cut your hair or tell you where youve been or where youre going to from here couple of twiddly bits which after all these years she fluffed then dropping down to minor key for the main reason she hadnt wanted to perform this number the creepy stuff the heavy stuff and in the chamber of the dead forgotten voices fill your head sure there they are tinny little voices highpitched fragmented chattering like a cheap transistor radio with its battery dying tune it in tune it in who is this who is it no no no no oh shit please dont die matt dont die on me nowyou have no right singing on through her wild tears an awed silence in the room like a giant cavern hall of ages caged in bones you think you know this song these words mr new york irishman for the night is growing colder and you feel it at your shoulder icybright singing now purged of that phoney guinnessy growl one or two women out there shivering and reaching for their cardigans the song rippling across the night sky down the dark years and youre watching its wavering passage from a different level like an air traffic controller in a tower late at night something flying out to meet it on a collision course give up you fool there is no heat the abyss opens up beneath your feet here he is again uncertainly into the spotlight looking around hello again earl something wrong is there my lord your grace is it cold for you in here will you get some servant to turn up the heating throw more peat on the fire and all the while will you listen to these wee voices chattering chattering chattering the comb is ice its brittle oh you cannot hold it must let go yes let it go its a trinket its worthless it takes your energy let it drift let the night have it let these christ these are not my words these are somebody elses words im singing somebody elses goddamn words and the comb is being pulled away now in a deceptively soft silver haze gently at first just a tug then insistent irritable let it come you bitch and slender hands slender like wires scalpelling into her breast feeling delicately but brutally and coldly like a pathologist at an autopsy for her emotional core for the centre of her somebody in a frenzy shes letting go of the song shes groping wildly at the air feeling her spirit straining in her body as the big lights come on huge shimmering chandeliers moira has fallen down from the stool shes lying twisted and squirming on the carpeted dais both arms wrapped around the guitar from miles away people are screaming or is it her screaming at them stop it catch it dont let it go from here help me help me she can hear them coming to help her the army of her fellowcelts but they cant get through they cant get through the walls of bone the walls of jiggling swelling bone not just the skulls any more the plasters fallen from the walls and the walls are walls of bone whole skeletons interlocking creaking and twisting and the jaws of the skulls opening and closing grisly grins and clacking laughter of teeth right up against her face shes trapped like a beating bloody heart inside a ribcage she sees the comb and all it represents spinning away until its nothing but a hairline crack of silverblue she watches it go like a mother who sees her baby toddling out of the garden and into the dust spurting from the wheels of an oncoming articulated lorry mammy but you cant hear me can you mammy the connections broken im on my own but no there is a man a tall thin man with a face so white it might be the face of some supernatural being no this is a real man hes wearing an evening suit a bowtie he has a small voluptuous mouth and an expanse of white forehead marked with greyish freckles and the white hair ripples back from the forehead not receding it has always been that way she ought to know him he knows her and where she keeps the comb this person unnoticed in the hubbub by everyone but her is lifting the black guitar case from the steps of the dais and examining it to see how it opens he looks at her furiously impatient and the air between them splinters like ice and when she tries to see into his eyes and they are not there only the black sockets in a face as white as any of the skulls their eyes meet at last his have projected into the sockets from somewhere they are light grey eyes and theres a whiteness around him growing into arms like treebranches above his head no not arms not branches antlers moira shrieked flinging the guitar away from her it made a mangled minor chord as it rolled down the steps of the dais she threw herself after it headlong into the glassspattered guinnesssodden tartan carpet clawing at the pair of shiny elegant evening shoes the air at first full of swirling unfocused energy and then for a moment everything was still most of those in the room were still seated at their tables with drinks in front of them the men and women in their evening wear white shirts and black bowties jewellery and silk and satin the american half out of his seat dark irish hair tumbling on to his forehead the earl on his feet his expression dismay turning to disgust was this woman having a fit in his castle everybody shimmering with movement but nobody going anywhere projectorjam until the first skull fell it was possibly the smallest of them so comparatively insignificant that moira wondered briefly why anyone would have admitted to having shot it let alone wanted to display it she watched it happen saw the antlers just lean forward as if it was bowing its head and then the wooden shield it was mounted on splintered and the poor bleached exhibit crashed seven or eight feet on to a table crystal glasses flying into the air around it god almighty a man blurted the white eyeless head toppled neatly from the table into the lap of a woman in a winecoloured evening dress the antlers suddenly seeming to be sprouting from her ample celtic cleavage for a whole second the woman just looked at it as though it was some kind of novelty like a big fluffy bunny popped onto her knees by an admirer at a party her glossy red lips split apart into what appeared for an instant to be an expression of pure delight it was this older woman next to her whose ornate redbrown coiffure had been speared by an antler she was the one who screamed first more of an escalating gurgle actually both women jerking to their feet in quaking revulsion clutching at one another chairs flying as with a series of sickening ripping sounds several other skulls cracked themselves from the walls all at once look some guy grabbing the earl by the shoulders shaking him and began to descend in like slow motion some so old they fell apart in the air and came down in pieces moiras audience in cowering disarray stop this the earl commanding irrationally limbs jerking in spasms semaphoring incomprehensible fear like a spider caught in its own web stop it stop it at once this tumultuous tending and creaking from all the walls even the great fire looking cowed burning back low and smoky as though someone had thrown muffling peat at it next to the fireplace this severe and heavy lady a matriarch of welshlanguage television it was said just sitting there blinking confused because her spectacles had been torn off and then trodden on by a flailing bearded man some distinguished professor of celtic studies eyes full of broken glass one cheek gashed by a blade of bone and pulling her gaze away from this carnage in the choking maw of the great fireplace moira thought she saw a face so grey it could only have been formed from smoke the face swirled two thrashing arms of smoke came out into the room as if reaching for her moira whispered faintly matt but it was smoke only smoke the butler guy weaving about helplessly in the great doorway as the stag skulls fell and fell this roaring spitting avalanche of white bone and splattering glass battered heads and scored skin people yelping moaning hurling themselves under collapsing tables craving shelter from the storm she caught the black guitar case as it fell towards her caught it in her arms come to mammy she sat bewildered on the bottom step of the dais in the refrigerated air in the absurdly shocking mess of glass and antlers i have to be leaving she thought hands on her shoulders you ok moira for chrissake get the fuck off me but it was only the american mr semtex please you ok here let me take that no let it alone will you she saw the whitefaced man on his knees not six feet away he was holding one of the skulls a big skull one antler snapped off halfway ending in a savage point a dagger of bone there was blood on the point and blood welling slowly out of his left eye blood and mucus a black pool around the eye the other eye was very pale grey going on pink he was staring at her out of it moira clutched the guitar case defiantly to her throbbing breast just hang on in there pal the american said to the whitefaced man were gonna get you a doctor ignoring the american the man with the injured eye said and later the american would swear to her that he hadnt heard this that the guy was too messed up to speak at all the man said very calm very urbane dont think miss cairns that this is anything but the beginning chapter vi in matt castles band willie wagstaff had played various handdrums bongotype things and what the irish called the bodhran although matt would never call it that to him it was all pennine percussion this morning without some kind of drum under his hands willie looked vaguely disabled both sets of fingers tapping nervously at his knees creating complex silent rhythms lottie smiled wanly down at him they were sitting on wooden stools at either end of the kitchen stove for warmth can you finish it willie can it be done willie looked up at her through his lank brown fringe like a mouse emerging from a hole in the wall lukewarm autumn sunbeams danced with the dust in the big kitchen behind the public bar such a lot of dust shed been neglecting the cleaning like everything else since matt had been bad now it was over dust to dust willie said we got two or three instrumental tracks down yknow the lament it all got a bit like halfhearted as you can imagine me and eric we could see it werent going to get finished not wi matt anyroad i want it finished lottie said crisply it was his last im not going to use the word obsession ive said it too much she hesitated im not religious willie you know that not in any any respect willie gave three or four nods his chin keeping time with the fingers on his knees but i just feel that he wont be at peace that it wont be over until that musics finished aye willies fingers didnt stop nerves so what about dic lottie said will dic want to do it lottie said grimly hell do it is he good enough oh aye willie said without much difficulty i reckon he is with a bit of practice like but really like what we could do with ishe beat his knees harder to help him get it out moira she rang me lottie said last night willies eyes lit up expectant dear god lottie thought theyre all in love with her actually it was early this morning i mean very early gone midnight the kind of time people dont ring up unless its an emergency oh willie said and his hands were suddenly still she asked me about matt she said was he ill i told her yes he was very ill i told her it was close to the end i told her lottie stood up and put her hands on the warm metal covers over the hotplates of the kitchen stove pressing down with both hands hard i didnt need to tell her willie was quiet we didnt say much she started to explain why shed put him off when he wrote to her i stopped her i said wed discuss it some other time there was a new kind of silence in the room i put the phone down lottie said it was about twentyfive past twelve i waited for a minute or two in case dic had heard the phone but he was fast asleep i thought ill make some cocoa take it up with me but i didnt move i knew i mean why should she suddenly ring after all these years at that time of night and sure enough not five minutes had passed and the phone rang again and it was sister murtry at the hospital and i just said hes gone hasnt he there was more silence then lottie said ive not slept since ive just sent dic to bed for a few hours im not tired willie im not using up any energy not thinking you know lottie sat down again i shant be staying here only until its done his bloody project i think coming back here buying the pub the whole bit that was all part of it the project all i want is to draw a line under it do you see i mean i hope somebodyll buy the pub somebody sympathetic but if not she shrugged well ive got to get away regardless willie nodded fingers starting up very slowly um what about moira im not inviting her to the funeral thats for sure lottie folded her arms making a barrier if she wants to help complete these songs thatd be ill not be begging no more of that and another thing willie tell whoever needs to be told tell them im not having anything to do with these stupid traditions you know what im saying matt mightve accepted it i dont all right aye all right willie said not sounding too happy but that was his problem lottie thought yeh he said ill tell her when willie had gone lottie pushed her hands on to the hotplate covers again seeking an intensity of heat needing to feel something something beyond this anaesthetized numbness wanting pain simple pain loss sorrow not any of this confusion over the gratitude that he was gone and the wanting him back but back as he used to be before all this before his project a blinding sun through leafless trees ricocheted from the windscreens of cars on the forecourt a perky breeze ruffled the flags projecting from the motels awning and lifted tufts of chrissies auburn hair she thought she probably looked quite good all things considered that she told herself was what a good nights sleep could do for you ha roger hall paused gripping the doorhandle of his volvo estate dont say it chrissie thought just dont give me that i still cant understand it this has never happened to me before he didnt he merely put on an upsidedown pathetic grin can we try again sometime eyes crinkled appealingly full of silly morning optimism and she felt herself falling for it even if she knew he still wasnt telling the half of it why not she said daft bitch she squeezed his arm how long will you be gone oh only until tuesday that is ill be back late tonight so ill see you tomorrow morning have lunch together shall we would that be of course she said she would have wangled the day off and gone to london with him theyd been too close to the field centre last night that was probably the problem too close to him im really only going down there roger said to make sure we get all the stomach returned dont want them trying to pinch him back bit by bit shut up just shut up about that fucking thing dont worry about it roger just drive carefully as the volvo slid away past the exit southbound sign two commercial traveller types came out to their twin cavaliers and gave her the onceover chrissie found herself smiling almost warmly at the younger one it would be two years in january since her divorce she got into her golf she looked at her face in the drivingmirror and decided it could probably take a couple more years of this sort of thing before she ought to start looking for something well perhaps semipermanent sadly rogers marriage was now in no danger whatsoever not from her anyway all the trouble hed gone to to deceive his wife was that for her was that really all for her and then he couldnt do it because of tension she imagined him driving like the clappers to london where he was supposed to have spent the night and then driving determinedly back with the bogmans peaty giblets in a metal samples case there was his real love and there was more to it alter the way hed been talking last night shed half expected to wake up in the early hours to find him all wet and clammy and moaning in his sleep about lumps of the stuff in the bed but that hadnt happened either indeed the only thing to remind her of soft clammy peat was the consistency of rogers dick chrissie got out of the motel compound by the service entrance and drove to work not to worry later that morning little willie wagstaff went to see his mother in her endofterrace cottage across from the post office need to find a job now then the old girl said sternly before hed even managed to clear himself a space on the settee ma was practical no time for sentiment dead was dead matt castle was dead no living for willie playing the drums on his own cant do owt yet willie said sides theres no work about always work said ma for them as has a mind to find it willie grinned rather than see him relax for a while ma would have him commuting to huddersfield or chorltoncum hardy to clean lavatories or sweep the streets

making him say it well like well naturally hell be buried in tchurchyard first one first one since his fingers finding a different more complicated rhythm what im saying ma is do we have to does it have to be matt ma scowled she had a face like an overripe quince she wore an old brown kneelength cardigan over a blue boilersuit her working clothes the two cats one black one white sat sidebyside on the hearth still as china bob and jim willie reckoned they must be the fourth or fifth generation of mas cats called bob and jim and all females willie liked his mothers cottage nothing changed bottles of stuff everywhere on the table an evillooking root was rotting inside a glass jar producing a fluid as thick as castrol comfrey known as knitbone and if it didnt knit your bones at least itd stop your back gate from squeaking rector come round ma told him said was i sure id given him right stuff for his arthritis bloody hell said willie chancing his arm there no he were right said ma surprisingly its not working never happened before that hasnt never not worked that arthritis mixture leastways its always done summat she reached down to the hearth picked up an old brown medicine bottle with a cork in it ma didnt believe in screw tops fullstrength too last summers willy smiled slyly losing thi touch ma now dont you say that his mother pointing a forefinger stiff as a clothespeg think what you want but dont you go saying it its not lucky aye im sorry still she squinted into the bottle then put it back on the hearth behind bob or jim youre not altogether wrong for once nay willie shook his head shouldntve said it just come out like im not what i was well what dyou expect youre eighty three six thats not what im saying son mas brown eyes were calm she still didnt need glasses and her eyes did wonderful things in manchester of a saturday all dolled up she could still summon a waitress in the cafe with them eyes even when the waitress had her back turned and willie had once seen this right viciouslooking streetgang part clean down the middle to let her through ma had sent the eyes in first but now the eyes were oddly calm accepting worrying that never been what you might call an accepter hadnt ma none of us is what we was this time last year ma said ever since yon bogman were took oh no willie stood up not again you start on about that bogman and im off dont be so daft you know im right our willie look at yer fingers drummin away plonk plonk always was a giveaway yer fingers nay willie said uncomfortably wishing he hadnt come im telling you were not protected same as we was ma wagstaff stopped rocking sit down get your bum back on that couch a minute willie sat he was suddenly aware of how dim it was in the parlour despite all the sunlight and how small it was and how little and wizened ma appeared it was like looking at an old sepia photo from victorian times hard to imagine this was the fieryeyed old woman whod blowtorched a path through a bunch of moss side yobboes weve bin protected in this village ma said you know that i suppose so were very oldestablished ysee very oldestablished indeed well this was true and the family itself was oldestablished in bridelow at least on mas side dad had come from oldham to work at the brewery but ma and her ma and her mas ma well that was how it seemed to go back through the women but weve let it go ma said willy remembered how upset shed been when her granddaughter his sisters lass had gone to college in london manchester or sheffield wouldve been acceptable but london he said let it go ma wagstaff leaned back in the rockingchair closing her eyes aye she said sadly you say as you dont want to hear this willie but youre goin tave to sooner or later youre like all the rest of um if its up on tmoor or out on tmoss its nowt to do wi us cant do us no harm well it can now see im telling thee all eight of willies fingers started working on his knees ma said theyre looking for openings looking for cracks in twall been gathering out there for years hundreds of years what you on about ma different uns like ma said not same uns obviously yobboes willie said dismissively realising what she meant bloody hooligans always been yobboes and hooligans out there maulin wi them owd circles means nowt except to farmers like bit of a bugger for farmers eh ma was scornful farmers loses more sheep to foxes thats not what im saying her eyes popped open giving him a shock because there was no peace in them now no acceptance all of a sudden they looked just like the little white marbles willie had collected as a lad shot through with the same veins of pure bright red she stabbed a finger at him again i can tell um yknow couldnt always aye less said about that willies own fingers stumbled out of rhythm the tips gone numb now dont upset yourself but theres one now ma said one hand clutching an arm of the rockingchair like a parrots claw on a perch comes and goes like an infection looking for an opening shurrup ma will you whatever it is lottie doesnt want listen ma said without hesitation you tell that lottie to come and see me tell her to come tomorrow im a bit busy now tell her ill talk to her about it just like we talked to matt matt knew what had to happen matt were chuffed as a butty aye matt and his mate the bogman together at last only weve got to protect the lad ma said i dont like any of this ma lottiell go spare well look ma was on her feet sprightly as a tenyearold moving bottles on the shelf give her this what is it daft question aye accepting the little brown bottle all right then ill give it her tell her itll calm her down make her feel better but ill not tell youre going ahead with willie gave his knee a couple of climactic thumps no way he didnt tell ma what lottie had said about them finishing matts bogman songcycle because when it came down to it he didnt like the thought of that himself and he had a pretty good idea how ma would react i warned him not to meddle with stuff he knows nowt about shed say and i dont expect to have to warn me own son so in a way willie was hoping lottie would have forgotten about the whole thing by the time the funeral was over a funeral which if shed any sense shed be attending with a very thick veil over her eyes chapter vii the man with two dobermans prowling the inside of the wire mesh perimeter fence was clearly too old to be a security guard his appallingly stained trousers were held up by a dressinggown cord with dirty gold tassels a thinner golden cord was draped around the crown of his tattered trilby however the dogs looked menacing enough and when the man flung open the metal gate they sprang for just a few seconds the duncoloured sky disappeared as the dobermans rose massively and simultaneously into the air and then they were on her both heads into her exposed face hot breath pumping and the great savage teeth oh my god moira shrieked as the rough tongues sliced through her makeup do you guys know what this bloody stuff cost she threw an arm around each of the dogs trapping the four big front paws to her tweed jacket and they all staggered together through the gate and on to the site knocking over an empty grey plastic dustbin the elderly man in the black trilby caught the bin as it fell moira he yelled hey donald moira said arms full of black and gold paws you all right well damn he pulled his hat off we wisny expecting ye today hen the duchess didny say thats because she doesnt know moira said i hope shes not away from her van down now the dogs obediently sat at her feet yeve still got the way all right donald said admiringly theyve grown again i swear ive never seen dobermans this big what dyou feed them on donald didnt smile public health officials my daddy she reminded him gently was a public health official aye i know but your daddy wisny like the hardfaced bastards they send round these days donald turned his head and shouted at a woman pegging babyclothes to a washing line outside a lilaccoloured caravan hey siobhan the duchess she in now oh sure the woman stumbled and dropped a nappy in a puddle she picked it up wrung out the brown water and hung it on the line leastways i havent seen no red carpet goin down today tinkers donald said disparagingly theyre all bloody tinkers here now cept for the few of us moira followed him and the dogs through the site with its fortyodd vans on concrete hardstandings and its unexpectedly spectacular views of the ayrshire coast it might have been a holiday caravan site but for the washing lines full of fluttering clothes and the piles of scrap and all the kids and dogs they passed just one perfect old romany caravan bright red and silver originally designed for horses but with a towbar now a man with a beard and an earring sat out on the step whittling chunks out of a hunk of dark wood he wore a moleskin waistcoat trimmed with silver moira stared at him amazed who the hells that donald turned his head and spat one of the dobermans growled oh moira said i see bloody hippies call emselves new age gypsies wis a time this wis a select site all kindsa garbage were gettin now hen he stopped at the bottom of six concrete steps leading to the apex of the site a flattopped artificial mound with the sides ranked into flowerbeds nothing changes moira thought wherever shes living its always the same evergreen shrubs mainly laurel sprouted around the base of the shining silver metal palace which crowned the mound like the mother ship from close encounters the old man mounted the bottom step hey duchess it wasnt what youd call a traditional romany caravan few like it had been seen before on a statutory local authority gypsy site only movie stars on location lived quite like this donald stayed on the bottom step the dobermans silent on either side of him there were antique carriage lamps each side of the door a heavy door of stained and polished douglas fir which slid open with barely a sigh she came out and stood frailly in the doorway a soft woollen evening stole about her bony shoulders the day was calm for the time of year no breeze from the sea donald said will you look whos here duchess from the edges of the stole the duchesss hair tumbled like a cataract of white water almost to her waist she looked down at moira and her face was grave moira said hullo mammy you ok hed looked anxious his tuxedo creased the thistle lolling from his buttonhole well actually it was more than anxious the guy had been as scared as any of them in the room full of splintered bone twisted antlers across the tables on beds of broken glass and one pair still hanging menacingly among the glittering shards of a chandelier moira had said you ever see bomb damage in belfast huh she was up on her knees now examining the guitar for fractures bomb damage she said not looking at him he was silent he crouched down next to her the two of them by the dais all the others the multinational celts brushing each other down sheltering in groups in the corners of the great hall the pale man had been helped away by the earl and some servants hed looked just once at moira with his damaged eye there were no cracks in the body of the guitar although its face was scratched and it looked to be very deeply offended whats your name moira turned to the american huh what are you called i uh he grimaced the suaveness gone black curls sweated to his forehead he looked as limp as the thistle he wore i dont believe this has happened some kind of earthquake or what uh macbeth thats your name my god here hold this a second she passed him the guitar while she untangled her hair he held the instrument up by the neck gripping it hard you have earthquakes in these parts what shed started to laugh earthquakes tremors she said macbeth i thought you were going to be irish despite the thistle new york irish just new york born and raised mungo macbeth of the manhattan macbeths my mother said i should wear the kilt he straightened the thistle we compromised thats a compromise he said you really are ok now oh im fine just fine feeling like shed come through a war a whole war in just a few minutes mungo macbeth had been looking around at all the wreckage where the stags heads had fallen then up at the ceiling there isnt one of them left hanging hed said awed not a goddamn one he was right what have i done i mean is that weird mungo macbeth said or is that weird and what was it that made you think the duchess said contemptuously that it was you she didnt sound at all like moira her voice was like the refined tink you made when you tapped with your fingernail on crystal glass of the very highest quality a most cultured lady who had never been to school not me on my own moira said someone something was you know like an invasion i felt threatened this guy also i didnt like the setup anyway generations of stalkers trophies and all these elitist folk like we are the celtic aristocracy were the chosen ones the duchess lifted her chin imperiously what nonsense you talk do you seriously think that if you began to suddenly resent me or something you could come in here and break everything on my walls virtually all the wall space in the luxurious caravan had been decorated with fine china your walls no moira said i should think not indeed but this place i felt very threatened she kept seeing like on some kind of videotape loop the man unfastening her guitar case but it was all so dreamlike part of the hallucination summoned by the song and the strangeness of the night she couldnt talk about it im mixed up mammy dont whine the duchess said mildly im sorry and the smoky form in the fireplace the sensation of matt and yet not matt and the knowing confirmed by the call lottie lottie listen i know its late im sorry only its matt ive been thinking about matt all night the duchess said have you the comb with you surely moira pulled her bag on to her knee show me the earl had said he couldnt explain it the heads had been accumulating on the walls for four or more generations and had ever been dislodged before some sort of chainreaction perhaps the domino effect he had suggested everyone go through to the larger drawing room and the servants had been dispatched for extra chairs and doctors to tend the injuries none of them apparently major uninjured moira and the american called macbeth had gone outside into the grounds clear my head he said the house behind them was floodlit looked like a wedding cake a narrow terrace followed the perimeter of the house and they walked along it moira carrying the guitar in its case why are you here she said drifting what do you do or are you just rich tv macbeth said i make lousy tv shows but also were rich the macbeths which is why they let me make my lousy tv shows and also why im here that is my mother she was invited she owns the company uh huh moira nodded as if she was interested white flakes of bone were still silently spattering her vision like static they sent me macbeth said on account of a im about the most expendable member of the family and b they figured it was time i reconnected with my uh roots roots sometimes need to stay buried moira said you dig up the roots you kill the tree i never thought about it like that its probably just a clever thing to say you found your roots have you been to where birnam wood came to dunsinane no he said but i think i just found one of the three witches really moira said coldly only these days they come more beautiful macbeth stopped suddenly and threw up both hands ah shit i apologise i dont mean to be patronizing or sexist or anything it was uh the hair your wonderful long black hair oh please with that lonely grey strand macbeth said like a vein of onyx or something i recognized it soon as you came into the room tonight see i dont know much about celtic history but rock music and folk i mean i really do have those albums would that you didnt moira said quietly then she shook her hair sorry stupid forget it standing on the edge of the terrace overlooking a floodlit lawn he cupped both palms around his face i am such an asshole no way she could disagree macbeth hung his head see i aw jesus im in this party of seriously intellectual celtic people and like what do i know whats my contribution gonna be what do i know i know a song so i go showing off my atom of knowledge i go how about you play the comb song just came out dumb huh she looked hard into his dark blue eyes so it was you asked for the song yeah it just came to me to ask for that song then someone else took it up it was confusing i coulda bit off my tongue when it came clear you didnt want to do that number im sorry he sat down on the paved area legs hanging over the side of the terrace he rubbed his eyes all those stag heads like it was orchestrated you think it was somehow down to the song hence im a witch you connect that with me uh macbeth looked very confused im sorry whole thing scared the shit out of me you feel the atmosphere in there before it happened headlight beams sliced through the trees along the drive the ambulance probably maybe two maybe a whole fleet seeing this was the earls place cold macbeth said bonefreezing cold i mean shit it isnt even cold out here now moira had said can you excuse me i need to make a phone call she didnt know how old the comb was maybe a few hundred years old maybe over a thousand shed never wanted to take it to an expert a valuer its value was not that kind the comb was of some heavy greyish metal it was not very ornate and half its teeth were missing but when she ran it through her hair it was like something was excavating deep furrows in her soul the duchess weighed the comb in fingers that sprayed red and green and blue fire from the stones in her rings eleven of them my the duchess said you really are in a quandary arent you else why would i have come and someone youve not told me everything i can sense a death yes moira whispered feeling as usual not so much an acolyte at the feet of a guru more like a sinsoaked catholic at confession whose matt castle who is he you know he was the guy whose band i joined when i left the university in manchester must be a long time seventeen years ago this was before yes the duchess passed the comb from one hand to the other and back again theres guilt here remorse well iive always felt bad about leaving the band when i did and also three four months ago he wrote to me he wanted me to do some songs with him he was back living in his old village which is that same place they found the ancient body in the peat maybe you heard about that a little the duchesss forefinger stroking the rim of the comb matt was seriously hung up on this thing moira said the whole idea of it this was the first time i mean when we split his attitude was like ok thats it nice while it lasted but its the end of an era so although weve spoken several times on the phone its fifteen years last january since i saw him um last year it came out hed been to the hospital for tests but when i called him a week or so later he said it was ok all negative no problem so goes quiet we exchange christmas cards and things as usual then suddenly thisd be three four months ago he writes wanting to get me involved in this songcycle hes working on maybe an album to be called the man in the moss and you would have nothing to do with it i yeh i dont like to bugger about with this stuff any more i get scared scared what effect im gonna have you know im pretty timid these days so you told him no so i no i couldnt turn it down flat this is the guy got me started i owe him so i just wrote back said i was really sorry but i was tied up had commitments till the autumn said i was honoured all this crap and id be in touch hoping obviously that hed find somebody else she paused her voice dropped he died last night about the same time all this the duchess passed the comb back to moira i dont like the feel of it its cold the comb is icy brittle oh her mother was glaring at her making her wish she hadnt come there was always a period of this before the tea and the biscuits and the duchess saying how is your father does he ever speak of me and shed smile and shake her head for her daddy still didnt know after all these years that shed even met this woman the duchess said that trouble you got into with the rock and roll group you dabbled i said to you never to dabble i said when you were ready to follow a spiritual path you should come to me it was why i gave you the comb yes mammy i know that shed always call her mammy deliberately in a vain effort to demystify the woman im doing my best to avoid it thats why the comb has not forgiven you the duchess said severely you have some damage to repair aye i know moira said i know that too shed returned from the phone floating like a ghost through a battlefield blood and bandages everywhere well maybe not so much blood maybe not any maybe the blood was in her head you all right miss cairns you werent hit im fine your im fine youre very pale have a brandy no no thank you all this solicitousness scared stiff some of his celtic brethren would sue the piss out of him she was impatient with him him and his precious guests and his precious trophies and his reputation what did it matter nobody was dying yes moira yes he is im sorry no not long ill know more in the morning perhaps you could call back then she had to get out of this house didnt want to see wounds bathed and glass and antlers swept away didnt want to see what had happened to the pale man outside mungo macbeth of the manhattan macbeths still sat with his legs dangling over the edge of the terrace moira joined him feeling chilly now in her black dress stiff down by the waist where it had soaked up spilled guinness from the carpet and because he was there and because he was no threat any more she began to talk to macbeth talked about many things not including matt castle in fact she was so determined not to talk about matt and therefore not to break down that she blocked him out and his dying with something as powerful and as pertinent to the night she found she was telling mungo macbeth about the comb song everybody thinks its metaphor you know it exists aye sure then she thought only person i ever told before was m she said quickly your family make regular donations to the ira what his eyebrows went up like theyd been pulled on wires and she stared good and hard into his eyes they were candid and they were innocent sorry she said i forgot you arent even irish moira lets be factual here im not even scottish she found herself smiling then she stopped she said every year these gypsies would camp on the edge of the town derelict land since before the war only this year it was to be redeveloped and so the gypsies had to go my daddy was the young guy the council sent to get rid of them he was scared half to death of what they might do to him the gypsy men who would naturally all be carrying knives some night creature ran across the tiered lawn below them edge to edge my gran told me this my daddy never speaks of it not ever but it wasnt the gypsy men he had cause to fear so much as the women they had the poor wee man seduced macbeth raised an eyebrow but not much like how could he resist her this quiet presbyterian boy with the hornrimmed spectacles and his first briefcase how could he resist this this moira swung her legs and clicked her heels on the terrace wall i can sympathize macbeth said she was a vision moira said still is hed have laid down his beloved council job for her after the first week but that wasnt what they wanted they wanted the camp site until the autumn for reasons of their own whatever that was all about and they got it my daddy managed to keep stalling the council his employers for reasons of his own and then it all got complicated because she wasnt supposed to get herself pregnant certainly not by him shed glossed over the rest her daddys ludicrous threats to join the gypsies her grans battle for custody of the child the decision by the gypsy hierarchy that under the circumstances it might be politic to let the baby go rather than be saddled with its father and pursued by his mother and then her own genteel suburban presbyterian upbringing and the rest is the song which you know the american sitting on the wall shook his head incredulous this is primetime tv you know that this is a goddamn miniseries dont you even think about it mr macbeth moira said or birnam woodll be corning to dunsinane faster than you can blink yeah uh the wood i was gonna ask you the scene in the wood where you get the comb poetic licence what happened was the gypsies were in town right just passing through two of them i was twelve these two gypsies were waiting for me outside the school im thinking you know run like hell but aw it was intriguing and they seemed ok you know and the camp was very public so i went with them well shed be about thirty then and already very revered you could tell even i could see she was my mother holy shit said macbeth we didnt talk much nobody was gonna try and kidnap me or anything nobody offered me anything except the comb she gave me that and is it a magic comb its just a comb moira said more sharply than she intended hes close to you the duchess said who the departed one still well have some tea the duchess said in a slightly raised voice and a young woman at once emerged from the kitchen with a large silver tray full of glistening white china one of my nieces the duchess said zelda there would always be nieces and nephews to fetch and carry for the duchess she lifted the lid of the pot and sniffed earl grey never mind you should take a rest moira unravel yourself maybe id rather not see whats inside of me the duchess stirred the tea in the pot making it stronger making the earl greys rich perfume waft out maybe you should get away and when you get back your problems will be in perspective go somewhere bland st moritz barbados jesus mammy how much money you think im making well england then tunbridge wells or somewhere tunbridge wells you know what i mean yeah youre telling me its something im not gonna get away from no matter where i go am i you said there was damage to repair you think i damaged matt castle do you i dont kn no no i dont see how i could have thats all right then said the duchess she smiled moira felt profoundly uneasy mammy how was he when he died can you tell me that moira youre a grown woman you know this mans essence has not returned to the source i can say no more than that moira felt the weight of her bag on her knees the bag with the comb in it the bag felt twice as heavy as before like a sack of stolen bullion she said in a rush mammy somebody was after the comb i had to fight for it yes that happens the comb represents a commitment sometimes you have to decide whether or not you want to renew it so it was this struggle which caused see im confused i feel exhausted but i feel i made it through to a new level a new plateau but that usually means something heavys on the way well doesnt it the duchess blinked how is your father she said brightly docs he speak of me often she said goodbye to donald at the gate and patted the dobermans her old bmw was parked about fifty yards away near a derelict petrol station parked behind it was a car which had not been there before a grey metro with a hirefirm sticker on the rear window leaning against the metro was a man wearing a dinner jacket over a black tshirt on the tshirt it said in red i govan the remains of a thistle hung out of one lapel of the jacket his face fumbled a grin uh hi he said moira was furious you followed me you fucking followed me listen moira see this has been like this was the most bizarre dramatic momentous night of my life you know so youve had a sheltered life is that supposed i cant walk away from this am i supposed to like push it aside maybe introduce it as an anecdote over dinner with my associates moira stood with her key in the door of the bmw she wanted to say ok while youre here maybe you can tell me something about a tall pale man with white hair instead she said macbeth you shouldnt believe everything a woman tells you when shes in shock i goddammit i saw and i tried to sleep on it and i couldnt so this morning mungo macbeth looked sheepish and spread his hands she gave him a cursory glance intended to wither fade him out i figured maybe you could use some help he said ok she said you see those gates behind those gates is a guy with two huge and ferocious dogs the dogsll do anything the guy says and the guy hell do anything i say you got the message couldnt we go someplace get a bite to eat no we could not moira opened the drivers door of the bmw and got in wound down the window you think i need a strong male shoulder to lean on that it or maybe a bedpost macbeth said helplessly i just think i just think youre an amazing person macbeth she sighed just go away huh he nodded expressionless turned back to his hire car he looked like he might cry this was ridiculous hey macbeth moira leaned back out of the window nodded at his tshirt you ever actually been to govan aw hell macbeth shrugged i cruised most of those western isles just dont recall which is which moira found a grin or the grin found her hurriedly she put the car into gear drove away and when she looked back there was only a bus a long way behind from dawbers book of bridelow the brewery fine beers have been brewed in the bridelow area since time immemorial the most famous being the almostblack bridelow bitter this or something similar was first produced commercially on an relatively small scale by elsie berry and her sons in the late seventeenth century using a species of aromatic bogmyrtle as a preservative the berry family began by providing ale for the bridelow pub the man ith moss but demand grew swiftly in communities up to fifteen miles away the bridelow brewery as we know it today was founded in the early nineteenth century by thomas horridge a businessman from chesterfield who bought out the berry family and whose enterprise was to provide employment for many generations of bridelow folk he at once began work on the construction of the first proper road across the moss to facilitate the movement of his brewery wagons descendants of thomas horridge continued to develop the industry and the family became bridelows greatest benefactors building the village hall enabling major repairs to be carried out to the ancient church and continuing to facilitate new housing as recently as the s however chapter viii in the bar at the man ith moss lunchtime young frank manifold said in disgust bloody gnats piss and angrily pushed his glass away ill have draught bass next time young frank said never thought id be saying that in this pub never eh thas just bitter lad said frank manifold snr who preferred scotch anyway thas a right to feel bitter mind im not saying thas not know what theyve done now ernie only paid off our drivers and replaced um wi their own blokes ken and peter paid off cut down lorries from five to two bigger uns like needed experienced hgv drivers they reckoned makes you spit ernie who also was on whisky had a sip out of young franks beer glass lads right im afraid he said its gone off well thank you young frank said devoutly thank you very much mr dawber only just dont go shouting it around the place ernie muttered lotties got to sell the stuff and shes enough problems no she doesnt said young frank backrow smartarse in ernies top class fourteen years ago doesnt have to sell it at all no more free house int it lottie wasnt here this lunchtime stan burrows whod also been made redundant from the brewery was minding the bar stan said i heard as how gannons was kicking up claiming theyd been sabotaged not given proper recipe like threatening legal action what i heard balls said young frank glaring at his discarded glass they dont give a shit ernie dawber on his usual stool at the end of the bar by the telephone pondered this the way he saw it there was no way the horridge family could have got away with not providing gannons with the correct recipe and why should they want to with shaw horridge on the board yet it was a fact since the brewery had been taken over the stuff had been slowly shedding its distinctive flavour surprising because it was well known that gannons whose bestselling product was a fizzy lager with a german name produced down matlock way had been anxious for some time to acquire their own genuine oldestablished real ale and would therefore be expected to treat bridelow beer with more than a modicum of respect ernie decided hed better go up to the hall one night and have a bit of a chat with shaw horridge or his mother bridelow black bitter had a reputation even if the brewery was in new hands even if thered been this swingeing rationalization which meant firing half the lads it was still bridelow beer gnats piss by eck hed never thought to hear that when his daughter rang from oxford in the early afternoon the rector barely made it to the phone in time were you in the garden catherine asked him suspiciously and hans didnt deny it it had taken him almost a minute to hobble from the kitchen to the study pointless however trying to conceal anything from cathy hows the knee she demanded at once and with a certain menace oh hans said as airily as he could manage with clenched teeth could be worse you know ive no doubt that it could pop but worse than what is what id like to know hans tried to keep from screaming out loud as he fell into the window chair pulling the phone on to his knees cathy said i dont suppose youd even tell me if youd had to have a zimmer frame screwed into the back of the pulpit the stillaggressive sun having gouged chunks out of the church wall began to attack the study window and when the rector twisted away from it his left knee felt like a slab of volcanic rock with a core of molten lava well actually he said abandoning pretence with a sigh it couldnt be a lot worse thats it his daughter said im on my way pop expect me for supper no no no your studies whatever they are cathy said crisply in a postgraduate situation as i keep explaining you get a fair bit of leeway im coming up no listen you dont understand raising his voice trying to shout down the pain as much as her im getting a lot of help the mothers union terribly kind and look when i need you i promise ill be in touch you know i will he swallowed a great slab of breath and bit his tongue jamming his palm over the mouthpiece just in time change the subject talk about something else erm matt castle poor matt died on sunday night oh no it was a mercy catherine yes i suppose it would be did oh very quick in the end he spent no more than a few hours in hospital kept signing himself out you see determined to die in bridelow he was even out on the moss yesterday morning im told with lottie and the boy brave man poor matt whats going to happen to the pub shell stay on i imagine for a while you know what shes like terribly independent old mrs wagstaff sent one of her special potions across to help her sleep lottie bunged it back at once with willie shes very resistant to all that whens the funeral friday afternoon youre going to have difficulty arent you especially if it gets colder putting her finger on it as usual so hans had to come out with what apart from the pain was on his mind cathy theyve given me a curate oh she said surprised well you certainly could do win the help but it er that could be a headache couldnt it it was only a matter of time hans said parish this size suppose ive been holding out putting it off that is i realise this sort of thing new chaps has always taken care of itself in the past i mean i myself was not well not perhaps the man they would have chosen at the time but one gets acclimatized headache hmm lets hope not anybody i know oh a young fellow few months out of college simons very keen well actually not that young late twenties i suppose used to be a teacher joel beard his name pleasant enough lad slightly earnest but so many of them are arent they cathy said jesus christ hans didnt say anything his daughter never blasphemed for effect i was at the high school with him hans could hear her frowning for a year or two that is he was four or five years in front of me he was head boy one of those who takes it seriously very authoritative very proper seemed more of a grownup than some of the teachers do you know what i mean most of the girls were crazy about him but i was never into greek gods she stopped pop listen you do know he was at st oswalds dont you yes he did he was surprised though that she knew the significance of this its not necessarily a drawback you know cathy he tried to straighten his right leg and although there was no great pain in this one the right knee fought him all the way both knees now god save us wheelchair job soon or one could go into hospital and leave joel beard in charge simon thinks hes a star he said which means i suppose that the silly sods fallen in love with him he used apparently joel this is he used to be some sort of born again christian before he decided to go straight as it were you call two years at st oswalds going straight the most notoriously fundamentalist theological college in the country i like to think im broadminded hans said sure but how broadminded is ma wagstaff look hans said people adjust bridelow adjusts people id rather have a fundamentalist or a charismatic than some bureaucrat with a briefcase and a mobile phone anyway the diocese likes him hes tough hes athletic this is simon talking and hes bringing god back into the arena bit of muscle theyre into that these days the antipansy lobby even simon ironically i mean all right i could refuse him i could tell them to take him back say he doesnt fit it but somebodys going to ask why doesnt he fit and anyway whos to say they might not be orthodox here but they have a strong faith and strong simple principles ma wagstaff very broadminded in some ways hmmm said cathy unconvinced however rest assured i wont let him take matts funeral i suspect the ladies have plans god no you mustnt let him do that so if i have to go out there on a pair of crutches or a zimmer frame dont you go talking about zimmer frames pop you did thats when ill come catherine decided ill come on wednesday night ill get you through the funeral i wont have you talking about zimmer frames now look im not going to argue my phone bills getting ridiculous ill see you wednesday night and she hung up on him thank you the rector said with resignation into the dead phone i suppose the hall had once been surrounded by parkland although now it just looked like ordinary fields with a wellordered assembly of mature trees beech and sycamore and horsechestnut the trees were higher now but not yet high enough to obscure the soaring stone walls of the brewery four storeys high an early victorian industrial castle as proud and firm in its setting as st brides church she hated it now you could not see the brewery from the drawing room but with all the trees nearly bare again eliza horridge from her window seat could see the village in detail she supposed shed always preferred autumn and winter for this very reason it brought her closer to bridelow the sad irony of this made her ache on the night the redundancies had been announced shed gone rather bravely she thought down to the post office to buy some stamps which she didnt need shed just had to get it over face the hostility except there hadnt been any nobody had screamed judas at her nobody had ignored her or been short with her but nobody had said a word about the jobs either they didnt blame her personally but liz horridge blamed herself and since that night had never been back into bridelow selfimposed exile in this warm and shabbyluxurious house with its pictures and memories of arthur horridge self imposed could go out whenever she wanted couldnt she she snatched up the phone on its second ring to wrench her mind from what it couldnt cope with yes the number was exdirectory there were too people down there with whom she could no longer bear to speak yes hello is that you shaw something told her she was in for a shock and her eyes clutched at the view of the village for support following the steep cobbled street past the pub past the post office past the line of tiny stone cottages to the churchyard liiiiz mellifluously stretching the word as he used to into an embrace super shattering her thought i saw you last week mgirl in buxton was in a wine bar thought you came up the street no couldnt have been she scraped out never go thought you sensed me turned your head so sharply to buxton her voice faded and looked at the window of the wine bar with a sort of sadness in your eyes couldnt see me of course she stared down at the village but it was like watching a documentary on the television or a soap opera because she could identify most of the people and could map out the paths of their lives from their movements between the post office the pub and the church perhaps it wasnt you after all he said she could even hear their voices when the wind was in the right direction and yes it was a lot like the television a thick glass screen between them and she was very much alone and the screen was growing darker or perhaps it was you as you used to be those chestnut curls of yore her hand went automatically to her hair as coarse and dry now as the moorland grasses she grabbed a handful of it to stop the hand shaking one wonders he mused your hair grey now liz put on weight or angular and gaunt id so much like to see what do you want liz croaked if you were with me i suppose youd keep in trim dye your hair have your skin surgically stretched probably wouldnt work but youd try if you were with me how dare you stung at last into anger where did you get this number he laughed she felt alone and cold terribly exposed almost ill with it what are you trying to do he said hows dear old ma these days is she well she said nothing perhaps you dont see her or any of them the word is youve become something of a recluse all alone in your rotting mansion what nonsense she said breathlessly also one hears the mothers union isnt as well supported as it was sad secular times liz whats it all coming to silly old bats eh they had your measure liz said with a spurt of spirit they saw you off oh long time ago things change barriers weaken old sweetheart ive been thinking why dont we meet up certainly not love to be able to come to buxton wouldnt you love to be smart and sprightly and welldressed give anything to have those chestnut curls back perhaps it was you after all sitting in your emotional prison and daydreaming of buxton perhaps thats what i saw perhaps you projected yourself ever try that liz should do could be a way out send the spirit give the body the bottle to go for it perhaps ill drop in on you like that would you you cant they wont let you times change mgirl times change what do you mean will you tell dearest ma i called she said nothing of course you wont dont see her any more do you you dont see any of them do you liiiiiiz leave me she crashed the phone down and she and the phone sat and trembled alone she said and began to weep i thought perhaps i might leave early alice said ive got a checkup at the dentists in buxton at six and ive got some stuff to pick up at boots and i dont like the look of the weather is that all right suppose so chrissie said bending over the filing cabinet roger had arrived midmorning seeming preoccupied and had not even mentioned their lunchdate just sloped off to some appointment now chrissie would have to check everything switch off the lights and lock up you dont mind being alone with alice giggled him couldnt be safer chrissie said rog dr hall was telling me he hasnt got one hasnt he alice was putting her stuff away in her calfskin sandbag she flicked a card across the desk at chrissie see theres my appointment what for the dentists just to show you im not making it up i never thought you were making it up alice ok why hasnt he got one asked alice without much interest she was a good ten years older than chrissie had grownup kids and a big house didnt need the job but chrissie supposed that in alices circle it was nice to say you worked for the university even if it was only as a number two secretary in an overgrown portacabin outside congleton chrissie said part of the ritual apparently when he was sacrificed i suppose that would be quite a sacrifice for a man said alice pretending to shudder actually its possible they just cut it off after he was dead i see alice shrugged into her sheepskin coat hard luck chrissie thought now youll never know how big they were in prechristian times alice took her car keys out of her bag stuck the bag under an arm so its all right then if i leave now yes chrissie said yes yes yes she screamed to herself but when alice had gone she decided it wasnt all right bloody fatarsed cow got away with too much spends most of the day experimenting with this disgusting seagreen nail varnish then pisses off to sprawl on the sofa and moan to her husband about how overworked she is chrissie picked up the dentists appointment card which alice had left behind it looked authentic enough if you didnt happen to know alices eldest daughter was a dental receptionist it was a dim grey afternoon with all the lights on she couldnt herself go in case somebody roger rang or one of the research students came in to raid the files she stared across the office at a doublelocked metal door just me and you chum and youve got no dick chrissie laughed under the laughter there was a soft noise from behind the metal door chrissie breathed in hard whos that there was silence yes that was it just a soft noise not a thump not a clang she looked around and over her shoulder the room had three desks seven filing cabinets and two big metalframed bookcases it was garishly lit by fluorescent tubes and the windows had venetian blinds between the blinds she could see the deserted college playingfields and beyond the tops of containerlorries on the motorway she was alone in the field centre and there was nobody apparent outside now look chrissie said this is not on this is not bloody on it was going dark out there the soft noise came again like a heavy cushion an oldfashioned one with brocade being tossed on to a sofa bravely chrissie slipped off her shoes and moved quietly to the metal door should she check this out dare she although shed never been in there alone she knew where there was a key she put her ear to the door there was silence shaws porsche was coming up the drive black as a funeral did it have to be a black one she could tell by the speed that it wouldnt be stopping at the house but continuing up to the brewery there was a new link road for the brewery lorries so they never grumbled past the hall these days and no local vehicles except for shaws mercedes and his porsche ever laboured up from bridelow any more so the hall sealed off from both the brewery and village irrelevant now to both might as well not exist nor me liz horridge whispered into the empty highceilinged room with its bland regencystriped wallpaper and its cold crystal chandelier ive become irrelevant to everybody even shaw famous mothers boy had quite casually replaced her in his life always away at meetings in matlock buxton sheffield london even or with his girlfriend the mysterious therese with whom shaw appeared obsessed as well he might the girl was far too beautiful for him at thirtyone he was at least ten years older losing his hair conspicuously lacking in style despite his costly education but being seen with therese therese beaufort no less had done wonders for his confidence and his lifelong stutter had virtually disappeared her delight had turned to a damp dismay years of speech therapy of love and patient coaxing at the fireside and what was it that finally killed shaws stutter sex she could weep had wept and wept and wept last week hed made her position quite appallingly clear if i were you mother hed said in passing everything shaw said to her these days appeared to be in passing if i were you id be off out of here somewhere warm the channel islands malta she clung to the sofa but i dont want a holiday shaw no not a holiday i mean for good to live why not its warm its civilized and absolutely everyone would want to come and stay with you what are you saying shaw had smiled affably and dashed off to his meeting every day since shed sat here by this bay window and listened to his voice in her head saying so smoothly without a hint of impediment somewhere warm the channel islands malta and envisaged therese beaufort in some slinky designer costume drink in hand languid in this window gazing out on her property liz horridge thought she could see old mrs wagstaff waddling up the main street of bridelow towards the church or maybe it wasnt maybe she just needed to see the old girl hows dear old ma these days is she well three decades ago in the crowded parlour full of bottles two cats on the hearth ma wagstaff cradling lizs head sleeping in the little bedroom if he comes to you scream dont matter what time and now perhaps ill drop in wouldnt you like that you cant shell stop you things change barriers weaken she looked out at the village willing it closer shed give anything to be able to shatter that damned glass screen before it all went black well look at it this way there was no way anyone could have got in there without her or alice knowing about it therefore there was no one in there except for well yes the spare key was filed in the third filing cabinet under k for key the problem was suppose something was amiss in there suppose a rat or something had got in suppose something electrical had malfunctioned threatening the bogmans welfare and therefore rogers and hers tentatively she unlocked the third filing cabinet and located the key it was smokycoloured steel about four inches long who would roger blame if something had gone wrong with the bogman his future who was in charge of the office in rogers absence filed under b was a second and longer key for the double lock to the inner room the specimen room the bogmans bedroom she just rather wished as she pushed in the first key that she hadnt acquiesced so readily to alices request to leave early chrissie slipped on her cardigan it would be cold in there wouldnt it mustnt get the shivers that would never do the metal door opened with a soft vacuum belch sorry to intrude chrissie said softly behind the door was a small hallway where two new portacabins had been pushed together this was where the white coats were kept and there were a couple of lavatory cubicles and a washbasin then there was another unlocked door leading to an anteroom with a desk and then the innermost metal door with a double lock through which minions like her and alice were not supposed to venture so there couldnt possibly be anybody in there anybody else shed been in there a couple of times but only with roger and not for very long so she knew what he looked like no problem about that the second key turned easily twice and chrissie walked into an almost complete but alarmingly pleasant darkness which hummed faintly she didnt move apart from the hum it was very very quiet nothing scurried away shed left the door open behind her to allow a little light in there but the velvety darkness absorbed it all within a yard or two of the opening and she had to fumble about for switches it was not cold this was it well of course this was why it seemed so pleasant the temperature was controlled to body heat bog body heat hed apparently been freezedried and then maintained in a controlled environment she rather hoped he was packed away or at least covered up with something do you touch him much chrissies hand found a switch and the lights came on flickering blue laboratory light white on white tiles mortuary light chrissie tensed breathed in sharply but of course she was right there was absolutely nobody here nobody else of course i touch him he feels like a big leather cricket bag you should pop in sometime be an experience for you actually he was rather smaller than the cricket bags chrissie had seen when her exhusband used to play he was lying on his table in his heatregulated bubble looking like somebody whod spent far too long in a solarium yes he had a lovely tan still hard to think of him as an actual corpse he was too old but still ancient as he was when you thought about it he was probably in a better state of preservation than chrissies late grandad was by now chrissie laughed at her stupid self she leaned over the bogman curled up under his plastic bubble all right then chuck she wondered what hed sound like if he could reply what language he spoke welsh probably she looked around there were a couple of wires naked rubber emerging from the bottom of the container pretty primitive the british museum boffins would probably have a fit but nothing seemed amiss ill leave you then chrissie said she tried to see his face his nose was squashed like a boxers there were whiskers around his contorted lips which were half open revealing the brown stumps of his teeth there was a fold in the side of his neck a flap like another lip she thought god thats where they cut his throat poor little devil beaten over the head garrotted throat cut and then they chopped his dick off oh yuck automatically she glanced down to where his groin ought to be where the body was bent and then chrissie made a little involuntary noise at the back of her throat she glanced back at his face his twisted lips leering at her now her eyes flicked rapidly back to his groin back to his face back to his groin she felt her own lips contorting and she made the little noise again a highpitched strangled yelp and she began to back off towards the door but she couldnt stop looking at him what no penis must have chopped it off part of the ritual chrissies hands began to tingle as they scrabbled frantically behind her back for the doorhandle get me out of here far from being emasculated the bogman under his bubble had the most enormous erection she had ever seen from dawbers book of bridelow natural history bridelow moss is believed to be over four thousand years old but there has been considerable erosion over the past two centuries and the bog appears to have been affected by pollution from industry twenty or more miles away with much of the vegetation being destroyed and the surface becoming even darker due to sootdeposits erosion is gradually exposing the hills and valleys submerged under the blanket bog and many fragments of longdead trees commonly known as bog oak have been discovered because of the preservative qualities of peat wood recovered from the moss is usually immensely strong and was once considered virtually indestructible chapter ix there was frost on the morning of the day matt castle was to be buried and the heaped soil beside the prepared grave looked like rock the grave was in the highest corner of the churchyard and the rector could see it from the window of his study a shovel was set in the soil a stiff scarecrow shape against the white morning hans turned back to the room and to the kind of problem he didnt need today of all days i didnt know who else to come to the young farmer said the empty teacup like a thimble in his massive hands ive got kids have you told the police whats the point the fanner wore black jeans and a tan leather jacket he wasnt a churchgoer but hans had christened his second child if youve been losing stock aye one ram but that were months ago i told tcoppers about that what could they do couldnt stake out the whole moor could they anyway like they said its not a crime any more witchcraft devil worship hans said gently theres a difference usually all bloody same to me with respect like i say its not summat they warn you about at agricultural college vicar sheep scabs one thing satanisms summat else yes hans didnt know what to do about this the man wasnt interested in counselling sympathy platitudes he wanted practical help so ive come to you like his name was sam davis this was his first farm a challenge seventy acres and more than half of it basically unfarmable moorland with marsh and heather great stone outcrops and the remains of two prehistoric stone circles half a mile apart cause its your job really int it said sam davis thrusting out his ample jaw a lad with responsibilities two kids a nervy wife and no neighbours tdevil an all his works like and there he really had put his finger on it this lad if this was not a ministers job what was hans tried to straighten his leg some minister he was took him half an hour to climb into the pulpit tell me again he said there was the remains of a fire in the centre of the circle now on the previous occasion you actually found blood and er the rams head of course on the stone just like they wanted me to find it sam davis said only it werent me as found it it were tlittle girl he set his cup down in the hearth as if afraid he was going to crush it in his anger yes obviously very distressing for all of you but you know its easy for me to say this obviously im not living in quite such an exposed hang on now vicar im not i know youre a big lad and well capable of taking care of your family the actual point i was trying to make is that its easy to get this kind of thing out of proportion quite often its youngsters they read books and see films about satanism they hear of these ritual places the stone circles not in transylvania or somewhere but right here within twenty miles of manchester and sheffield so you think its youngsters then i dont know all im saying is its often kids the kind if you saw them you could probably tuck a couple under each arm aye well like i say its not me so much as the wife i wanted to wait up there maybe surprise em like give em a bloody good hiding but i think your wife was right hans said dont get into a vendetta situation if you can help it its probably a phase a fad theyll go off and find another circle in a week or two or perhaps theyll simply grow out of it youve told the police and apart from the er the ram ive not told coppers about last night only you theres nowt to see only ashes no blood no bits how far is the nearest circle from where you live half a mile threequarters but its a tricky climb at night cant do it wiout a light and wi a light theyd see me comin jeeps no bloody use either on that ground so you saw the fire bit of a red glow that were all and your wife heard she thought she heard like i say couldve bin a sheep fox owl rabbit but she thought it was aye said sam davis a babby theres a dragon the boy said and his bottom lip was trembling there is gerroff said willie wagstaff hed been for his morning paper and didnt plan to bugger about on a day as cold as this wanted to get home and put a match to his fire you go an look uncle willie this was benjie nearly eight willies youngest sister sallys lad tough little bugger as a rule he had the chief with him an alsatian benjies minder willie folded up his paper stuck it under his arm what you on about at all s a dragon uncle willies orrible he was about to cry pale too cheeks ought to be glowing on a morning like this especially with having the day off school to go to matts funeral then again could be that was at the bottom of this death funerals everybody talking hushed a big hole being dug in the churchyard for the feller he called uncle matt and benjie trying to understand it all seeing this great big dragon all right willie said pretending he hadnt noticed the lad was upset ill buy it wheres this dragon on tmoss oh aye and what were you doin on tmoss on your own then eh i werent on me own uncle willie tchief were wi me an e dint like it neither the big dog flopped his mouth open stuck his tongue out and looked inscrutable gerroff said willie that dogs scared of nowt all right lead the way but if youre havin me on you little arab ill when the farmer had gone catherine came in with a midmorning mug of tea for hans and he asked her you hear any of that bits his daughter sat on the piano stool she was wearing a plain black jumper and baggy striped trousers with turnups got the gist what are you going to do about it pop well said hans i dont really know obviously i dont like the sound of this baby business and im not one to generalize about hysterical women but still i think if a child had gone missing virtually anywhere in the country wed have heard about it dont you cathy looked serious as she often did these days as if shed suddenly decided it was time to shoulder the full responsibility of being an adult as distinct from a student no she said not necessarily what do you hans looked puzzled then he said oh that its been exaggerated a lot of course but that doesnt mean it doesnt go on pop youre beginning to sound like joel beard oh i dont think so well said hans if there really is a possibility of something of that nature then he should tell the police shouldnt he but wheres his evidence his wife thought she heard a baby crying as he said it could have been any one of a dozen animals or the wind or cathy said a friend of mine at college did a study of socalled ritual child abuse what it amounts to in most of the cases which have been proved is that the ritual bits the devil masks and the candles and so on are there to support the abuse clement simply to scare the children into submission so in most cases were not talking about actual devil worship just extreme evil hans said wheres the difference exactly im not an expert cathy said but i rather think there is a difference she grinned slyly i think its something ma wagstaff could explain to you if you caught her in the right mood cheeky little madam hans smiled im the accredited holy man in these parts in case youd forgotten anyway why didnt young sam go to ma wagstaff for advice because he hasnt lived around here very long he doesnt know the way things operate yet how they changed thered been a time not so long ago when cathy had been dismissive to say the least of ma wagstaff and all she stood for and you do do you hans said you know how things operate im getting an inkling perhaps we should discuss this sometime i dont think so cathy said hans frowned i dont think words can really pin it down she said or that we should try to she looked at him blandly all openfaced and painfree twentythree years old a lighthaired plainfaced girl even hans had to admit she was no great beauty however there was a knowingness about her that he hadnt been aware of before he felt old suddenly she was starting to look wiser than he felt how they changed every time they came home from university theyd grown stronger and more alien catherine studying archaeology at oxford and barney her twin who hed rather imagined would follow him into the church at the london school of economics and now researching for a prominent conservative mp barney the onetime young socialist have you got a boyfriend cathy he asked suddenly why do you ask because im your only surviving parent her nose twitched mischievously and youd got around to wondering if i was gay i suppose he felt his eyes widening was this indeed what hed been wondering one of those forbidding shapeless lumps that lay in the mental silt cathy swivelled suddenly on the piano stool lifted up the wooden lid to expose the keys and began to beat out the opening bars of jerusalem i dont think im queer she said addressing the keys but some people find me a bit strange the frosted peat was quite firm where he walked didnt even need his wellies today fifty yards out willie stopped bog oak he told himself thats all probably passed it hundreds of times but they get turned around by the wind bits break off the moss looked like a dark sea sometimes you came down from the village across the road and it was like chambering over the rocks to get to the bay that was on a misty day when the moss stretched quickly to the horizon but on a bright morning like now you could see how the bog actually sloped gently upwards then more steeply towards the mountains kinder scout in the distance on a beach there was driftwood in a moss bog oak great chunks of blackened wood coughed up by the peat made good strong furniture benjie wouldnt cross the road to the moss but the chief had followed willie reluctantly big paws stepping delicately over the black pools at the edge where it nearly met the tarmac now fifty yards into the moss the chief stopped too and made a noise at the back of his throat that was halfgrowl and halfwhine bog oak willie said to the dog you never seen bog oak before point was though he personally had never seen owt like this before the size of it the fact that it had suddenly appeared in a place where there were no trees save a few tatty corpses he walked up by the side of it and its shape began to change but it still didnt make you think of anything scarier than half an oak tree with its branches all crushed up and twisted but when he got around it looking back through the branches towards the village this was when his breath got jammed up in his throat when he felt like he was swallowing half a brick willie backed off to where the dog was crouching and snarling his black lips curled back over his teeth all right chief willie said hoarsely he looked back to where benjie stood forlorn in his red tracksuit youre going tave to explain this willie told himself his right hand building up a rhythm on his hip pocket where there was a bunch of keys lads countin on you better come up wi summat a bit quick he straightened up bog oak hed stick to his story the fact that hed never seen bog oak like this before was his problem just had to make it sound convincing for the lad willie marched boldly up to the thing grabbed hold of the end of one of its branches to snap it off about nine inches of it strewth it was like trying to snap a crowbar it came off though all at once go on he said to the chief fetch it and he threw it as hard as he could glad to get it out of his hand if truth were told it felt cold and hard just like iron or stone but it was wood all right nowt fossilized about it too light hed hurled it into the wind and it landed barely ten feet away well go on then bloody hell hed thrown dozens of sticks for this dog over the years the chief didnt move the thick fur on the back of his neck was flattened his eyes were dull and wary his tail between his legs you soft bugger willie said what this was the dog was close to benjie theyd grown up side by side only natural hed picked up on the kids fear aye willie thought and itdve put the shits up me too at his age then he thought admitting it to himself what do you mean at his age he tried to look at the thing dispassionately it was amazing like a work of art like bloody sculpture but it didnt make him think of a dragon dragons were from fairy tales more than that dragons were animals all right they had wings and long scaly tails but they were animals and there was nowt scary about animals willie wanted to back off further until he couldnt make out the details he wanted to crouch down at a safe distance and growl at it like the chief basically he didnt want to see it any more wished hed never seen it at all because it was the kind of shape that came up in your dreams this was stupid but there was no getting round it the tangle of branches wrapped round woven into each other like pipes and tubes like a human being wearing its intestines on the outside and out of all this the head rearing up on a twisted scabby neck and the head was as black as as as peat it had holes for eyes with the daylight shining through and a jagged widely grinning mouth and on either side of the head were large knobbly horns and where one of the horns went into a knob there was even the beginnings of another face like one of them gargoyles on the guttering at st brides but what was worse than all this was the way the thing thrust out of the peat twelve feet or more two big branches sticking out either side of the neckpiece like hunched shoulders and then smaller branches like dangling arms and hands and misshapen fingers like they had arthritis in them like the rectors fingers and when a gust of wind snatched at it the whole thing would be shivering and shaking its wooden arms waving about and rattling dancing about willie remembered something that used to scare the life out of him when he was little the teacher ernie dawbers uncle telling them about gibbet hill where hanged mens skeletons used to dangle in chains rattling in the wind oh come on willie said scornfully he was shivering himself now cold morning coldest this year not expecting it thats all there is to it nowt else come on walked away from it across the moss towards the little lad and the village wanting to run imagining benjie screaming run uncle willie run its come out of tbog and its after yourun he kept on walking steadily but the fingers of both hands were drumming away going hard and steady at his thighs bog oak willie made himself shout bog oak part four the burial chapter i across the border heading south moira ignored all the big blue signs beckoning her towards the m motorways in murky weather demanded onetrack concentration she had other roads to travel you should take a rest moira the duchess unravel yourself well sure nothing like a long drive to a funeral for some serious reflection for facing up to the fact that you were also journeying and who knew how fast towards your own the countryside getting rained on glistening drably looked like it also was into some heavy and morose selfcontemplation it was almost like shed left scotland and then doubled back there were the mountains and there were the lochs and there also was the mist shrouding the slow sulky rain which made you wet as hell very quickly cumbria she stopped a while in a grey and sullen community sliding down either side of a hill wandered up the steep street and bought a sour milky coffee in a snackandsouvenir shop a dismal joint but there was a table where she could spread out the map find out where she was heading many places hereabouts had jagged rocky names nordicsounding some of them the vikings had been here after the romans quit and what remained of the celts anything she looked out of the cafe window at a ragged line of stone cottages with chalet bungalows legostyle on the hillside behind she watched a couple of elderly local residents stumbling arminarm through the rain english people this guy was telling us at the conference this afternoon how the english are the least significant people culturally that is in these islands mongrels no basic ethnic tradition and what the hell moira wondered were new yorkers mungo macbeth of the manhattan macbeths could you credit it moira had another go at the coffee made a face pushed the plastic cup away she sighed poor macbeth poor glamorous superficial macbeth who back home through the very nature of his occupation

god or maybe worth half a million in compensation but who because this was scotland the old ancestral muckheap and because of the night the crazy surrealistic celtic night had behaved like a man bewitched moira took her plastic cup back to the counter which was classic british stainedglass stained with coffee congealed fat tomato ketchup on your own the guy behind the counter said he was lanky latetwenties he had a sneery kind of voice out of essex or somewhere nowhere you went these days in britain did the people running the tourist joints ever seem to be locals she said were all of us alone pal and slinging her bag over her shoulder headed for the door you didnt finish your coffee he called after her something wrong with it it was truly fine moira held up the back of a hand got all my nail varnish off no problem about half an hour later she surrendered to the blue signs on the motorway the rain was coming harder or maybe she was just driving faster into it at a service area somewhere around lancaster she found a phone stood under its perspex umbrella called her agent in glasgow and explained where she was previous experience malcolm told me not to call until i was well on the road or youd instantly come up with a good reason why i wasnt to cross the border never mind that i have been telephoned malcolm said ponderously the old testament voice by the earls man oh shit hoping you were fully recovered right she said cautiously and most apologetic about the abrupt termination of your performance the other night by the inexplicable precipitation from the walls of approximately a hundred stags heads now was that not an extraordinary thing to happen bizarre several people had to be treated for minor lacerations and there were two broken arms oh dear so naturally the earl wanted to reassure himself that you had not been damaged in any way im fine just fine because you seemed to have disappeared along with one of his guests a gentleman called er macbeth sorry moira said no more money she hung up and ran back into the rain black hair streaming behind her before he could say anything about witchy women the psychic thing a millstone a fucking albatross she started the car the eightyearold bmw with a suitcase in the boot the suitcase jammed up against the ovation guitar steeping in its black case like dracula in his coffin we only come out at night me and that guitar together with sometimes devastating results the damned psychic thing if you really could control it it would be fine no forget fine try bearable it would be bearable but going down that old dark path towards the possibility of some kind of control well you took an impulsive step down there the once and you found all these little sidepaths beckoning tiny coloured lanterns in the distance follow me im the one you dabbled i said to you never to dabble the coloured lanterns the insistent whispering voices the comb has not forgiven you you have some damage to repair yes mammy she drove well she thought smoothly with concentration down into england the way many years ago a loss of innocence ago you travelled to the university in manchester for all of four months before one night this local folk group matt castles band played the student union matt on the pennine pipes an amazing noise growing up in scotland you tended to dismiss the pipes as ceremonial militaristic matt just blows your head away the pennine pipes are black and spidery the bag itself with a dark sheen like a huge insects inflated abdomen matt plays seated the bag in his lap none of this wrestling with a tartan octopus routine where dyou get these things like a set would you luv i wouldnt have the nerve mr castle they look like theyd bite an hour and a couple of pints later hes admitting you cant buy them there are no other pennine pipes perhaps there used to be once a long long time ago but now just these the ones he made himself how to describe the sound sometimes like a lonely bird on the edge of the night and then in a lower register not an external thing at all but something calling from deep inside the body the notes pulled through tube and bowel the romans brought bagpipes with them the utriculus whether they were here before that nobody knows i like to think so though lass its important to me im an english celt within a month youre singing with the band trying to match the pipeswhich you cant of course could anyone but the contest is productive matt castles band fifteen years semiprofessional around the greater manchester folk clubs is suddenly hot the band offered its first nationwide tour ok just the small halls and the universities but what it could lead to maybe the chance the only chance theyll ever get at their time of life to turn fulltime professional only this tour it has got to be with moira cairns eighteen years old firstyear english lit student oh the chemistry three middleaged guys and a teenage siren no moira and the deals off typically the only pressure matt applies is for you to take care of your own future stick with your studies think about this lass if it all comes to nowt where does that leave you and yet how badly he needs you to be in the band i can go back i can be a mature student you wont though think twenty years ahead when me and willie and eric are looking forward to our pensions and youre still peddling your guitar around and your looks are starting to fade off blunt thats matt about some things anyway there was always a lot going on underneath moira shifted uncomfortably in her seat and caught sight of herself in the driving mirror were those deep gullies under her eyes entirely down to lack of sleep she thought even five six years ago i could be up all night and drinking with kenny savage and his mates and id still look ok more or less the further south she drove the better the weather became down past preston it wasnt raining any more and a cold sun hardened up the pennines the shelf of grey hills known as the backbone of england some way to go yet fifty sixty miles maybe more if she was halfway down the backbone of england then bridelow must be the arseend before the pennines turned into the shapelier more touristfriendly peak district moira switched motorways the traffic building up lots of heavy goods vehicles like driving down a greasy metal corridor then the pennines were back in the windscreen moorland in smudgy charcoal behind the sliproads and the factories somewhere up there the peat i have to do this matt had written its as if my whole careers been leading up to it it just knocked me sideways the thought that this chap the bogman was around when they were perhaps playing the original pennine pipes time swam she was driving not in her car but in matts old minibus her last night with the band matt talking tersely about piping to the moss how the experience released him and hed written it was as if hed heard me playing i dont know how to put this but as if id played the pipes and sort of charmed him out of the moss as if wed responded to something inside us both now thats a bit bloody pretentious isnt it lass and moira could almost hear his cawing laugh she came off the motorway and ten minutes later getting swept into naked countryside that was anything but green she thought shit what am i doing here i dont belong here i walked out on the guy fifteen years ago traitorous cow hadnt escaped her notice that one thing lottie had not done was invite her to the funeral always a space between her and lottie never was quite the same after moira found the nerve to get her on one side during her second pregnancy and warn her to take it easy have plenty of rest lottie smiling at this solemn kid of nineteen explaining how shed carried on working until the week before dic was born never was quite the same with lottie after the termination and the hysterectomy the road began to climb steeply it hadnt rained here but it was cold the tops of stone walls and fences sugared with frost jesus i am nervous it was gone pm the funeral arranged for strange time at this point in the year theyd be losing the light by then her month was dry she hadnt eaten or drunk anything since the two aborted sips of the filthy coffee in the lake district and no time now for a pub lunch the sky was a blank screen the outlines of the hills now ironhard against it lottie was jealous back then though shed never let it show the countryside was in ragged layers of grey the only colour a splash of royal blue on the side of some poor dead sheep decomposing by the roadside tufts of its wool blown into a discarded coil of barbed wire the sky harsh blanched without sympathy unquintessential england as hard and hostile as it could get no watermeadows thatched cottages or bluebell woods no reason for lottie to be jealous was there well nothing happened did it matt was always the gentleman was cant get used to this i need to see him buried in front of her a reservoir stone sides a stone tower cold slate water she followed the road across it along the rim of the dam slowing for a black flatbed lorry loaded with metal kegs the only other vehicle shed seen in three or four miles across the cab in flowing white letters it said bridelow beers the road narrowed steepened it was not such a good road erosion on the edges holes in the tarmac with coarse grass or stiff reeds shafting through no houses in sight no barns not even many sheep and then suddenly she crested the hill the horizon took a dive and the ground dipped and sagged in front of her like dirty underfelt when you stripped away a carpet christ moira hit the brakes the road had become a causeway either side of it like a yawning estuary sprawling mudflats was something she could recognize peatbog hundreds of acres of it there was a crossroads and a fourway signpost and the sign pointing straight ahead straight at the bog said bridelow but there was no need she could see the place dead ahead hey matt moira breathed a warm pressure behind her eyes you were right this is something like a rocky island down there across the bog but the rocks were stone cottages and at the high point they sheered up into the walls of a huge blackened glowering church with a tower and battlements behind it against a sky like taut stretched linen reared the ramparts of the moor unconscious of what she was doing until it was done her fingers found the cassette poking out of the mouth of the player she held her breath there was an airbag wheeze a trembling second of silence and then the piping filled up the car moira began to shiver uncontrollably and it shook out all those tears long repressed she let the car find its way across the causeway on the other side was a shambling grey building with a cobbled forecourt the pub she took one look at it and turned away eyes awash so she saw the village through tears a cliff face resolved into a terraced row with little front gardens white doorsteps houses divided by entries like narrow miniature railway tunnels then there were small dim shops a hardware kind of store its window full of unglamorous onetime essentials like buckets and sponges and clothespegs as if nobody had told the owner most of his customers would now have automatic washing machines a fish and chip shop with some sixyearolds impression of a happylooking halibut painted on a wooden screen inside the window a post office with a stubborn red telephone box in front british telecom had now replaced most of them with shoddy americanlooking phone booths that thankfully had forgotten about bridelow the streetlamps were black and iron old gaslamps maybe a man would come around at night with a pole to light them well it was conceivable much was conceivable here moira saw an old woman in a doorway she wore a fraying grey cardigan and a beret she was as much a part of that doorway as the grey lintel stones peat preserves matt had said peat preserves from dawbers book of bridelow religion ii that bridelow was a place of prechristian worship is beyond doubt as has already been noted in this book there are a number of small stone circles dating back to neolithic times on the moor less than a mile from the village the original purpose of these monuments remains a matter for conjecture although there have been suggestions that some are astronomicallyoriented as for the village itself the siting of the church on a presumed prehistoric burial mound is not the only evidence of earlier forms of worship indeed chapter ii steady pop just take it ve ry steady no leave me please ill be fine if i can just god i never realised how could you let it get to this and say nothing how could you hans hissed shut up with a savagery that shocked her he pulled away and ducked into the church porch and cathy was left staring at our sheila who was grinning vacuously both thumbs jammed into her gaping vagina cathy turned away and saw why her father had been so abrupt a large man was bearing down on them weaving skilfully between the gravestones like a seasoned skier on a slalom catherine he roared how wonderful joel cathy said wanly so youve come all this way for matt castles burial and youre looking well youre looking terrific now he stepped back beamed did i spot your esteemed father in here joel he was slumped on the oak bench inside the porch looking cathy thought absolutely awful the pain now permanently chiselled into his forehead joel beard didnt appear to notice hans ive been approached by two young chaps with guitars who apparently were among matt castles many proteges in manchester they say theyd like to do an appropriate song during the service a tribute i didnt see any problem about that but how would the relatives feel do you think cathys father looked up at his curate and managed to nod ill yes we must consult lottie obviously perhaps cathy cathy said of course ill ring her now and ill come and tell you joel ok why couldnt the big jerk just clear off but no he had to stand around in the porch like some sort of ecclesiastical bouncer smiling in a useful sort of way his head almost scraping the door frame can we expect any press do you think television cathy said with all respect to the dead joel i dont think matt castle was as famous as all that folkies no matter how distinguished tend to be little known outside what they call roots music circles ah joel nodded i see with those tight blond curls cathy thought he resembled a kind of macho cherub staying the night catherine probably the roads are going to be quite nasty i gather black ice forecast in fact she added hopefully i wouldnt hang around too long after the funeral if i were you not a problem joel said i have accommodation oh damn where why joel beard spread his long arms expansively here of course hans sat up on the oak bench eyes burning joel i do wish you wouldnt its disused its filthy its its damp wont be by tonight ive asked the good mr beckett to supply me with an electric heater hell cathy said not the winecellar it was a small square stone room below the vestry where they stored the communion wine and a few of the church valuables it was always kept locked ah now catherine this is a latterday misnomer the records show that it was specifically constructed as emergency overnight accommodation for priests did you know for instance that in the snow was so thick that the bishop himself on a pastoral visit was stranded in bridelow for over two weeks when he was offered accommodation at the inn he insisted he should remain here because he said he might never have a better chance to be as close to god sort of thing a bishop would say said cathy ah yes but and then hed lock himself in and get quietly pissed on the communion wine avoiding her fathers painsoaked eyes but happy to stare blandly into joel beards disapproving ones cathy thought i really dont know why say things like that it must be you joel gods yobbo you bring out the sacrilegious in us all the digital wallclock in the admin office at the field centre said er alice murmured casually into the filing cabinet as its friday and dr halls not likely to be back from that funeral and theres not much happening i thought i might no chance chrissie snapped forget it alices head rose ostrichlike from the files well she said deeply huffed done it now chrissie thought well bollocks shes had it coming for a long time im sorry alice she said formally but i dont think for security reasons that i should be left alone here after dark alice sniffed never said that before all right i know the college is only a hundred yards away and someone could probably hear me scream but thats not really the point there are important papers here and and petty cash too shed caught one of the research students in here when she returned from lunch the youth had been messing about in one of the cupboards and was unpleasantly cocky when she informed him that he was supposed to have permission nothing to do with him of course alice smirked because youre not silly like that are you i beg your pardon him in there the one with no personal bits dont be ridiculous chrissie mumbled head down so that alice would not see her blush how stupid shed been the other night thinking it was just a thought alice said she opened the bottom drawer of the smallest filing cabinet and brought out her makeup bag when obviously it couldnt have been what you thought you were just more frightened than you cared to admit going in there on your own going anywhere tonight it was just the way the thing was lying and the projecting item was just some sort of probe or peg to hold it together what sorry alice i said are you going anywhere tonight oh i thought id have a night in chrissie said watch a bit of telly she didnt move she was still aching from last night roger had taken her to dinner at a small dark restaurant shed never noticed before in buxton and then because his wife was on nights had accompanied her back to her bungalow rogers eyes had been crinkly and glittering his stress as experienced at the motel had obviously not been a longterm problem gosh no i wonder alice said if mrs hall will be with him at the funeral i think he likes to keep different areas of his life separate chrissie said carefully lottie said shaking out her black gloves to be quite honest i wish he was being cremated dic didnt say anything hed been looking uncomfortable since the undertakers had arrived with matts coffin for some reason theyd turned up a clear hour and a quarter before the funeral i dont like graves lottie said talking for the sake of talking i dont like everybody standing around a hole in the ground and you all walk away and they discreetly fill in the earth when youve gone id rather close my eyes in a crematorium and when i open them again its vanished and i dont like all the flowers lying out there until they shrivel up and die too or you take them away and what do you do with them dic blacksuited glaring moodily out of the window his hands in his hippockets lottie just carried on talking far too quickly and also you see in a normal situation what happens is the funeral cars arrive and they all park outside the house with the hearse in front and all the relatives pile in and the procession moves off to the church wouldve been daft dic said when its not even two minutes walk which means i mean in the normal way it means the coffin doesnt leave the back of the hearse until it reaches the church door not like this its quite ridiculous in this day and age the two of them standing alone in the pubs lofty back kitchen alone except for matts coffin dark pine occupying the full length of the refectory table but i mean what on earth was i supposed to say to them lottie said youre early go and drive him around the reservoirs for an hour the relatives would be here soon some from quite a distance some with young children i keep thinking dic said his voice all dried up that i ought to have a last look at him pay my respects you had your chance lottie said more severely than she meant to when he was in the funeral home you didnt want to go i couldnt her voice softened well nows not the time dont worry thats not your dad that poor shell of a thing in there thats not how hed want you to remember him god she thought with a bitter smile but im coping well with this of course half the mothers union had been round offering to help with the preparations and the tea and the buffet and shed said very politely no no thank you its very kind of you but i can look after my own and the old dears had shaken their heads well what else could they expect of somebody whod turn down ma wagstaffs patent herbal sedative yes she was coping then dic shattered everything he said mum ive got to know what happened with that nurse lottie dropped a glove at the hospital the night he died who told you about that picking up the glove pulling it on and the other one oh mum everybody knows about it no they dont she snapped they might not here but it was all round the infirmary jeffs girlfriend knew whos on admissions in casualty theyve got no damn right to gossip about that kind of thing dic squirmed god you choose your bloody times my lad im sorry mum not as if she was hurt she had a shock that was all he didnt know where he was he was drugged up to the eyeballs she was a young nurse too inexperienced to be on a ward like that but you know the way hospitals are now they said he attacked her he didnt attack her god almighty a dying man a man literally on his last legs dic said unwilling to let it go they said he called her this nurse they said he called her moira lottie put her gloved hands on the pine box about where matts head would be as if she could smooth his hair through the wood say look its ok really i understand leave it will you dic she said very quietly just leave it shes not corning today is she the cairns woman no lottie said shes not good said dic cautious as a field mouse little willie wagstaff peeped around the door sniffed the air and then tiptoed into the dimness of mas parlour the curtains were drawn for matt as were the curtains in nearly all the houses in bridelow but at mas this was more of a problem the place all cluttered up as usual with jars and bottles and big cats called bob and jim he crept over to the table in its centre was a large aspirin bottle the contents a lot more intriguing and colourful than aspirins the principal colour was red in the bottom of the bottle was a single red berry most likely from the straggly mountain ash tree by the back gate all the berries had vanished from that bugger weeks and weeks ago but this one looked as bright and fresh as if it was early september also in the bottle was about a yard of red cotton thread all scrimped up one end of the thread had been pulled out of the bottle and then a fat cork shoved in so that about half an inch of thread hung down the outside the bottle had been topped up with water that looked suspiciously yellowish the tangle of red cotton soaked through by the ell willie said through his teeth nothin left to chance eh you put that down now willie nearly dropped it mas eyes had appeared in the doorway followed by ma too dim to see her properly she was in a very long coat and a hat that looked like a plate of black puddings bloody hell ma scared the life out of me corning in here wiout knocking messing wi things as dont concern you me messing he gestured at the bottle i bet thats not spring water neither used to be ma glared indignantly at him been through me now that strengthens it oh aye i thought you were losing your touch ma stumped across to the table snatched up the bottle and carried it over to the ramshackle dresser where her handbag lay the size and shape of an oldfashioned doctors bag she was about to stow the bottle away then stopped whos carrying him then me eric frank manifold senior maybe young dic that lottie ma said shes a fool to herself that girl if shed let the mothers union give her a hand wed all be sleeping easier eh he watched ma passing the aspirin bottle from hand to hand thoughtfully oh now look ma just forget it i am not anyway therell be no chance lottiell be watching us like a bloody hawk aye praps ill not ask you ma said to his relief the thought of opening matts coffin turned his guts to jelly and anyway why dyou need a thing like that i thought it were all sorted out you thought ma was contemptuous whore you to think willie wagstaff ma im fiftyfour years old willies fingers had started up a hornpipe on the coins in the hip pocket of his shiny black funeral pants and never grown up ma said this is grownup ma bent and put the bottle down on the edge of the hearth the fire was just smoke no red all banked up with slack to keep it in until ma returned after the funeral she straightened up wincing just a bit not as sprightly as she was but what could you expect and faced him hands clamped on the coat around where her bony old hips would be its like damp ma snapped once you get an inch or two up your wall youre in trouble if your walls a bit weak or a bit rotted itll spread all the faster itll feed off rot and corruption and sickness too ma willie didnt want to know this he never had she knew that ma picked up his thoughts like theyd dropped neatly in front of her dustpan and brush comes a time willie wagstaff when things cant be avoided no longer he were a good man matt castle but dint know what he were messing with or who probably dint even know he were messing wi owt and that wife of his she were on guard day and night nobody could get near he were crying out for help were matt by the end and nobody could get near well matts dead ma willie said warningly ma picked up the aspirin bottle and that she said ramming the bottle deep into the bag is why he needs protection and not only him obviously this is crucially important our willie oh bloody hell said willie it had always been his way with ma to pretend he didnt believe in any of this found it expedient as a rule a time ago lad not long after you left school we had some trouble dyou remember wi a man i do and i dont willie said evasively meaning hed always found it best not to get involved in what the village traditionally regarded as womans work no matter how close to home ma said he were clever ill say that for him knew his stuff knew what he were after but he were bad news wanted to use us had to be repelled willie did believe though at the bottom of him most of them did despite all the jokes what about him mas lips tightened then she said theyre allus looking for an opening and this one stood out a bloody mile and matt castle dint help chipping away at it making it bigger eh this musical thing he were working on t bogman ohaye another way in willie werent doing that on his own were he willie went quiet he knew matt had been consulting with some writer but the man never came to bridelow matt always went to the man until the final few weeks when he couldnt drive himself any more he looked at his mother with her big daft funeral hat and dared to feel compassion she didnt need this her time of life look dont get me wrong ma ma wagstaffs fearsome eyes flared but they couldnt hold the fire for very long nowadays but youve bin at this for a fair few years now more than fifty ma said wistfully so like like i were saying to milly dont you ever get to like retire i mean is there nobody else can take over ma straightened her hat there is one she said biblically who will come after me but what asnt come yet like willie said stepping carefully you could push it just so far with ma and then the eyes switched from dipped to fullbeam now look you cheeky little bugger when i need your advice thats when theyll be nailing me up an all willie held up both hands backed off towards the door which is not yet got that oh aye said willie outside in the hard white daylight he looked across at the church on me way matt willie said with a sniff and a sigh rubbing his hands in the cold i hope theyve nailed you down me old mate good and tight chapter iii glasgow shit could this be the right place realistically no first off there was no elevator the stairway when he managed to find it was real narrow the steps greasy he didnt even like to think what that smell was but if he was unfortunate enough to be accommodated in this block hed surely be kicking somebodys ass to get the goddamn drains checked out hardly seemed likely shed trust her fortunes to a guy working out of a dump like this but when he made the third landing there was the sign on the door and the gold lettering said the m w kaufmann agency please knock and enter which he did and inside it was actually a little better than hed guessed it would be clean anyhow with a deep pink carpet and walltowall filecabinets also one of those ancient knee hole desks up against the window and the knees in the hole were not he noticed in there because they needed to be concealed she was about eighteen with ringlets and big eyes she swivelled her chair around and looked at him the way to his eternal gratitude women always had i uh he stood in the doorway for a couple of seconds trying to salvage some breath this guy kaufmann had to be pretty damn fit working here mr macbeth is it he nodded dumbly do excuse the stairs she said mr kaufmann represents quite a number of singers huh doubtless there was some underlying logic here concerning singers and breathcontrol but he was too bushed to figure it out he hung around in the doorway while she went off to consult with m w kaufmann in his inner sanctum thinking so you did this again macbeth put on a suit and tie this time cancelled your lunch appointment got busted for speeding by a cop with an accent so thick it sounded like he hadnt got around to swallowing his breakfast you really did all of this over a woman again maybe he thought as the kid beckoned him in maybe this is what they call a midlife crisis sure like all the other midlife crises i been having since i turned twentynine mr macbeth m w kaufmann said i am malcolm kaufmann they shook hands and waving him to a chair kaufmann said this all seems rather er irregular im an irregular kind of guy macbeth said winningly malcolm kaufmann looked less than won he was a small foxyeyed person with stiff hair the unnatural colour of lighttan shoes the secretary was hanging around eyeing up macbeth without visible embarrassment thank you fiona kaufmann waved her out eyeing up macbeth himself but in a more discriminating fashion so he said youre in television i understand macbeth confessed he was planning to build up the image a little then he changed his mind and built it up a lot how he was over here for the international celtic conference but also on account of his company was tossing around an idea for a major miniseries piece of shlock about this american guy doesnt know his ass from his sporran comes over to scotland to look up his celtic roots and before he knows it hes besotted with this uh mysterious scottish lady i see kaufmann said yeah i guess you do at that macbeth was thinking besotted with a beautiful mysterious lady who sings like a fallen angel and has wild black hair all down her back with just one single longestablished strand of grey under the spell of an enchantress who can make the earth move and the walls and the ceiling and after you meet her you dont sleep too good any more he said did moira ever act ah kaufmann leaned back in his chair tilting it against the wall tapping his rather prominent front teeth with a ballpoint pen well her first love naturally is her music but i do believe clearly searching his memory for the time shed done a walkon for some local soap macbeth helped him out certainly has the charisma dont you think indeed indeed the same er quality perhaps as that apparent in who shall i cher does that comparison do her justice would you say spoken like a good agent malcolm kaufmanns eyes narrowed dont be deceived by the surroundings mr macbeth i am a good agent you say that you encountered moira at the earls recent celtic gathering that would be on the evening when her performance was unaccountably disrupted right macbeth said unaccountably disrupted by what appears to have been an earth tremor which when it happened i dont recall having felt really maybe im insensitive that way macbeth said but you dont really think so macbeth shrugged like you say she has charisma they both nodded of course macbeth said this is early days see first off what id really like is to meet with moira over lunch before i leave here discuss things informally and how long will you be here two weeks at the outside well i shall no doubt be in touch with her very shortly kaufmann smoothed down his unconvincing hair and i shall naturally inform her of your interest then perhaps the three of us might yeah thatd be uh thatd be just she in town right now i fear not see i thought if she was doing a gig someplace id kind of like to be in the audience kaufmann smiled this sudden interest in moira this is entirely professional of course im a very professional kind of guy however ive long been a fan of the music but also malcolm this is kind of sensitive which as you pointed out to me a few moments ago you are not yeah well when i uh encountered the lady that night i was a mite overwhelmed i guess by the essential uh celtishness if thats the word of the occasion and if im being honest by the experience of moira herself and so well i believe i said a few things left her thinking as you doubtless are thinking right now what a grade a dork this person is oh yes said kaufmann he paused she can certainly be quite disconcerting thank you for that so id like to meet with her informally and maybe convince her that in less inhibiting circumstances i see well sadly moira is not working tonight or in the city at present she has a personal matter to attend to and though as her agent i am obviously aware at all times of her whereabouts no im afraid i cant tell you where she is that really would be irregular ah right macbeth said perhaps you could leave a number with fiona where we can contact you the agents face was blank right macbeth said gloomily chapter iv joel beard had been standing there for a couple of minutes over by the window in the rectors study his mouth slightly open hans he said urgently as if the church was on fire hans quickly who on earth is that the rector couldnt manage anything quickly any more but yes he too had seen the hooded figure it had vanished now behind the church tower im sorry joel over there didnt you see it no i mean all kinds of women pass through that gate joel turned to him a got you smile on his large unlined face i dont think i mentioned the gate did i hans and i dont think i mentioned a woman well obviously i assumed hans grimaced and bent to his worse knee feigning pain for once bloody man joel had spent three halfdays with hans being shown around shaking a few hands big cheerful amiable character anxious to learn but suddenly i wouldnt be surprised joel said in his flat calm yorkshire voice if there werent quite a lot of things you havent noticed things that go on hereabouts the hell are you talking about hell said joel yes i think i am talking about hell for instance sam davis the young chap who was here morning hans stared at him how do you know about that when he came out his land rover wouldnt start joel flashed his teeth i was around i fixed it we had a chat mechanic too eh the rector said youre obviously an endlessly useful man to have about the place joel deaf to all sarcasm said i told sam id go along to the farm talk to his wife and perhaps perhaps do what i can to protect them joel if theres any protecting to be done in this parish god in heaven this was the mans first full day in bridelow and he was taking over oh i realised of course that youd be along there yourself if it wasnt for your er leg i explained all this to sam of course i did made my excuses did you hans joel beard wore a hefty goldplated crucifix on his chest joel the avenging angel for the first time hans was getting an inkling of how disruptive this man could turn out to be hans im only trying to help joel said like a social worker addressing some uppity pensioner the problem is hans people sometimes dont realise the amount of sheer legwork involved in ministering to a rural parish admit it now youve needed help for quite some while and been too proud to ask for it well naturally we all admire you for that but theres a job of work to be done here you know that the rector said coldly i really dont know what youre talking about perhaps joel said gently thats because youre too close to it you know what i think i think these filthy rites on the moors are only the tip of the iceberg he glanced back out of the window to the place where the hooded woman had disappeared stay away hans pleaded inside his head stay out of sightfor gods sake whoever you are theres been talk you know joel said into the glass pane i have to be frank its the only way i can be and i think its only fair you should know a good deal of talk at diocese level hans sat down suddenly carelessly in his armchair and felt the pain might hurl him at the ceiling listen he gasped gripping the chair arms holding himself down has it ever occurred to you for one blessed moment that perhaps there are things you dont understand i know you were at st oswalds i know the sort of bullatagate christianity they go in for i only know whats in my heart joel almost chanting his eyes squeezed to slits joel the seer joel the prophet i know that god is living in my heart and therefore what i feel to be right and good must be right and good because it is his word god save us hans thought from born again christians cunning enough to get into the business proper and god help me to restrain this mans excesses leave him alone cant you see what youre doing to him cathy in the hall ear to the study door dressed for the funeral black jumper and skirt coat over her arm half an hour ago shed sneaked down to the winecellar to discover that joel had set up a camp bed on the stone flags and a cardtable with candles like a makeshift altar a bit eerie a lot disturbing what the hell was this bloke trying to achieve digging himself in like a big mole under the very heart of bridelow talk hans said you say theres been talk what kind of talk joel walked back to the centre of the room stood in front of the piano his hands behind his back the polished cross flashing from the black of his cassock like a cheap medallion hans thought from the sour darkness of his pain im not a humble man joel said hans coughing nearly choked i know this joel said and i pray one day almighty god will let me come to humility in my own way but notyet his hands whipped round from behind his back one was an open palm and the other a fist they came together with a small explosion in the still fusty air of the rectors study not yet joel beard said softly turning back to the window still presumably no sign of the woman in black whichever of them it was hans thought she would do well to depart quickly and discreetly the way they could when they wanted to its not the time you see for humility joel standing behind hanss chair now blocking his light the clergys been humble and selfeffacing for so long that it amounts to downright indolence its time i believe to remember the other christ the one who ejected the traders and the money lenders from the temple theres worse than that here isnt there look joel spat out its the devils lair its hans tried to get out of his chair felt suddenly dizzy thats what the talks about joels eyes burning in the afternoon gloom satan walking openly in the street satan walking bold as brass to the very door of this church where that filthy whore parades her her parts no hans felt old and ineffectual its not true yes theres a cult of satan making blood sacrifices on the moors and this is where its emanating from god only knows how long its flourished here cathy breathed in hard half an hour ago joel had caught her spying stood and watched her coming up the steps from the cellar smiling at her from the vestry doorway cathy redfaced mumbling just seeing if there was anything i could do to er to make you a bit more comfortable down there could have bitten her tongue off she supposed lots of women would find him awfully attractive with the tight golden curls the wide smile and that physique perhaps she really was gay certainly she hated the man now how could he say these things that filthy whore parades her parts our sheila youre insane she wanted to fling open the study door and scream it at him joel said reasonably were not asking you to do anything yourself obviously youve had to live with these people for a very long time big part of your life and we all realise youre not well and who hans asked wearily as if he didnt know are we joel for once was silent the bishop our newly appointed archdeacon perhaps he fancies you joel have you thought about that joel beard turned away in distaste christ says but but youre not christ joel hans said horrified at the hollow weakness of his own voice he slumped back into the chair into the endless cavern of his pain his eyes closed the rev joel beard laughed agreeably well crack this thing together rector you and me and god hans heard him rubbing his hands well times getting on funeral to conduct though i cant think why you left it until so late in the day family request hans mumbled lying some relatives had long way to travel hmm i see well come on old chap joels strong christian hand on his shoulder soon be over from behind the door cathy scurried away pulling on her coat hed caught her once today hed never catch her again the two of them stood at the bottom end of the churchyard not far from the lychgate there was a monument here on its own stark and pointed like an obelisk one word indented on a dressedstone plaque horridge it was always pretty scary shaw said to think that one day id be under that too therese in her ancient foxfur coat walked all round the monument is it a vault something like that i didnt take too much notice when they stuck my father in there im sure that one of the reasons i was determined to unload the brewery was to avoid being buried here i mean i didnt think about it at the time but it must have been at the back of my mind to break the family ties with bridelow get the hell out of here for good i mean not have to come to peoples funerals who you hardly knew because youre a horridge i reckon the old man would have sold out himself if hed had half a chance where would you like to be buried somewhere warm if it has to be in this country id prefer to be cremated i wouldnt mind being cremated being buried here therese said i like vaults she smiled her eyes glinted you can get out of them shaw shuddered a feeling he was growing to enjoy she looked very edible today as ever however for the first time he rather hoped she was not naked under that coat it was so cold though that he didnt really imagine she could be shed attached a scarfthing to it today with the foxs head on the end shaw whod ridden to hounds two or three times whilst staying with friends didnt find this offensive but suspected there were people in bridelow who would they appeared to have strong views about killing animals for pleasure she said have you ever seen him your father he knew her well enough by now to know exactly what she meant by that but he pretended he didnt of course ive seen him he didnt die until i was twentyfive come on lets get a drink before the show starts its your family vault after all therese said youve got rights of access why dont we pop in and visit him one for gods sake tess not his bloody father the sanctimonious old sod ive told you before she said coldly i dont like to be called tess then she turned her head and looked up into his face and the foxs glass eyes were looking at him too we could ask him you see he felt the chill wind raising his hairline even more wished hed worn his stylish new homburg she was playing with his mind again sometimes it was difficult to sleep we could ask him if you were right that he really did want to get out of bridelow that he wouldve had no objections at all to gannons taking over the brewery give your mother something to think about id rather not if you dont mind shaw said he was thinking about last summer a warm day in august when hed found out about another side of therese over dinner one night in manchester hed giggled nervously and said to her you know im beginning to think you must be some sort of vampire only ever corning out at night would you like that if i was a vampire i dont know what would it mean i could make you undead couldnt i er havent you got to be dead before you can be undead shed put down her glass and looked at him red wine glistening on her lips face still and golden in the moving candlelight like a mask from some egyptian tomb and what she said makes you think you arent and he began to shake with desire a new kind of desire which began at the bottom of his spine but hed kept on at her in the car it was a range rover this time belonging she said to a friend as she whizzed them down deansgate around am what did she do at weekends in the daytime social work she said social work and it was true two days later they were out on the moors he was following therese in gloriously tight jeans and there were two friends called rhona and rob and a bunch of people therese described loosely as offenders rhona who was quite attractive despite having a sort of crewcut was apparently a professional social worker with the local authority rob a lean hardlooking man was amazingly a policeman a detective sergeant you had to admire her cheek being friends with a copper after all the cars and things shed stolen theyd parked their vehicles in a long layby off the sheffield road and after two hours of hard walking shaws legs were starting to ache where are we going exactly not far now therese assured him the six offenders who were of both sexes and ranged in age from teens to about sixty were fairly silent the whole way after a further few minutes therese stopped they were on a kind of plateau offering a magnificent view of miles of sunlit moorland and more distantly a huge expanse of darkness which he assumed was the moss with the hills behind it reaching up to kinder scout gosh look shaw said theres the bridelow road weve come a hell of a long way round if wed just gone through the churchyard and carried on up the moor wed have been up here in about half an hour it was better to come this way therese said dont whinge shaw there were stubby stones around where she was standing arranged in a rough sort of circle or maybe an eggshape it was hard to tell they were so overgrown one of the older offenders was on his knees he was probably exhausted he had his arms around one of the bigger stones a thing about two and a half feet high and he seemed to be kissing it what sort of offenders are they shaw whispered just people who society considers maladjusted therese said its stupid they all have special qualities nobody seems to want to recognize rob said were helping to rehabilitate them therese had taken a few objects from her backpack odd things photographs in frames a small pair of trainers a large penknife and arranged them around the circle up against the stones they had a rough sort of picnic outside the circle of stones with a whole cooked chicken which everybody pulled bits off and red wine afterwards they all sat around in the springy yellow grass not talking the sun going down shaw starting to feel a little drunk a little sleepy he was aware that rob and rhona had entered the circle and were murmuring to themselves in low voices they seemed to have taken all their clothes off they began to touch each other and then to have sex shaw was deeply shocked but kept quiet about it it went on for some time until suddenly dreamily a plump spotty middleaged woman called andrea stood up and joined rob and rhona in the circle and began to behave as though there were some other people in there too hello david she said joyfully the first time shed spoken all afternoon all right kevin she giggled yes she said me too do you like it here its nice isnt it at that stage rhona and rob left her and came out and sat with therese and shaw flies and midges buzzed around andrea in the dusk shaw seemed to fall asleep when he awoke he saw andrea on her knees in the circle with her arms around what looked like two dusty shadows isnt it heartwarming therese was whispering as if they were watching a weepy from the back stalls shes becoming reconciled to the loss of her brothers what happened to them they died therese said a long time ago she killed them with a penknife they were only little course she was only a child herself it was such a shame they put her away for a long time he didnt remember how they got back to the cars except that it was dark by then and it didnt seem to take nearly as long as it had taken them to get to the circle in the churchyard therese said is she here your mother no she she thinks shes got that taiwanese flu ive tendered her apologies funny isnt it the way she wont come into bridelow she should leave shes no connections here why wont she leave i dont know shaw said but he did his mother couldnt bear to be supplanted by therese his mother did not like therese this was understandable sometimes he wasnt sure that the word like precisely conveyed his own feelings her dark hair swept back today was mostly inside the collar of the fur coat she wore a deep purple lipstick nor he thought was love appropriate so why therese nodded back towards the village shaw looked his watch three minutes to four and the light was weakening why therese said its coming meaning the funeral procession shaw shuddered again with a cold pleasure that made him afraid of her and of himself you know therese said i think its time you met father properly is he dead shaw asked fearfully chapter v everything that happened the dreadful inevitability of it all ernie dawber would remember in horribly exquisite detail like a series of grim cameos or the meticulously etched illustrations in the prewar picturebook from which he used to tell stories to the youngest children on friday afternoons enjoying the measured resonance of his own headmasterly tones and then holding up the book to what was left of the light so they could all see the pictures cosy back then friday afternoons in midautumn with mr dawber and the brothers grimm home to buttered toast for tea now it was another friday afternoon but this time the text was being read to ernie and he could see all the pictures the pages turning over in a terrible considered rhythm until he wanted to leap up from his seat in the back row crying out stop stop he didnt leap up much any more sometimes lately he felt unsteady and disconnected in his head but when he went to the docs for some pills for it the doc had made him have tests sorry hed gone now no leaping up anyroad nowt he could do except to witness it for this was all he was now the observer the local historian dry and factual not for him to comment or to judge nothing that happened on this day would ever be recorded anyway in the book of bridelow and so was best forgotten as if ever he could cosy too the first picture in the bar at the man before the funeral having a whisky for the cold with his half of black his mind charting the changes from that warm evening when matt castle had brought them hope although unknown to him at the time the change must have begun on the bright march morning when the roadmen found the bog body hand clenching on his glass of black now condemned as gnats piss by them as knows the only light in the bar is greenishblue from the old gasmantle matt castle reinstated childishly happy when he found it could still be made to work such small things seemed to delight matt painstakingly patching up frail memories of his childhood unaware that he too was part of the change behind the bar stan burrows in a black waistcoat says passively tough about gus bibby eh why whats up you not heard ernie hes closing up the stores no i could see it coming me just not up to it no more bent double half the time i went in for a bucket last week had to climb up and get it meself sides which hes selling nowt what can you buy in guss you cant get in macclesfield twenty per cent cheaper its a matter of principle stan were glad enough to shop at gus bibbys when theres snow or floods and you cant get across the moss anyway what about his son how many days a year cant you get across tmoss since theyve built that road up nay its price of progress int it progress ernie nearly choking on his soso half of black stan saying nay bibbysll shut and itll stay shut whos going tbuy that place what about his son hell not come back will he got a good job wi gas board in stockport would you come back aye said ernie i would how manys like you though ernie any more be honest how many second picture halfway up the street church behind him looking down towards the man from up here the pub looks as if its built on the moss itself a bitter wind has blown through bridelow snatching the leaves from the trees and bleaching the colour from the faces inside the front porches the faces hovering ghostly in the shadows the bodies invisible in black the villagers start to step from their doorways the coffins coming a fair turnout thanks to matts folkmusic friends from the manchester circuit and outsiders with an interest in bridelow like dr roger hall and the former brewery workers who failed to find employment in buxton macclesfield glossop or even manchester and sheffield theyre all here except for the ones hunched over their fires with their beechams powders and a bad case of taiwanese flu the like of which would never have got across the moss in the old days ernie fancies he can hear wretched coughing from behind the drawn curtains as if the virus has spread to the stones themselves turn the page lad up by the arched lychgate now watching people stepping down to the cobbles to join the ragged tail of the procession the blinds are down at the post office soon to be the only shop remaining in bridelow ernie hardly recognizes blackclad milly gill who normally looks like a walking botanical garden is she in mourning just for matt castle or for bridelow itself the coffins at a funny angle because of the respective heights of the men carrying it from little willie to gangling frank are willie and milly gill back together ernie hopes so they need each other time like this lottie castle follows immediately behind and by eck mourning becomes her shes never looked as fine the red hair swept back under a neat black pillbox hat with a little veil generous mouth set hard with her half a pace behind is the lad dic a leather case under his arm go on turn over youve got to look the coffin on a wooden bier beneath the autumn cross the rector hunched stiffly before it his strong hair slumped over his forehead not quite hiding pearls of sweat and the lines in his face like an engraving behind the rector bobs the new curate curlyhaired lad built like a brick privy bit of a firebrand by all accounts hell be all right hell settle down wont he at the side by the choir stalls is hanss lass catherine who seems all of a sudden to have lost her youth anxiety on her firm plain face worried about her dad and with good reason needs a long rest that lad two youngsters with guitars who ernie doesnt recognize sing a wistful but forgettable ballad stop and look around afterwards before realising congregations arent supposed to applaud especially at a funeral then the rector gets down to it lord were here to thank you for the life of matthew castle and to pray that his soul might ernie in the centre of the rearmost pew locates ma wagstaff without much difficulty thats quite a hat mas got on with those big black balls on it anyway its through ma that he spots the mystery woman otherwise he never would have noticed her all in black like that and in the shadow of the pillar ma turns around just once with that famous penetrating stare thought at first the old girl was looking at him and then he sees the black hooded figure to his left on the little seat wedged up against the stone pillar by eck theyre not usually as public as this about it these women pretty place this church norman was it those huge archways and candles here and there like in a catholic church warm stained glass with garden of edentype pictures full of flowers and fruit and the cross that hung above the carved wooden screen dividing the nave from whatever the altar area was called the cross was of green wood or at least wood that had been green last summer woven boughs some with shrivelled dead leaves still hanging from them a cross from the woods and the hedgerows yeah nice and strange one of several strange things in here like the german shepherd dog sitting stoically on a pew next to a small boy well why not but still just a wee bit weird jesus shed be feeling at home here next but she still kept the cloak about her it was pretty damn cold in here and going to be a good deal colder outside when the darkness came down underneath the cloak the jeans and jumper shed travelled down in no place to change wouldnt worry matt how she looked but jeans might not be viewed as entirely respectful at a funeral in these parts keep them covered alsoi dont want this place to know me dont want to be identified by lottie or willie or dic or anybody who ever bought a castle band album not yet ok locking the car shed glanced up into the thickening sky and thought before this burials over its going to be fully dark matt castle going out of the dark and into the last black hole and the peaty soil heaped upon him under cover of the night but no bad thing the dark i cant face anybody shed thought standing alone in the muddy parking area behind the church pulling up the deep hood until her face was lost traitorous cow ill stay at the back out of sight ill pay my respects in my own way and then ill get the hell out and nobodyll be the wiser and yet shed stared up at the church at its dour crenellated walls at its gothic stainedglass windows showing their dark sides to the sky taking the light and giving out nothing at all the popeyed stone gargoyles grinning foolishly down on her somehow followed the walls to the tower and the edge of the churchyard where the moor began in ochre tufts and gorse bushes and in the distance there was a clump of rocks like a toad and if you blinked the toad would be quivering having leapt and landed five yards closer theres something here that knows me already no people around at that time only the sensation of them behind the drawn curtains not peering through the cracks at the stranger and the strangers dusty bmw nothing so obvious this is a knowing place shed found herself saying aloud then all too damn conscious of looking very like an extremely witchy woman shed passed through a wooden wicket gate under a steep stone archway to walk a while among bridelows dead there at the top of the churchyard was the hole awaiting matt the area immediately around it covered with bright emerald matting luridly unconvincing artificial grass she stood on it on the very edge of the hole staring down into the black rooty soil and saw again the smokechoked mouth of the great fireplace at the earls castle the clawing thing her mind had constructed there mammy how was he when he died can you tell me that backing away from the open grave thinking there are people here who can tell me that and i cant ask standing several yards from the church doorway now and feeling strongly that someone was watching out for her but knowing from experience that this feeling of being watched wasnt necessarily a case of someone but something that the watcher could be something in the air something that existed purely to watch spooking herself down here in england where she had no heritage and there should be no reverberations aw fuck this shed said aloud turning towards the church doorway looking up directly into the massively exaggerated gaping pussy of the sheelagh na gig shit moira said was you wasnt it the sheelagh the exhibitionist the stone effigy of a woman compressed to the dimensions of a gargoyle thrusting out her privates and leering about it a blatant fertility symbol or something almost always found in the stonework of churches mostly in ireland but rarely as prominent as this got yourself a prime spot here hen said moira shed walked under the sheelagh na gig through the porch and into the church feeling better now she knew whod been watching her this was ok this was not the whitehaired whitefaced man whod tried to steal the comb and maybe brought the bloody house down this was something older more benevolent maybe shed been the first in church shed sat here alone inside her own dark shroud concealed by a pillar until until matt arrived well all of us remember the day matt returned the minister said the gratitude felt by the whole village that its second most important institution was to be saved hes not well this minister moira thought and hes worried a real sense of oppression coming off him and there shouldnt be that in here this is abnormal the old lady knows the one in the really bizarre hat hans leads them out into the churchyard the pace all the more funereal because he can hardly walk as they near the doors ernie dawber standing up in his pew sees the curate joel beard stride forward to take the rectors arm then theres a rush of footsteps down the aisle and he sees catherine squeeze past the coffin resting on the shoulders of willie and eric frank senior and young frank and practically throw herself between the two clergymen dashing the curates hand aside and snatching her fathers arm clasping it by eck no love lost there and she doesnt care who knows it the pews are emptying from front to back which means ernie will be the last out except for the mystery woman he glances behind just once as he joins the end of the procession but shes not there sometimes they just disappear these people the next picture is so black at first because of the sky that its almost like a woodcut the graveyard packed like a dark fairground but a circle of space at the top where the moor looms above the rectangular hole in the soil which when the lamplight flares is like the opening of a shaft alfred beckett verger and organist has lit a metal paraffin lantern which he holds up on a pole hanging it over the grave as hans completes the burial rite his own version some of it turned about but all the old lines there man born of woman hath but a short time as the phrases fade like a curlew it begins the piping ernie gasps muffling his mouth with a leathergloved hand clutching a victorian marble cross for support a hush enclosing the churchyard as the cold and homeless notes roam the air he straightens up against the cross brushing in relief at his overcoat its the lad dic matts coffin on the ground at the edge of the grave and dic standing by it the pennine pipes under his arm and the wilderness music swirling up into the cold only the lad for just a few seconds ernie moving closer the lad plays well his dadd be proud tries to see lotties face but her heads turned away someone weeping behind him cant see the coffin any more the four bearers lined up on either side of dic concealing the grave lamplight shows him the fingers of willie wagstaffs left hand starting to move against his thigh a slow beat in time with the piped lament ernie finds hes standing next to the lampbearer alf beckett when somebody likely a woman whispers put it out alf eh put lamp out silently alf beckett lowers the pole to the ground unhooks the lantern lays it on the grass at his feet shuffling around to put himself in front of it so that no light is cast into the grave that do fine ta lad oh hell quite soon behind the pipes theres a scraping and a scuffling on the ground like mice or rats ernie tries to shut it out hes not supposed to hear this he looks up away from it and the only face he can see clearly is the rectors upturned to the sky to what light remains the rector also knows he is not supposed to hear or to see he has his eyes tightly closed get it over with ernie hisses get it bloody done raises his eyes above the little graveside scrum but doesnt close them sees the black shapes of the sparse trees on the edge of the churchyard where it meets the moor the trees trembling has this withering shrivelling sense of something blowing towards them off the moor off the moss irrational his nerves like the night when he was scared the moss would swallow the sun and it would never come up again come on settle down calm yourself theres nowt you can do except keep your mouth shut and your eyes averted nowt here for the book of bridelow dic keeps on piping the same melancholy tune over and over again but erratic now offkey hes getting tired but the noises behind him go on the scuffling on the ground and now a jarring creak and an intake of breath and then all hell stop let me through rough hands thrusting ernie aside mr beckett wheres the lamp stand back will you stand back i said or somebody will get hurt the lantern snatched up its gassywhite flame slanting flaring in the furious eyes of the rev joel beard smoke rolling from the funnel hands grab at him to hold him back from the grave but joel snarling is big and fuelledup with rage the metal cross swinging as his cassocked chest swells and his elbows slam back the lamp flies up into the night and joel catches it by its base as it falls pushing alf beckett so that alf spins sideways into dic castle and the pennine pipes make a squirming ruptured noise subsiding into empty impotent blowing and wheezing the rev joel beard steps to where the coffin of matt castle lies at the graves edge and he lifts the lantern high chapter vi she was not among those weeping when the pennine pipes began it got to her in other ways hanging back behind the crowd still as the headstones around her moira felt confused puzzled the plucking at something inside her starting this small familiar tingle in her lower abdomen ok she would have known anyway that it wasnt matt she could hear there wasnt the same lilting lightasair technique the inimitable agility would have been no mistaking that and yet the roman numerals on the church clock litup said it would be dark at this time of year but the darkness had the icy velvet quality of midnight and whoever had organized this service had known it was going to end like this why sure as hell was the strangest funeral shed ever been to the minister and the principal mourners in a distant lamplit huddle the freezing air over the entire churchyard somehow electric with this almost feverish dreamlike tension and the piping going on and on and on like in a timeloop so that you wound up mentally pinching yourself asking is this real like where am i did i drive across these unknown hills into some dream dimension needing at last to break through maybe talk to someone hear the sound of her own voice anybodys voice she moved closer symbolically tossing back the hood of her cloak at the moment the lantern went down she saw the big shapes of the trees at the end of the churchyard below them shadows intertwined the amorphous tableau at the top of the small rise where matts grave was to be from whence came the insistent neverending piping but no sounds of a funeral service no suggestion of anyone leading the proceedings only under the pipes as she drew close a whispering as if there was more than one person whispering but they werent listening to each other the voices rustling together like winddried leaves and she caught a passing perfume a sick sad smell then to her left a small commotion an expulsion of breath from a yard or so away a dragging on her cloak and she was almost pulled down stop a mans voice strong authoritarian let me through for just a second everything froze and then there was this instinctive communal resistance a tightening of the clutch of bodies around her the whispering intensified new urgency in it the dead leaves really crackling now a scrabbling now by her feet some guy had been pushed over rolled on to the cloak he found his feet she reclaimed the cloak somewhere nearby there was a struggle going on she didnt move the lamp appeared again bouncing wildly in the air like some willothewisp thing in the spinning light she got a splitsecond picture of must be matts boy dic castle playing the pipes the bag trapped in an elbow his face red with effort and willie wagstaff next to dic willies eyes flitting anxiously from side to side and she could almost feel the rhythm of the little guys famously impressionable fingers in her head thud thud thud thud and then the oillamp went up again was held steady and moira looked down oh jesus into matt castles face framed in quilted white the smell the perfume of the dead the coffin lid off his hair gone gravedirt spilled on his closed eyes the way you never want to see them the way you cant bear to remember them and still you cant turn away your head it wont move what have they done moira began to shiver she closed her eyes and this was worse like waking up in the fast lane her senses lurching out of control cracked images oscillating in the steamy halflight between perceived reality and illusion the place where the whispers went vaporous arms reaching from the smoky maw of a great fireplace the splintering white of a skullstorm dancing lights on the moor a rock like an encroaching toad popeyed gargoyles belching blood an eruption of steaming intestine on stone all these reflecting one to another like in the shards of a shattered mirror while tiny vicious chattering voices gnawed at her eardrums and she felt something sucking around her shoes pulling her down and she knew that if she didnt open her eyes shed be screaming like a loony but when she did it was no better she blinked in pain he lay there in his coffin matt castle not in a shroud but a plain white tshirt and his greywhite hands crossed over his chest were fumbling at it oh god oh jesus his damned hands were how dare you how dare you the man holding up the lantern the big cleric shed seen in the church earlier this mans face bleached in the lamplight with rage and shock below him the old lady with the bizarre hat sleeves pushed up and both arms in the coffin pressing something into the dead hands of man castle crossed over his breast it was her hands moving not his moira saw a frightened angry glazing in the eyes of the big man as he bent roughly down with the lamp forced himself between the old woman and the body in the coffin she thought she heard him sob or it might have been her the big minister guy had put his own hand in there holy christ is this real and brought it out something clutched into a fist put that back the old womans eyes flashing greengold like a cats in the lanternlight this is unpardonable yeah he was sobbing the big man sickened shattered furious at what he was doing joel the minister the rector was there on the other side of the grave his face all twisted up the fairhaired girl still holding on to his arm please put it back ill explain to you i promise how how can turn away joel please it isnt what you just turn away the big clergyman lifted his left hand to the lamp he was holding up a small bottle something moved in it liquid moira glimpsed red joelgive it to meyou dont understand she saw that joel was breathing rapidly now a kind of wild petulant hysteria there she saw him rise to his full height saw his arm pull back the rector screamed no shook out of the girls grip threw himself across the empty grave one shoe reaching the phoney nylon grass mat on the other side inches from the coffin as joel breathing violently hurled the bottle above all the heads towards the moor beyond the trees then he turned put down the lamp and stumbled back into the crowd his hands flailing heard him clumping away his outraged breathing his sobs grab him somebody please the girl and she meant the rector people pushing past moira reaching out for the minister as the false grass slid from under his shoe and he almost rolled into the open grave several minutes later the graveyard had quietly emptied except for the group around the empty coffin mostly women and not whispering any more at the centre was the one with the hat she was the oldest of them two of the others replaced the coffin lid moira had backed beyond the lamplight was a short distance away leaning up against this tall cross in the celtic style trying to breathe oh god oh holy jesus what the fuck am i into here one of the women at the graveside was lottie castle lotties voice was very quiet very controlled carefully folded up tight i cant believe that any of this has happened lottieit was willie coming up behind her and you i know willie said im

pass us me bag joyce its down behind that cross moira tensed at her feet was a thick vinyl shopping bag lotties leather boot slammed down hard on the coffin between the old womans hands you lottie said have done about enough for one day the old womans hat fell off she looked startled like nobody ever spoke to her this way you dont understand girl moira sensed an even further drop in the temperature of the night air between them no lottie said youre right i dont understand any of this i dont want to matt thought he did he thought he should well what good did it do him tell me that i

swear ill wring your stringy old neck for you she stood and folded her arms and waited moira knew she wouldnt move until the last shovelful was trampled down when ma wagstaff looked at her she turned her back right then willie had a rope he threw one end across the grave and another man caught it ok frank wheres tother rope lets do this proper im sorry ma shes right nowt else you can do now lets

black seeds sown ma wagstaff said ominously bury him tight and pray for us all the old woman walked unsteadily away her back bent like shed been beaten mugged moira thought several other women followed her silently down the cemetery path the church clock shining bluish in the sky said when the women reached the shadow of the cross where moira stood ma wagstaff stopped stiffened stared up at her as moira silently handed her the shopping bag old embers kindled briefly in mas eyes neither spoke moira didnt know her and yet she did hans lay stiffly on the old sofa in the rectory sitting room theyd put cushions under his knees taken off his dogcollar his eyes were wide open but ernie dawber could tell they wouldnt focus hans kept trying to tell them something but his mouth wasnt shaping the words cant fee fee pop stay quiet lets put your overcoat over your legs hows that mr dawber dont you think we should get the doctor to him i do you go and make us some tea catherine dic ring for an ambulance when theyd gone ernie leaned over hans dont try and talk just nod all right are you trying to say theres bits of you you cant feel hey up you dont have to nod that hard just tilt your jaw slightly is it your arm your shoulder hans pushed an elbow back into the sofa trying to raise himself chest shoulders now then ernie raised a warning finger listen lad weve known each other a long time me and thee ill be frank with you im not a doctor but my feeling is youve had a bit of a heart attack the rector squirmed in protest ah ah dont get alarmed now ive seen this before its nowt to get panicked about what you are is a classic case of a man whos been pushing himself too far for too long i know this is not what youd call an easy one this parish for a clergyman and youve handled things with tremendous skill hans and courage over the years anybody herell agree with that the rectors eyes flashed frustration aye i know its not the best of times to get poorly what with one thing and another and that joel by eck hes a rum bugger that lad impetuous well but hans be assured theyll cope the mothers union they will cope theyve had enough practice over the years wished he felt half as confident as he sounded the trouble with bridelow was so much had been left unsaid for so long that nobody questioned the way the mechanisms operated any more it was just how things were done no fuss no ceremony until there was a crisis and they found the standby machinery was all gunged up through lack of use when they heard the warble of the ambulance hans grabbed hold of ernies wrist and began to talk ive buggered things ernie dont be daft dont worry about joel this time next week hell think it was all a bad dream the rectors dry face puckered dont think so oh aye folk do yknow things heal quick in bridlo the thing about it and ive been thinking about this a lot and writing it down started a book dont say owt about it gods sake dawbers secret book of bridelow not for publication like ma wagstaffd have a fit just to bring all the strands together reason it out for meself no look hans blinked hard no the thing about bridelow its so prosaic know what i mean not sensational no dressing up or dressing down for that matter nowt to make a picture spread in the news of the world joel nobodyd believe him would they you think about it he patted the rectors hand no better still dont think about it get yourself a bit of a rest ill handle things bridlo born bridlo bred leave it to uncle ernie this had been his forte as a headmaster getting the kids to trust him even when he hadnt the foggiest idea what he was doing as the ambulance men crunched up the path hans said shurrup you old fool and listen its joel like i said well handle him no you dont understand know where hes where hes going to spend the night do you back in sheffield if hes got any sense no hes made up a bed little cellar under the church ernie dont let him not now not after this oh said ernie by eck you spent a night down there once didnt you chapter vii glasgow she told him that not only had she never eaten here shed never even been inside the joint before and he having stayed in better hotels most of his life felt as usual like an over privileged asshole she had the grouse first time for that too didnt scots eat grouse on a regular basis like eskimos and seal meat he joined her a new experience for him also the grouse wasnt so great as well as which it looked like a real bird which made him feel guilty afterwards looking up from the sweet trolley she said i suppose youll be wanting your pound of flesh then aw come on fiona i can buy a girl dinner without the question of flesh coming into it i should be so lucky she smiled enticingly i was referring to moira youll want to know about moira well he said yeah but only if this isnt gonna get you into any kind of uh shit said fiona i dont think so i see all mr kaufmanns receipts he never comes here anyway its nice to live dangerously for a change i bet you live your whole life dangerously me for one and a half years after leaving college hed been a trainee assistant director the very next day he was an executive producer moms company uh well not sos youd notice you do look kind of dangerous mungo looks can be deceptive last thing he planned was to seduce this one irish she said you look irish somehow so people keep telling me mungo she said aw hey thats really incredible mungo macbeth of the manhattan macbeths my moms real proud of that giving her the condensed autobiography from being a small kid i learned how the actual king macbeth was really a good guy whose name was unjustly blackened by this english hack playwright thats true actually fiona said he wisny a bad guy im told they also used to play pipeband records to me in my cradle macbeth said screwing up his nose but that made me cry so they hired this genuine scottish nanny used to sing me gaelic lullabies that part i remember that was great that was how i got into the music my dad used to sing me tom jones fiona said glumly the green green grass of home not so great my dad never got to sing me anything macbeth said he didnt last that long he was kind of jettisoned by my mothers family before i was born they are the macbeths my dads name was smith i mean smith forget it so anyhow this trip came up she said go go feel the true power of your celtic heritage you feeling it im feeling a jerk is what im feeling i wont say she was expecting a delegation from the clan macbeth to turn out for me at the airport in full highland costume but you get the general picture out of interest have you actually seen anybody in a kilt since you got here apart from at the earls do nope so whatll you tell her when you get home hey would it be ok for me to have the profiteroles and just a coffee for me he said to the waiter make that two ill wait what do i tell mom ill say i had a peculiarly celtic experience ill say it was too deep and personal to talk about oh wow fiona said rolling her big eyes problem was that tonight she didnt look eighteen any more she was in a tight red dress well some of her was in it macbeth thought hard about moira cairns to take his mind off this comparatively minor but far from discountable temptation ill tell her i met a real witch he said one of the weird sisters aw shes no a witch fiona said scornfully no what is she shes what my granny used to call fey ok maybe a bit more than that like one day she was very annoyed with mr kaufmann i mean shes usually quite annoyed with him but this was something anyway here they are raging away at each other and shes about to storm out the door and then she just turns round like shes gonny say something else only she canny find the words and then one of the damn filing cabinets starts to shake and im no kiddn here all four drawers come shootn out at once really incredible awesome silence afterwards coulda been an earth tremor that was what mr kaufmann said but he still went all white yknow i mean that filing cabinet was locked im certain it was i can sympathize macbeth shuddered his mind making a white skull out of the tureen on an adjacent table listen fiona im a little shaky on moiras early career she was at college in manchester which is where she joined this local band right matt castles band matt castle just died oh shit really remembering something mindlessly insulting hed said about matt castle just after they met what a shithead a wonder she spoke to him at all after that the waiter brought fionas profiteroles hey great fiona said so then she was approached about joining this rock band offered a lot of money big money even for the time to make two albums the philosophers stone macbeth said but they only made one album right she split before they could get around to the second one but see the word is that the reason they wanted her apart from her voice was that you remember max goff who owned epidemic records he was murdered year or so ago some psychopath kid with a grudge right fiona said i didnt know she was with his outfit it was cbs put out the album in the states well the word is mungo fiona leaned conspiratorially across the table that the real reason max goff wanted her in the band was hed heard she was psychic he was very into all that like he already had a couple of guys signed to epidemic who were also psychics and he wanted to put them all together in a band see what happened of course moira didny know this she thought the guy just liked the way she sang right and what happened i mean that first album that was terrific i wore mine out aye but it all got very heavy with drugs and stuff and moira broke her contract came back to scotland went solo signed up with mr kaufmann whos well hes no exactly part of the rock scene i wondered about that the other singers on mr kaufmanns books are like mostly yknow nightclub or operatic or kind of jimmy shand type of outfits who fiona dug into a profiterole cream spurted see moira made it clear she wisny gonny have anything to do with the rock scene ever again and thats how its been she just does traditional folk concerts and selected cabarettype dates really boring hell of a waste its very intriguing what do you think happened fiona shrugged most likely she just got in with a bad crowd i used to think well maybe she was doing drugs in a big way heroin or something and realised it was like a one way street yknow but you dont think that now she shook her head i know her better now shes too strong she widny touch drugs not the kind that might get any kind of hold on her anyway i think its more likely she just rejected the psychic stuff the way they were fooling about max goff and these guys she knows what it can do right like if one person can shoot all the drawers out of a filing cabinet whats gonny happen wi four or five of them this is fascinating fiona the kid was smarter than hed figured youre saying maybe she came back to scotland to kind of put herself in psychic quarantine maybe scared of what she could do im only guessing fiona said but how come shell no play any of the old songs any more i think she wants to put all that stuff behind her but can you do that being psychic i mean its no like a jumper you can take back to marks and spencer drink your coffee mungo s gonny get cold he drank his coffee not tasting it hed been fooling himself that this thing about moira was purely well more than physical romantic maybe she was beautiful and intelligent and he loved her music from way back but maybe it went deeper maybe this was a woman who hed instinctively known had been closer to what the meaning of things things that having money and influence and famous friends couldnt let you into time of life he thought staring absently into fionas cleavage or maybe i really do have celtic roots mungo she said can i ask you something go ahead he could guess all this stuff about a miniseries kaufmann told you about that i keep my ear to the ground or the door he grinned yeah was that on the level you mean are we gonna go ahead with a film about uh an american guy who comes over here to trace his roots and ok ok falls in love with this beautiful aw hey she said i think thats sweet so maybe youll help me how tell me where i find her i dont know fiona said really part five our sheila from dawbers secret book of bridelow unpublished the oldest woman in bridelow commands as you would expect considerable respect as well as a certain affection ma wagstaff no i am afraid i refer to our sheila who displays her all above the church porch the socalled sheelagh na gig the spelling varies is found inexplicably in the fabric of ancient churches throughout the british isles a survival of an older religion some say or a warning against heathen excess usually it is lazily dismissed as some sort of fertility symbol the shapes and sizes vary but the image is the same a female shamelessly exposing her most private parts pornography i am glad to say it isnt the faces of these ancient icons are normally grotesque in the extreme their bodies compressed and ludicrous our sheila however is a merry lass with an almost discernible glint in her bulging stone eyes and a grin which is more innocent than lewd do not dismiss her as a mere fertility symbol she has much to say about the true nature of bridelow chapter i round about chrissie had got a phone call from the police would she mind popping over to the field centre when shed arrived the place was all lights police car and a van outside an unmarked rover pulling in behind her when the two cid men from the rover walked across they looked as if theyd been laughing now facing her across her own desk they were straightfaced but not exactly grim im detective inspector gary ashton the tall one said this is ds hawkins waving a hand at the chubby one in the anorak now miss white chrissie she said lovely he was a fitlooking bloke short grey hair and a trenchcoat fancy that even with policemen fashion goes in circles if youve been trying to get hold of dr hall she said helpfully he went to a funeral but it should be well over by now thank you we know ashton said he left early apparently and went home hes on his way now just to get our times right when exactly did you go home oh sugar chrissie thought we finish at four fortyfive she said actually shed left at just before four alice had fallen back on the irrefutable claiming she had one of her migraines coming on chrissie had stuck it for fifteen minutes on her own and then thought sod it and gone to fetch her coat four fortyfive ashton said right they could tell when you were lying couldnt they if he could he didnt seem too concerned now he said youre responsible for locking up are you i do it if theres nobody else i wouldnt say im responsible theres the caretaker he comes on at five and then a private security firm comes round a few times at night thats just since hes been here they were worried there might be a few you know weirdo types wanting to have a look or something whats happened then has there been a breakin so when you left everything was locked up what dyou do with the keys the front and back door keys we drop off at the caretakers office at the main college building the keys to the bogman section we keep those in here im afraid is that bad in one of the filing cabinets but thats always locked at night of course if this chaps an inspector she realised its got to be more than just a breakin and the big doors at the back we never open them well only when when the bogman arrived in a van they brought him straight in that way do you go round and check those doors chrissie before you leave round the outside i mean do i buggery said chrissie im an office manager not a flaming night watchman look come on whats this all about whats happened ashton smiled so you didnt see or hear anything suspicious before you left no not tonight oops what dyou mean not tonight well i thought i heard a noise in there where he is a couple of nights ago but it was nothing probably a bird on the roof you didnt raise the alarm what for it was locked i knew nobody could get in through those doors without making a hell of a racket so there didnt seem somebody got in tonight miss white oh hell said chrissie they didnt damage him did they rogerll go hairless she was cold the bmw beckoned she could after all simply drive away from this nobody invited you girl frost on the cobbles no one else on the street curtains drawn chimneys palely smoking ah the burden of guilt and regret all hed done for you all he meant to you and the thought that youd never see him again well you saw him she shivered problem with this place was there was nowhere you could even get a cup of coffee except the pub she stood and stared at it from across the road it was a large shambling building set back from the street with a field behind it and nothing behind that but peat dark sooty stone windows on three floors none of the upper ones lit outside was a single light with an iron shade a converted gaslamp quite a feeble glow just enough to light up the sign above the door the man ith moss in black no picture didnt look like lottie castles kind of place lottie was big sofas and artnouveau prints moira stepped lightly across the cobbles peered through the doorway only a dozen or so people in the bar lottie not among them willie was there with eric marsden the big dollop of hair over erics forehead had gone grey but he looked no more mournful than he always had eric the quiet one in every band there was always a quiet one go in then shall i why its moira come to help us reform the band just one problem we had to bury matt never mind have a drink lass she turned away gathering her cloak about her moved quietly across the forecourt to the steeply sloping village street there was a guy leaning against the end wall of a stone terrace smoking a cigarette she kept her distance walked down the middle of the street along the cobbles nothing for you here go back to what you know the fancy clubs and the small halls you can play that scene until youre quite old long as the voice holds out save up the pennies in twenty years you can retire to a luxury caravan like the duchess sea views all your albums collected under the coffee table as she came abreast of him the guy against the wall turned and looked at her muttered something sounded like fucking hell then he tossed his cigarette into the road at her feet and they tell me he said that this used to be a respectable neighbourhood whos that too dark to make out his features you dont know me but you know me huh yeah he said but not nearly as well as my dad did oh moira said his voice had sounded different when she last heard it like high prepubertal she sighed dic she said you want to go somewhere and discuss all this he laughed a short laugh matts laugh a cawing well she said im thinking he said from deep within his shadow cause i dont mind moira said im easy yeah he said we all knew that moira paused that was your chance dic i threw you that one you gave the predictable adolescent answer so go fuck yourself ok she turned away moved quickly up the street clack clack clack on the cobbles as good a way as any to do your exit grabbing the chance to go out angry it helped on either side of her were the gateposts of the stone cottages a black cat on one watching her like it knew her well lights behind curtains lights from an electrified gaslamp projecting from an end wall and over them all like another moon the illuminated church clock take it all in you wont see it again byebye bridelow all right it rang harshly from the cobbles like an iron bar thrown into the street it didnt stop her yeah ok running feet she carried on walking turned towards the lychgate the corpse gate but passed it by and entered the parking area behind the church where it was very dark she was taking her keys out of her bag when he caught up with her im sorry all right good youll be able to sleep fitted the key in the car door night dic give my love to your mother look hey she said gently im leaving ok you know your dad was screwing me what can i say to that i want to talk about it well im no talking here its cold and im no going to the pub so maybe you should just go away and think about it instead huh call me sometime fix it up with my agent im tired im cold where will you go and what the fuck does that have to do with you i shall find a nice anonymous hotel somewhere look dic said there is somewhere we can talk somewhere warm cosy moira got into the car goodnight moira she started the engine switched on the lights wound down the window by the way your playing it was well youre getting there i dont want to get there he said without emotion i just wanted to please him aye moira said it never did though no she said a dumpy elderly man walked through the headlamp beams he wore a long raincoat and a trilby bat like donalds only in better shape good evening he said politely as he passed the lights were on in the church am be ring the pillars in the nave a suitcase stood by the font ernie dawber watched the new curate manhandling a metal paraffin stove into the vestry all right lad joel beard alarmed set down the stove with a clang ernie dawber lad we met the other day with hans ah yes the curate recovered stood up straight he was wearing his cassock and the huge pectoral cross look im sure you mean well mr dawber but id rather not discuss anything tonight if you dont mind beg your pardon the funeral mr dawber what happened at the funeral you were about to tell me how innocuous it all was im saying id rather not discuss it well i think we should discuss it mr beard because it looks like youre in charge now joel beard looked bewildered hed obviously rushed away from the graveside dashed down to his little cell to recover and didnt yet know about hans ernie told him oh joel said oh my lord aye is he going to be all right happen said ernie if he gets some rest if he doesnt spend all his time worrying what the bloody hells going on back in bridelow joel beard gave him a hard look for swearing in church now look lad ernie said pull yourself together youre not really going to kip down there i am joel rested an arm on the edge of the font its quite clear to me that its become even more important to sleep in gods pocket you were there today i think mr dawber you saw what went on i saw a big soft bugger making a bloody fool of himself said ernie stoutly now come on its getting cold pick up your suitcase you can stay in my spare room for tonight and well have a bit of a chat joel beard made no reply he stood very call and very still the amber lights turning his tight curls into a golden crown good night mr dawber he said the double doors crashed back roger hall burst in and he was white to the edges of his beard chrissie was sitting at her desk the senior detective ashton casually propping his bum against it hands deep into his trenchcoat pockets the detectivesergeant playing with the zip on his anorak roger just stood in the doorway breathing like a trainee asthmatic he was wearing casual gear the polo shirt and the golfing trousers all right whats happened staring all round the room and finally noticing her chrissie dont look at me like that dr hall i know less than you obviously being the minion how much did they tell you on the phone dr hall ashton asked corning to his feet just just that is this on the level it s not a joke ashton shook his head doesnt look like it im afraid sir roger glared across the office at the metal door it was shut its unbelievable shaking his head what happened to the socalled security patrol well be talking to the company sir have no doubts meantime we didnt like to touch anything until you got here so it youd be good enough to take us through roger nodded dumbly chrissie was almost feeling sorry for him his face was like a crumpled flour bag he looked like a parent whod just learned his child had been found on a railway line in fact to him if somebody had vandalized his beloved bogman this was probably worse which is why chrissie didnt quite feel sorry for him the two detectives ashton and the chubby one in the anorak waited while roger went to unlock his personal highsecurity cabinet he brought out both keys the detectives followed him to the anteroom and then all three of them went through to the inner lab chrissie stayed behind elbows on her desk chin propped in her hands waiting for the eruption she didnt know whether to laugh or cry on his behalf no rogers voice echoing back lookinspector is it gary ashton sir greater manchester im i just cant believe this has happened what i look let me do some checks its possible unlikely but possible that theres a rational explanation ive been away for a few days this week its conceivable i suppose that something was arranged and by some incredible oversight i wasnt informed you mean whoever it was forgot to inform the caretaker theyd be dropping in sir after dark no youre right clutching at straws i suppose god almighty this is how did they actually get in quite professionally done sir the rear doors were forced both sets but forced by somebody who knew how if you see what i mean its unbelievable chrissie heard a clang rogers fist hitting the metal table if you wouldnt mind sir fingerprints sorry its just if anything any one thing had been specifically calculated to fucking ruin me this ruin you dr hall i we had a lot riding on it you dont get your hands on one of these very often how valuable would you say i mean i realise you cant invaluable and yet nor valuable at all to most people you could hardly stick it in your hall like a rodin its beyond me the whole thing and yet chrissies head shot up out of her hands never well sir i expect you have photographs ill also need to know what kind of vehicle would be required assuming it has been removed from immediate area bloody hell chrissie stood up she found she was shaking well obviously be searching the grounds pretty thoroughly but if you wanted to get it away without damaging itwould it need any special conditions refrigeration its in peat inspector peats a preservative thats how he survived for two thousand years of course sorry stupid of me anyway were clearly not looking for young tearaways here so have you any idea any notion at all who in the wide world would go to so much trouble to steal a twothousandyearold corpse old as that well wouldnt be much use for medical research then so what are we looking for bit of a nutter a rich eccentric collector ill be honest dr hall ive not come across anything quite like this its a oneoff its unbelievable roger said for about the fifteenth time and chrissie heard him pacing the echoing empty lab chapter ii the girl who opened the rectory door was sipping red soup off the top of an overflowing mug she watched both of them cautiously over the rim sorry dic said its an awkward time she swallowed hot soup winced no problem im on my own thats what i thought we er we needed somewhere to talk sorry your dad is he how is he they say its a minor heart attack tomato soup adhering to her lips im not allowed to see him until tomorrow he has to have rest ma wagstaff says not to worry hell be ok she sounded like this was supposed to be a reliable medical opinion this is moira cairns dic said hello catherine gruber said limply moira sensed she was worried sick the porch light was a naked bulb above it the gaping orifice spread by stone thumbs was deepened by the hard unsubtle shadows it threw the sheelagh na gig lit for drama grinning lasciviously at joel beard and he was appalled to think that everyone entering the church to worship god should have to pass beneath this obscenity tradition the antiquarians said our heritage olde englande joel beard saw beyond all this saw it only as symbolic of the legacy of evil he had been chosen to destroy a few minutes ago hed telephoned the archdeacon from the kiosk in front of the post office giving him a carefully edited summary of the evenings events in bridelow not mentioning the appalling incident at the graveside with the bottle which the archdeacon might have judged to be at this stage an overreaction on his part well poor hans the archdeacon had said easily and insincerely i think he should have a few months off dont you perhaps some sort of semiretirement i shall speak to the bishop in fact i think ill go and see him meanwhile you must take over joel do what you feel is necessary i have your support my support spiritually and and physically i hope i shall come to see you drop in on you very soon meanwhile tread carefully joel will you live at the rectory now the girls still there simon hanss daughter shell have to go back to oxford quite soon id guess but then theres hans himself when he leaves hospital dont worry well find him somewhere to convalesce meanwhile i shall sleep in the church in the priests cell all alone down there my god joel youre a brave man its gods house joel had said even he feeling with a rare stab of embarrassment that this was a naive response and was it gods house and which god as he entered the church of st bride under the spread thighs of the leering sheelagh he experienced the unpleasant illusion of being sucked into no longhaired girls dic castle said bitterly always the long dark hair moira said i cant believe this no no she said firmly the ministers daughter had left them alone in the rectory sitting room dic had wanted her to stay like he needed a chaperone with this scottish whore but she wouldnt they could hear her banging at a piano somewhere ragtime numbers with a lot of bum notes letting them know she wasnt listening at the door he never touched me sexually moira said he never came near on stage it was always him on one side me on the other eric and willie in between but a yard or two back that was how it was on stage that was how it was in the van that was how it was somewhere walls away catherine gruber went into the maple leaf rag savaging the ivories getting something out of her system and you clearly dont believe me moira was sitting on a cushion by the fireplace paper had been laid in it a lattice of wood and a few pieces of coal dic said followed him once after a charity gig she was waiting for him in the car park about twentyone twentytwo about my age long dark hair when was this fucking little groupies dic said he was semisprawled across a sofa clutching a cushion at his age er bout a year ago just before he before it was diagnosed dic had a lean face full lips like matt dark red hair like lottie still had a few spots and yeah he said i do know she wasnt the first staring at moira in her jeans and her fluffy white angora sweater hands clasped around her knees black hair down to her elbows because you still think the first was me sure and you know something gimme a cigarette will you he tossed the cushion aside got out a crumpled pack of silk cut and a book of matches didnt know you smoked tonight she said taking a cigarette tearing off a match i smoke the ministers daughter was playing the entertainer sluggishly moira said just answer me this earlier tonight at your dads funeral at the graveside i mean howd you feel about that his face closed up hard as stone i just played the pipes badly i didnt see anything she nodded ok so i dont know what youre talking about i understand well forget that then he lit his own cigarette said through the smoke mum said you wouldnt be coming anyway she didnt know you seen her no and thats not because listen im gonna say this there was a time when i felt bad twenty fifteen years ago when i felt bad because i never came on to him not even after a gig in some faraway city when we were pissed and i felt bad that i was twenty years younger and i was taking off nationally and he was maybe never going to i bet you did dic sneered i bet that really cut you up she ignored it i was thinking if wed slept together just the once to kind of get it over bring down that final barrier you got the vaguest idea what im saying he just looked at her through the smoke anyway moira said we didnt it never happened maybe thats another piece of guilt im carrying around i dont know the piano music stopped dic lay back on the sofa hands clasped behind his head outside the wind was getting up spraying dead leaves at the windows there was a polite knock on the door and cathy came in im making some tea if oh yeah thanks dic sitting up looking sheepish be ten minutes cathy said moira said as the door closed lottie your mother she know about this we never discussed it but you think she knows right dic shrugged this girl this socalled girl of matts you know who she was no i tried to find out from people at the folk club the bear you remember the joint nobody seemed to know her so how do you know they were because they went straight into this shop doorway wouldve taken a jack to prise them apart right moira said sadly and she looked like me yeah superficially like you used to look thanks a lot dic picked up the cushion and hurled it with all his strength at a bare wall i didnt mean it like that ok i dont mean a fucking thing i say i just like insulting people yeah sure moira said this wasnt getting either of them anywhere she wished shed stuck to her original plan and never agreed to come here with him so he had problems theyd made him stand there playing the pipes while they messed with his dads body in its coffin she could feel the confusion and the rage billowing out of him dic she was going to regret this yes no she wasnt she wasnt going to say anything either of them might regret she gathered up her cloak from the carpet im away all right the hissing sound disturbed him and the occasional popping and the blue glow it came from the circular wick of the paraffin stove intense slightly hellish iceblue needles pricking the dark the close stone walls shimmering like the inside of a cave lit by a cold and alien seaglare joel turned the flame up fully until it was flaccid and yellow and then he blew it out the stove was having little or no effect anyway his original plan had been to bring an electric heater down here but there was no power point and the nearest one in the church was too far away for alfred becketts extension lead to reach joel lit a candle with the stove out the temperature must be plunging but at least it didnt look as cold he sat on the side of the campbed with the double duvet wound around him cold he could live with anyway insulated by years of refereeing schoolboy rugby matches cold he could almost relish hed taken off his boots but added an extra pair of rugby socks when he lay down his feet projecting from the bottom of the bed would touch the stone blocks of the far wall that was how cramped this cell was but discomfort was good it was a holy place above him the nave of st brides around him its ancient foundations rock of ages a blessed place a sanctuary where bishops well at least one bishop had passed the dark cold hours in sacred solitude if he hadnt been so bonetired so sated with righteous rage joel might have spent the night in holy vigil on his knees on the stone floor like some mediaeval knight praying for divine aid in the deliverance of bridelow from its own dark dragon but his body and his mind were both demanding sleep a state often at its most elusive when most needed he was also rather appalled to find his loins apparently yearning for the comfort of a woman before his conversion joel had exploited his godgiven glamour at every opportunity and there had been many now he did not deny himself the yearning only its habitual casual assuagement he told himself this unseemly erection in the house of god was merely a sideeffect of the cold and the pressure of the duvet his watch told him it was not yet pm but tomorrow he felt would be a long day so he would allow his body sleep when he blew out the candle and lay back the paraffin stench hung over him like a chloroform cloth he must not sleep in this air clutching the duvet around him he arose into the absolute darkness followed his nose to the stinking heater and pulled it two yards to the oaken door bent almost double he carried the appliance into the little tunnel which led to the stairway and then leaving it out there shuffled back to his cell locking the thick and ancient door of his sanctuary against the pagan night falling uncomfortably into the rickety bed tread carefully joel what did the archdeacon mean by that joel would tread with the courage and determination of the first christians to walk these hills those who had driven the heathens from their place of worship and built upon it this church and whose holy task because of the isolation of the place and the inbred superstition of the natives had yet to be completed with gods help joel beard would drive out the infidel for ever cathy was pouring boiling water out of a big white teapot down the sink forgot to put the bloody tea in im a bit impractical well dont bother for me moira said i have to go youre the singer arent you cathy filled the kettle plugged it into an oldfashioned fifteenamp wallsocket it was that kind of kitchen thirty years out of date but would never be antique moira said wearily yes she was the singer cathy said still i bet you dont play the piano as good as me moira grinned how long you known dic years on and off hed come up to bridelow with his father at weekends i used to fancy him rotten at one time used to cathy shrugged that was when we were the same age she said elliptically moira looked at her a little overweight pale wispy hair pulled back off a face that was too young yet to reflect cathys cute sense of irony when we came in you said you thought your father was knackered you said itd do him good to get out of this place for a while i said that did i try again you were born here so they tell me i dont live here at present im in oxford doing what studying cathy said the principal occupation in oxford next to watching daytime telly and getting pissed what are you studying oh hey forget it im tired of walking all around things what i really want to know is what happened at matts funeral that fucked your dad up so bad and whos the other minister the big guy and how come you dont like him also whos the crone who fumbles in coffins and why was your daddy letting it go on thats for starters cathy straightened up at the sink you cant do that huh you cant just come into bridelow and ask questions like that straight out oh really well ill be leaving then ok cathy said lightly the avalanche of liquid peat hit him like effluent in a flooded drain and then it was swirling around him and he was like a seabird trapped in an oilslick his wings glued to his body if he struggled it would tear his wings from his shoulders and enter his body and choke him he could taste it already in his throat and his nose but even as it filled his dream he knew that the tide of peat was only a metaphor for the long centuries of accumulated godless filth in this village he knew also that he did have wings that could carry him far above it for he was an angel and if he remained still and held his light within him the noxious tide could never overwhelm him joel dreamed on although the stone room around him was cold the black peat in the dream was warm he remained still and the peat settled around him like cushions inside his dreaming self the light kept on burning its heat was intense and its flame like the one inside the paraffin heater became a tight blue jet arising from a circle it heated up the peat too in his dream he was naked and the peat was as warm and sensuous as womanskin against him moira waited for her by the rectory gate it was bitterly cold she imagined the walls of the village cottages tightening under the frost cathy came round the side of the house a coat around her shoulders howd you know id come after you moira shrugged youre like old ma wagstaff you are you know that thats the crone yes i hope not moira said well dammit willies old mother and he never said all those years and he never said a word im trying to understand it all cathy said somebody has to work it all out before we lose it most people here dont bother any more its just history i suppose thats been part of the problem moira realised she was just going to have to do some listening see what came together the church clock shone out bluewhite and cold as if it was the source of the frost the old ways moira said sometimes they dont seem exactly relevant and people get scared for their kids yeh youre right they dont want to understand most of them but can you blame them its not even as if its particularly simple not like buddhism or jehovahs witnessism cathy said not like you can hand out a pamphlet and say here it is its all there i mean you can spend years and years prising up little stones all over the place trying to detect bits of patterns cathy fell silent and moira found she was listening to the night the night was humming faintly a tune she knew people like me she thought we travel different roads responding to the soundless songs and the invisible lights its all too powerful the heritage maybe you should go away and when you get back your problems will be in perspectivego somewhere bland st moritz tunbridge wells bridelow ah duchess you old witch she said so what is the history of this place i mean the relevant bits you need to talk to mr dawber hes our local historian and what would he tell me probably about the celts driven out of the lowlands by the romans first and then the saxons the english celts from cheshire and lancashire and shropshire and north wales it was all one in those days they fled up here and into the peak district and because the land was so crap nobody tried too hard to turn them out and besides theyd set up other defences other defences well not like hadrians wall or offas dyke the kind of defences you cant see moira said the kind of defences most people cant see corrected cathy she looked up into the cold sky moira saw that all the clouds had flown leaving a real planetarium of a night cathy said shed kill me if she knew i was telling you all this who ma wagstaff of course and what makes you so sure she doesnt know oh god cathy said you are like her i knew it as soon as i saw you at the door its the green teeth and the pointy hat said moira i dont know what it is but when youve lived around here for a good piece of your life you get so you can recognize it but your old mans the minister and a bloody good one cathy snapped the best right moira said id like to meet him when hes feeling better well see cathy walked past her out of the rectory gates stood in the middle of the street looking up at the church its a sensitive business being rector of bridelow how to play it and if its working if its trundling along i mean things have always sorted themselves out in bridelow its been a really liberalminded balanced sort of community a lot of natural wisdom around however you want to define wisdom the moonlight glimmered in her fair hair giving her a silvery distinction then moira realised it wasnt the moonlight at all the moon was negligible tonight a wafer it was the light from the illuminated church clock they call it the beacon of the moss cathy said huh the church clock thats interesting dont you think its not been there a century yet and already its part of the legend thats bridelow for you you mean everything gets absorbed into the tradition mmm now joel beard thats the big curate with the curly hair the one and only joel beard saint joel now joels really thick he thinks hes stumbled into the devils backyard he thinks hes been called by god to fight satan in bridelow because this is where he can do it onetoone in the blue corner saint joel in the red corner the evil one wearing a glittery robe washed and ironed by ma wagstaff and the twelve other members of the mothers union the mothers union moira laughed in delight thirteen members cathy said thereve always been thirteen members i mean they dont dance naked in the moonlight or anything which bearing in mind the average age of the mothers is a mercy for everyone oh jesus said moira this is wonderful it used to be rather wonderful cathy said but its all started to go wrong even mas not sure why hey look have you anywhere to stay tonight i mean you want to stay here theres a spare room this kid would never say she didnt want to be in the house alone thank you moira said i think id like that dic who didnt drink much had gone back to his fathers pub and sunk four swift and joyless pints of bridelow black sitting on his own at the back of the bar at one stage he became aware of young frank pulling out the stool on the other side of his table steady on lad tapping dics fifth pint with the side of a big thumb its not what it were this stuff but itll still spoil your breakfast dic said fuck off frank frank got his darts out of his back pocket game of arrows dic shook his head making franks image sway and loom like something on a fairground ride come on lad franks grating voice rising and fading out of the pub hubbub like a radio coming untuned lifes gorra go on you cant say you werent expecting it he were a good bloke but hes better off dead than how he were you got tadmit that frank dic clambered to his feet sank the rest of his pint most of it going into his shirtfront fucking leave it will you and then he was weaving and stumbling between the tables and out into the night he stood in the doorway a while getting his breath together then he strode across the forecourt and on to the street the cobbles gleamed frosty already in the light of the big clock in the sky shining like the earth from the moon in those old space pictures dic began to moonwalk up the street taking big strides crashing into the phone box outside the post office giggling like a daft sod coming up by the church where hed talked to moira cairns there was her bmw still parked there moira cairns wouldnt mind poking that sometime give her one for his old man maybe she owed him one part of his inheritance he wished he had his pipes with him give them a fucking tune give them a real tune bastards what were they at what were they fucking at down there hands in dads coffin sick bastards standing by the lychgate with its cover like a picturepostcard well and a seat inside went in sat down out of the blue light in here anyroad right under the church but the sloping roof blocked it out dic nestled in the darkness feeling warm closed his eyes and felt the bench slipping under him like dropping down a platform lift into a velvet mineshaft dic threw his arms out stretched his head back accepting he was pissed but feeling relaxed for the first time since he didnt know he giggled there was a hand on his thigh it moved delicately up to his groin like a big spider feels good dic said pretty sure hed fallen asleep on the bench lips on the side of his neck and his nostrils were full of the most glorious soiled and sexy perfume the hand sliding his zip down easing something out he pulled in his arms hands coming together around the back of a head and soft hair hair so long that it was brushing the tip of his cock moira dic whispered from dawbers secret book of bridelow unpublished although there has never been any excavation it is presumed that the low or mound on which st brides church is built was a barrow or tumulus dating back to the bronze age and may later have been a place of celtic worship similar mounds have been found to enclose chambers which some believe to have been used not so much for burial purposes as for solitary meditation or initiation into the religious mysteries some tribes of american indians i believe fashioned underground chambers for similar purposes there has been speculation mat the small celllike room reached by a narrow stairway from the vestry occupies the space of this original chamber the official explanation for this room is that it was constructed as overnight accommodation for itinerant priests who came to preach at st brides and were unable because of adverse weather to return that night across the moss however there are few recorded instances of this being necessary and when in a visiting bishop announced his intention of spending the night there to be closer to god he eventually had to be found a room at the man ith moss after being discovered naked and distressed in the snowcovered churchyard at three oclock in the morning chapter iii the moss was like a warm bath and he left it with regret knowing all the same that he must that there was nothing to be accomplished by wallowing so he strode out and when he glanced behind him what he saw took away his breath for it was no longer a black and steaming peat bog but a vast sparkling lake an ecstatic expanse of blue and silver reaching serenely to the far hills its water was alive quiescent undemanding but surely a radiant living element no not merely living undying immortal and the water was a womanly element light and placid recumbent generous if she had a mind to be if you pleased her he felt tufts of grass crisp and warm under his wet feet and was embarrassed thinking he would surely besmirch it with filthy peat deposits from his bogsoiled body but when he looked down at himself he saw that his skin was fresh and clean not from the bog but from the lake of course and he was naked of course quite natural he stood at the tip of a peninsula he thought at first it was a green island because the mound which rose soft as a breast from its centre was concealing the hills behind but as he ascended the rise new slopes purpled into being and when he reached the summit the surrounding hills were an amphitheatre in the middle of which he stood naked appraised shade the light shade it damn you what with your hand jacket anything you poor little sod youre really frightened arent you no its just dont be easier than you expected surely wasnt it soils lovely and loose obviously replaced in haste everyone shitscared like you look why dont you get the ropes we can have this one out and into the range rover before we start on the other ok all right now got a firm grip have we you let it go and i promise you cock well put you down there and bury you alive yes all right yes ive got it ok now pull ohagh where shall i just at the side will do right fine now lets have the lid off what have a little look at him eh hah see that not even nailed down they really were in a panic werent they to think i was once almost in awe of these little people how wrong can oh now oh look at that oh go on have a better look get closer put your fingers on his eyes i cant ioh god how did i get into this no good asking him my friend youve cut all your ties in that direction ernie dawber was soon aware of something happening in the churchyard a light sleeper ernie eyes and ears of the community twentyfour hours a day the headmasters house overlooked the playground on the one side and from the landing window there was no hidingplace at all for a pair of eightyearolds sharing a packet of embassy gold ernies replacement as head teacher came from glossop and had not been prepared for such dedication in fact hed said more or less that if they made him live over the shop as it were they could stick the job he was a good lad though generally speaking so the education authority had accepted his terms allowed him to commute from across the moss and sold the house to ernie who couldnt have had a better retirement present he was always on hand and more than pleased to take groups of kids on nature rambles or do a spot of relief teaching in the classroom in an emergency and he could still watch the generations pass by through the landing window the schoolyard while through the back bedroom window on the other side of the house the graveyard full circle so all it took was the clink of a shovel and ernie dawber was awake and up at the window they were being very quiet about it as usual he couldnt see much just shadows crisscrossing through torchbeams up at the top end where the churchyard met the moor where matt castle had finally been planted and the earth piled at last on top of him ernie watched for just over half an hour and then the torches were extinguished by eck he said halfadmiringly hopping over the freezing oilcloth back to bed thas got a nerve ma he remembered joel beard what really could he have done if their stupid curate was determined to spend the night in the little cellar under the church how could he stop him maybe the rectors fears were unfounded maybe his experience and that of the bishop all those years ago well they were sensitive men not all clergymen were by any means and this lad certainly looked well not dense exactly that wasnt quite the word dogmatic set in his beliefs blind to other realities but at least tucked up in his cell he wouldnt be aware of what was happening up in the churchyard and that was a small mercy ernie thought getting into bed he felt a trifle dizzy but decided to disregard it he thought he recognized the naked woman on the hill there was something about her the way she looked at him the way she smiled the way she seemed to say are you man enough he stood above her confident of his superior strength his muscular limbs his halo of golden curls their power over women oh he was man enough for had he not fallen into the black peat and emerged from clear water as clear as the sea of galilee and had not the peat been washed from him now the female lay in the grass before him close to the summit of the green mound her legs spread he knew what she wanted her wild hair was spread over the grass hair which reflected the light changing like water hair which rippled like the lake he smiled his most superior smile i know what you want disdainful and if there was no disdain in the reaction of his body this was another demonstration of his power proof that he certainly was man enough but gently she shook her head first you must recognize me for what i am and then worship me the lights were tiny some distance away a short procession of them torches lanterns tilley lamps whatever people were carrying them and they were carrying them openly across sam daviss farmland and sam gripped the bedroom window ledge bloody mad now right no im gettin shotgun sam no shurrup he rasped youll wake kids im not letting you he heard her pull the cord to the light over the bed look sam turned his back on the window esther all whitefaced and rabbiteyed sitting up in bed blankets clutched to her chin theyre makin a bloody fool o me yon buggers he whispered dont even hide their bloody

land aye he said i know you dont mean the bloody land rubbish as it is im scared she said all smallvoiced its an awful thing tbe scared of your own home sam he snatched a glance out of the window the lights had stopped moving theyd be clustered up there in a circle of their own around what was left of the stone circle sam shurrup arent you scared really arent y listen what it does to me it just

no bloody way you go out there esther said and im ringing the police and ill ring the bloody vicarage too and tell um where you are i dont care what time of night it is oh shit sam advanced on the bed spreading his arms wide cold by now in just his underpants bloody hell woman what do you suggest i do then come back to bed esther said trying her best to smile through the nerves that were making her face twitch please sam dont look just thank god theyre up there and were down here please well talk about it tomorrow well thanks very much for your contribution sam sighed well talk about it tomorrow fucking nora he took one last glance the circle of light did not move ive had it wi talk sam said first you must recognize me for what i am recognize you he laughed for what you are he stood above her looking down on her the elongated shadow of his penis divided her lolling breasts like a sword i know what you are he said i know precisely what you are he saw a blue calm in her eyes that was as deep as the lake and for a moment it threatened to dilute his resolve then he heard himself say how dare you she lay below him placid compliant youre just a whore how dare you seek my recognition youre just a a cunt in an act of explicit contempt he lowered himself upon her and her hands moved to her crotch thumbs extended to open herself for him hes quite small isnt he i somehow expected him to be bigger more impressive quite manageable really oh my earth to earth peat to peat it would have been rather less easy to get at him in a week or two watch it now be careful of his eyes mustnt be blase im not its just im actually not as worried about you know touching this one it doesnt seem like a real body somehow more like a fossil lay him gently youve done well so far im proud of you but lay him gently hes ours now and remember never forget i know ill feel so much better afterwards shut up join hands in a circle around the body it was not a rape she was a whore and a heathen whore when he plunged into her he found her as moist as black peat and packed just as tightly around him light into darkness not to be enjoyed it was necessary whore he gasped with every breath whore whore whore lifting his head to seek out her eyes looking for a reaction searching for some pain in them whore saw her mouth stretched into a static rictus of agony wh tighter still around him and dry ore dry as stone no too late he thrust again into stone the pain was blinding immeasurable the pain was a whitehot wire driven through the tip of his penis and up through his pelvis into his spine his back arched his breath set solid in his throat and he found her eyes little grey pebbles and her mouth stretched and twisted not in agony but ancient derision a forever grin in the midst of death we are alive wearealive go on two handfuls stop not on his faceshine the light there behold i shew you a mystery we shall not sleep but we shall be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye at the last trump for the trumpet shall sound and the dead shall be raised and the dead shall be raised ok now fill in the grave quickly quickly quickly dust to dust to ashes to earth dust to ashes to earth now stamp it down all of you together and the dead shall be raised corrupted and we shall be changed we shall be changed douse the lights douse them chapter iv another hard white day and she didnt like the look of it it had no expression there was a threat here most folk wouldnt see not good weather not bad weather nowt wrong with bad weather you couldnt very well live in bridelow if you couldnt put up wi spot or two of rain every other day or a bit of wind to make your fire smoke and your eyes water or blizzards or thunder and lightning but this was no weather just cold air at night and a threat everything black or white black night with white stars white day with black trees black moor black moss cold and still round about this time of year there should be some colour and movement in the sky even if it was only clouds in dirty shades of yellow chasing each other round the chimney pots shades there should be shades ma wagstaff stood in her back kitchen hands on woollenskirted hips she was vexed with them cats too shed washed their bowl first thing and doled out a helping of the very latest variety of gourmet cat food willied brought her from that posh supermarket in buxton shrimp and mussel in oyster sauce and the fickle little devils had sat there and stared at it then stared at her well thats it ma growled if you want owt else you can gerout and hunt for it but the cats didnt want to go out they mooched around all moody ignoring each other looking up at ma as if was her fault bad air as ma unbent the cat food can in one hand a fork in the other her back suddenly creaked and then she couldnt stand up for the pain that started sawing down her spine like a bread knife then the front door went half a knock somebody who couldnt reach the knocker as ma hobbled through the living room the white light seemed to be laughing heartlessly at her filling the front window and slashing at the jars and bottles the door was jammed and opened with a shudder that continued all the way up mas spine to the base of her skull now then ma said on the doorstep was her youngest grandson with that big dog of his always went for a walk together before school benjie said nowt grinned up at her gaptoothed something clutched in one hand well well said ma smiling through the agony whered you find that chief found it said benjie proudly jus this mornin up by tmoor ta ma took the bottle and fetched the child in for a chocolate biscuit from the tin the bottle wasnt broken but the cork was half out and the glass was misted the bit of red thread that hung outside for the spirit to grasp

ruefully wondering if shed be able to stand up straight before teatime thats what i keep askin meself fine lot of use she was she ought to be out there finding out exactly what they were up against even if it killed her before two thousand and more years of care and watchfulness came to ruin oh she could feel it mornings like this everything still and exposed she looked down at young benjie chomping on his chocolate biscuit it will kill me she thought im old and feeble and me backs giving way ive let things slip all these years pottered about the place curing sick babbies and cows and not seeing the danger and now theres only me with the strength inside but im too old and buggered to go out and find um itll come to me though one night ma thought with uncustomary dread when its good and ready but will i be joel beard awoke screaming and sweating coughing and choking on the paraffin air he sat on the edge of the camp bed with the duvet wrapped around him moaning and rocking backwards and forwards in the darkness for several minutes before his fingers were sufficiently steady to find the candle on its tray and the matches he lit the candle and almost immediately it went out he lit it again and it flared briefly with a curious shower of sparks before the wick snapped carrying the flame to the metal tray where it lasted just long enough for joel to grab his cross his clothes and his boots and make it to the door on his way through the tunnel to the steps he knocked over the paraffin heater with a clatter and crash of tin and glass and didnt stop to set it upright at the top of the steps he was almost dazzled by the white dawn awakening the kneeling saints and prophets the angelic hosts and the jewelcoloured christs in the windows deliverance he dressed in the vestry where he found a mildewed cassock and put that on over his vest and underpants but he did not feel fully dressed until his cross was heavy against his chest the air in the nave felt halffrozen he could smell upon it the bitter stench of autumn raw decay but no paraffin and the cold was negligible compared with the atmosphere in last nights dungeon he unbolted the church door stood at the entrance to the porch breathing in the early morning air seven oclockish couldnt be certain left his watch in the dungeon wasnt going back for it and he did not look up as he said youre finished you bitch and then went quickly down between the graves to the gardeners shed up against the perimeter wall the shed was locked a padlock through the hasp he had no key he shook the door irritably and glared in through the sheds cobwebbed window he could see what he wanted a gleaming edge of the aluminium windowcleaning ladder on its side stretching the length of the shed he also saw in the window the reflection of a face that was not his own joel was jolted and for a moment could not turn round the face was a womans it had long dark hair steady hard eyes and black whores lips the lips were stretched in a tight shining grin which the eyes did not reflect cold derision remembered pain speared joels spine as he turned halfhypnotized by the horror of it turning as he would turn to stare full into the face of the gorgon knowing it would turn him into stone like the angels frozen to the graves he saw the still figure of a woman on the other side of the church wall the village street below her her back was turned to him slowly she began to walk away and because the wall blocked her lower half she seemed at first to be floating her long black hair swayed as she moved and in the hair he saw a single thin icewhite strand joel felt a twisted revulsion twisted because there was inside it a slender wafer of cold desire like the seam of white in the hair of the woman who walked away he watched her not aware of breathing she was wearing something long and black he watched her until she was no more and not once did she turn round joel sobbed once felt the savage strength of rage he bunched a fist and drove it through the shed window ernie dawber had heard about the bogman on the morning news so he wasnt exactly surprised when round about he heard a car pulling up irritably in the schoolhouse drive hadnt given much thought to how he was going to handle this one too busy making notes for a daft book that would never get published the page he was writing an introduction began bridelow might be said to operate on two levels it has what you might call an underlife sometimes discernible at dusk when alls still and the beacon is about to light up he looked up from the paper and the room went rapidly in and out of focus and swayed bugger not again damn he pushed his chair back swept all the papers from his desk into an open boxfile and went to let the man in a raw day dr hall a word mr dawber if youre not too busy innuendo it was going to be all innuendo this time he could tell im a retired man im not supposed to be busy come in sit down cup of tea or something a little no thank you nothing oh very starchy its interesting that you dont seem at all surprised to see me mr dawber im not daft ernie said thats how i got to be a headmaster underneath halls open barbour jacket was a suit and tie an official visit well at least shut the door ernie said its the worst kind of cold out there the archaeologist consented at last to come into the study ernie closed the boxfile and placed it carefully under his chair look around he said you dont need a search warrant i havent said anything to the police hall said not yet im giving you a chance either to bring it back or tell me where it is ernie didnt insult him by asking what he was talking about dr hall this is a very serious allegation dont worry i know enough about the libel laws not to make it in public thats why ive come to see you if we can keep it between the two of us and the er if it comes back undamaged thatll probably be as far as it goes now look you dont really trunk oh i dont for one minute think you were personally involved besides you were at the funeral i saw you wouldnt have been time so im just the mastermind the brains behind the heist that it something like that all right said ernie dawber ill be straight with you yes i did come to you on behalf of the village and urge you to put that thing back in the bog that was me and i meant it but and ill say this very slowly dr hall i do not know who stole the bogman from the field centre ill say it to you and ill say it again before a court of law and he truly didnt know nobody ever knew these things apart from those concerned had his suspicions who wouldnt have but nothing black and white ma wagstaff was right there was never anything in black and white in bridelow which was how it was that balance and harmony could always be gently adjusted like the tone and contrast on a television set shades of things oh aye naturally he had his suspicions nowt wrong with suspicions suspicions never hanged anyone roger hall had changed colour his beardrimmed lips gone tight and white dr halls tonal balance was way out its here dawber i know its here youre welcome to search i dont mean this house i mean in bridelow somebody has it dont be daft thats if it hasnt already been put back in the bog and if it has well find it i can have two coach loads of students down here before lunch well comb that moss inch by inch and when we find the area thats been disturbed i wish i could help you dr hall no you dont ernie dawber nodded that was true enough no he didnt joel lugged the ladder through the graveyard and into the church dragging it along the nave putting it up finally against a stone pillar next to the rood screen he shook the ladder to steady it then began with a cold determination to climb in his anklelength black cassock this was not easy close to the top he hung on with one aching bruised and bloodstained hand the big gilded cross swinging out from his chest while he rummaged under the cassock for his swiss army knife using his teeth to extract its longest sharpest blade the topmost branches of the autumn cross were almost in his face it was about six feet long crudely woven of oak and ash with mashed up inside for stuffing thousands of dead leaves and twigs part of a birds nest shrivelled berries and hard brown acorns disgusting thing fashioned in public hed been told on the field behind the man ith moss with great ceremony and the children gathering foliage for its innards oh lord joel roared into the rafters help me rid your house for ever of this primeval slime he leaned out from the ladder one foot hanging in space tiny shards of glass still gleaming amidst the stillbright blood on the hand gripping a rung his fatigue fell away he felt fit and supple and had the intoxicating sensation of grace in his movements deliverance orange balingtwine bound the frame of the cross to a rusted hook sunk into a crossbeam he swung his knifearm in a great arc and slashed it through filth he screamed the autumn cross fell at once and joel watched it tumble and was glad a beginning the sapless weightless artefact fell with a dry slithering hiss like a serpent in the grass he thought satisfaction setting firm in the muscles of his stomach his head filled with a wild light he did recoil slightly throwing the lightweight ladder into a tilt as the socalled cross burst apart on the stone flags fragments of leaves and powdery dust rising all around until the belly of the church was filled up with a dry and brackishsmelling sepia mist joel coughed and watched the filthy pagan detritus as it settled a bigger job than usual for the women on the mothers union cleaning rota he hoped the foul bitches would choke on the dust chapter v with a nod to our sheila moira slipped quietly into st brides church just before am to be alone to confront the spirit of bridelow maybe find something of matt castle here special place matt had said a long long time ago on a snowy night in manchester its got part of what ive been trying to find in the music thats where it is where it was all along cathy gruber had persuaded her to stay the night in the guest room shed slept surprisingly well no awful dreams of matt in his coffin and awoken with all too rare these days with a sense of direction she would discover matt trace the source of the inspiration which was the essence of the village bridelow last refuge of the english celts a more pure undiluted strain than youll find anywhere in western europe she stopped in the church porch who said that who said that the american said it macbeth macbeth yeah quoting somebody some writer addressing the celtic conference stanhope stansfield some name like that from the north of england connections she felt like a small token in a boardgame manoeuvred into place by the deft fingers of some huge invisible cunning player and she knew that if she was to tap into matts imagination she was also going to have to confront his demons as she walked cautious now out of the porch into the body of the church something whooshed down the aisle and collided with her at chestlevel hey moira grinned in some relief holding at arms length a small boy gerroff kid was in tears you ok you hurt yourself the child tore himself away from her wailing and hurled himself through the door an arm flung across his eyes like hed been blown back by an explosion moiras grin faded something had changed the place looked bare and draughty even through the stainedglass windows the light seemed ashen and austere on a table near the entrance next to the piles of hymn books al the lanterns and candlesticks had been carelessly stacked as if for spring cleaning one of the slender coloured candles had rolled off the edge and lay snapped in two on the stone flags she picked up the two halves held one in each hand a moment then placed them on the table and wandered up the central aisle of a church which seemed so much bigger than yesterday at matts funeral so much less intimate less friendly something was crunched under her shoe she looked down and saw curledup leaves and broken twigs shrivelled berries and bracken and acorns and all the rustic rubble of autumn scattered everywhere like a savage wind had blown through the nave in the night looking up she saw what was missing what the mess around her ankles was somebody smashed the autumn cross no accident this moira said aloud shivered and wrapped her arms around her sweatered breasts it was still cold but after what shed learned last night shed left the black cloak at the rectory this was obviously not a place in need of a spare witchy woman she stood by the rood screen and looked back down the naked church she looked down at the mess all around her on the stone floor and the scratched and homely pews saw for a moment a scattering of bleached white skulls but she knew almost at once that it wasnt the same or at least that she was not to blame this time this was a rape she experienced a moment of awe i walked into someone elses conflict but it was not quite someone elses conflict there was a connection and the connection was matt castle last night shed said to cathy just as abrupt as the girl had been why did they open matts coffin what was in that bottle ah cathys eyes cast down over the steaming mug of chocolate you saw that dont get me wrong im not normally an intrusive person but matt meant a lot to me dic obviously thinks so oh you heard that i wondered if maybe you had one of those pianos that plays itself those pianos dont play bum notes cathy looked offended no i didnt have my ear to the door dic and i went for a drink the other night i drove he got a bit pissed he said his father the boys way off there was nothing more complicated than friendship between me and matt he never he never touched me moira stumbled and fell into a dusty pew sat staring into the vaulted ceiling where the cross had been but seeing nothing he never touched me that was true never a friendly kiss never a celebratory hug when a gig had gone down well or the first album had gone into profit never touched me sexually he never came near but he looked often shed feel his moody gaze and turn and catch his eyes and shed smile and he wouldnt and then hed look away she bent painfully over the prayerbook shelf clink from outside the sound of a chisel on stone i was thinking if wed slept together just once to kind of get it over bring down that final barrier no wouldnt have got anything over would have started something bad you knew that really just as you really knew what was going on inside matt castle and chose to ignore it just a crush hell get over it he didnt he couldnt he made you leave the band before the clinking from outside was coming harder maybe they were demolishing the joint entirely too choked to think about this any more stomach tight and painful moira stood up made her way slowly down the aisle to the doors but when she grasped the ringhandles the doors wouldnt open owd on youll have me off sound of someone creaking his way down a wooden ladder up against the doors she leaned her back against the doors took a few deep breaths and called out after a few seconds ok aye the porch doors opened and there was a smallish guy in his sixties flat cap and a boilersuit big soft moustache like a hearth brush sorry lass dint know there were anybody in theer he held a mallet and a masonry chisel there were chips of grey stone and crumbly old concrete around the foot of the stepladder storm damage moira said you what you repairing storm damage summat like that but then looking up at the wall above the porch she saw where the chippings had come from from the stones supporting the exhibitionist the sheelagh na gig our sheila youre taking her down aye he didnt sound too happy why he gave her a level look alfred beckett verger organist dogsbody who are you she grinned fuck it she was here now in the open uncloaked moira moira cairns used to work with matt castle the name felt different a different darker matt castle matt castle eh said alfred beckett right course he seemed to relax a little how do he stuck out a stubby hand and moira took it stone dust and all he had a firm grip it pulled her back into what people took for the real world so mr beckett she glanced up at the ancient woman squashed into a stone plaque fingers up her fanny a few strokes of the chisel away from a serious loss of status aye mr beckett said like a ragged sigh and moira saw he wasnt far from tears he said he was following instructions didnt want to do it hated doing it but he wasnt in an arguing position was he vergers being a good way down the ecclesiastical hierarchy and if i dont do it he said hell do it hisself and he wont be as careful as me mr beard moira said aye hell smash her like like the autumn cross ill see shes all right alfred beckett said ill keep her safe until such time as he sighed fished a packet of arrowmint chewing gum out of the top pocket of his boilersuit moira accepted a segment and they stood together chewing silently for a minute or so then mr beckett said aye its a bugger a scrap of cement fell from our sheila moira said but isnt she excuse me im no an expert in these matters isnt she protected in some way no lass shes i meant isnt she a feature of a listed historic building oh said alfred beckett aye happen but mr beard reckons shes not safe and could fall on somebodys head same as shes not done for the past umpteen centuries aye moira said eventually its a bugger all right now then why arent you at school benjie threw his arms around mas waist and burrowed his head into her pinny he started to sob she pulled him into the kitchen shut the back door now lad whats matter tell owd ma ma wagstaff sat her grandson on the kitchen stool spine still giving her gyp she reached up for a bottle of her special licorice toffees never been known not to work when it was out ma said the bugger benjie with his swollen eyes and his wet cheeks bulging with toffee the unfeeling spiteful bugger ma said biggest thing that had ever happened to benjie ernest dawber putting him in charge of the autumn cross a whole afternoon inspecting the twigs and branches acorns bits of old birds nests and stuff the other kids had brought saying what was to go into the cross what was right for it what wasnt good enough standing proudly top of the aisle the day alfred beckett had come with his ladder and the cross all trimmed and finished had been hoisted into place and everybody cheering biggest thing ever happened to the lad leave him to me ma said ill sort that bugger out meself just you see if i dont benjie stared at her wildly shaking his head couldnt speak for the toffee gone far enough ma said got to be told a few things for his own good if nowt else no benjie blurted dont go near it ma ma was taken aback eh s getting bigger ma every day s getting bigger what is lad the dragon the little lad started crying again scrambling down from the stool clutching ma round the waist again wailing youve not to youve not to eh mystified but determined to get to the bottom of this ma detached his small hands from her pinny squatted down with much pain to his height now then summat youve not told me eh come on she held his shoulders straightening him up feeding him some strength not that shed much to spare these days come on tell owd ma all about it he stared into her face eyes all stretched with terror bigger ma s bigger he might look big to you benjie ma said gently but hes only a man no s a dragon mr beard s a dragon so the new curate was in combat with the forces of evil as represented by our sheila and the autumn cross and whatever willies ma was doing inside matt castles coffin last night early this morning as the dregs of hot chocolate were rinsed from the mugs shed at last got it out of cathy what it was all about or as much of it as cathy knew so the coffins on the ground and the lights been lowered and the lid is open i didnt see it and your friend old mrs wagstaff has her hands inside and im wondering if maybe the old biddy has a passing interest in necrophilia thats a terrible thing to say i know so tell me whats going on huh it was i think it was a witch bottle i thought you said she wasny a witch its just a term its a very old precautionary thing to trap an evil spirit matts spirit no i dont know maybe if there was one around in there with him in the coffin i dont know its no good asking me youre going to have to talk to ma if shell talk to you and lottie today it was important to talk to lottie because lottie was not part of this place had not been returning like matt to the bosom of a tradition which was older than christianity a more pure undiluted strain than youll find anywhere in western europe moira had come through the lychgate was standing at the top of the cobbled street the cottages like boulders either side under a blank unyielding sky a sky as hard as a whitewashed wall this writer stanton stanhope hes on his feet and is he mad this guys face is this guys face is this guys face is white chapter vi the plump woman in the village post office looked like a chief girl guide whatever they called them now also although she wore no wedding ring she struck moira as a member of the mothers union i wonder um could you help me im looking for willie wagstaff shed forgotten to ask cathy where willie lived and cathy had set out to drive fifteen miles to the hospital to visit her dad willie have you been to his house moira smiled well no that s sorry luv im not very bright this morning the postmistress rolled her eyes go across street turn left and after about thirty yards youll come to an entry go in there and youll see a cottage either side of you and its the one on the left moira bought ten postage stamps and two packets of arrowmint chewing gum in case she ran into alfred beckett again there was no answer at willies house a narrow little cottage backing on to other peoples yards moira wondered if he lived alone she squashed her nose to the front window there was a bowl of flowers in it with ferns a womans touch females had always been drawn to willie born to be mothered in the old days it used to be said that otherwise worldly mature ladies would turn to blancmange when little mr wagstaff smiled coyly and let them put him to bed moira was not that mature yet the reason she needed willie was to talk about matt and also to meet his mother she came out of the entry unsure what to do next there was no one else in the place she knew except at the bottom of the village street moira found herself facing the pub the last building apart from a couple of wooden sheds before the street widened into the causeway across the peatbog this was the difficult one against the white morning the pub looked hulking and sinister like a gaol or a workhouse stonework so murky that in places it might have been stained by the peat outside on the forecourt a man in an apron was cleaning windows a redhaired woman appeared in the porch handed the man a steaming mug of tea or coffee stopped and stared across the forecourt waited in the doorway watching moira you ready for this hen theyre not ancient monuments these circles ancient possibly monuments well hardly joel beard kicked at a stubby stone no signs pointing um out anyroad said sam davis not even proper tracks thats because theyre not in the care of any government or local authority department unlike say stonehenge where you have highsecurity fences and tunnelaccess which is why these places are so open to abuse the reverend beard in his dark green goretex jacket and his hiking boots striding through the waisthigh bracken action priest sam thought cynically lights you say although they were less than a hundred yards from the first circle it wasnt even visible yet this was the most direct route from sams farmhouse but he reckoned that mob last night must have come in from behind over the hill cocky bastards sam said breathing harder keeping pace with difficulty due to shorter legs bold as brass if wife hadnt kicked up idve been up theer last night sam bunched his fingers into fists id give um bloody devil worship i know how you feel the minister said but you did the right thing in coming to me this is my job this is what im trained for sam davis watched the big blond man flexing his lips baring his teeth steaming at the mouth in the cold air it was all esthers fault this making him drag the church into it look mr beard joel aye thing is i dont want to turn this into some big bloody crusade all i want is these buggers off me property know what i mean the reverend beard stopped in his tracks sam have you ever had footandmouth disease on your land god be all i need swine fever fowl pest sheep scab give us a chance ive only been farming two year the point im making joel beard said patiently moving on as the bracken came to an end and the ground levelled out is that when a farmers land is infected by a contagious disease its not simply a question of getting rid of the afflicted livestock there are wellestablished procedures for the purpose of shall we say decontamination aye but lets get down to some basic facts joel who exactly are these fellers your mate the vicar now he reckoned its just kids right could probably tuck a couple under each arm kids said joel beard for kicks sam said like drink drugs shoplifting kicks hans gruber said that sam shrugged summat like that right this is it i beg your pardon the main circle youre in tmiddle of it joel told you it werent much around them sunk into tufts of dry yellow grace were these seven small stones stained with mosses and lichens none more than a couple of feet high in a circle about fifteen feet in diameter sam found it hard to credit them being here in this formation for about four thousand years dont know much about these things meself sam said some folk reckon they was primitive astronomical observatories you could stand in um and see where tsun were risin or summat personally he didnt give a shit by his left boot were two flat stone slabs pushed together the ground had clearly been disturbed there were blackened twigs and ashes on the slabs but what thats got to do wi bloody sacrifices is sam the reverend joel beard shot up like a charge of electricity had gone through him and then yelling get back seized sam davis by the shoulders and shoved him out of the circle what the sam struggled out of joels grip stumbled back into the bracken joel was still in the circle swaying like a drunk swallowing big hollow breaths through his mouth his body bent into a fighting stance hands clawed eyes blinking sam davis stared at him he was going to kill esther for landing him with this big tosser theres evil here joel said stupid sod looked ready for war all that bothered sam was how close the battlefield was to his kids down below half a mile away his farmhouse and its barns and buildings looked rickety and pathetic like matchstick models he could kick over with the tip of his welly joel beard had closed his eyes the sun shuffling about behind weak clouds had actually given him a faint halo for getting on ten minutes joel didnt move except at one point to lift up both hands on outstretched arms as if he was waiting sam thought for somebody to pass him a sack of coal then he spoke i give you notice satan joel said in a powerful voice to depart from this place hed unzipped his jacket to reveal a metal cross you could have used to shoe a horse then he raised his hands so that they were parallel to his body and began to push at the air like this mime artist sam had once seen on telly pretending he was behind a pane of plate glass bloody nora sam muttered to himself crouching down among the ferns unnerved by the whole thing but determined not to show it even to himself got a right fuckin nutter ere shaw horridge watched them through binoculars from the range rover it was parked on a moorland plateau about half a mile away the binoculars being shaws own were very good ones the range rover belonged to a squat greasy little man who lived in sheffield and was unemployed he called himself asmodeus or something stupid out of the omen theyre moving on i think shaw said asmodeus had a beard so sparse you could count the hairs he had the seat pushed back and his feet on the dashboard good he said as if he didnt really care shaw lowered his binoculars what would you do if they came up here with spades and things id be very annoyed indeed asmodeus said in his flat drawly voice id be absolutely furious so would therese wouldnt you darling therese was stretched out on the rear seat painting her fingernails black shaw scowled he didnt like asmodeus calling her darling he didnt at all like asmodeus who was unemployed and yet could afford a newish range rover and yet he was still in awe of him having seen him by night this little slob with putrid breath and a potbelly not yet out of his twenties and yet able to change things and he was excited but what would you do asmodeus grinned at him through the open window youre a little devil arent you shaw what would you do shaw said because therese was there kill them whaaay you hear that therese shaw thinks hed kill them therese lifted newly painted nails into the light well she said we might need the priest but i must say that little farmers beginning to get on my nerves shaw tensed tell you what shaw asmodeus said well give you an easier one how about that they sat at one end of a refectory table near an agatype kitchen stove their reflections warped in the shiny sides of its hotplate covers moira kind of jumpy inside but lottie pouring tea with steady hands businesslike in control and this was less than twentyfour hours after the setto at matts graveside lottie laying into willie and willies ma and the other crones while the minister was helped away into the vibrating night over fifteen years since theyd been face to face lotties hair was shorter her face was harder more closedup out on the forecourt it had been hello moira very nonchalant like their meetings were still everyday events no fuss no tears no embrace no surprise no doubt dic had told her moira was around she sipped her tea and said lottie was looking well in spite of you too lottie said flatvoiced i always knew youd become beautiful when you got past thirty listen thanks for what for not coming when he wrote to you i was tied up sure lottie said but thanks anyway things were complicated enough better this way this way his music lottie said his project his beloved bogman now stolen i believe lottie maybe im stupid but im not with you it was on the radio this morning thieves broke into the university field centre out near congleton and lifted the man in the moss i find it quite amusing but matt wouldve been devastated like somebody kidnapping his father somebody stole the bogman just like that lottie almost smiled hardly matters now though does it listen ill take you down in a bit show you his music room he left some stuff for you for me tapes listen im not pushing moira but i think you should do it do it she was starting to feel very foolish get together with willie and eric and dic and record his bogman music i dont know if its any good or not i havent heard much of it but matt saw it as his personal summit his big thing lifes work moira looked hard at her this austere handsome woman fiftyodd years old looked for the old indomitable spark in the eyes truth was she was still indomitable but the eyes the eyes had died a little this was not the old lottie this was a sad and bitter woman playing the part of the old lottie then well do it moira said whatever its like good thank you but dont decide yet you see ill be frank if youd come when he wrote to you well he was quite ill by then into the final furlong he wasnt fit to record not properly and then there was the other problem and dont say what other problem lets not either of us insult the others intelligence ok moira leaned back and slowly sipped her tea they sat there in silence two women with little in common except perceived obligations to one man mammy how was he when he died can you tell me that this was the woman who could tell her but lottie had never had much patience with religion of any sort organized or well as disorganized as whatever it was ma wagstaff was trying to do last night with her patent witch bottle lottie she said im sorry i didnt know well maybe i knew inside of me but i was young too young to understand it and nothing happened lottie i swear it lottie shrugged better maybe if it had better for me i can tell you if hed gone off with you but after sticking with it through all kinds of well i wasnt prepared to have him spending his last days ignoring me eaten up with old lust and regrets so im glad you couldnt come lottie took her teacup to the sink dropped it into a plastic bowl the sink was a big oldfashioned porcelain thing pipes exposed underneath it with bits of rag tied around them no what lotties used to moira thought lottie is stainlesssteel and wastedisposal youve had problems then christ everything i say to this woman is just so fucking facile lottie turned on the hot tap held both hands under the frenzied gush until the steam rose and her wrists turned lobsterred you could say that eventually turning off the water wiping her hands on a blue teatowel she said i was married for twentyeight years to a man who collected obsessions the pennine pipes the mysteries of bridelow the bogman moira said nothing she was feeling faint her breath locked in her throat she was getting a strong sense of matts presence in the room and you lottie said in the lofty rudimentary kitchen moira heard a roaring in her head saw a flashing image of matt in his coffin white tshirt white quilted coffinlining before it was washed away by the black tide carrying images of a stone toad dancing lights the steam from writhing intestines liberated on to a flat stone on me night he died moira swallowed tea but the tea wasnt so hot any more and she was swallowing bile on the night he died lottie said he sexually assaulted a nurse in the hospital im not hearing this she started to look wildly around the kitchen high ceiling with pipes along it whitewashed walls with crumbling plaster showing through in places stoneflagged floor like the church of st bride two narrow windows letting in light so white it was like a sheet taped across the glass and this awful sense of matt the nurse had long dark hair lottie said almost wistfully he addressed her as moira the silence was waxen she felt scourged lottie said i wanted you to know all this matt was dodging about under the table behind the pipes vibrant shockhaired matt reduced to a pale fidgeting thing hunched in corners flitting agitated from one to another giving off fear hurt confusion before you made a firm decision about the music you see im being open about it no secrets any more moira looked up into the furthest comer near the back door and a cobweb inexplicably detached itself from the junction of two pipes and hung there impaled by a shaft of white light heavy with glittering flies corpses come with me lottie rolled down the sleeves of her cardigan and strode across the kitchen to the back door with a long gaolers key part six mothers from dawbers secret book of bridelow unpublished the most widespread and powerful celtic tribe in northern britain were the brigantes whose territory known as brigantia included much of yorkshire lancashire and southern scotland and had its southern boundary in the lower pennines the mother goddess of the brigantes was brigid and it is believed that many churches dedicated to st bride were formerly sites of pagan celtic worship chapter i the bloody media over twenty cars parked outside the field centre and men and women pacing the concrete forecourt most of them turning round when roger halls car pulled in where the hell was he supposed to park with all these bastards clogging the place three cameramen all swinging round shooting his volvo estate as it manoeuvred about seeking space as if he might have the bogman himself laid out in the back no no im sorry ramming his way through jabbing hands holding pocket tape recorders dr hall have you any idea yet dr hall do you know when can you just tell us dr hall how no he held up both hands therell be an official press statement later bastards leeches one of the double doors opened a few inches and he was hauled in chrissie and the other woman alice got the door closed and bolted behind him inspector gary ashton was sitting on rogers desk any luck sir blank wall roger was brushing at his jacket as if the reporters had left bits of themselves on him however i must say ashton said it seemed a bit of a long shot to me that a bunch of villagers from bridelow would go to all this trouble he smiled hesitantly look ive had a thought i hardly like to suggest this sir but i dont suppose theres a university rag week in the offing dont be ridiculous roger said well i dont honestly think ashton said tautly that its any more ridiculous than your idea about superstitious villagers which sounds a bit like one those old ealing comedies if i may say so sir roger said i think you should listen to me without prejudice i think i know how theyve done it liz horridge stood frozen with terror at the edge of the pavement she was sweating hard there seemed to be a film of it over her eyes and a blur on the stone buildings around her turning the cottages into squat muscular beasts and the lychgate into a predatory bird its wings spread as if it were about to hop and scuttle down the street and overwhelm her pinning her down and piercing her breast with its cold stone beak she was leaning panting against the back of a van parked on the corner where the main street joined the old brewery road oh and by the way mother the chairmans hoping to drop by tonight who the chairman gannons been planning to come for ages apparently but you know appointments commitments will he come here well receive him in the main office show him around the brewery then yes i expect ill bring him back for a drink a proper drink ha go get out got to shed thought that when she got so far the fear would evaporate in the remembered warmth of the village but the village was cold and empty and a blind like a black eyelid was down in the window of gus bibbys general stores which always kept long hours and would always be lit by paraffin lamps on gloomy days but it was saturday afternoon gus bibby did not close on a saturday afternoon saturday had always been firewood day and thered be sacks of kindling outside always always on a saturday liz felt panic gushing into her breast maybe it wasnt saturday maybe it wasnt afternoon maybe it was early morning maybe the whole place had closed down been evacuated and nobody had told her maybe the brewery itself had been shut down for weeks and the village had been abandoned chairmans hoping to drop by tonight no how could i not have seen it how could i have sat there pretending to examine gannons proposals and estimates and balance sheets and not see his name because it wasnt there i swear liz horridge pumped panicky breath into the still white air not far now not fifty yards she could take it step by step not looking at houses not looking at windows someones door creaked opened tara then luv look after yourself you what liz scuttled back into a short alleyway squeezed herself into the wall mustnt let anyone see her yeh dont worry our kennethll be up to see to it in tmorning yeh you too tara door closing footsteps liz clung to the wall she wore an old waxed jacket and a headscarf over the matted moorgrass that used to be chestnut curls she emerged from the entry into the empty street like a rabbit from a hole wanting needing aching to sit again at ma wagstaffs fireside a warm dry old hand on her sweating brow if he comes scream dont matter what time cant turn back now if you turn back now youll surely die believe this how are you pop he was out of bed that was a good sign wasnt it cathy found him wearing a dull and worthy hospital dressing gown sitting at his own bedside in a shabby vinylbacked hospital chair he was in the bottom corner of a ward full of old men bit tired he said theyve had me walking about physiotherapy got to keep moving when youve had a coronary cathy clutched at the bed rails they never told me that had to drag it out of them myself soon as they get you in hospital youre officially labelled moron his features subsided into that lugubrious boxerdog expression whats it mean pop coronary thrombosis means a clot in the coronary artery means i was lucky not to christen matt castles grave for him means i have to rest putting on a pompous doctorvoice we have to get ourselves together as they say mr gruber tell me about joel please tell me he didnt sleep under the church cathy said carefully that she hadnt seen him today not a word of what shed heard about him rampaging around the place in his postfuneral fury ripping down anything that hinted of paganism just that she hadnt actually seen him and that she didnt know where hed slept storm gathering inside that chap hans said hurricane joel wanted to make sure he was somewhere else when it blew dont you think about it pop get some rest let them do their tests try and endure the hospital food and dont refuse the sleeping pill at night cathy i know but its not your problem hanss head lolled back into the hard vinyl chair i keep the peace its taken me years to strike the right balance dont worry theyll sort him out ma and the union theyll deal with him but they sorted you out didnt they cathy smiled for him trying to look more optimistic than she felt hans said bleakly cathy simon fleming came to see me they want me to go to the poplars for a few weeks convalescence where the churchs nursing home in shropshire ghastly dump full of playedout parsons mumbling in the shrubbery nobody gets out alive cathy felt desperately sorry for him but couldnt help thinking it might be the best answer for a while let the mothers handle it whatever there was to be handled he didnt seem to have heard about the disappearance of the bog body and she didnt tell him he had enough to worry about already look all you need roger hall said is an exhumation order thats not a problem is it backs to the doors the press people assembled on the other side chrissie and alice looked at each other roger playing detective didnt suit him chrissie wondered idly if inspector garry ashton was married or attached she thought this business was rather showing up roger for what he was pompous arrogant humourless despite the nice crinkles around his eyes ashton said a little impatiently you were convinced earlier that the body was hidden in bridelow still am roger said smugly go on ashton said no longer at all polite lets hear it chrissie liked his style also the set of his mouth and the way his hair was razorcut at the sides roger said i attended a funeral in bridelow yesterday matt castle the folk musician so i understand ashton said mr castle a friend of yours was he with a tingle of excitement chrissie suddenly knew what ashton was wondering did roger himself have anything to do with the theft the police must have spoken to the british museum by now learned all about rogers battle to bring the bogman back up north and why was he so keen to keep pointing the police in other directions gosh chrissie thought and rogers obsessive attitude the bogman intruding everywhere and when the bogman was in a state of er emasculation roger himself was unable to function and complaining of clamminess and peat in the bed and everything and then suddenly roger could with a vengeance and the bog body had acquired what appeared to be an appendage of its own chrissie felt a kind of hysteria welling up stop it im going bloody bonkers or somebody is suddenly she didnt want him touching her again castle roger said not what youd call a friend no but he was always very interested in the bog body as many people were kept ringing me up asking what wed learned so far and actually turned up here twice wanting to see the body which of course was not available for public viewing although i did allow it the second time whyd you do that because because he was with someone i judged to be more reliable he didnt elaborate ashton didnt push the point either chrissie thought of the writer stanage so anyway roger said it was castles funeral yesterday and i thought i ought to show my face i only went to the church service left before they actually put him into the ground but i very much wish id stayed with it now seen him buried i might be thick said ashton but im not following this all right lets approach it from another angle weve all been assuming that the breakin took place last night right have we dr hall ashton look can we stop this fencing i know youre an experienced policeman and all that but ive been doing my job for over twentyfive years too angrily roger drew his chair from under the desk scraping the inspectors legs look because of the funeral and one or two other things i didnt come in here at all yesterday and you only found out about the burglary before me because our normally lazy caretaker just happened to try the doors for a change correct ashton came slowly down from the desk stood looking down at roger interested but if hed bothered roger said to check the doors the night before and if he says he did hes probably lying i know that man hed probably have found them forced then my strong suspicion is the breakin happened the previous night and that the body wasnt here at all yesterday and what does that say to you what it says to me inspector and i might have to spend a bit of time explaining this to you but what it says to me is that my bog body is buried in st brides churchyard i see ashton said thoughtfully or do i the funeral roger raised his hands the grave its a double grave what im saying is dig up castles coffin youll find our body lying underneath trust me and there it was oh lord oh mother ma wagstaff could see the thing from the top of the churchyard the highest vantagepoint in bridelow it hadnt been there a week ago had it there was a time when she knew this moss better than anybody couldnt claim that now getting owd now letting it slide ma leaned on her stick and wondered if she could make it all the way out there without some help shed have been able to yesterday but yesterday was a long time ago yesterday though she hadnt realised it at the time she still had some strength shed thought that sooner or later it would come to her but instead it had sent her an invitation brought by a little lad who for no good reason had decided the dragon because the dragon was there was responsible for breaking up his autumn cross and in a way he was right right about that thing out there ma could feel its black challenge and looking across at it she could tell why he thought it was a dragon those little knobbly horns you could make out even from this distance only an owd dead tree as sometimes came out of the moss when there was storms and flooding bog oak except there hadnt been a storm so it was black growth like the blackness that grew in matt castle and she had to gauge its strength ma hesitated not one to hesitate wasnt ma but if she went out there shed be on her own as well as which somebody needed her help this side of the moss shed known this for days well aye people was always needing owd mas help but this was somebody as didnt want to ask hadnt for some reason been able to overcome a barrier and until this barrier was overcome there was nowt ma could do now she could feel the struggle going on and when the plea came she must be there to answer it pulled this way and that between the flames and the torrent oh lord oh mother which way do i turn let it slide for so long losing me grip ill walk out then walk out there following the river staying near the water gathering what power i can happen i can deal wi this quick nip it in tbud stare it down give it the hard eye reshape it turn it back into wood and only wood leaning heavily on her stick ma wagstaff followed the old steep narrow path down from the churchyard meeting the thin river at the bottom of the hill where it went under the path a little bridge no more than a culvert and there was a scrubby field to cross before they reached the moss i can make it i can can i lean on you mother the last few steps were going to be the hardest by far from two yards away ma wagstaffs front door looked like the golden gates of heaven unattainable liz horridge was aware of her mouth being wide open gulping a fish out of water metabolism malfunctioning agoraphobia say it agor a phobia commonenough condition always so hard to imagine until it came upon you in panicattacks convulsions stomachcramps yet this more like claustrophobia not enough air lungs bursting shed tried to do it in planned stages like an invalid learning to walk again the first stage had been waiting for the postman whom she hadnt seen facetoface for months when the van drew up shed be watching from the diningroom window and if the postman was carrying a parcel she would run to open the front door leaving it slightly ajar and by the time he was tossing the parcel on to the mat liz had taken cover yesterday almost sick with apprehension shed waited for the post van down by the main gate rehearsing how shed handle it just taking a walk normally go the other way yes it is cold bright though bright yes thank you good morning when the postman didnt come she was so relieved it had been foolish trembling shed returned to the house to make shaws breakfast but shaw had gone to be with her whenever he went out without saying even vaguely where he was going it would always be to be with her therese beaufort had come into the house only once had been polite but dismissive had shown a vague interest in everything except liz at whom shed looked once with a chilly smile before reappraising the drawing room as if sizing it up for new furniture now she merely parked outside and waited expressionless not looking at the house yes ive seen your mother now thank you and now there was look liz why dont we meet up and chairmans hoping to drop by tonight fear despair shed walked away down the drive down the road into terror knowing she could not go home tonight to the village to ma wagstaff to plead for sanctuary liz horridge fell down tearing her skirt feeling the small jutting stones of ma wagstaffs front path gashing her knees she began to crawl towards the door feeling the emanations of the stone buildings heavy on her back as if they would push her into the little pointed stones beneath her the whitened donkeystoned step gleamed like an altar liz rose on her knees tried to reach the knocker but managed only the letterbox which snapped at her fingers like a gintrap mrs wagstaff she managed to wail please mrs wagstaff let me in but nobody came to the door im sorry i couldnt stop it it wasnt my fault about the brewery please hes coming back please let me in and then the stones came down on her the weight of the village descended on her shoulders taking all the breath from her and she couldnt even scream chapter ii didnt know i was coming back to die i mean thats what people do isnt it and animals go back home to die but i wouldnt have if id known last thing they need heres any deadwood the voice frail but determined going to get this out if it killed him yeah just as well really that i didnt know all moira could see through the windscreen was the moss the vast peatbog unrolling into the mist like the rotting lino in the hall of her old college lodgings in manchester half a life away the bmw was parked in the spot at the edge of the causeway where yesterday shed sat and listened to the pipes on cassette now it was another cassette the one from the brown envelope inscribed moira funny thing lass this is the first time ive found it easy to talk to you maybe cause youre not there in the flesh heh did you realise that how hard it was for me lottie knew no hiding it from a woman like lottie shit i dont care who knows im dead now matt laughed the cawing shed followed lottie into a yard untidy with beer kegs and crates beyond it was a solid stone building the size of a twocar garage it looked as old as the pub had probably once been stables or a barn matts music room lottie said shed been almost scared to peer over lotties shoulder into the dimness into the barnlike space with highlevel slit windows and huge rough beams dust floating like the beginnings of snow lottie silent moira hesitant may i lottie nodding moira slipping past her expecting echoes but there was carpet and rugs underfoot and more carpet on the walls to flatten the acoustics she saw a table papers and stuff strewn across it shelves supported by cementspattered bricks held books vinyl records and tapes heavy old speaker cabinets squatted like tombstones and there was a big teac reeltoreel tape machine matts scarred martin guitar lay supine on an old settee with its stuffing thrusting out between the cushions hanging over the sides of a stool was something which from across the room resembled a torn and gutted old black umbrella shed walked hesitantly over and stared down at the pennine pipes in pity and horror like you might contemplate a bird with smashed wings it was as if hed simply tossed the pipes on the stool and walked out forever and the bag had maybe throbbed and pulsed a little letting out the last of matts breath and then the pipes had died moiras throat was very dry she was thinking about matts obsessions the pennine pipes the bogman and cant help your feelings can you like if youre a married man with a kid and you meet somebody and you and she takes over your life and you cant stop thinking about her but thats not a sin is it not if you dont anyway i never realised that you i never realised matts voice all around her now car stereos so damned intimate lottie had turned away calling back over her shoulder ill be in the kitchen stay as long as you like lock up behind you and bring me the key the parcels on the table and was gone leaving moira alone in the barn that was like a chapel with the pipes left to die on the table a thick brown envelope which had once held a junkmail catalogue for honda cars it had been resealed with sellotape and moira was scrawled across it inside the tapes four of them three of music and this one a basf chrome marked personal not a sin if you dont do owt about it but i always found it hard to talk to you i mean just to talk to you till it came time to tell you to get out of the band that was easy that was a fucking pushover kid im sorry the way that worked out with the philosophers stone sounded like a big opportunity like for me too chance to make the supreme sacrifice but we cant tell can we we never can bloody tell till its too late rambling hed have been on some kind of medication wouldnt he drugs but when they told me id had me chips i did regret it regretted it like hell i thought most likely youd just have told me to piss off but there might have been a anyway id have given anything for just one just one time with you just one anything christ moira stared out of the side window to where half a tree had erupted from the moss like bone burst through skin when you wrote back and you said you were too busy i was shattered id convinced meself youd come i just wanted to at least see you just one more time moira bit down on her lower lip id tried to write a song couldnt do it it was just a tune without words nothing best bloody tune i ever wrote which isnt saying much play it for you in a minute wont be much good the playing what dyou expect be the last tune i ever play gonna play it over and over again until i get it perfect and then im gonna get lottie to take me out and ill play it to the fucking moss the man in the moss thats what its about the man in the moss thatll be me too want to die with this tune in me head this tune and you she felt a chill like a low whistling wind its called lament for the man i want the moss to take it a gift lament for the bridelow bogman soon as i read about him months ago before it came out about the sacrifice element i was inspired by him direct link with me own past the celts the english celts like hed come out the moss to make a statement about the english celts and i was the only one could interpret it sounds arrogant eh but i believe it like this is what me whole lifes been leading up to man starting to cough on and on distorting because the recording level couldnt handle it the carspeakers rattling like there was phlegm inside fuck it man said if i go back and scrub this ill forget everything i was gonna say sorry can you handle it see this was before theyd completed the tests on the bogman before it was known about the sacrifice even then i was pretty much obsessed i didnt care if we spent every penny wed got lottie shes a bloody good woman moira i never deserved lottie she went along with it although she loved that chintzy house in wilmslow and she hated the man ith moss soon as she clapped eyes on it but she went along with it sometimes i think did she know did she know before me that i was gonna snuff it she says not i believe her across the moss she could see the pub a huge grey boathouse on the edge of a dark sea its backyard a landing stage and then soon after we came the report came out about the bogman about what he was a sacrifice to appease the gods so theyd keep the enemy at bay make this community inviolate protect these celts these refugees from the fertile flat lands the cheshire plain lancashire the welsh border invaders snatching their land romans saxons and this the old high place above the moss maybe it was a lake then bridelow mans voice cracked bridelow the last refuge i cried when i heard i cried he went willingly almost definitely that was what happened almost certain he was the son of the chief everything to live for had to be see to make a worthwhile sacrifice voice gone to a whisper gave himself up willingly thats the point can you grasp that moira he let them take him on the moss and they smashed his head strangled him and cut his throat and he knew he fucking knew what was gonna happen she stared through the windscreen at the moss thick low cloud lay tight to the peat like a bandage on its putrefying suppurating skin hard to credit isnt it i mean when you really think about it when you try and picture it he let the buggers do it to him young guy fit full of life and energy and he gives himself up in the most complete sense can you understand that maybe it affects me more because ive got no youth no energy and what life theres left is dribbling away by the minute but by god i realised i wanted a bit of that she thought about the bogman the sacrifice she thought about matt inspired always so contagious matts inspiration she thought i cant bear this can you get what im saying like they took him away these fucking scientists with never a second thought about what he meant to bridelow and what bridelow whatever it was called back then meant to him so i wanted i wanted in to be part of that to go in the moss too lottie tell you that lottie thinks its shit but it isnt no moira whispered it wouldnt be want some of me out there with him hes my hero that lad im fiftyseven and im on me last legs nay not even that any more me legs wont carry me and ive found a fucking hero at last matt starting to laugh and the laughter going into a choke and the choking turning to weeping me and ma wagstaff met one day one stormy day ma understands the old bitch willies ma you know says to me we can help you help him but you must purify yourself out on the moss the dead tree like bone was moving it had a tangle of thin branches as if it were still alive and the branches were waving whipping against the tree she says you have to purify yourself the tree was a bad tree was about to take its place alongside the encroaching stone toad on the moor the eruption of guts on an ancient roughhewn altar bad things forcing themselves into bridelow and then you came home moiras eyes widened i used to think she was a substitute me own creation like creating you out of her you know what i mean an obsession imposes itself on whats available but i shouldve known shouldve known you wouldnt leave me to die alone her senses froze so as i go into the final round as they say im drawing strength from the both of you the bogman and you moira tomorrows sunday ill be going out on the moss to play last time i reckon ill need lottie and dic poor lad to get me there ill send them away then therell just be the three of us no she said what is this me and thee and him matt chuckled eerily hard rain hit the moss no she said thanks lass thanks for getting me through this thanks for your spirit and your body it was your body wasnt it she wrapped her arms around herself began to shake feeling soiled ma said youve got to purify yourself but theres a kind of purity in intensity of feeling isnt that right pure black light ill play now matt said and she heard him lifting his pipes onto his knees if youre listening to this it means youre here in bridelow so find willie find eric and then find me youll do that wont you find me the old familiar routine the wheeze the treble notes i wont be far away matt said and the lament began at first hoarse and fragmented but resolving into a thing of piercing beauty and an awful knowing anticipation out on the black moss as if hit by a fierce wind the dead tree lashed impatiently at its bones with its own sinuous branches like cords of gut moira thought theres no wind no wind to speak of the moss in the rain was dull and opaque like a blotter she didnt want to look at the tree but a movement drew her eyes human movement an old woman was hobbling across the peat she had a stick a stringy shawl wrapped around her head she was approaching the tree very deliberately slow but surefooted she seemed to be wearing ordinary shoes not boots or wellingtons she knew the peat where to walk cathy had said youre going to have to talk to ma if shell talk to you it is her isnt it the dead tree was about a hundred yards away the old woman was walking around it now poking experimentally at it with her stick and then backing away like a terrier a wavy branch lashed out wrapped itself around the walking stick moira drew breath another movement quick and sudden and the shawl was torn away from the womans shoulders thrown triumphantly up into the air on the tip of a wavy branch like a captured enemy flag holy christ moira was out of the car leaving the drivers door hanging open stepping down from the causeway hurrying into the moss where the sinewy whipcord branches of the old dead tree were writhing and striking individually at the old woman ma wagstaff pulsing like vipers moira running across the peat through the rain desperately trying to keep her footsteps light because she didnt know this moss there was no wind the rain fell vertically behind her matts music on the car stereo was a dwindling whine mrs wagstaff she screamed mrs wagstaff get away from it in the distance over the far hills behind the rain the sun was a bulge in the white bandage of cloud and the flailing tree of guts and bones was rearing up against it she was maybe sixty yards away now and the tree was tossing its head it had a head and its eyes were white they were only holes in the wood letting the sky through but they burned white and it was not a case of what you knew it to be old and twisted wood shrivelled windblasted contorted by nature into demonic nightmare shapes this was the old mistake to waste time and energy rationalizing the irrational mrs wagstaff back off what was the old biddy doing here alone where were the mothers union when she needed backup mrs wag dont dont look moira stumbled dont look at it she said miserably for bridelow moss had got her left foot swallowed it whole closing around her ankle like soft lips white eyes black horned head white eyes its thee it were always thee ma wagstaff growled stabbed at it one last time with her stick the wood was so hard that the metal tip of the stick snapped off mrs wag womans voice screaming in the distance nowt to do wi her mas job this she moved away like an old experienced cat bait it come on show thiself a dry old rasp not much to it but she got it out whats a tree whats a bit of owd wood to me eh show thi face cause this is as near as thas ever going to get to bridlo we seen to thee once and itll stick backing away from it and all the muck coming off it in clouds she was going to need some help some strength itd take everything shed got and some more and not long not long for it allhallows soon the dark curtain thin as muslin dead tree out of the moss and made to live made to thresh its boughs him taunt it youre nowt words coming out like a sick cough youre nowt jack you never was owt dead tree writhing and slashing itself at her and though she was well out of range by now she felt every poisoned sting get it mad ah ma turned away not worth it not worth me time bit of owd wood but her heart was slamming and rocking like an old washingmachine black horned head white eyes dead but living in him white eyes chapter iii there was a metallic snapping sound followed by a faint and desperate wailing mrs wagstaff the voice was familiar but it didnt matter this was a funny little house bottles and jars on every ledge even on the edges of individual stairs sprigs of this and that hung from the ceilings and circulated musty smells the witchs den he sat in silence at the top of the stairs unperturbed please mrs wagstaff let me in then silence he smiled as children theyd clustered by the church gate and whispered about the witchs house not daring to go too close see the curtain move its her shes coming it hadnt changed only his perspective on it the wicked witch perspectives changed now it was cool to be wow wicked but ma wagstaff wasnt authentically wicked never had been ma wagstaff lets face it wasnt quite up to it and wouldnt be now shed conned them generations of them now im really rather wicked he thought if theres such a thing or at least im getting there he didnt move his body didnt move the reason it didnt move was he didnt want it to suddenly he had true selfcontrol and this amazed him or rather it amazed him to reflect on what a bag of dancing neuroses he used to be so untogether he couldnt even regulate the sounds coming out of his own mouth shershershaw ster sterstuttering shaw amusing to imagine what hed have been like if hed been given this present task even a month ago when he was still unconvinced when he used to say its you know bad though isnt it it might be fun it might be exhilarating but its bad essentially surely and were you good before shaw were you good when you were stuttering and dithering and letting your father dominate you is that your idea of what it means to be good in which case how does it feel to be bad terminology nowadays bad was cool like wicked a step in the right direction hows it feel feels good alive quite simply that i didnt know before what being alive meant i said to her havent you got to be dead to be undead and she said what makes you think you arent so i was dead and now im alive i know that when i pull the handles turn the switches press the buttons something will happen theyd told him hed seen nothing yet theyd told him there would be a sign and now there was and what a sign once again shaw couldnt resist it he allowed his right hand to remove its leather glove and brush its palm across the top of his head a delicious prickly sensation the first time hed felt it hed wanted to leap up and squeal with joy but there was no need to do this any more he could experience that joy deep inside himself knowing how much more powerful and satisfying the feeling was if he didnt allow it to expend itself through his body dissipating as he hopped about like a little kid punching the air so shaw horridges body remained seated quietly at the top of the stairs in ma wagstaffs house while shaw horridges spirit was in a state of supreme exultation his hair was growing again he was alive and he had made it happen just a fuzz at first then thicker than a fuzz almost a stubble hed heard of men going to ma wagstaff for her patent hairrestorer some claiming it worked a bit but not actually sure whether it had or not not like this no doubt about this where thered been no hair now there was hair all around him were ma wagstaffs bottles full of maybes maybe if the winds in the right direction if the moon s full if theres an r in the month quite sad really a grey little world of hopes and dreams no certainties hairloss was natural in some people his mother said but it had taken therese to prove to him that you didnt have to accept something just because it was supposed to be natural acceptance was just spiritual sloth being truly alive was about changing things changing people situations changing your state of mind changing the natural being alive was about breaking rules with impunity mens rules also the rules men claimed theyd had from god natural rules this was what shed taught him learn how to break the rules for no other reason than to break them and you become free thou shalt not kill but why we kill animals to eat we kill people with abandon in wartime we kill for the queen we kill for the oil industry where does the taboo begin he stretched his arms and yawned settled down to wait aware of his breathing fully relaxed how could bad be bad when it felt as good as this eventually kneeling messily in the rain moira pulled her shoe out of the bog the shoe was full of water she shook it out and put it on by this time the old woman had hobbled to the edge of the moss where there was a gate leading into a field beyond which was the pub and further up the hill on which the church sat the dead tree was still it looked hard heavy almost stonelike too dense to move in the wind even if thered been one but it moved for me she thought limping back to the car and it moved for ma wagstaff such things were almost invariably subjective like how often did two people see a ghost at the same time together ghosts and related phenomena were onetoone you saw it and the person with you said hey whats wrong with you what are you staring at whyve you gone so pale but the tree moved for ma wagstaff and it moved no question for me she climbed behind the wheel and sank into the seat drained the cassette tape had ended she slipped it out of the tape deck ma wagstaff understands the old bitch she says to me we can help you help him but you must purify yourself i am not getting this matt what were you into you and ma and then whuppp moira reeled back in the seat as something hit the windscreen like a big bird covering the sky darkening the car it flapped there wriggling and beating at the glass holy jesus it was snagged in the wipers but it wasnt a bird only a dark blue woolly shawl ma wagstaffs shawl snatched from her by the deviltree blown across the moss blown hard directly at the car like it had been aimed moira began to pant closing her eyes tight squeezing on the steeringwheel until it creaked when she opened her eyes the shawl had gone and the vertical rain showed there was still no wind ok move she switched on the engine slammed the bmw into reverse pulled it back on to the causeway pointing it at bridelow the sky was dirty now but she wondered if it would still be white through the eyeholes in the thing of wood on the moss ma said youve got to purify yourself but theres a kind of purity in intensity of feeling isnt that right pure black light right get off my back matt youre sicker than i figured just get the hell off my back moira drove erratically into the village street bumping carelessly along the cobbles and over the kerb nobody about no sign of the old woman the cottages featureless and damp in a huddle pure black light black light white light what is this shit wished she could call the duchess but the duchess wasnt on the phone the duchess wants to contact anybody she doesnt mess with phones moira sat in her car at the bottom of the street ploughing her fingers through her hair exposed and scared oh yes and maybe halfderanged couldnt properly express in words what she was doing here like shed been sucked into the smoking fireplace that night at the earls castle and gone up the chimney and been spit out cold on bridelow moss now everything was pointing at ma wagstaff but ma wagstaff had run away she left the car in the street squelched to the post office peat water oozing out of her shoes willies not in she panted at the big flowery girlguide postmistress where would i find his mothers place weak as a kitten ma felt weak as a dayold kitten its eyes not open yet weak and blind help me mother ma followed the river back gratefully leaving the moss behind there was a crack starting in her walking stick where the black tree had snapped off the metal tip soon the stick wouldnt support even a skinny spidery owd thing like her and what would she do then it got her to the churchyard god alone knew how and she propped her old bones up against a stone cross looked up at the church porch and it hit her like an elbow in the ribs desecrated oh mother oh jesus over the door a mess of crumbling old cement that vandal the goths and the vandals and the angles and the saxons and the romans and the socalled christians all them raiders bridelow had fought off over the long centuries and the buggers still at the door with their battleaxes inside the church little benjies autumn cross all smashed and the vile thing growing out on the moss waving mas lost shawl like a banner and the seeping sickness within that saps health and takes jobs and now our sheila smitten from the wall thrown away like she was nowt more than one of them dirty magazines grinding in pain the few teeth shed got left to grind ma wagstaff staggered through the graveyard up to the top end where matt castle lay the earth still loose on him covered by wreaths already bashed about by the weather petals everywhere the witch bottle lay in her coat pocket dead moving like an owd crab on a pebble beach ma staggered by matts grave without stopping the earth loose around him not buried proper not yet still air holes in the soil poor bugger might as well be lying stretched out on top the rain had stopped but the clouds still bulged like cheeks full of spit ma stumbled out on to the moor through the top wicket gate between two tattered gorse bushes this was not the real moor this was still bridelow until you got over the rocks below the rocks was the holy well the spring water bubbling bright as lemonade into a naturalhewn stone dish the well they dressed with flowers in the springtime to honour the mother and the water long before she reached it ma could hear it singing a rock leaned over the spring like a mantelpiece over a hearth above it the moor which was not bridelow carved out of the stone a hollow with a little shelf on the shelf a statue mother ma said breathlessly the statue was plaster she wore a robe once painted blue now chipped and faded her eyes were uplifted to the sky beyond the shelf of rock her hands turned palmsdown to bless the water trickling from the rock below her feet oh mother ma dropped her stick shed made it home she fell down upon the stone the edge of her woollen skirt in the rock pool began to cry words bubbling out of her like the water from the rock ive brought thee nowt forgive me mother not properly dressed dint know i were coming see she sat up crossed herself closed her eyes all hot and teary cupped her hands into the pool and brought the spring water to her eyes and when they were touched by the water she saw at last through her eyelids a warm bright light ma lifted up her hands into the light and felt them touch the hem of the radiant blue robe of the mother the material that felt like a fine and silken rain she began to mumble the old words dropping into place words in english words in latin words in an oldenday language that was neither welsh nor gaelic words from the bible powerwords and humblewords words to soak up the light and bring it into her blood come into me mother give me light and give me strength give me the holy power to face your enemies and to withstand the shadow fell across her the bright blue gauze dissolved mas eyes opened into pain the curate stood astride the sacred spring big and stupid as a victorian stone angel so he said this is it is it he kicked a pebble into the pool its even more tawdry than i expected mrs wagstaff go away ma said quietly looking down into the pool whats it to do wi you go on clear off come back when youre older whats it to do with me he stood there thick and hard as granite you can ask that where did you get this with a hand like a spade he plucked the mother from her stone hollow one of these catholic shops i suppose or was it taken from a church hmm he held the statue at arms length hardly a work of art mrs wagstaff but hardly deserving of this kind of grubby sacrilege ma was on her feet blinding pain ripping through every sinew you put that back thats sacred that is put it back now call yourself a minister of god youre nobbut a thick bloody vandal wi no more brains than pig shit and you he said tucking the statue under an arm are a poor misguided old woman who ought to be in a home where you can be watched over until you die ma wagstaff tried to stand with dignity and couldnt joel beard bent his face to hers youre a throwback mrs wagstaff a remnant my inclination as a human being is to feel very sorry for you but my faith wont allow me to do that behind his eyes she saw a cold furnace thou shall not suffer a witch to live the statue hefted above his head like a club ma cowered oh nohe lowered the statue to chestheight dont cringe mrs wagstaff i wouldnt hurt you physically im a servant of god i merely remind you of the strong line the bible takes on your particular subspecies joel beard put out a contemptuous hand to help her up she looked at the hand and its fingers became a bundle of twisted twigs bound roughly together and the connection was made with the thing on the moss two opposing terminals the black and the white each as dangerous and ma stranded in the middle gerraway from me she shrank back feeling that if she touched his hand shed be burned alive what are you afraid of mrs wagstaff im afraid of denseness ma said kind of denseness as rips down a childs offering smashes it on tstones but but it was evil he said reasonably cant you people see that primitive heathen it insulted the true cross ma wagstaff shook her head tha knows nowt thas big and arrogant and tha knows nowt thas not fit to wipe hans grubers arse joel beard raised the statue of the mother far above his head his face severe his golden curls tight as stone all right then he said be your own salvation mrs wagstaff ma grabbed at the air eyes widening in horror she began to whimper joel smashed the mother down on the rocks and her head broke easily pounded to plasterdust ma wagstaff cried out the cry of the defeated the gutted the desolate gone nowt left gone to dust beating the plaster from his hands and his green hiking jacket joel beard strode away across the dirtyyellow moorgrass fragments floated in the centre of the pool until the springwater scattered them making widening circles over the mothers headless body chapter iv for the first time since all this had begun lotties hands began to shake and she pressed them against the hotplate covers on the stove so that if the policeman had seen it hed think she was simply cold it was a bad dream switching from one dreadful scene to another until the horror was spinning about her like a merrygoround of black shadowhorses and whichever way she turned she turned back to the policeman who to give him his due looked no happier about this than she felt steadying her voice she said you want to dig up my husband this is inspector ashton exhaled down his nose look mrs castle if there was any other way its not your husband we want to see its the grave itself normally when theres an exhumation its at the request of the coroner or the pathologist to enable further examination of a body in this case we dont want to touch the body we dont even want to open the coffin we have reason to believe the grave may have been disturbed before your husband was placed in it lottie felt her face muscles harden somebody had blown the gaff on ma wagstaff and her primitive rituals what the hell else had the old hag been up to we have reason to believe ashton said that certain stolen goods may be buried under your husbands coffin what goods id rather not say at the present time if you dont mind mrs castle hed turned up in the bar not long after moira had left on his own asked if he might have a word all very casual and quiet lottie thought about the implications and what if i dont agree ashton sighed itll just take longer for us to get permission but youll get it anyway ashton nodded between ourselves what does bother me is that the person whos made the allegations about this these stolen goods has intimated that if we dont act on them quickly hell make his suspicions known to the media i dont need to tell you what that would mean in terms of invasion of privacy unwarranted intrusion into private grief reporters all over your doorstep you mean said lottie that this mans blackmailing you ashton laughed if only it was that simple no i was inclined to disbelieve him at first but now i agree theres a strong basis for thinking somethings down there as shouldnt be and if we can handle our excavations discreetly after dark inconspicuous no fuss have you spoken to anyone else in the village no i certainly havent and id be very much obliged if youd keep this to yourself as well last thing we want is an audience course well have to consult with the minister but that wont be a problem i shouldnt think lottie thought about ma wagstaff and her old ways and matts apparent acceptance of all this rubbish as part of the unique west pennine tradition acknowledging with much bitterness matts part in all this right she pulled her hands from the stove go ahead ill sign whatever you want me to sign thank you said ashton thats very brave of you mrs castle just one thing hed begun to button his trenchcoat he stopped keep me out of it inspector i dont want to know when you do it or what you find i dont want to be involved ashton nodded relieved and youll keep this to yourself oh i wouldnt want to alert anybody who might have cause to be embarrassed lottie smiled grimly i certainly wouldnt suspicious at first as he came up the street fingers going on his thighs nose twitching as if he had whiskers then he saw who it was and she watched the sun come up in his cheeks and knew it was all right moira more than ten years dissolved in the pennine air willie hey i was looking for you the whole morning i were down me workshop doin a bit o bodgin an fettlin he stepped back put his hands on her shoulders like a dog on its hind legs eee lass i cant tell you youre looking bloody grand she thought he was going to lick her ears but he backed off and they stood a couple of yards apart inspecting each other he hadnt changed at all small and wiry brown hair down to his quick eyes she didnt know what to say so damn much to talk about and none of it superficial it started to rain again once it starts willie said twitching his nose at the sky it gets to be a bloody habit in bridlo he smiled got time for a cup o tea lass did he think she was just passing through jesus willie moira said feeling close to collapse ive got time for a whole damn pot she would come in by the back door same way hed come in it hadnt been locked didnt even have a lock on it he remembered how as a child hed been dared to go in by other kids into the witchs den hed refused he was afraid this time last year hed still have been afraid even a couple of months ago he would he came to his feet and stood behind the balustrade his hands around the wooden ball on top it was sticky with layers of brown varnish the paper on the walls was brown with age thered been flowers on it they just looked like grease patches now late afternoon dimness enclosing him hed have been afraid of that too once afraid to open the bedroom doors afraid of the ghosts within afraid of what he might disturb afraid not to be afraid but not any more willie had a teapot in a woollen teacosy made out of an outsize bobble hat you make it yourself i have a friend willie said looking embarrassed about

what about you oh you know livin alone as the song says is all ive ever done well your song sorry luv ive not been keeping track nana griffith found an echo sometimes other people take the songs right

oh aye i know that all right i he hesitated refilling her teacup how long you been here i were looking out for you at matts funeral i was being lowprofile moira said but i saw the business with the witch bottle if thats oh willie sat down and crossed his legs started up a staccato fingerrhythm on the side of a knee i dont know sometimes i think were living inside a bloody folk museum its no a museum moira said i just watched her out on the moss theres kind of a dead tree out there bog oak willie said thats what it is then whyre your fingers drumming up a storm shit willie said shit shit shit come on moira dragged herself out of the chair lets go and talk to her moiras left foot was feeling cold and wet she stamped it on the cobbles went out on the moss with no wellies stupid huh rainy afternoon in a small village nobody else about no distractions and they were both on edge the hush before the thunder its in the air a damp tension so quiet catch my death moira smiled feebly both of willies hands drumming it happened to willie through his fingers people said it was nerves but what were nerves for if not to respond to things you couldnt see hey come on moira said softly whats wrong here willie i dont know he sounded confused nowt i can put me finger on theyd hammered on mas door waited and waited all dark inside willie started blinking the only noise in the street was the rapid rhythmic chinking of his fingers on the coins in one hip pocket and something else maybe keys in the other it echoed from the cobbles and the stone walls of the cottages willies fingers knew something that willie didnt willie quick come on think where would she be where would she go if she was scared he looked swiftly from side to side up and down the street willie hands wet with the onceholy spring water white with powdered plaster wind blowing through her head mind acrackle with shredded leaves and lashing boughs no thoughts only shifting sensations everything shaken up like medicine gone sour in the bottle air full of evil sediment sky white trees black church tower black twisted legs and malformed feet crabbing it through the bracken and the headier broken owd woman going back to her useless bottles let me help you mrs wagstaff for gods sake long striding legs head in the clouds wanted to help for appearances sake wouldnt look good if he buggered off and owd ma fell and broke a leg gerroff me she shrieked youve got to turn away from all this make your peace with almighty god its not too late screeching through the gale in her brain what would you know its long too late wretched gargoyles screaming along with her from the churchs blackened walls at the churchyard gate relief for both of them him going one way to his church not looking back ma the other

the coins in his pocket chinked damply im saying nowt youve gorra talk to ma he heard her creaking into the hall below gerrout from under me feet bobbie the cat heard her feet on the bottom stairs and slid himself into a room which as hed ascertained earlier was a box room full of rubbish teachests heaps of old curtaining a treadle sewingmachine shrouded in dust took her a long time and a lot of laboured breathing to reach the top of the stairs heard her in the bathroom the dribble and the flush and the old metal cistern filling up behind her with a series of coughs and gasps he brought a hand to the crown of his head felt his emergent urgent bristles one last time for luck luck you made your own he put his glove back on for a moment a while back someone hammering on the front door had flung him back to that night last summer in the stolen car the police but then hed concentrated go away and the knocking had stopped flexing and clenching his powerful leathered hands he moved out onto the landing as the old woman sighed and braced herself to go downstairs not much left of her old bones in a frayed cardigan hair as dry and neglected as tufts of last summers sheep wool caught in a wire fence some witch he thought rising up behind her quite slowly although he knew hed made no sound she turned around and looked up at him at his fingers poised above her bony brittle shoulders then at his face and he looked at hers theyd always said in the village how fierce her eyes were how she could freeze you where you stood with those eyes turn you to stone pin you to the wall shaw horridge grinned come on then wanting her to do that to him focus her eyes like lasers wanting the challenge the friction wanting something he could smash like hurling someone elses saab turbo into a bus shelter wanted to do it and feel better but her eyes surprised him they were as soft and harmless as a puppys for a moment this froze him come on he said suddenly agitated come on witch she stared calmly at him heels on the very edge of the top stair wouldnt take much of a push that was no good he said wheres your magic eh wheres your fucking magic now she bit her worndown bottom lip but otherwise didnt move dont you know me she said do you not know me he shook his head youre going to die he said dont you realise that the withered old face crumpled into an apology for a smile im dead already lad ma wagstaff said voice trickling away like sand through an eggtimer dead already but its nowt tdo wi you youll be glad of that one day her ancient face was as blank as unmarked parchment as she threw up her arms hands wafting at the air her body seemed to rise up at him making him lurch back into the landing wall and then she flopped down the stairs with barely a bounce like an old discarded mop chapter v the gypsy guy with the beatup hat and the dobermans wasnt too sure about this still looked like hed prefer to feed the stranger to the dogs no macbeth said i dont even know her name had to be easier getting to meet with the goddamn queen all i know is she isnt called mrs cairns the guys heavy eyebrows came down suspicious who is it told you where to come uh moiras agent in glasgow listen im not with the police im not a reporter ok well you just stay here pal the gypsy guy said and to make sure macbeth didnt move from the gates of the caravan site he left the two dogs behind macbeth liked to think he was good with dogs but the dobermans declined to acknowledge this when he put out a friendly hand one growled and the other dribbled macbeth shrugged and waited the gypsy was gone several minutes but when he returned hed gotten himself a whole new attitude unbolting the gates holding them back for the visitor wid ye come this way sir well shit next thing hed be holding his hat to his chest and bowing even the dobermans had a deferential air macbeth grinned figured maybe the old lady had sussed him psychically checked out his emanations whatever in no time at all heres mungo macbeth of the manhattan macbeths sitting in a caravan like some overdecorated seaside themebar brass and china all over the walls ill leave ye then duchess thank you donald lifting a slender hand loaded up with gold bullion she was cleopatra aboard this huge goldbraided victorianlooking chaise longue she had on an anklelength robe edged with silver had startling hair as long as moiras only dazzling white well uh this was bizarre this was an essentially tricky situation awe was not called for and yet this place was already answering questions about moira that he hadnt even been able to frame she said call me duchess its a trifle cheap but one gets used to these indignities didnt look to be more than sixty younger by several centuries he thought than her eyes and youll come to the point mr macbeth life is short he blinked ok swallowed couldnt believe hed come here was doing this uh fact of the matter is i spent some time with your daughter couple nights ago really the duchess said dryly no hey nothing like see i this was his first meeting with moira all over again couldnt string the words together cant get her off of my mind he said and couldnt say any more you poor man the merest shade of a smile in the crease down one check how can i help acutely aware how embarrassingly novelettish all this was sounding how like some plastic character in one of his own crummy tv films he said solemnly see this never happened to me before the duchess had a very long neck very slowly she bent it towards him like a curious swan are you a wealthy man mr macbeth one day maybe he said so they tell me thinking if she asks me to cross her fucking palm with silver im out of here the feeling im getting from you those ancient ancient eyes connecting with his is that despite your name youve always been very much an american thats that the truth macbeth confirmed with a sigh all weve got to do now is convince my mom the duchess smiled at last i think i like you mr macbeth she said well have some tea later she picked up on the theme youre really not what you appear are you no the duchess shook her head tiny gold balls revolved in her earrings this worries you you feel youve been living a lie you feel that all your life youve tried to be what people expect you to be but different people want different things and you feel obliged perhaps to live up to their expectation of you you feel the duchess scrutinized him with renewed interest over her goldrimmed bone china teacup you feel you are in your present fortunate position because of who you are rather than what you can do macbeth said nothing he hadnt come here for this had he sorry to be so blunt the duchess said no problem macbeth said hollowly this is your job perhaps people think you can open doors do they just said macbeth now youve woken up and youre thinking am i to spend my life serving up the er goods as a form of restitution paying back even though i might be paying back to people who never gave me anything or do i go out on my own chance my arm there were subtle alterations in her voice macbeth felt goosebumps forming the duchess said is there something more out there than piling up money even if that moneys not all for me even if its helping the economy and therefore other people who might need the money more than me are there more things in heaven and earth than you get to read about in the new york times christ he was listening to himself by the time she sat back to sip more tea hed swear the duchess had developed a significantly deeper voice and an accent not unlike his own ah this is just a sophisticated act this is a classy stage routine no it isnt the duchess said crisply he almost dropped his cup what his hand shook no it isnt going to rain the duchess said sweetly although it was forecast but then forecasts are seldom reliable ive found he guessed shed never been to college he guessed she hadnt always talked so refined he guessed her lifestory would make more than one miniseries then he guessed hed better start keeping a tighter hold on his thoughts until he was someplace else im not a fortuneteller you know she said like some women would say what do you think i am a hooker i uh moira never said you were macbeth said uncomfortably i appear to be able to do it sometimes but i dont make a practice of it she poured herself more tea so why did i let you in here macbeth didnt know because im worried about the child she said thats why he said i can understand that can you im uh a celt he said and she started to laugh a sound like the little teaspoon tinkling on the bone china to be celtic she said is more an attitude than a racial thing like to be a gypsy is a way of life what about to be a psychic her face clouded that she said is a cross to bear shell tell you that herself its to accept theres a huge part of your life that will never be your own its to realise there are always going to be obligations to fulfil directions you have to go in even though you cant always see the sense of it thats what shes doing right now the duchess nodded she has things to work out oh i dont know what shes doing and i wouldnt dream of interfering shes a mature person but i am her mother and mothers are always inclined to worry so im told i was only thinking coincidence just before you arrived i wish she had someone who cared for her but shes a loner we all are i fear we learn our lesson we dont like other people to get hurt youre saying you think moira needs someone with her the duchess shrugged her elegant shoulders someone looking out for her maybe when donald told me there was a man at the gate asking after moira i wondered if perhaps then she gave him the kind of smile that was like a consolatory pat on the arm i dont really feel youre the one mr macbeth sometimes when he interviewed wouldbe filmdirectors there was one nice brighteyed kid he could tell was never going to make it and trying to let the kid down easy hed always start out i dont really feel look duchess macbeth felt like he was about to cry this was absurd he started to tell her about the night at the earls castle about moira singing the comb song and how it ended yes the duchess said impatiently i know about that so am i right in thinking moira caused all that the deer heads and stuff to come crashing down the duchess looked cross the question is pouff irrelevant how can anyone ever really say i did this i caused this to happen perhaps you are a factor in its happening perhaps not ill tell you something mr macbeth nobody whos merely human can ever be entirely sure of the ability to make anything happen say if youre a great healer sometimes it works youre lucky or youre so good and saintly that you get helped a lot and sometimes it doesnt work at all i once knew a woman called jean wendle but thats another story she lay back on the chaise and halfclosed her eyes looking at the wall behind him or let us say if youre a bad or a vengeful person and you want to hurt somebody you want to curse them in the movies it goes zap like one of those what dyou call them ray guns lasers he heard a small noise behind him turned in time to see a plate one of a row of five with pictures on them sliding very slowly from the wall the plate fell to the floor and smashed macbeth nearly passed out from a long way away he heard the duchess saying doing damage harming people is much easier but thats unpredictable too sometimes people dabble and create a big black cloud throwing up her arms theatrically and they cant control where it goes numbly macbeth bent to pick up the pieces of the plate maybe hed dislodged it with the back of his head the ones still on the wall had pictures of balmoral castle where the queen spent time and glamis castle blair atholl castle and the queen mothers castle of mey he held two pieces of the broken plate together and saw in one of those shattering timeless moments that they made up a rough watercolour sketch of the familiar victorian gothic facade of the earls place accidents happen the duchess said leave it on the floor macbeths fingers were trembling as he laid the pieces down he needed a cigarette more urgently than at any time since he quit smoking six years ago i never liked that one anyway the duchess said doubtless psyching out that macbeth could use more hot tea and fast she filled up his cup and added two sugars he drank it all she was offering him an easy way out she was saying what just happened the plate also the skulls on the wall this is kids stuff this is chickenshit compared to what a person could be letting himself in for if he pursues moira cairns mungo macbeth maker of miniseries for the masses thought maybe this was how king arthur laid it on the line for any madassed knight of the round table figuring to go after the holy grail hed often wondered about those less ambitious knights who listened to the horror stories and thought well fuck this what do need with a holy grail maybe i should just stick around and lay me some more damsels do a little sunday jousting how could those knights go on living with themselves having passed up on the chance of the one big thing he said earlier you said about when a guy gets to wondering how much his life has really been worth and if there isnt more stuff in heaven and earth than hes reading about in the new york times the silent girl whod brought the tea came back and took away the tray after shed gone he said duchess why i only met your daughter once never even why can you tell me instead the duchess told him the story of a man who fell in love with the queen of the fairies and all the shit that put him into macbeth said he knew the songs tarn lin thomas the rymer all that stuff but that wasnt the same thing surely moira cairns was a human being thats quite true the duchess said gravely but remember this wherever she goes that young woman shes bound to be touched with madness now who is the white man white man i thought perhaps you might be his emissary whiteskinned man i dont think i mean race just a man exuding a whiteness somebody i know you dont i dont know what you mean i believe you dont all right never mind macbeth asked do you know where moira is oh the little jewish person kaufmann tells me shes in the north of england bastard wouldnt tell me you he doesnt trust strange that i find you quite transparent thanks there was a man called matt jesus you intuited that the duchess sighed in exasperation she told me right macbeth said relieved matt uh castle she thinks he was her mentor i rather suspect she was his right macbeth said uncertainly hes dead shell have gone to try and lay his spirit to rest macbeth squirmed a little was this precisely what was meant by things you couldnt find in the new york times was this what mom meant about uncovering his roots he thought not the duchess smiled kindly you can leave now if you wish mr macbeth ill have donald see you to the gate no wait two trains of thought were about to crash buckling his usual a to b mental tracks this uh white person a thin man with white hair and a very white complexion the castle the bones whitefaced man with a cut eye shit i dont believe this you got that outa my head you pulled it clean outa my head mr macbeth calm down two or three weeks ago a man of this description came to consult me as people do occasionally he didnt get in donald is my first line of defence the dogs are the second and donald told me the dogs disliked this man quite intensely on sight now dogs cant invariably be trusted they may react badly to oh psychic disturbance in a person or mental instability but when a man arrives in an expensive car and seems very confident and the dogs hate him on sight stanhope macbeth thought stansgate and when donald conveyed my message that i was unwell he was apparently quite annoyed he sent a message back that he had information about my daughter which he thought i would wish to know i suggested donald should let the dogs have him what happened he left stanley stanmore duchess you think this guy meant her harm two people arrive within a short period to talk to me about my daughter one the dogs dislike how did the dogs take to you mr macbeth i wasnt invited to play rubberbone but i seem to be intact the duchess nodded i dont know how you found me no dont explain its not important i didnt mention the man to moira she has enough problems i think but if you wanted to help her you might keep an eye open for him if there was a problem and you were to deal with it she need never know need she macbeth started thinking about the knights and the holy grail and this guy stanton stansfield part seven angels from dawbers secret book of bridelow unpublished the history of beer beer of course was brewed in bridelow long before the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries ale was the original sacred drink made from the water of the holy spring and the blessed barley and preserved with the richlyaromatic bog myrtle from the moss nigel pennick writes in his book practical magic in the northern tradition cakes or bread and ale are the sacrament of country tradition the runic word for ale alu is composed of the three runes as lagu and ur the first rune has the meaning of the gods or divine power the second water and flow and the third primal strength the eating of bread and drinking of ale is the mystery of the transmutation of the energy in the grain into a form where it is reborn in our physical bodies it follows therefore that to some local people the sale of the bridelow brewery and the detachment of the beermaking process from its ancient origins would seem to be a serious sapping of the villages inherent strength perhaps even a symbolic draining away of its lifeblood chapter i shes got to be in i can hear the kettle boiling and boiling and boiling whistling through the house the kettle having hysterics ive got a key willie said bringing out the whole bunch of them a dark damp dread was settling around moira she took a step back on the short path leading to ma wagstaffs front door held on to a gatepost biting a lip what the f the door opening a few inches then jamming and willie putting his shoulder to it summat caught behind here hey stop willie jesus through the crack in the door shed seen a foot blackshod and pointing upwards she drew willie gently back and showed him oh christ willie said drably he didnt approach the door again he said quietly moira do us a favour nip across to tpost office fetch milly what about a doctor she wouldnt thank you for a doctor just get milly milly gill moira didnt need to say a word milly gill looked at her and lost her smile shooed out two customers and shut up the post office ran ahead of moira across the street big floral bosom heaving when they got to the house willie had the front door wide open and tears of horror in his eyes milly gill moved past him to where the old woman lay in a small neat bundle at the bottom of the stairs eyes like glass buttons open mouth a breathless void one leg crooked under her brown woollen skirt the body looked as weightless as a sparrow moira doubted shed ever seen anything from which life was so conspicuously absent a life which obviously had been so much more than the usual random mesh of electrical impulses even when it was moving the little body had been the least of ma wagstaff this was a big death willie wagstaff stood in the front garden looking at his shoes drawing long breaths his hands hung by his sides fingers motionless the kettles wild whistling ended with a gasp and then milly gill came out and joined them youll need a doctor willie luv his head came up eyes briefly bright but the spark of hope fading in an instant death certificate milly said softly she took his arm come on post office ill make us some tea the street was silent but doors were being opened curtains tweaked aside shadowed faces nobody came out everybody sensing the death mood in the dusky air moira thought bleakly they dont die like this people like ma wagstaff not at a time of crisis they dont have accidents and sudden heart attacks they know when its over and they go quietly and usually in their own time at the post office doorway milly gill called out to the street at large its ma wagstaff nothing anybody can do she turned to willie no point in keeping it a secret is there luv moira heard willie saying i was only with her this morning the way people talked facing the mindless robbery of a sudden death and i saw her less than an hour ago and she was in some state willie she was in some state id guess it couldnt have been quicker milly gill said unconvincingly leading them through the post office into a flowery little sitting room behind shes still warm poor old luv maybe she had a seizure or something going downstairs sit yourselves down ill put kettle on and phone for tdoctor this is moira cairns said willie how dyou do plug that fire in willie its freezing scrabbling down by the hearth willie looked up at moira through his mousy fringe fishing out a weak smile that was almost apologetic i should go moira said last thing you need is me willie got to his feet nervously straightening his pullover i wouldnt say that no she thought poor willie whos he got left no mother no matt no job maybe no direction only fingers drumming at the air is there only you no brothers sisters two sisters willie said theres always more girls by tradition like moira sat on the end of a settee with bright floral loosecovers the carpet had a bluebell design and there were paintings and sketches of wild flowers on the walls ah willie said she had to go sometime she were eighty i forget getting on though least she dint suffer thats the main thing oh but she did willie she couldnt look at him her worried eyes following a single black beam across the ceiling two bunches of sage were hanging from it the soft musty scent favouring the atmosphere homely no hurry milly gill was saying in another room on the phone to the doctor if theres sick people in tsurgery you see to them first see to the living when she came back into the sitting room there were two cats around her ankles bob and jim willies eyes were damp little buggers didnt see um come moira said your mas cats willie smiled not any more catsll always find a home these buggers knew where to come theyll not be the only ones this ladys with the mothers union right willie said you know about that eh i knew about this one when she first come in said milly gill well have to have a talk sometime luv her watchful grey eyes said she also knew that women like ma wagstaff did not fall downstairs after having unexpected strokes or heart attacks willies fingers had known that too had felt it coming whatever it was soon huh moira said joel beard said here in my in the churchyard he and the policeman were standing in the church porch the wet afternoon draining into an early dusk its a possibility vicar ashton said its something we have to check out and the sooner we do it the less likely we are to attract attention you havent had any press here i take it joel beard shook his curls why would they come here they would if they knew what we were proposing to do sir and these things have a habit of leaking out so i dont know if youve had experience of an exhumation before but what it involves is screening off the immediate area and confining it to as few people as are absolutely necessary you can be there yourself if you like but i assure you well be very tidy now the lights lights you mean you want to do it tonight i thought these things took not much more than a phone call involved these days sir were under quite a lot of pressure to find this thing as you can imagine joel said it all seems so unlikely it didnt though it connected all too plausibly inspector how do you suppose that this was actually done without anything being seen this was what i was planning to ask you country churchyard even at night somebody sees something dont they perhaps they saw and they kept quiet mmm when was the grave dug i dont know joel said i imagine the day before the rector was in charge then but he hes in hospital hes had a heart attack thats unfortunate ashton said no you see whats been suggested to us is that the grave was dug deeper than is normal and then the body was brought here and covered with earth and then the funeral went ahead as normal with mr castles coffin laid on top of the bog body thats preposterous joel said it wasnt though somehow there was a link here with the old woman and the bottle shed been attempting to secrete into castles coffin you see our information is that there was a request from some people here for the body to be returned to the bog and when it seemed unlikely that was going to happen somebody decided to pinch it would you know anything about that mr beard good lord joel said no i certainly wouldnt you know i think on the whole that i should like to be there when you do it i thought you might said ashton moira felt weary and ineffectual and she had a headache walking head down into the rectory drive she was speared by lights cathy parked her fathers vw golf crookedly in front of the garage how is he hes ok cathy said quickly unlocking the front door im sorry i didnt leave you a key did i im hopelessly inefficient about her father moira saw she was playing this down cathy unloaded plastic carrier bags and her long university scarf on to the kitchen worktops all stark white butchersshop tiling i went into manchester afterwards had to get away somewhere crowded to think got loads of cold things from marks and sparks you dont mind do you pop sees to the cooking as a rule im a disaster in the kitchen did you get to see ma wagstaff yes said moira did she talk to you no moira said im afraid not then cathy discovered the sugar bowl was empty and went into the pantry the little room under the stairs for a new bag oh she said the little scumbags huh moira peered over her shoulder cathy was holding a brick there was a small window in the pantry and the brick had clearly been used to smash it little bastards cathy said you know this never used to happen i know people say that all the time oh things were different when i was a kid and you could get in the cinema for sixpence none of this vandalism in those days kids had respect but its true even what six months ago it was true in bridelow they did have respect cathy put the brick down on the floor now theres graffiti in the toilets at the parish hall a week or two ago somebody had a defecated on the seat inside the lychgate can you believe that in bridelow you better check the house moira said cathy had a cursory look around the downstairs rooms everything seemed to be in order little sods everybody knows pops in hospital she looked at moira oh yes thats another thing theyre sending him to a convalescent home i thought it wasnt too serious coronary cathy said despondently thats serious theyre sending him committing him is how he sees it to this church nursing home down in shropshire at least a month which means joels got to move in here with you youre joking cathy said even if i could bear to have him in the house hes much too proper to countenance it no ill go back to oxford come up at weekends and see pop i mean i expect youll be wanting to be off wont you moira said look you got any cardboard in the garage or somewhere we can block up this window never mind alf becketll fix it tomorrow moira said cathy um something bads happened because of the post offices strict security regulations milly gills front door had two steel bolts and a fancy double lock which shed always thought was damn stupid in a place like bridelow tonight though first time ever milly was glad to turn the key twice over and slide the big bolts even though she knew there were some things no locks could keep out the urgent banging on the door shook her willie wagstaff never used the knocker willie would beat out his own personal tattoo with his fingers oh mother milly gill said clutching her arms over her breast im not going to be up to this it was an hour since the doctord had ma taken away across the moss hed said there might have to be a postmortem probably no more than a formality it was most likely natural causes but if there was reason to think she might have fallen accidentally thered have to be a public inquest pity bridelow didnt have a resident doctor any more this was an asian gentleman from across the moss who couldnt be expected to understand milly had pleaded with him not to let them cut ma up if there was any way it could be avoided it was important that all of mas bits should be returned to bridelow for burial not tissue and stuff left in some hospital waste bin more crashing at the from door who is it milly shouted didnt recognize her own voice it sounded that feeble its me alf milly tuttutted at her cowardice why she should think there might be something abroad because something that happened to hundreds of pensioners every week had happened to ma wagstaff she undid the bolts and turned the key twice im sorry alf not like me to be nervy but if anything alf beckett looked worse than she felt there was a streetlamp outside the door a converted gas lamp with an iceblue bulb its light made alf look quite ill eyes like keyholes milly he said were in tshit come in luv milly said her responsibility now this sort of problem keeping up community morale she sat alf down on the floral settee he was ashen now then come on milly said its all right well get over this weve had bad patches before no alf shook his head listen its my fault milly said we always left too much to poor old ma we thought she were immortal thought we could sit back everybody getting on with their lives foreign holidays videos didnt seem to matter like it used to and then when ma started getting gloomy we all thought it were just her age even me daft cow and now everythings happened at once and its shaken us but well be all right honest luv she got up to put the kettle on ive sent willie to tman for a pint lifes got to go on alf just means well have to have a bit of a gettogether soon as possible sort this lad joel beard out for a start then well see what else weve got to tackle mrs horridge thats another thing milly alf becketts hearth brush moustache looked bent and spiky policeve come eh because of ma have they found summat no no listen to me woman for christs sake alf sat up on the couch hands clasped so tightly together that his knuckles were whiter than his cheeks its tgrave theyre coming to dig matts grave up in the narrow doorway to the back kitchen milly froze filling it alf said some buggers told tcoppers as tbogmans in theer milly felt sick all churned up inside ma gone the rector in hospital and her at the wrong time of life to cope with it all she covered up her face with her hands and looked at him through her fingers lord she whispered whatve we done alf whatve we done in bridlo to deserve this cathy said to moira if pop hears about this hes going to do something stupid shed told cathy only about mas death not about seeing the old woman out on the moss fighting a dead tree she said like what like discharge himself cathy said glumly moira i dont know what to do they ran this place between them pop and ma wagstaff they hardly ever met but they had an understanding you know they were in the sitting room cathy had lit the fire she was sitting on the sofa where dic castle had sprawled shed taken off her shoes and her thick woollen socks were planted on an old rag hearthrug dark with scorchmarks from stray coals he doesnt talk much about it but it was obviously really tough for pop when he first came here he was pretty young younger than joel and a southerner with a funny german name hell of a culture shock series of shocks i suppose like when he finds out theyre all heathens is that what we are moira smiled its no that simple is it i was up on the moor with willie wagstaff earlier we saw the holy well whos that dedicated to the goddess brigid st bride the mother goddess or the holy mother of god gets confusing doesnt it cathy said and the cross that was in the church made out of twigs and stuff the autumn cross and theres a winter cross yeh made of holly and mistletoe and stuff and then a spring cross made of youve got it moira said putting it all together finally they cant make up their minds what they are can they cathy folded her legs on to the sofa like i said you need to talk to mr dawber he can put it into an historical context but the first church in britain was the celtic church and by the time they came along i like to think celtic paganism was pretty refined with this giveandtake attitude to nature and animals and things in parts of scotland said moira particularly some of the western isles its not been so much a takeover as a merger like nobody could say the teachings of christ were anything less than a hell of a good framework for say human behaviour the way we treat each other but in isolated areas there were aspects of life it didnt quite cover said cathy maybe still doesnt and this area was always very isolated cut off selfsufficient immune from outside influences we got electricity later than everybody else piped water was a long time coming television signals are still so lousy that most people havent got one yet yeh but look now its a brick through your window and sheffield united are shit on the walls and somebody has one on a public seat thats outside influences for you be a rape next cathy this bogman oh hes all right no hes not matt castle was besotted with him the man in the moss matt was seeing him in biblical terms sacrificial saviour of the english celts he died to save us all cathy said gosh isnt that a terrible piece of blasphemy can you imagine the sleepless nights pop had over this the bogman was he some sort of pennine jesus or the antichrist huh moira thought of the black snaking branches of the tree on the moss her head throbbed as if the thing were lashing at her brain ok she said hurriedly lets leave that be for a while when they built the first christian church here they put it on the old sacred site and its dedicated to brigid or brigantia now known as st bride and the ministers here have always had a kind of agreement with the priestess and her attendants who in time become known as the mothers union right all the anglican churches have mothers unions young wives groups too yeah but most of them presumably dont recognize the symbolism the mothers and the hags the hags being the ones over the menopause when youre over the change cathy said you go on to a new level of responsibility well so im told how do you know all this i read a lot of books now ok the bogman turns up again the willing sacrifice the pagan jesusfigure who supposedly went to his death to save his people thats one powerful symbol cathy regardless of what else it might be its a heavy symbol it churns things up ive told you hes all right what dyou mean hes all right somebodys stolen him im telling you there are people around who will do things with a relic as powerful as that look its ok thats sorted out sorted out she had to stand up walk away from the fire although she was shivering and it hurt when she swallowed moira come on sit down i promise you its ok why moira demanded why is it ok cathy because said cathy simply the bogmans had a full christian burial chapter ii by now the sky was the colour of police trousers ashton thought prosaically and damn near as thick tent wouldve been better he said as the rain started up again steel needles in the arc lamp does it matter if he gets wet depends what state hes in roger hall was struggling with his umbrella glad to see youre still sure hes down there count on it hall said ashtons lads had erected a grey canvas screen about seven feet high around the grave still just a mound of soil no headstone yet that saved a bit of hassle anyway youve brought your own coffin have you i wouldnt call it that hall said my assistant has it over there pointing at chrissie white shivering in fake fur a plywood box at her feet whats that white stuff inside then dr hall polystyrene chips shut that lid properly chrissie we dont want them wet weve also brought a few rolls of clingfilm inspector we wrap him in that first so we dont lose anything like a frozen turkey ashton said anyway its good to see we havent pulled a crowd yet lets just hope we can get this sorted before anybody knows were here now wheres that gravedigger bloke the big curlyhaired clergyman came over wearing his full funeral kit ashton noticed long cassock and a short cape like coppers used to have on pointduty in the good old days he looked nervous might he know something this is mr beckett inspector our verger little pensioner with a big stainlesssteel spade you dig this grave first time around mr beckett aye what about it usual depth six feet give or take a few inches no need to measure it sithee when thas done tjob a few score times and when mr castle was buried did you notice if the earth had been disturbed it were bloody dark by then said mr beckett uncompromisingly patting his chest as if hed got indigestion but actually smoothing the bulge in his donkey jacket for in its inside pocket shrouded in household tissue lay a little brown bottle be his job this time to get the bloody bottle into matt castles coffin which theyd have to get out of the way before they could get at the bogman this was a new bottle alf had gone with milly gill to ma wagstaffs house and hed stood guard while milly made it up all of a dither poor lass im not doing it right alf im sure im not doing it right its thought as counts alf had said not knowing what the hell he was on about ma always said that standing at the parlour door watching milly messing about with red thread and stuff by candlelight alf what go in tkitchen fetch us a mixing bowl what sort any sort big un im nervous come on hurry up alf handing her a white pyrex bowl standing around in the doorway as milly put the bowl on the parlour floor feeling about under her skirts well dont just stand there alf bugger off the door closed only streetlight washing in through the landing window ugly shadows thrown into the little hall the bannisters dancing millys muffled muttering and then the unavoidable sound of her peeing into the pyrex alf trying not to listen standing where mas body must have landed looking up the stairs into a strange forbidding coldness him whod patrolled the empty church on wild and windy nights and never felt other than welcome hurry up lass giving me tcreeps this is mas house the sound slowing to a trickle theres not a nicer atmosphere anywhere alf deliberately turning his back on the stairs aye but that were when ma were alive this time moira went off to make the tea gave her time to think shed asked cathy who was left in the mothers union apart from milly gill cathy had looked gloomy and said dont ask moira lifted the teapot lid and watched the leaves settle seemed the mothers union wasnt what it used to be ma wagstaff used to say theyd let things slide a bit cathy said moira put the teapot on a tray with a couple of mugs some dead leaves hit the window from the doorway behind her cathy said ma thought there was something out there trying to get in she said the air was different how do you know all this cathy do you have to be a mother to be in the mothers union cathy grinned there were bags under her eyes and her hair looked dull in the hard kitchen light theyll even take virgins these days are you a virgin a mother pops an enlightened clergyman cathy said but not that enlightened two young coppers helped alf with the spadework which was a good bit easier just when you didnt bloody need it than hed have expected under normal circumstances he was ashamed of this grave the soil all piled in loose big lumps nothing tamped down but hed rushed the job as rattled as anybody by that ugly scene between ma wagstaff and joel beard and then lottie castle screaming at them to get her husband planted quick three feet into the grave getting there faster than he wanted to he could see joel peering down at them unlikely the ladd know yet about ma wagstaffs death nobody rushing to tell him after the way hed been carrying on thing was joel probably had no idea what he was up against just a bunch of cracked owd women which alf conceded wasnt a bad thing for him to think just now at least he didnt suspect alf and he wouldnt be watching him too closely the problem is cathy said that its become more of a way of life than a religion is that no a good thing well yeah it is for ordinary people getting on with their lives this sort of natural harmony the feeling of belonging to something its great until things start to go wrong and your brewery gets taken over and most of the workforce is fired and your village shop shuts down and your local celeb arrives to save your pub from almost certain closure and hes dead inside six months and your placid undemanding rector develops quite a rapid worsening of his arthritis which mas always been able to keep in check except mas losing it and she doesnt know why cathy looked at moiras cigarettes on the chairarm how longs it take to learn to smoke she waved an exasperated hand forget it oh this place is no fun any more atmospheres not the same people not as content ive been home twice since the summer and its struck me right away maybe thats the same all over britain with this government and everything but bridelow was always protected yeah and now its not i mean somebody like joel would never have got away with what hes done ripping down that kids cross and our sheila i mean weve had these religious firebrands before maybe even my old man was a bit that way when he first arrived but something calms them down ma wagstaff used to say it was in the air shades pastel shades you know what i mean the old celtic air moira said everything misty and nebulous no extremes everything blending in you can sense it on some of the scottish islands scotch mist parts of ireland too maybe it was preserved here like the bogman in the peat cathy said youre not going to rest until i tell you are you and i do need to get to bed cathy i feel terrible cathy sighed ok they stole the bogman back they buried him in matt castles grave before matt went in jesus said moira who were not supposed to know but everybody i suppose theyre all in it theyve done it before a few bits of bodies have turned up in the moss over the years and thats what they do with them save them up until somebody dies and curiously somebody always does even if its only an arm or a foot turns up somebody conveniently snuffs it so the bits can have a christian burial well inasmuch as anything round here is one hundred per cent christian but this body well its the first time theres been a whole one and the council discovered it didnt they so no way they could keep this one to themselves and then the scientific tests revealing that this had been a very special sacrifice the triple death mmm so ma wagstaff and milly gill and co and willie is willie in this willie used to be a carpenter he did too and hes good with doors and locks and then theres that mate of his the other chap in the band eric he works for a security firm now in manchester the same firm as it happens that was hired to keep an eye on the field centre bloody hell moira slumped back in her chair its beyond belief its like one of those old films where everybodys conspiring whisky galore or something so the bodys back home in bridelow soil it didnt go completely right milly says that right at the last minute ma started getting funny feelings about it going in matt castles grave im no surprised youve got to purify yourself of course so she made up this witch bottle to go in matts coffin its got rowan berries in it and red cotton and the person making up the bottle has to pee in it moira said rowan tree red thread holds the witches all in dread what its a song moira said well its the wrong way round mostly it was the witches themselves who use the bottles to keep bad spirits at bay the spirits are supposed to go after the red berries or something and get entangled in the thread its all symbolic so she wanted to save man from evil spirits or maybe she wanted to save the bogman from something in matt i dont know cathy said im the rectors daughter im not supposed to know anything we turn a blind eye but the bottle never got in the coffin did it i dont know the supposed contaminant remains i dont know moira he stood at the edge of the grave looking down forcing himself to look down sometimes when he prayed he thought he heard a voice and the voice said you have a task joel you must not turn away sometimes the voice called him mr beard like the voice on the telephone a calm knowing voice obviously someone inside the village disgusted by what went on here one day joel hoped he would meet his informant when he encountered people in the street or in the post office he would look into their eyes for a sign but the women would smile kindly at him and the men would mumble something laconic like all right then lad and continue on their way he stepped back in distaste as a shovelful of gravesoil was heaved out of the hole and over his shoes surely they had to be six feet down by now he wondered whether if they kept on digging they would reach peat the moss slowly sliding in underneath the village insidious he looked over his shoulder and up above the heads and umbrellas of the silent circle of watchers at the frosty disc of the church clock the beacon of the moss the false light the devils moon perhaps that had to go too like the pagan well and the cross and the monstrosity above the church door before the village could be cleansed more light please one of the policemen in the grave you there yet the inspector ashton swing that light round a bit ken lets have a look deeper than we expected sir maybe its sunk that likely mr beckett the light swept across the vergers face aye happen thats what happened alfred becketts voice like crushed eggshell ashton said right lets have this one out see whats underneath ernie dawber had returned after dark from his weekly mission to the supermarket in macclesfield bringing back with him a copy of the manchester evening news a paper that rarely made it across the moss until the following day the frontpage lead headline said massive hunt for bogman a major police hunt was underway today for the bridelow bog body snatched in a daring raid on a university lab and a prominent archaeological trust has offered a reward for information leading to the safe recovery of the man in the moss we are taking this very seriously indeed said oh dear me ernie dawber said to himself the paper spread out on the table where he was finishing his tea toasted lancashire cheese what a tangled web eh trying to keep his mind off what the doctord had to say well what right had he to complain about that least hed got a doctor of the old school who didnt bugger about while theres life theres hope medical science moving ahead at a tremendous rate none of that old nonsense thank the lord might just drop in and see ma wagstaff about it nowt lost in that is there the doorbell rang ernie didnt rush he folded up the manchester evening news very neatly preserving its crease if it was dr hall he didnt know what hed say as an historian he was glad the experts had got their hands on this particular body been able with their modern scientific tests to clarify a few points but equally ma wagstaff with her instincts and her natural wisdom had been right about putting the thing back thank god he thought pulling at his front door for instinct all too aware that this was not something he himself possessed bit of psychological insight perhaps now and then but that wasnt the same thing so it had to be done putting the bogman back in bridelow earth commitment fulfilled alls well that ends well except it hasnt ernie thought getting the door open it hasnt ended and its not well lord knows why by eck he said surprised and to what do i owe this honour on his doorstep in the rain stood four women in dark clothing oldfashioned anklelength navy duffle coats with the hoods up or dark woollen shawls over their heads a posse from the bridelow mothers union in full ritual dress could be quite disconcerting when you saw them trooping across the churchyard against a wintry sunset but always a bit well comical at close range can we talk to you mr dawber milly gill said from somewhere inside whatever she had on ernie identified the others in a second franks wife ethel young franks wife susan and old sarah winstanley with no teeth in probably the only remaining members of the union fit enough to go out after dark this time of year he felt a warm wave of affection for the curious quartet now then he said cheerfully wheres ma no instinct that was his problem thought you knew everything milly gill said in a voice as cold and dispiriting as the rain ive been out ernie said on edge now milly said quietly mas died on us and the churchyards full of policemen digging up matts grave can we come in mr dawber matt castles coffin came up hard it was like a big old decaying barge stuck in a sandbank it didnt want to come it wanted to stay in the dark and rot and feed the worms they had to tear it out of the earth with a slurping and a squelching of sodden soil and clay hell fire youd think itd been in here years one of the coppers muttered sliding a rope under one end groping for one of the coffin handles alf beckett stayed on top hands flat on the lid knowing it hadnt been nailed down knowing that if it slipped they could drop the corpse into the mud thinking get it over get it overget the bloody thing found and have done with it and wondering then if by any chance he was standing on the squashed brown face of the bog body oh what a mess what a bloody mess all right the inspector said as two men on the surface took the strain take it easy come out now please and keep to the sides alf scrambled out after the coffin he was covered in mud lay it over there please dont damage it now roger dr hall time for you to take over i reckon right dr roger hall strode into the lights beads of water glinting in his beard now well see without ceremony they dumped the coffin behind the piles of excavated earth up against the canvas screen well out of the light matt castle just something to be got out of the way while everybody crowded round to gaze into the grave except for alf beckett who shuffled behind the others squatted down on the wet grass by the coffin put a muddy hand inside his donkey jacket and brought out the witch bottle whispering forgive this intrusion lad as he felt along the muddy rim of the oilslimy casket hands moving up to its shoulders thumbs prising at the lid bracing himself for the stench a sickening blast of gasses some bloke barking no no not like that look let me come down alf breathing hard snatching at the lid as it suddenly sprang away god help us could he do this could he put his hands in there mind yourself dr hall bloody slippy down there s all right get that bloody lamp out of my eyes give me a light give me a torch thanks alf thought it was worse that there was no light he might not be able to see the body but hed have to touch it feel for the cold rubbery hands would they be rubbery or would they be slippery or flaking with decay he didnt know but hed find out prising the fingers apart to get them to hold the bottle voice raised muffled voice out of the grave got to be chrissie the trowel pass me the trowel take your time dr hall you wont get another chance hand inside alf could feel the quilted stuff and the stiff lacy stuff the lining felt more like nylon than silk sweat bubbling up on his forehead to meet the rain his moustache dripping the smell from inside the box was dank and rotten alf wrenched his head aside looked away from the blackened hump of the coffin towards the people gathered round the open grave joel beard singing out contemptuously you see nothing are you really surprised alf propping himself on his right arm the hand splayed into the grass ashton it has to be i refuse to it hit alf beckett in a sudden burst of bewilderment the bogman they cant find it why cant they find it and then his stomach lurched hot vomit roared into his throat his supporting arm collapsed the nerves gone and his mouth stretched into a scream so wide it seemed itd rip his lips apart the scream was choked by the vomit his left hand the one inside matt castles coffin had slipped all five fingers dropping into a soft cold and glutinous mess a thin and viscid slithering thing was pulsing between them chapter iii this time sam davis said you wont stop me hed already dressed by the time esther awoke lights she said lights again sam nodded cradled in his arms was his dads old twelvebore shotgun get that out esther shouted ill not have that thing in my bedroom fair enough sam said patting the pockets of his old combat jacket i will stop you esther said sitting up in bed rubbing her eyes if you go out with that gun illve called the police before you get to the end of the yard please yourself sam broke the gun mans got to look after his own he pulled a handful of cartridges from his jacket pocket and shoved a couple into the breach esther started to cry dont waste um luv sam said we tried your way big wanker oh satan get thee gone im giving thee notice to quit sam snorted now im giving um notice to quit wi this and theyll listen youre a bloody fool sam davis esther wept youre a fool to yourself where will i be wi you in jail for manslaughter where will your children be shurrup eh sam said youll wake um ill be back in half an hour or less dont worry dont worry ill show it um happen ill fire it over their heads thats all itll take sam davis moved quietly out of the bedroom and his wife followed him downstairs ive warned you ill ring for tpolice aye leaving the lights off sam undid the bolts on the back door it was raining out and cold enough for sleet when hed gone esther shivering in her nightie said right and went to the phone the phone was dead hed ripped out the wire and pulled off the little plastic plug esther ran to the back door and screeched sam sam into the unresponsive night the nights were the worst times but in a way they were the best because they hardened lotties intent to get out by day local customers drifting in around lunchtime nice people she got to thinking the pub was an important local service and there werent many of those left in bridelow and if she didnt keep it on who would and matt matt would be so disappointed with her but at night alone in the pineframed bed which kept reminding her of her husbands coffin enclosed by the still strange hard whitewashed walls she felt his stubborn obsessiveness in the air like a lingering humid odour and she knew shed paid back all she owed to matt long since if indeed hed ever given her anything apart from headaches and dic she lay down the middle of the bed head on a single white pillow for the first time entirely alone dic had gone off relieved she knew to his bedsit in stockport back on monday to the supplyteaching he was doing in lieu of a real job dic looking perpetually bewildered all day saying little mooching about rubbing his chin offering in a halfhearted way to stay here until sunday night but lottie briskly waving him out fed up with you under my feet moping around time i had some space for myself to do what though well to try and find a buyer for the pub for a start that would be a picnic best she could hope for was to flog it to some rich cheshire businessman with romantic yearnings for conversion into a luxury home with an exclusive view of peat peat peat bloody peat in the mornings shed draw back the bedroom curtains and the first thing shed see would be black peat and on to the scene her mind would superimpose matt in his wheelchair sinking into the moss and fighting it all the way and every bloody marshbird banking overhead would be imitating the pennine pipes of blessed memory all i want is bridelow moss behind me to be able to draw back the curtains on to other peoples gardens parked cars the postman the milkman no hills in view over the tops of the laburnums in other words the view from the bedroom window in wilmslow which matt had despised and which she carried in her mind like a talisman of sanity with the bedside light on she gazed unblinking at the ceiling a single hefty black beam bisecting it diagonally so that half the ceiling was light half shadow ma aye gone agstaff deadyou didnt know god no if walls could record voices and mood and atmosphere the mans ancient stones would have been crumbling tonight under the dead weight of suppressed emotion the death of ma wagstaff the underlying theme below all the trivial taproom chat about manchester united and the sodding government and the more meaningful analyses of working conditions under gannons lottie saying nothing playing barmaid pulling bridelow black for those committed to preserving the brewery and lager and draught bass for those whod been made redundant so ma wagstaff had gone well she was old she was halfbaked shed clung to her own loopy ideas of religion let them be buried with her not that anything stayed buried round here the bogman rising again after who could say how many centuries to cause torment and to haunt matts latter days and now poor matt himself rising again to help the police with their inquiries which jaw tightened both hands clenching on the sheet for a moment was none of her business and none of ma wagstaffs any more just let it be all over just let them have found what they wanted and put matt back m his grave and stamped down the soil what they wanted she knew of course that it had to be the bogman how honoured matt would have been to know hed be sharing his grave with his illustrious ancestor most likely she conceded he did know matt always could keep a secret even from his wife especially from his wife and that does it lottie thought ill talk to estate agents first thing monday morning she put out the lamp and shut her eyes she was not lonely she was relieved at last of the horror and the pity of matt and his illness and his allconsuming passions and relieved too now that moira had been here now that shed received his taped begging letter of the responsibility of overseeing the completion of matts magnum opus his bogman suite moiras responsibility now poetic justice one obsession taking care of another not that moira presumably had ever wanted to be matts obsession lottie opened her eyes and stared searchingly into the darkness or perhaps obscurely perversely moira had she kept her ego under wraps but it was there it existed maybe it is poetic justice youve been relieved youre free to go the lino was as cold as flagstones under ernies bare feet and although his bedroom slippers were under the bed he didnt fetch them out the cold was better i dont want comfort i want the truth an answer what must i do what is there left i can do through the window he could see the churchyard gravestones wet with rain and blue under the beacon of the moss be one for me happen this time next year he couldnt from here see matt castles grave but hed heard about all that from alfred beckett whod come pounding on his door while the dregs of the mothers union sat dispiritedly drinking tea in his study what can we do mr dawber whos going to explain me hed stated firmly ill explain if necessary hed never seen the mothers in such a state and never imagined he would old sarah winstanley with no teeth just about said it all no ma no teeth no hope not for me now neither with ma gone everythings changing millicent had said hardening and now weve lost the man for good and all theyll take him back to london this time no question about that bad luck on this scale mr dawber its not natural mary lane died did you hear pneumonia fiftythree god forbid shades ma had said thems whats kept this place the way it is they started talking about shades again and it was not really his province hed promised ma wagstaff that hed get the man back and now it was all falling through and it was his responsibility what was there left in the time he had and then milly had told them about liz horridge i forgot all about it wi ma being found not long after i found her up mas front path first time shes been seen in tvillage for months well she were in a shocking state banging her fists on mas door please please like this whimpering you know i put me hand on her shoulder and she nearly had hysterics i want ma i want ma i says mas not here luv come and have a cuppa tea i says she just looks at me like she doesnt know who i am and then she pushes me aside and shes off like a rabbit i rang the hall to tell somebody but shaws never there is he and moira cairns staying with young cathy in the rectory at the very heart of the village he looked down at the graves why had she come so secretively and why hadnt she gone away again hed seen her walking down from the church this morning strikingly goodlooking lass probably in her late thirties looking it because of that white strand in her hair like the light through a crack in the door of a darkened room but what did they know about her nowt ernie said aloud to the silent graves should he say owt to the mothers he wasnt a stirrer he wasnt a gossip hed always known more than he passed on just as dawbers book of bridelow was only ever a fraction of what the dawbers knew about bridelow whod take over the book from him no more dawbers left in bridelow happen it really was the end of an era happen the bridelow to come wouldnt have the distinction that warranted a book of its own ernest dawber last of the village scribes chronicler of the fall alf becketts arrival had saved him if alf hadnt turned up one of them or all of them would surely have sensed he had worries and sorrows of his own by eck hed been scared had alf beckett so scared as hed told them that he could hardly keep his spade level when the time came to shovel the soil back on matt castles coffin after finding no trace of the bogman they didnt find it milly gill up on her feet in a flash for all her weight alf shaking his head dumbly whats it mean milly franks wife ethel dazed i dont know millys voice hoarse i dont understand but its good isnt it the youngest of them susan said we dint want um to find it of course its not good milly said you dont suddenly get a miracle like that in the middle of a lot of bad its not the way of things what frightens me if hes not there where in gods name is he she broke off for a sip of tea im sorry mr dawber i shouldve told you earlier it were finding ma knocked me back strange though isnt it everythings so terribly strange all of a sudden when theyd gone ernie had telephoned the hall himself no answer hed go up there tomorrow a visit long overdue it must be deliberate you know all this milly had said an attack village is under attack eh like i said things go in waves mr dawber good times bad times were used to that aye ma had said what this is its a balancing act but this is an attack milly said ernie had been flummoxed for a minute you mean the curate joel beard well hes part of it we let them disturb the man in the moss we didnt do right by him now weve no protection all sorts are coming in unsuitable people aye people like him all my sources tell me ernie said that joels ambitions are being fuelled by the new archdeacon who fancies him summat rotten joel beards gay not as i know of but the archdeacon certainly is ernie noticed old sarah looking mystified no joel beards incorruptible im afraid whatever hes doing he thinks hes doing it for the good of mankind theyll all be coming in soon milly said despondently look at all them strangers at the brewery three of ours sacked one of theirs brought in rationalization they call it we dont see it till its happened sometimes i think all we see is shades of things aye then ernie had fallen silent thinking of a woman in a black cloak at matts funeral moira cairns former singer with matt castles band alf said that bloke hall he wouldnt accept it at first said he were convinced it were theer and if he had to dig all night hed get it out aye milly said grimly happen somebody told him somebody wanted that grave dug up so wed know there was nowt down there apart from matt oh christ oh mother i dont like this alf sat down on the footstool ernie would rest his feet on while thinking this hall he even wanted to open matts coffin thought happen bogman were in theer god in heaven said ernie joel beard he started kickin up then wouldnt let um go near said they ad no permission except for ttake coffin out like quite right too ernie said alf milly said anxiously the bottle you did get the bottle in no milly gill closed her eyes and clasped her hands together in anguish couldnt do it alf said seemed no point milly said angrily did you even try oh aye alfs hands had been dangling between his legs as he squatted on the stool ernie saw that both hands were shaking i got lid off no problem nobody were watching thank christ they were all looking at him now alf beckett soaked to the skin moustache gone limp eyes so far back in his head that they werent catching any light from ernies greenshaded desk lamp werent theer alf suddenly squealed matt werent theer nowt in tcoffin but bloody soil thered been a silence you couldve shovelled into buckets ernie could still hear it now as he stood looking over the graveyard glittering with rain and the blue light of the beacon of the moss and worms alf had said finally shaking on the little wooden footstool staring at the floor handfuls of big long worms at the window ernie dawber sighed very deeply moira awoke with this awful sense of doom set around her like a block of ice she was hot and she was cold she was sweating and she was whimpering mammy oh mammy please dont let them shed dreamed a version of the truth she was a little girl again living with her daddy and her gran in the almost posh glasgow suburb catching the bus to school grans warning shrilling in her ears and you just be sure and keep away from the old railway you hear on account of the gypsies were back the gypsies who still came every autumn to the old railway caravans in a circle like covered wagons in a western when the indians were hostile corning home from school getting off the bus the two dark skinned gypsy boys hanging round hey you moira is it the duchess wants tae see ye you leave me alone get lost huh were no gonny hurt ye you deaf i said get lost ye gonny come quietly ye wee besom or dissolve to interior a treasure cave with china and brass and gold and the most beautiful exotic woman you ever saw my youre quite a pretty child now i have something think of it as a family heirloom tell no one until youre grown guard it with your life now this rich glowing thing which would be dull and grey to most people heavy in your hand you must remember this day always you will remember it for youll never be a wee girl again and that night she had her first period guard it with your life moira sprang from her bed snapped on the light the guitar case stood where shed left it propped between a mahogany wardrobe and the wall she dragged it out lay it flat on the worn carpet the strings making wild discordant protest as she threw back the lid feeling for the feltlined pocket where might be stored such things as spare strings plectrums harmonicas and combs the door was tentatively opened and cathy appeared in rumpled pyjamas whats wrong moira was shivering in a long tshirt with sylvester the cat down the front moira whats wrong moiras voice low and catarrhal growlyrough the broken window wasny just vandals youre cold damn right im cold come downstairs ill make some tea thrusting her hand again and again into the harmonica pocket nothing she pulled out the guitar laid it on the bed turned the case upside down picked up the guitar and shook it violently and listened to nothing rattling inside when slowly she straightened up her back was hurting she felt arid derelict she felt old but inexperienced incompetent she felt like an old child numbly she reached behind the bedroom door for her cloak to cover her thin goosebumpy arms the cloak was not there theyd taken that too sam stumbled no more than twice he knew his ground didnt need no fight although he had the powerful police torch wedged in his jacket pocket case he needed to blind anybody it was pissing down sam wore his old fishing hat pulled down head into the rain never been raining when these buggersd been up here before they wouldnt like that be an advantage for him two years windblasted rained on snowed on there was a moon up there somewhere buried in clouds so the sky wasnt all that black when his eyes had adjusted he could see the outline of the hill and when he got halfway up it he could make out a couple of faint lights down on the edge of bridelow but no lights above him now moving round so hed come to the circle from the bit of a hump behind it he climbed higher a lone bluewhite disc floating into view vague through the rain and mist beacon of the moss bloody church bugger all use theyd been pair of um when he came to the bracken sam stopped stayed very still listening thought by now hed have seen their lights heard some of the chanting whatever they did sam went down on his haunches the rain spattering the bracken quietly as he could he snapped shut the breech of the gun jammed the butt under his elbow and crouched there waiting the rain corning down hard and cold muffling the moor seeping through his jacket mightve brought his waterproof except the thing would have squeaked when he moved have a hot bath when he got in slug or two of whisky sam hefted the twelvebore his mouth felt dry they were here he could feel it they were close bastards stay aggressive aggression generated heat and aggression was better than fear right sam moved in closer he reckoned he was no more than twenty yards from the circle couldnt see it yet just over this rise they were there no question but were they lying low expecting him had they somehow heard him coming sam pulled in a deep breath drawing in rainwater and nearly choking he stuck his finger under the trigger guard and went over the rise like a commando stopping just the other side legs splayed all right you fuckers he bawled nobody move and nobody moved nothing not even a rabbit in the grass only the sound of the rain battering the bracken holding the gun under his right arm sam fumbled for his torch clicked it on swirled the beam around finding one two three four five stubby stones a circle of thumbs jabbing out of the moor where are you fucking come out ill give you your bloody satan not frightened now bloody mad come on he thought about firing a shot into the bracken case they were flattened out in there but it wasnt likely was it no theyd gone he switched off the torch pushed it back in his pocket and did a degree crouching turn with the gun levelled behind him up on the moor he glimpsed a fleeting white light didnt pause to think right theyre on the run move it halfaware that he was departing from his own useless piece of moorland sam set off under a thickly clouded night sky with little light in it but an endless supply of black water his jacket heavy with it and his faithful fishing hat which once had been waterproof now dripping round his ears like a mop rag he thought of his bed and he thought of his kids and his wife who he supposed he loved really and he thought this was the stupidest bloody thing hed do this year and maybe next but but them bastards were not going to get away with it and that was that he tracked the light just one light hazy so probably a fair distance away heather under his boots now waterlogged but better than the bracken and the light was getting bigger he was closing in definitely no question two three hundred yards distant hard to be sure at night but the way the rain was coming down crackling in the heather there was no need to creep sam strode vengefully onward maybe it was due to forging on with his head down and his eyes slitted to keep the water out maybe this was why sam didnt realise for a few seconds that the light was actually coming much more quickly towards him a shapeless light bleary and steaming and coming at him through the rain faster than a man could run hey sam stopped gasping then backed away bewildered his index finger tightened involuntarily and the gun went off both barrels and sam stumbled dropping it something squelched and snagged around his ankle like a trap he went down caught hold of it curved and hard and realised sickened that he must have put his foot through the ribcage of a dead sheep pulling at the foot dragging the bones up with it he saw the light was rising from the moor in front of him misty and shimmering in the downpour and it seemed to him soaked through foot stuck in a sheep that the light had a face features forming and pulsing a face veiled by a thin muslin curtain the fabric sucked into a gaping mouth sams mouth was open too now he was screaming furiously into the rain wrenching the torch from his pocket thumbing numbly at its switch until it spurted light a brilliantly harsh directional beam making a white tunnel in the rain and mist straight up into the face where the tunnel of light ended suddenly a beam designed to light up an object eighty yards away and it shone as far as the rearing figure of light a matter of four five feet away where it died in the beam the figure of light turned into a shadow a figure of darkness and cold no sam davis wanted chanting townies in robes and masks he wanted sick stupid people wanted to see them dancing getting pissed wet through wanted to hear them praying to the fucking devil with their fire hissing and smouldering in the rain didnt want this didnt want it no when the shadow stretched and the torch beam began to shrivel as if all the light had been sucked out leaving only a thinly shining disc at the end of the torch sam felt his bowels give way all the rage and aggression slithered out of him like the guts of a slaughtered pig and the void they left behind was filled with a cold immobilizing fear lottie castle came awake in swirling darkness awakened by the cold air on her own body exposed to the night the sheets and blankets thrust away her nightdress shed her body was rolling about on the bed drenched in sweat arms and legs and stomach jerking and twitching with electricity nipples rigid and hurting whats happening whats happening she was ill her nervous system had finally rebelled against the months of agony and tension she was sick she was stricken she needed help she needed care she should be taken away and cared for she should not be alone like this not here in this great shambling mausoleum lottie began to pant with panic feeling the twisted pillow sweatsoaked under her neck as it arched and swayed she couldnt see anything not her body not the walls nor even the outline of the window behind the thin curtains it couldnt be darker but it wasnt silent and fright formed a layer of frost around lotties heart as she became aware that every muscle in her body was throbbing to the shrill sick whinny of the pennine pipes high on the night chapter iv at am the sunday sky hung low and glistened like the underside of a huge aircraft it didnt menace joel beard gods warrior skimming across the causeway hands warm in his gauntlets deep and holy thoughts protected inside his helmet his leathers unzipped to expose the cross nourished by little more than three hours sleep at chris and chantals place in sheffield he felt well reborn talked and prayed and cried and agonized until am old chums chris and chantal born again brethren still with the church of the angels of the new advent still strong in their faith i sometimes wish id never left joel reaching out for reassurance why it was your great mission joel we all knew that its terrific to carry our commitment all our certainty into the straight church but its just so lonely chantal i didnt realise how or how corrupt that there were places where the church allowed the evil to remain real evil for a quiet life a quiet life is that what its come to i mean tonight going back to the church after this fiasco with the grave it was there for anyone to see the ghastly light from the clock that isnt really a clock and all the sneering gargoyles and the place over the door where this revolting sheelagh na gig thing used to be and you realise its everywhere how many country churches have these pagan carvings the green man all kinds of devilfigures demons twisted demon faces everywhere grinning at you its our church yes yes yes the pieces of socalled character clinging to old churches like barnacles to a wreck the very aspects of ancient churches that tourists found so picturesque oh yes ive always been fond of old churches as if this was some sanctified form of tourism when really they were soaking up the satanic what it means is that the church has been sheltering this filth pressed to its own bosom for centuries what everyone finds so appealing about these old parish churches are the things that should not be there am i the only one to see this theyd brought him food and coffee made up a bed for him in the sitting room sat up half the night with him prayed with him in his agony ive had visions dreams ive been tested all the time im there im tested it tries to twist me how can i handle this im only one man no youre not only one man joel were here were in this together tens of thousands of us listen you were our emissary youve seen and youve come back we hear you joel we hear you yes he slowed for the cobbles bumping up the street towards the church its stonework black with age and evil say the word joel just say the word were with you im tired ive only been there a couple of days and im exhausted youll sleep tonight joel well cover you with our prayers youll sleep well and he had even if it was only for a few hours hed awoken refreshed and ready for his first morning worship at st brides no prepared sermon in his pocket no script no text he would stride into that pagan place and cleanse it with the strength of his faith his sermon would be unrehearsed it would almost be like speaking in tongues cathy said you look really awful thanks ive been trying to understand it cathy said dont it wont do you any good cathy pushed the fingers of both hands through her hair i mean they broke in here in this really obvious unsubtle way and they didnt take the telly or the video or even your guitar just this comb does it look valuable moira broke the end off a piece of toast and tried to eat it looks like one of those metal combs you buy for grooming dogs only not so expensive and kind of corroded like a lot of stuff over a thousand years old it looks like junk look cathy said reasonably is it not possible it just sort of slipped out when you were bringing your stuff in should i search the garden moira shook her head gave up on the toast should we call the police no no this is only guy i ever took the thing out for was matt castle and i never wanted to look im sorry your fathers had a coronary youve got this joel beard moving into your house and im rambling on about a damn comb what time are you leaving this afternoon sooner if i can cathy said shed wait for the cleaner to tell her to put joel beard in the room moira had slept in and to get alf beckett to fix the pantry window then shed pack a couple of suitcases for her father and drop them off at the poplars this home for clappedout clergy and then think about going back to oxford what are you studying at oxford this and that cathy said where will you go home moira didnt answer where was home anyway glasgow the folk circuit she felt motiveless the whitetiled rectory kitchen looked scuffed but sterile like a derelict operating theatre getting to her feet was an effort the view from the window of graves was depressing the sky was like a crumpled undersheet slightly soiled i dont know what to do moira said and the words tasted like chewedout gum when something dreadfuls going down and you dont know what it is or how you connect why do you have to connect you just came to a friends funeral you can go home can i just take it easy thats all you cant drive all the way to scotland without sleep youll have an accident why dont you book in somewhere for a night i look that bad you look like somebody walked off with your soul cathy said with this shockingly accurate perception holy communion by tradition was at but by nobody had arrived joel went to pick up a stray twig in the aisle a piece of the autumn cross the cleaners had missed he took it outside through the churchyard and dropped it on the cobbles outside the lychgate depositing it safely on secular ground on his return he glanced above the doorway where the sheelagh na gig had hung half afraid the thing would have left some murky impression of itself on the stonework beneath but there was only dust hed sent the vile plaque to be locked away in the school cellars until such time as a museum might be persuaded to take it he waited in full vestments in the vestry doorway looking over the backs of empty pews towards the altar yesterday evening hed had beckett bring the wine up from the cellar room and then had the room locked and hed taken the key and hurled it away across the moss the church clock gave a single chime for when nobody came to holy communion it didnt really surprise him how could anyone here kneel at the altar accepting the blood and body of christ knowing what they knew knowing that stipends and student grants added up to buggerall she tried to give cathy some money for the two nights accommodation cathy laughed after you were burgled moira didnt think she looked too convinced about the comb understandably perhaps they were standing by the front gate of the rectory she felt weak and washed out and cold without her cloak the raw air hurt her cheeks and made her eyes water cathy said you look like youre coming down with something hope its not this taiwanese flu moira looked down the hill towards the man ith moss either side of the cobbled street the cottages looked rough and random like rocks left by a landslide she said goodbye to cathy kissed her on the check cathys cheek felt hot and flushed moiras lips felt cracked like a hags she was remembering the day the duchess had given her the comb how shed stood before her wardrobe mirror and the old comb had stroked fluidly through her short hair like an oar from a boat sailing with the tide and the hair had seemed suddenly so lustrous and longing to be liberated and that was when it began the fiveyear war with her gran who thought children should be seen and not heard and not even seen without their hair was neatly trimmed if thats what you were thinking cathy was saying in a low voice huh i said raising her voice it wasnt dic what wasnt whoever broke in youve been indicating it was a personal thing i mean how many people would know about that comb anyway i didnt say anything you didnt have to you thought it was dic well he wouldnt do a thing like that and anyway he hes away teaching wheres he teach im not telling you cathy said her pale eyes were glassy with tears please moira it wasnt him it wasnt moira thought whats happening to her whats happening to me when she picked up her fancy lightweight suitcase and her guitar case they both felt like they were full of bricks and her hair felt lank and heavy suffocating like an iron mask as she made her way over the cobbles to the church car park in the room directly over the post office milly gill brought willie wagstaff tea in bed shouldntve bothered willie grumbled milly said im your mother now dont say that balancing her own cup and saucer in one hand the mothers were supposed to be good at balancing things she got gracefully back into bed with him she was wearing an anklelength floral nightdress tied over the breasts with an enormous pink bow she looked like a giant cuddly rabbit willie thought never more grateful for her than he had been this past night im everybodys mother now milly said miserably who else is there old sarah shit said willie i dont want it to be you milly shrugged her big shoulders and still kept the cup balanced on the saucer ive lived opposite ma for twenty years ive studied her ways best i can ive been well almost a daughterinlaw i was always led to believe willie said that ma was supposed to announce her successor theres one asll come after me and it werent you luv im sure of that no said milly but ma thought shed be around for another ten years yet i know that for a fact ma thought shed see in the millennium who can say owt like that who the hell knows how long theyve got ma knew aye but she were bloody wrong though werent she milly squeezed her lips tight makes you wonder willie said bitterly if its not a load of old garbage all of it the whole caboodle makes you bloody wonder ill not have that from you little man milly chided even if you are in grief thats part of the problem that sort of talks like decay realism more like willie said his fingers waking up stretching themselves then batting the side of his teacup in a soft chinking rhythm drink your tea youre upset we all are i just wish i could get some insight about the man aye willie said and wheres bloody matt dont bear thinking about this lot makes me think ill happen have ma cremated you never will milly sat up so suddenly she actually spilled some tea nowt as goes in yon churchyard ever bloody stays down willie protested aye all right i mean no ill not have her cremated settle down will you talk to moira i dont know milly said wasnt there talk of her getting into bad magic some while back aye and she got out again willie said you met her last night how did she seem to you all right i suppose milly said grudgingly but you cant tell i should be able to tell i know but oh willie her shoulders started to shake and she collapsed against him im out of mc depth why did she have to die like that why did she leave us because she had no choice said willie almost managing to get his arm all the way around her its no good us keep getting worked up about it whats done is done but his fingers didnt accept it they set up a wild uncontrollable rhythm on millys arm just below the shoulder ma was killed ma was killed ma was stop it milly sobbed i know i bloody know but what can we do talk to moira willie said the church clock chimed for am be late for church willie said not going milly said means nowt to me now that place hes destroyed it in one day aye willie said and the well you what him or somebody i never told you did i i forgot what with ma and everything me and moira went up there looking for ma and the well had been wrecked statue smashed right bloody mess milly rolled away from him mashing her face into her pillow in anguish im sorry lass willie said i just forgot sunday morning and the whole village was unaccountably silent moira walked to the church car park and loaded everything into the bmw it was coming up to which probably explained the silence this would be the time of the sunday morning worship she walked across to the public notice board next to the lychgate sunday holy communion morning service unless otherwise notified life will go on unless otherwise notified she no longer felt observed she wasnt worth it any more a thin bewildered scottish woman coming up to middle age and her hair turning white everything was unreal the clouds were like stone her head felt as if it was set in concrete she needed to get away to sleep and think and sleep and then maybe to find dic track the little shit down deal with this thing shed see willie and then leave she didnt feel like talking to him or to anybody but willie was the other link there were things willie could tell her and he was a churchgoer or always used to be she was probably going to have to wait until they all came out she slipped through the lychgate it began to rain quite powerfully the gargoyles glared down at her she moved quietly into the church porch but there was no feeling of sanctuary here now the sense of walking into the womb had gone with the sheelagh na gig it was merely shelter now from the rain and nothing else moira stopped hearing a voice a preachers lilt from the body of the church dearly beloved brethren the scripture moves us in sundry places to acknowledge and confess our manifold sins and wickedness and that we should not dissemble nor cloak them before the face of almighty god it was cold in the porch colder than outside she hugged herself and there was something wrong with that voice wherefore i pray and beseech you as many as are here present to accompany me with a pure heart and humble voice unto the throne of the heavenly grace saying after me the door to the church was closed she would wait for a hymn and then go in almighty and most merciful father we have erred and strayed from thy ways like lost sheep we have offended against thy holy laws and there is no health in us cathy had been right she was coming down with something a cold flu wasnt just shock she was shivering again should go back to the car turn up the heater and then it came to her what was wrong there should be responses all these lines the minister was intoning were supposed to be repeated by the congregation he was leaving the spaces to the glory of thy holy name but nobody was filling them not one person in this congregation was participating amen nobody repeated amen he might have been talking to himself holy jesus we shall sing hymn number six hundred and three round the sacred city gather she waited for the organ or the harmonium or whatever that sound they always made like they were drawing breath for the first chord there was silence only that hollow gasping ambience these places had and then the singing began round the sacred city gather egypt edam babylon all the warring hosts of error sworn against her move as one a strong and strident tenor one voice this guy was singing on his own and that was very seriously eerie moira began to feel scared get thee watchman to thy rampart gird thee warrior with thy sword trembling she pushed gently at the swingdoor opening it just an inch just enough to peer in and let out the voice louder watch to prayer lest while ye slumber stealthy foemen enter in she almost screamed let go of the door letting it swing back into place with an audible thunk that seemed to echo from the rafters im away im out of here as she ran out of the porch into the bleakly battering rain she could still see him fully robed statuesque but crazyeyed arms filing out balanced there on the steps before the altar place singing to all those empty pews all those completely empty pews she walked back along the cobbles to where she could see down the street as far as the man ith moss not a soul but the silence was more sorrowful than sinister hung down like her confidence somewhere around the soles of her shoes she looked along the blank windows of the cottages the only sign of presence was some chimney smoking cheerlessly maybe all this had something to do with the sudden death of ma wagstaff a big death and the stealing of the sheelagh the removal of the candles the toppling of the autumn cross like they didnt feel welcome in the church any more these bewildered people who no longer knew where they stood in relation to their god or their goddess she turned into the alley which led to willies house and she hammered on his door her body flattened against it come on willie come on deserted she tried a little nervously a couple of raps on the front door of the curtained cottage at the top of the street where ma wagstaff had lived and died finally she found an old envelope in the car and wrote a careful note walking back down the hill to push it into willies letterbox willie i suppose we need to talk sometime about what were going to do about maos music on the bog body i dont suppose you feel any more like it than me at the moment so ill get in touch in a few weeks time i have to go home now home where the hell was home home is where the heart is and i havent got a heart i havent got a soul i have been burgled she stood in the street and looked from window to window up and down in search of life and did not find it but then what the hell business was it of hers if the people of bridelow wanted to lie low and boycott st brides and its unsympathetic new minister and turning on her heel summoning energy from god knew where she walked crisply with determination clop clop bloody clop on the cobbles back up to the lychgate and the car almost falling into the arms of the angel bloody gabriel in white as he strode through the gate his desperate solo service abandoned im sorry he snapped and then with his hands still on her shoulders to separate their bodies he began to stare at her seeing what she figured must be this sad sluttish face no makeup hair awry maybe a low and useless anger burning fitfully in the eyes his hands dropped away from her his fists clenched he began to tremble he said who are you golden curls tight to his head van helsingsize cross looming out at her as his white linen chest swelled who are you doesnt matter moira said tonelessly im leaving now he blocked her path to the car legs apart this real big bastard in full sunday vestments humiliated in the sight of his god profile like michelangelos david or something a good head taller than she was and bellowing out in the name of god who are you woman look would you please get outa my way she said tiredly like she didnt have enough problems of her own its sunday morning he was snarling now through gritted teeth rage choking him and my church is empty there is no congregation no sidesmen no organist maybe its just your sermons are crap moira said look he said in a kind of wonder backing off his surplice billowing like a sail youre taunting me please i know who you are he was screaming it at the village i know what you are yeah im sure you do but would you please just get the hell out of my way and knew as she was saying it that she shouldnt have used the word hell his face glowed red bulging with blood she saw it corning but she didnt move she took it from his massive open hand across the side of her face from forehead to lower jaw it would have hurt her less if shed fallen but she wouldnt do that she stayed on her feet and she stared into his incandescent eyes abruptly he spun away and strode back through the gate she heard his footsteps crunching the gravel and then hitting the path finally she heard the church door crashing into place with an echo that didnt seem to fade but went on smashing from one side of her skull to the other as she moved unsteadily to her car chapter v being sunday he could park in the street right outside and wait for some movement it was a dull cold day in glasgow and a light gleamed out of the second floor of kaufmanns scuffed tenement which indicated fiona had got it right see he often works on a sunday catching up with his vat and stuff but mungo you tell him where you got this from im out the door long as you realise that lucky hed kept fionas home number he owed the kid another dinner this sunday morning convinced macbeth that being a private investigator had to be about the most tedious occupation you could have outside of accountancy the first hour the car radio kept him amused with some bizarre soapstyle drama about country folks in which nobody got killed nobody seemed to be balling anyone elses spouse but two guys nearly came to blows in an argument about milk quotas only in britain the second hour macbeth fell to contemplating the futility of his life so far the hopelessness of his quest etc and then just after pm malcolm kaufmann came out of the building and spent some time locking the door behind him kaufmann bad on a long black overcoat over a pink polo shirt macbeth followed him to a crowded chromium pub where kaufmann ordered chicken sandwiches and to macbeths dismay sat down to eat them with two other guys he obviously knew macbeth said shit a few times under his breath ordered up a sandwich and a beer sat as far away from kaufmann as he could while still keeping him in view and began to eat very slowly there were many women in the bar macbeth passed some time debating which one hed make a move on if he hadnt been an investigator on a case there was one in a dark blue velvet top who had to be wasted on the guy she was with he was drinking too much and talking to other guys she was on diet coke and probably only here to drive him home she had long dark hair which of course was nothing at all to do with macbeth picking her out no way he was getting to thinking he would make a move if only to make the womans lunchtime more memorable when malcolm kaufmann came swiftly to his feet said a rapid goodbye to his pals and made an exit weaving through the crowd with such practised agility that macbeth almost lost him couldnt be sure kaufmann wouldnt get into a car or taxi and head off home so he called after him in the street and kaufmann turned at the edge of the sidewalk and raised an eyebrow mr macbeth how very strange to see you we have to talk malcolm macbeth said trying to sound tough of course we must arrange a time like now oh dear said kaufmann this sounds serious what can the fair moira have been up to macbeth walked right up to him there was a cab idling not ten yards away and he was taking no chances we need to talk about a man he said name of john peveril stanage ashton thought he should tell her himself maybe test the water a bit also he liked a pint around sunday lunch when he got the time unable despite his divorce to shake himself out of the feeling that sunday lunchtime was special and he couldnt deny he was becoming quite fascinated by this place a bit of old england only twenty miles from factories and warehouses muck and grime and petty crime he drove across the moss in his own vehicle the japanese sports car which was his first independent purchase with the bit of money left over after paying off his wife a gesture ashton realised now that gillian was probably right it was bloody pathetic to buy a car like this at his age lump of flash tat and he could never even remember what bloody make it was oh she said looking up to serve him its you no curiosity he noticed but then if they had recovered anything from that grave be all over the village wouldnt it just thought i should officially inform you mrs castle he said confidentially across the bar that we didnt find what we were looking for im sorry we had to put you through this there were no more than a dozen customers in the man some had looked up when he came in made a change most pubs they could smell a copper the same way he could scent illegal odours amidst tobacco smoke always somebody in a pub with something to hide whether theyd been flogging nicked videos or their mot was overdue you have your job to do lottie castle said she seemed weary strained nervy still looking good though hed not been wrong about that tragedy suited some women something about recent widows murder victims wives especially stripped of all need for pretendglamour they acquired this harsh unadorned quality the real woman showing through sometimes this excited him must be getting warped price of thirty years in the job i had the feeling yesterday he said that you thought we might have found something she said wouldnt have surprised me either way the bog body wasnt it somebody told you he wondered why she should make him think of murder victims wives call it intuition lottie said what you having pint of black youll be the only one she said when he raised an inquiring eyebrow she told him another bunch of jobs had gone working men replaced by men in white coats brought in from across the moss rumours that gannons might even close the brewery altogether transferring all production of bridelow black to their new plant outside matlock never said ashton how can you brew bridelow black in matlock how can you brew german lager in bradford said lottie people dont care any more theyve got the name thats all that matters thought the lads here were looking a bit cheesed ashton nodded at the customers lottie said gannons have apparently got tests showing the local spring water doesnt meet european standards of purity cost a substantial amount to decontaminate it added to which the equipments antiquated wheres the business sense in preserving some scruffy little deadend village brewery on the wrong side of a bog bloody tragic ashton said and meant it just about finish bridelow i reckon peopleve got to have work lottie said theyll move out schoolll shut churchll be operating every fourth sunday still want this better make it a bottle of newcastle ashton said i wouldnt like to cause an incident the rots already set in im afraid lottie said pulling a bottle from under the bar general store closed last week chip shops on its last legs how long the post officell keep a suboffice here is anybodys guess not good for you either dozen customers on a sunday be a few hikers in later lottie said listlessly i was told ashton said smoothly raising his voice a little that some folk reckon all the bad luck thats befallen this village is due to that bogman being removed from the bog behind him conversation slowed to a trickle thats stupid lottie said you see thats why we thought somebody mightve had the idea of bringing it back to bridelow and where better to put it than at the bottom of an existing grave done it before apparently according to my source and who might that be asked frank manifold snr from behind his half of draught bass ashton didnt turn round surprising as it may seem mrs castle i can understand it the way people might be feeling problem is were talking about a prize specimen here experts from all over the world made plans to come and see it its almost unique invaluable and so you see the police are under quite enormous pressure to get it back there was no reaction from lottie castle he was pretty sure now that she knew nothing well ashton sucked some of the creamy froth from his brown ale i suspect were going to have to disrupt peoples lives something terrible if we dont find it soon by this time the silence behind him sounded thick enough to sit on of course he said if the bogman was in bridelow or say back in the moss and somebody was to tell us anonymously precisely where then personally i cant see us taking it any further ashton felt that if he fell off his stool the silence would probably support him now another piece of information thats come my way mrs castle he went on is that a certain gentleman has agreed to provide sufficient money to create a permanent exhibition centre for the bogman and that this centre might well be established here in bridelow thus ensuring that the bogman remains in his old home and that the hundreds of tourists who come to see him will spend a few bob in the village and perhaps have a drink or two in this very pub perfect solution you ask me whats your own feeling mrs castle my feeling lottie began to breathe hard she started to straighten glasses to steady her hands he thought yes he said your feeling lottie didnt look at ashton nor past him at the other customers just at the glasses i hope you never find it she said in a voice like cardboard he said nothing caused enough upset she started to set up a line of upturned glasses on the bar top and you know i dont really think i care what happens to this village ill tell you mr ashton anybody wants this pub they can have it for a song you fancy a pub supplement your police pension bit of country air he could see tears in her eyes hard as contact lenses views she said lovely views mrs castle he said please im sorry peat she shrieked slicing a hand through the line of glasses so that the last two instantly smashed against the beer pumps you want peat peat peat and more fucking peat cassock windwhipped around his ankles joel stood looking down the village street his back to the church notice board his face soaked by rain and by sweat the sweat of rage and humiliation he shouldnt have struck her it was unpremeditated but it was wrong and yet because the woman was an incarnation of evil it was also rather unsatisfactory shall not suffer a witch to live until the arrival of the sounddrenching rain and wind hed contemplated delivering his sermon from the middle of the street denouncing the denizens of bridelow to their own front doors what a damning indictment of hans gruber this was hans who packed the church at least twice on sundays a stranger who had been accepted by the villagers as one of their own one of their own hans turning a blind eye to the lone blackclad figure in the churchyard before the funeral the hooded figure clearly exuding not respect nor monastic piety but a heathen arrogance and gruber the quisling screaming at him joel put it back as he snatched the bottle from the coffin joel looked down the street towards mrs wagstaffs cottage its curtains were drawn upstairs and down this was another deliberate insult ill come to church for hans grubers services but ill not even leave my bed for yours he began to shake with rage obviously after the incident at the well the harridan had poisoned his name in bridelow the street was deserted he strode to the telephone kiosk in front of the post office the answer was clear if as a christian he had been rejected by the resident congregation then he must summon his own just get me out of here get me across those hills and you can break down she said or do what the fuck you like she had this sore throat now cathy had been talking about some kind of taiwanese flu whatever the hell that was it sounded like the bmw had it too i get across these hills moira told the car im gonny book you into a garage and me into a hotel that looks sufficiently anonymous and then i think im gonny die quietly out of the corner of an eye the bmw making noises like kenny savage in the lavatory the morning after shed seen the dead tree on the moss again it didnt move but it didnt look so obviously dead any more a white light shining like a gemstone in its dragons eye shed closed her own eye the eye which was letting in the image of the tree and this hurt it was the side of her face joel beard had slapped maybe the eye had gone black she couldnt bring herself to look in the mirror i cant believe he got away with that normally id have torn the bastards balls off the bmw retched like it was about to throw up its oil or something maybe you didnt understand me she gripped the wheel shaking it maybe you only understand german in which case youll never know that if you dont get me to that hotel im gonny trade you in pal in the drivingmirror through the rain coming down like sheet metal now she could see the spikes of st brides church maybe two miles back across the moss and youll be bought at auction by some loony teararse seventeenyearold looking for something fast and sleek to smash up and get killed in yeah yelling at the car because she didnt want to hear anything else coming at her through the rain and the engine noise didnt want to touch the radiocassette machine on account of there was a tape inside with the late matt castle on it matt coming seriously unspooled her head ached and her hair felt heavy and greasy just awful she pushed it away from her eyes the moss had gone from the mirror it was all scrubby moorland with dark unfinished drystone walls like slippery piles of giant sheepshit she came to a signpost and hesitated then pointed the car at the place that sounded biggest and closest buxton some kind of inland resort with hotels listen hen what you do is you book into the biggest plushest hotel they have there like the buxton hilton or whatever and you take several aspirins and you get a nights sleep and then you do some hard thinking you can still think ok you can still function the comb is merely an artefact invested with symbolism by you and by your mammy and however many other gypsies have had it in their goldencrusted fists but to claim it holds part of your spirit your essence your living consciousness is just ridiculous sentiment right sure the buxton road doubled back round the moss to the bridelow moors in a steep curving climb with what seemed like a sheer cliff going up on one side and another sheer cliff coming down on the other with just a low drystone wall between ms moira cairns and a long long drop into what being largely invisible through this sheeting rain might just possibly be hell come on come on the bmw was faltering its engine straining like the big rubber band that powered it was down to its last strand sweating she flung the damn thing into third gear and then into second revving like crazy except the engine didnt it stalled in the middle of a twisting narrow road barely halfway up a hill that looked about three times as steep now the bmw wasnt actually ascending it any more this bastard stalled oh shit hauling on the handbrake im really screwed this time first time any car had broken down on her for maybe ten years also coincidentally the first time shed had flu or whatever the hell it was in maybe five and worst of all worst of all the handbrake couldnt hold it now look treading hard on the foot brake it isnt that the cables snapped or somebodys been messing with it its just stretched too far garagell have it fixed in ten minutes what you have to do now assuming you get to the bottom of this hill ok you have to shove this car into the nearest grass verge then get out and walk through the filthy rain without ok the benefit of a mac or an umbrella until you come to a phone box or somebodys house malcolm was always on at her to install a car phone no way shed said malcolm said when you want to be incommunicado you can just switch it off she said incommunicado is my middle name malcolm so wheres the point in paying out fifty quid a month but its taxdeductible moira she wanted to scream with the terminal frustration of it if she managed by some miracle piece of driving to deposit this magnificent piece of kraut technology at the bottom of this bottomless hill that was when her real problems would begin she didnt scream her throat was hurting too much already gently oh so bloody gently she let out the brake and allowed the car to slip backwards down the hill which now seemed almost fucking vertical twisting her neck round over her shoulder to try and track the curves in the streaming wet road not much to see anyway but rain and more rain she was no damn good at this never been able to master that mirrorimage coordination you needed for reversing thing is to stay well into the left hard against the sheer cliff ok steepish hill thats all it is the one going up and god if i can make it to the bottom in one piece i will walk through this filthy blinding rain for ten miles hear me this roaring in her ears it had to be the blood flushed up there by concentration and the flu letting out the brake going backwards in short bursts then jamming on feeling the wheels lock and slide on the rainfilmed road ok easy youre ok just as long as nothings coming up behind you then alarmingly she was going backwards in a sudden spurt and when she jammed on the brakes it made hardly any difference and the breath locked in her swollen throat staring helpless as the cars rear end suddenly slid out into the middle of the narrow carriageway skimming over the central white line the tail end skidding off aiming itself at the crumbling stones no more than two feet high set up between the road and hell oh my christ scared now like really scared moira tried to jam both feet on to the footbrake straightening her legs out hard heaving her back into the seat until it creaked the pressure forcing her head back and around until she was staring out of the front windscreen the car slipping back all the while it was like going up the down escalator in one of those panicking nightmares only with the thing on at triple speed and a wall on one side and an endless open liftshaft on the other and the brakes were definitely full on and gripping while the car was sliding backwards on the rainslashed road and moiras cars were full of this dark turbulence turning her vision black black black black black it said bridelow black across the cab of the massive dripping truck powering down on the bmw like some roaring prehistoric beast oh christ get it into first gear she was starting to scream out loud plunging the clutch down grinding the gearstick but there was nowhere to go the windscreen full of black the trucks engine bellowing then scornfully clearing its throat as with no great effort it prodded the little car and moira cairns through the disintegrating drystone wall and the shimmering curtain of rain and over the roads edge into the endless mist beyond chapter vi the old clergyman across the lounge was deeply asleep in his chair head back mouth open lifetime of begging you see hans gruber explained to his daughter hes turned into an offertory box you go over there drop a pound coin in his trap and itll suddenly snap shut clack another quid for the steeple fund hans smiled cathy said youre feeling better then until i stand up and a stroll to the loo is like the london marathon but its always better when you get out of hospital even coming here the poplars was a georgian house with a modern singlestorey extension set amid flat tidy raindaubed fields where cheshire turned imperceptibly into shropshire there were all kinds of trees in the grounds except cathy had noted actual poplars nearly as exciting as leighton buzzard hans said makes me realise how much i love bridelow its hardness its drama cathy said nothing right now bridelow had more drama than beirut could handle hans leaned forward in the chair lowered his voice even though apart from the rev offertory box they were alone in the lounge im finished arent i cathy im out bollocks cathy said with less conviction than the choice of word implied hans shook his head really wouldnt mind so much if it was going to be anybody but joel thinks hes a new christian but hes actually more set in his ways than that poor old sod cathy squeezed his hand youll be back in no time no i wont joel you see hes like one of those chaps in the old westerns come to clean up bridelow vocation and simon fleming sees joel as his vocation and as long as hes archdeacon joel might have bitten off more than he can chew pop he put on his first sunday service this morning and nobody came youre not serious cathy watched her fathers mouth briefly wrestling with a most unchristian spontaneous delight honest to god pop a totally unorganised boycott you know what bridelows like sort of communal consciousness apparently a few people started to drift along got as far as the churchyard realised the usual merry throng was not gathering as usual and toddled off home does your heart good doesnt it certainly not said hans recovering his gravitas its actually quite stupid just get his back up and then hell do something silly i dont mean go crying to simon or the bishop or anyone hes too arrogant hell want to sort it out himself damn hans looked gloomy that was really quite stupid of them i cant believe ma wagstaff allowed it ah cathy lowered her eyes hans was wearing tartan bedroom slippers somebody must have had a battle to get him into those whats wrong im sorry pop cathy swallowed something i havent told you hans went very still the customers didnt stay long after lottie had her flareup led by tactful frank manifold snr they drank up smartish what about you pal frank said to inspector ashton as he deposited his empty glass on the bar top havent you got some traffic to direct or summat lottie said its ok frank its me im overwrought she turned to ashton have another on the house no this chaps right ashton said youve enough problems without me no lottie said i want your advice ive had intruders then joel arrived to take up residence at bridelow rectory and found alfred beckett replacing a broken window in the pantry he stood over the little man perhaps he ventured sarcastically some explanation was due well mr beckett thumbed a line of putty into the windowframe i would have been theer like never missed a morning service in thirty year except in an emergency like this problem here which as mr beard could see he was at this moment putting right before it started raining again causing everything in the pantry to be soaked through and ruined mr beckett joel snarled you are the organist aye said mr beckett uncomfortably thats true like but but nothing you knew there would be no congregation you knew no one would come nay said mr beckett nobody come well bugger me joel felt a red haze developing behind his eyes he wondered briefly if the hypocritical little rat hadnt smashed the rectory window himself as a lame excuse for his nonappearance bloody vandals mr beckett said expertly sliding in the new pane of glass never used to get no vandalism in this village and thats a fact mr beard joel stared at him youre nobbut a thick bloody vandal wi no more brains than pig shit joel snatched the ball of putty from the windowledge and sent it with a splat to the pantry floor mrs wagstaff he said icily mrs wagstaff is behind all this nay said mr beckett why cant any of you people tell the truth this devious little man was the only villager who derived a small income from the church and doubtless could not afford to lose it when i came past her cottage not half an hour ago mrs wagstaff had not yet deigned to draw back her curtains what pray is your interpretation of that mr beckett scraped up his ball of putty cause shes bloody dead he said why dyou think feeling his holy rage congealing into a hideous mess joel walked numbly through the kitchen down the hall and into hans grubers study had the old woman spoken to neighbours of her encounter yesterday by the pagan shrine he remembered with no pleasure now the gratification hed allowed himself to feel as he left her in the churchyard and watched her stumping angrily away the feeling that he finally had her on the run had she run hard enough to bring on a stroke to give her a heart attack was there a general feeling that he joel was responsible for her death and for hanss collapse at the graveside was that what this was all about joel sat bowed across hanss desk his fingers splayed over his eyes was this to be his reward for following his christian instincts reacting fiercely and publicly as gods blunt instrument was it joel lowered his hands and saw a tower of books before him on the desk amidst the acceptable routine theology he saw inflammatory titles as the celtic way the virgin and the goddess pagan celtic britain the celtic creed the tenets of witchcraft evidence of hanss attempts to rationalise this evil the way one might seek to explain crime in era of social deprivation when it came to basics joel had no great illusions about himself he was not a scholarly man his strength was well literally that his strength he wasnt going to be able to work in this study hed lock the door on hanss collection of pornography just as hed locked the dungeon door behind him anterooms to hell both of them with a sweep of his arm which sent the books in the pile spinning to the four corners of the room he experienced again the sublime grace of movement hed felt as he leaned from the ladder and slashed the cord which bound the autumn cross bound to be casualties but he would go on he must she led him out of the back door to an old barn of a place only a few yards from the main building unlocked the door how did they get in ashton asked i dont know no windows forced lottie shook her head bewildered whats been taken lottie still shaking her head nothing nothing i can see ashton looked hard at her and let her see that he was looking was this a windup or was there a mental problem he didnt think so she was standing in the middle of the barn hands on hips the sleeves of a bulky scandinaviantype cardigan pushed up to the elbows she had firm strong arms mrs castle i know you think im off my head i didnt say anything well me too mr ashton i think i must be cracking up gary he said and id like to help if i can you not got better things to do one of the lads was saying theres a big police hunt up on the moors thats south yorkshires ashton said our manor finishes just this side of the moss well help if were asked but weve not been asked im offduty anyroad whore they looking for farmer dont ask me his name went off after some trespassers last night and didnt come back had his shotgun with him thats the worry why you think it might be the same hooligans broke in here lottie shook her head again it wasnt so much a denial ashton thought as an attempt to shake something out but then he said gently there wasnt a breakin here was there mrs castle there had tove been lottie said quietly insistent theres no other explanation ashton sat down on the edge of a dusty old couch next to a black thing that made him think of a dead animal all skin and bones he saw mrs castle glance at it briefly and recoil slightly whats this ashton was curious there was a flute bit sticking out of it with airholes that lottie said thats the pennine pipes mr ashton primitive kind of bagpipe my husbands instrument woke me she hesitated woke me up mr ashton about two oclock this morning what did them the pipes somebody down here playing the pipe you think i could mistake that noise after living with it twentyodd years ashton experienced a sensation like the tip of a brittle fingernail stroking the nape of his neck he said what did you do well i didnt go down said lottie thats for sure perhaps somebody wanted to frighten you mrs castle she said when you got matts coffin out did you no ashton said we had no reason and no right to disturb your husband she said do you mind if we go outside after you ashton said he pulled the wooden door into place behind them quite thankful to be out of there himself place was like a mausoleum without a tomb lottie castle sniffed and one side of her mouth twitched in latent selfcontempt you know what its like when youre alone or maybe you dont yes he said i do things that would otherwise seem totally crazy go through your head true and with you lot digging up his grave i thought well it was as if he was lottie castle thrust open the kitchen door ashton followed her in quietly shut the door behind them and stood with his back to it i didnt catch that he said as if he was what as if youd let him out lottie castle said in a parched monotone looking down at the flags and hed come back for his pipes she turned her back on gary ashton and walked over to the stove listen ashton said wondering if he was cracking up this piping was it like im sorry any particular tune no she said no particular tune she was silent a moment then she said when matt used to get the pipes out hed flex the bag a bit get the air circulating make all these puffing wheezing noises and then a few trills up and down the scale warming up you know getting started lottie placed both palms on the hotplate covers matt castle getting warmed up she said that was what i thought heard hans moistened his lips with his tongue cathy got up ill fetch you a cup of tea no her father moved in his chair winced no its all right i he looked quietly down at his knees for a while then he said they were talking about a plastic one back at the hospital you know i said to leave it a while i said i was seeing a very experienced private therapist cathy smiled wasnt working though was it no hans sighed she was talking the last time i saw her about something getting in and sapping her powers perhaps it was intimations of mortality that was her way of expressing it that she was corning to the end of her useful life and maybe she could see the end as well of over a thousand years of tradition and im wondering too if this is going to be the end of it cathy said nothing hans said bit of a rag bag the mothers arent they now nobody to really take over nobody with mas authority milly gill i dont think so do you nice woman but too soft in the nicest way of course and the rest of the village well modern times modern attitudes general loss of spirituality i blame the eighties mrs thatcher all that greed all that materialism some of it had to find its way across the moss sooner or later its still a good place pop in essence yes as long as that essence remains im very much afraid the essence has gone cathy thought theyd never come as close as this to discussing it hed always been too busy organising things fudging the issue the issue being that the parish priest in bridelow must become partially blind and partially deaf this also was a tradition in the old days which in this instance meant as recently as last year it wasnt possible to get to bridelow brewery without passing the hall the hall was built on a slight incline with heathery rock gardens ernie dawber could remember when the old horsedrawn beer drays used to follow the semicircular route which took them under the drawingroom window for the children admire the horridges were always proud of their shire horses the stable block had been a very fine building indeed with a victorian pagoda roof now it was decaying amid twisted trees grown from hedges long untrimmed no horses any more it was heavy trucks and different entrances no obvious link between the brewery and the hall liz horridge ernie thought must be feeling a bit bereft he shouldnt have left it so long there was no excuse the hall itself to be honest wasnt looking too good either big holes in the rendering gardens a mess arthur horridge would have a fit ernie was merely saddened at another symptom of the change gettin a bit whimsy ernie leave me alone ma give me a break eh fifty yards below the house the drive went into a fork the other road leading to the brewery by eck ernie dawber said stopping to look for suddenly the brewery was more impressive than the hall in the past it had always been discreet concealed by big old trees but now some of the biggest had been felled to give the victorian industrial tower block more prominence gannonss doing had they made out a case for the brewery as an historic building and got a government grant to tart it up bloody ironic eh they sack half the workforce talk about shifting the operation to matlock but if theres any money going for restoration theyll have it happen turn it into a museum theyd even finished off repairing the old pulley system for the malt store briefly abandoned last may was it how soon we forget when a rope had snapped and andy hodgson had fallen to his death accidental death official coroners verdict no blame attached dont want to put a damper on things ernest but summats not right go away ma he had to stop this snatches of ma wagstaff had been bobbing up and down in his brain ever since hed awakened like an old tune thatd come from nowhere but you couldnt get rid of it reminding him of his commitment get him back and if i dont if i fail what then he could only think of one answer to that one hed thought of before and it had made him laugh and now it didnt well nagged from beyond the grave you wouldnt credit it ernie straightened his hat girded up his gaberdine turned his back on the brewery which suddenly offended him and hurried up to the hall he pressed the bellpush and heard the chimes echo as if from room to room within the house even as he pressed again he knew there was nobody inside so she doesnt come down to the village any more well shes always been a bit aloof not a local woman only to be expected with this bad feeling about the brewery she supposed to subject herself to that when it wasnt her fault but you ernest nowt to stop you going to see her ma she were in a shocking state banging her fists on mas door please please like this please liz ernie sheltering under the overhanging porch as the rain came harder answer the door eh he remembered attending her wedding back in would it be this highborn highbreasted cheshire beauty niece of lord benfold on the arm of a grinning arthur horridge boisterous with pride free ale all round that night in the man sturdy lass ma wagstaff had observed they were already calling her ma back in the fifties never pegged her own washing out ill bet ma talking then as if eliza horridge were nowt to do with her as if there was no secret between them it was years before ernie had put two and two together put me hand on her shoulder and she nearly had hysterics i want ma i want ma oh lord liz answer the bloody door please hans said i realised a long time ago where the essence was that a real centre of spirituality was what was important that what kind of spirituality it was was to a large extent irrelevant you say you realised cathy said slowly did that come in a blinding flash or were you tutored perhaps both they started work on your mother to begin with through the welldressing she was always interested in flowers hans laughed painfully can you imagine doing it through something as utterly innocuous as flower arranging millicent gill it was taught her only a kid at the time but shed been born into it flowers petal pictures pretty yes cathy said then flowers in the church nothing strange about that but in this kind of quantity used to look like kew gardens in august i remember and the candles coloured candles and the statues i remembered commenting to the bishop old tom warrender in those days canny old devil about the unexpected anglo catholic flavour but they still turn up in force on a sunday dont they hans he said and then he patted me on the shoulder as if to say dont knock it when youre winning of course even then i knew we werent talking about anglocatholicism not in the normal sense anyway and then when wed been here a few years your mother went into hospital to have you and barney which reminds me pop barney called from brussels hell be over to see you before the end of the week no need tell him theres no telling him anything you know that go on when mum was in hospital i was approached by alf beckett frank manifold and willie wagstaff they said the house was no place to bring families into far too dismal and shabby give them a couple of hours and they and a few of the other lads would redecorate the place top to bottom be a nice surprise for your mother welcomehome present from the village i didnt know about that of course you didnt anyway i said it was very good of them and everything but the mess dont you worry about that vicar they said you wont even have to see it until its done weve arranged accommodation for you ah said cathy theyd installed a bed in the little cellar under the church said hans the place had been aired chemical toilet in the passage washbowl kettle all mod cons of course i knew i was being set up but what could i do hans paused i spent two nights down there and cathy discovered she was leaning forward gripping the leatherette arms of her chair and what dont expect me to tell you what happened i came out to put it mildly a rather more thoughtful sort of chap than when i went in cant explain it i think it was a test i think i passed i hope i passed but you didnt want joel sleeping down there god no the difference being that id been there a few years by then i was halfway to accepting certain aspects of bridelow they knew that somebody took a decision that the vicar should be presented to her i think i think if i hadnt been ready if i hadnt been considered sufficiently what tolerant i suppose openminded then probably nothing would have happened probably nothing would have happened with joel but i didnt want him down there i dont want to sound superior or anything but that boy could spend fifty years in bridelow and still not be ready cathy said realising this wasnt going to do much for her fathers recovery suppose suppose he did spend a night down there and he was already worked up after that business at the funeral and he stirred something up brought something on suppose he was tested and failed well hans said theres an old story ernie dawber once told me about what really happened when that bishop spent a night down there in eighteen whenever they say he went totally bloody bonkers hans patted cathys hand but then he said wouldnt have been much of a story at all if he hadnt would it there was a loud urgent rapping on willies front door which could only be milly who knew the door was hardly ever locked certainly not when willie was at home but whod knock anyway for emphasis when it was something important willie had been rereading moiras note it had been a relief at first didnt think he could really apply himself to matts bogman music not right now not the way he was feeling but what did she mean i have to go home why did she have to go so quickly she couldnt wait to say tara aye he shouted come in lass willie she stood panting in the doorway her flowery frock darkspotted with rain i were just going to make some toast for me tea you want some willie she said come and see this s up youve got to see it milly gasped its pissing down ill need me mac never mind that she pulled him out of the door dragged him up the entry and into the street look its a bus said willie a big green singledecker was jammed into the top of the street outside the post office thin rivers of rain were running down the cobbles around its back wheels on the back of the bus it said hattersleys travel sheffield coach tour willie said puzzled coaches would come to bridelow quite often in the old days in summer admittedly not on a wet sunday at the end of october look milly said about forty people had alighted from the coach mostly young people in jeans and bright anoraks a small circle had gathered around the unmistakable goldentopped figure of joel beard they stepped forward in turn men and women to hug him praise god willie heard as he and milly moved further up the street he heard the phrase repeated several times willie looked at milly through the lashing rain what the bloody hells this milly nodded towards two young men unwrapping a long white banner gothic golden lettering explained everything to milly anyway who the bloody hell said willie are the angels of the new advent theyve got a church in sheffield me cousins daughter nearly became one about a year ago theyre fundamentalist born again christians willie they see the world as one big battleground god versus satan like the world cup its not funny willie this is what youve dragged me out to see a bloody biblepunchers outing youre not getting this are you willie luv millys greying hair was streaming her dress was soaked through willie noticed with a quick stirring of untimely excitement that she wasnt wearing a bra what im saying if youll listen milly hissed is that theyre god and were satan a short time later milly heard a small commotion and looked out of the post office window to see a group of people assembled in the centre of the street between the lychgate and the rectory one of them was joel beard someone held up the trumpet end of a loudhailer and handed a plastic microphone to joel god is here he blasted god is here in bridelow you are all invited to a special service at eight pm to rededicate the church in his name milly felt a terrible trepidation obviously none of the villagers would turn up but what effect was it going to have all these no doubt wellmeaning but dangerously misguided people stirring up the atmosphere this is an official announcement bridelow has tonight been formally repossessed by the lord heathens out someone yelled heathens out part eight john peveril stanage from dawbers secret book of bridelow unpublished men what part have men really played in the history of bridelow not perhaps if we are honest a distinguished one except for our late friend the man in the moss who we are told gave his life for our community we have i suppose dealt with the more mundane elements the business matters employment the sustenance of a measure of wealth enough anyway to keep our heads above the moss and we that is male members of the dawber family have acted as local chroniclers albeit discreet ones for i am sure that if this present manuscript were ever to see the light of day our sofar hereditary function as the compilers of the dull but worthy book of bridelow would cease immediately to be a tolerated local tradition but as for the important things in life and death well all that traditionally is the preserve of the women and as far as most of the men have been concerned they are welcome to it we are in the modern parlance a goddessorientated society although the role of the christian deity is more than politely acknowledged thank you mother and you too sir is one of our phrases however men being men there have been occasional attempts to disrupt the arrangement and when a man is possessed of abilities beyond the normal and a craving for more then i am afraid the repercussions may be tragic and longlasting chapter i macbeth pumped money into the coinbox all the loose change he had a young female voice said this is hang on i cant make it out two four oh six i think i dont live here ive just picked up the phone macbeth could hear a lot of people talking excitedly in the background he said can i uh speak with moira moira cairns this is bridelow rectory sure i need to speak with moira can you get her to the phone im sorry im pretty sure we havent got a moira weve got a maureen would you like to speak to her the glass of the phone booth was streaked with rain it was going dark all he could see were the lights of a fastfood joint over the road didnt even know which town this was hed just kept stopping at phones ringing this number first time anyone had answered the young female voice asked are you still there yeah yeah im still here listen ask around willya moira cairns i chrissake she has to be there there was a long pause then im sorry the female voice said coldly your speech is profane goodbye and hung up on him hung up the fucking phone just like that macbeth raced out of the booth and across the street bought a burger with a tenpound note and got plenty of change the burger was disgusting after two bites he tossed it into a waste bin and took his change back to feed the phone he wasnt about to waste this number all the time it had taken to obtain it the call to the earl the waiting around for malcolm kaufmann the blackmail i called the earl this morning malcolm you remember the earl the man who asked if this rory mcbain who was booked to entertain his guests could perhaps be replaced by moira cairns this coming back to you malcolm the way the earl was prepared to uh oil the wheels this last item was a lucky guess the earl having denied any suggestion of making it worth kaufmanns while none the less it had gone in like a harpoon spearing malcolm to the back of his executive swivel chair see the longer it takes for me to find her malcolm the more likely it seems im gonna have to reveal to moira the extent of your cooperation in this uh small deception at which malcolm had pursed his lips and written upon his telephone memo pad a phone number all he had he swore it moira had phoned yesterday left this emergencyonly contact number along with a message no gigs until further notice she done this kind of thing before all too often mr macbeth on top of the coinbox macbeth had three pounds and a couple of fiftypence coins he dialled again this time it was a different voice male macbeth said whos that this is chris chris macbeth said right listen chris i need to speak with moira moira cairns you know her oh said chris you rang a few minutes ago you were abusive apparently je macbeth tightened his grip on the phone calmed himself im sorry just i was in a hurry its kind of urgent chris please look chris said were strangers here why dont you speak to joel just hang on macbeth fed a fiftypence coin into the phone presently a different guy came on this is the reverend joel beard who am i speaking to uh my name is macbeth i was told i could get moira cairns on this number but nobody seems to know her so maybe if i describe her shes very beautiful has this dark hair with with a vein of white the voice enunciated slowly and heavily macbeth breathed out well thank christ i was beginning to think id been fed a bunch of what i said what did you say your name was macbeth thats m a c ah thats an assumed name i suppose id heard you people liked to give yourselves the names of famously evil characters as a way of investing yourselves with their what shall we call it unholy glamour huh listen friend i dont have time for a debate but its now widely recognised that the famously evil as you call him macbeth was in fact seriously misrepresented by shakespeare for political reasons and uh maybe to improve the storyline he shoving in a pound coin jeez what am i doing i dont want to get into this kind of shit all i want is to talk with moira cairns is that too much to ask what the fuck kind of show you running there a silence clearly the guy had won himself an attentive audience the woman youre seeking the voice clipped and cold has been driven away as the voice rose will be all of your kind you can inform your disgusting friends that as from this evening the village of bridelow erstwhile seat of satan has been officially repossessed by almighty god yeeeessss the background swelled the phone obviously held aloft to capture it a whole bunch of people in unison praise god and they hung up macbeth stood in the rain washed booth cradling the phone in both hands jesus christ he said back in his hirecar windows all steamedup he slumped against the headrest is this real i mean is it the duchess had indicated moira had gone to this north of england village for the purpose of laying to rest the spirit of her old friend matt castle whichever way you wanted to take that whatever it meant it had clearly left the local clergy profoundly offended but while macbeths knowledge of northern english clerical procedure was admittedly limited the manner of response from the guy calling himself the reverend joewhoever and what sounded like his backing group was to say the least kind of bizarre wherever she goes that young woman shes bound to be touched with madness yeah yeah cant say i wasnt warned but there is a point at which you actually get to questioning yourself about how much is real or to what extent you are permitting yourself to be absorbed into someone elses fantasy but not unwillingly surely well no not yet truth is its kind of stimulating the time was macbeth left the car and returned to the diner across the street on the basis that one sure way of restoring a sense of total reality would be another attempt to consume a greasy quarterpound shitburger and double fries about an hour ago before leaving glasgow hed found a sundayopening bookshop where he bought a road atlas and a paperback he laid the paperback on his table next to the shitburger the cover showed a huge cavern full of stalactites and stalagmites the angle of vision was rooflevel and way down in the lefthand corner was a small kid with a flashlight the book was called blue johns way from inside the title page macbeth learned it had been first published some thirty years ago and this was apparently the seventeenth paperback impression on the inside cover it said the author john peveril stanage has emerged as one of the half dozen bestloved childrens writers of the twentieth century basing his compelling stories on the history myths and legends of the peak district and the southern pennines of which he has an unrivalled knowledge he has ensnared the imagination of millions of young readers the world over mr stanages work has been translated into more than fifteen languages and won him countless awards not overenlightening and there was no picture but then macbeth thought the guy didnt exactly look like a favourite uncle maybe the publishers figured hed scare the readers but then again that was obviously part of his intention if blue johns way was typical a quote on the back from some literary asshole on the london guardian said the book conveyed a powerful sense of adolescent alienation the bookseller had told macbeth a growing number of adults were hooked on stanages stories for kids apparently he was becoming a minor cultfigure like c s lewis in america im told the bookseller said his books arent even marketed as childrens fiction any more that so macbeth whose reading rarely extended beyond possible miniseries material had never previously heard of stanage he live down in where is it the english peak district hes publishing under false pretences if he isnt you got any idea precisely where a shrug negative this morning under pressure the earl had admitted to macbeth that he personally had been unfamiliar with the work of moira cairns until a member of the celtic bond steering committee had drawn his attention to it yes all right forcefully drawn his attention so it was stanage who was insistent moira should be hired for this particular occasion he was keen yes how keen hes a great admirer of her work tell me earl why is mr stanage on your steering committee well because hes a great authority on an aspect of celtic studies the english element which is often neglected and because hes hes very influential and also rich macbeth thought that above all the crucial factor the reason youre taking all this shit from me earl the reason you deigned to accept this call at all macbeth propped the paperback against a sauce bottle and reread the blurb john clough is an unhappy boy growing up fatherless in a remote village in me northern hills he has never been able to get on with his mother or his sisters who live in a strange world of their own from which john as the only male is excluded at weekends he spends most of his time alone in the spectacular limestone caverns near his home where he forms a special bond with the spirits of the deep with the spirits help john discovers the dark secret his mother has been hiding and sets out to find his true identity macbeth went back to the counter ordered up a black coffee and opened up the roadatlas how long you figure it would take me to get to uh manchester england never been pal five hours pends how fast you drive last night macbeth had called his secretary in new york to find out how seriously they were missing his creative flair and acumen his secretary said he should think about coming home his mom was working too hard which meant his mom was working them too hard and therefore enjoying him being out of the picture so no hassle five hours a short hop but they claimed moira had been given an assisted passage out of town the woman youre seeking has been driven away so she might no longer be in that area but she would not be the easiest person to get rid of if she still had unfinished business macbeth was getting that holy grail feeling again the one big thing what the fuck he climbed back into the metro started up the motor chapter ii right let the dog see the rabbit that the photo paul ta got to be him sarge not necessarily lad all sorts come out here purely to top umselves i remember once it is look aye well done lad neverve thought hed have got this far in last nights conditions no way but wheres the gun the body lay faceup in the bottom of the quarry both eyes wide as if seeking a reason from the darkening sky hell fire

round for hours whats he come six miles seven and just falls over the edge but this business of intruders somebodyll want it checked out whoever they were whatever they was up to or if they even

starting raining again desmond yes sarge hot lemon lad my advice wi a good dollop of whisky oh lord were asking you to intercede to help us sanctify this place drenched for centuries in sin and evil oh lord come down here tonight give us some help come on down lord shine your light thats what were asking come on shine your light yes and into every murky corner come on shine your light through every dismal doorway shine your light into every fetid crevice shine your light and willie shouted it too shine your light it was easy it was just pulled out of you like a handkerchief from your top pocket nowt to it at first hed felt right stupid felt bloody daft in fact as soon as he walked in wearing his suit the only suit in the place so it was obvious from the start that he wasnt one of them not that this had bothered them theyd leapt on him big frightening smiles and started hugging him welcome brother welcome good to see someones been brave enough to turn his back on it all whats your name willie gerroff he wanted to shout this is no bloody way to behave in church or anywhere for that matter soft buggers willie were so very glad to have you with us to see there is one out there who wants to save his soul praise god and rest assured that from this moment on youll have the full protection of the lord and therell be no repercussions because youll be wearing the armour of the lords light do you believe that is your faith strong enough willie to accept that oh aye said willie no milly gill had said flatly and finally when mr dawber wanted to go its got to be you willie mr dawber looks too intelligent thanks a bunch you know what i mean you look harmless its always been your strength willie luv you look dead harmless like a little vole said frank manifold snrs wife ethel in a voice like cottonwool and milly gave her a narrow look just watch and listen willie listen and watch what am i listening for youll know when you hear it what hed heard so far had left him quite startled they sang hymns hed never encountered before with a rhythm and gusto he associated more with folk clubs he felt his fingers begin to respond tried to stop it but he couldnt felt an emotional fervour building around him like in the days when he used to support manchester city it had started with everybody thered be over fifty of them now sitting quietly in the pews as joel beard led them in prayer but when the hymns got under way theyd all come out and stand in the aisle quite still no dancing and turn their faces towards the rafters and then lift up their hands palms open as if they were waiting to receive something big and heavy when the hymn was over some of the younger ones stayed in the aisle and sat there crosslegged staring up at the pulpit at their leader some of you joel beard said soberly may already have realised the significance of tonight joel in full vestments leaning out over the pulpit the big cross around his neck swinging wide burnished by the amber lights which turned his tight curls into a helmet of shining bronze a bit different from downbeat comfortable old hans with his creasedup features and his tired eyes but no autumn cross over joels head no candles on the altar all statuary removed and despite all the people in their bright sweaters and jeans with their fresh scrubbed faces and clean hair despite the colourful congregation and despite the emotion the church looked naked and cold and gloomy as a cathedral crypt joel said every few years the realms of god and satan collide the most evil of all pagan festivals falls upon the lords day tonight my friends my brothers my sisters we pray for ourselves for we are at war bloody hell willie remembered its it is sunday joel said quietly and it is allhallows eve new years eve willie thought time was when theyd have a bit of a do down the man except that always happened tomorrow all souls bit of a compromise reached over the years with the church and a logical one in willies view imagine the reaction in the days of the witch hunts to a village which had a public festival at halloween so they had it the following night all souls night made sense wouldnt be doing much this year though buggerall to celebrate we have recaptured this church joel beard proclaimed for the lord sterilised it more like willie thought feeling a lot less daft a lot more annoyed despiritualised it if theres such a word and it is left to us to hold it through this night yes oh bloody hell theyre never praise god well remain here until the dawn well sing and pray and keep the light keep the light its a waste of time willie wanted to shout its a joke apart from the mothers doing whatever needs to be done in private halloweens a nonevent in bridelow just a preparation for the winter a time of consolidation like a sharing of memories i would stress to all of you that its important to preserve a major presence here in the church nay lad give it up go home joel said if anyone needs to leave to use the toilet the rectory is open but hear me go in pairs ignore all distractions and hurry back take care make your path a straight one do not look to either side now those who thirst will find bottles of spring water and plastic cups in the vestry do not drink any water you may find in the rectory it may have been taken from the local spring which is polluted both physically and spiritually willie was stunned this was insane this was bridelow he was on about and of course joel said we shall eat nothing until the morning praise god willie slumped back into his pew next to a girl with big boobs under a pink sweatshirt with white and gold lettering spelling out thank god for jesus have we been taken over though milly said have we lost our village gone under our noses bit strong that ernie dawber said with what he was very much afraid was a nervous laugh yet they were in milly gills flowery sitting room hed set out for evensong as was his custom if there was a boycott it was nowt to do with him damn silly way to react anyroad she had caught up with him suddenly appearing under his umbrella telling him about the angels of the new advent time to talk about things milly said steering him home sitting him down with a mug of tea youre the chronicler mr dawber you know its not an exaggeration youve watched the brewery go youve seen people fall ill and just die like they never did before you know as well as i do ma didnt just fall downstairs and die of shock its common enough ernie said damply among very old people but ma wagstaff milly folded her arms trying for a bit of presence all right whos taken the man whos taken matt castle from his grave come off the fence mr dawber what do you really think youre asking me youre in charge now millicent im just an observer with failing eyesight there you go again please mr dawber youve seen the state of us were just a notverypicturesque tradition what did i ever do except pick flowers and dress the well and we meet for a bit of a healing this is how its been and susan says she cant stop long because of the child and its franks darts night young frank needs a good talking to said ernie thats the least of it theyre all just going through the motions and nothing seems to work out its like were going into the quiet time this is last midsummer and jessie marsden has to use her inhaler twice we cant even beat our own hay fever any more itd be almost funny if it wasnt so tragic the image speared ernie again ma showing him the shades of things and making him promise to get the bog body back and him failing her in the end but need this be the end happen you need some new blood he said finally i dont think thats the answer mr dawber the strength is in the tradition new bloods easy to get remember that girl who showed up a couple of years ago heard about bridelow god knows how and wanted to tap the source place of immense power how lucky we were could she become a a neophyte was that the word ernie dawber smiled from the daughters of isis rotherham as i remember nice enough girl wellintentioned you sent her away well mr dawber what would you have done we couldnt understand a word she was saying all this about the great rite and the cone of power come off it millicent you knew exactly what she was saying well maybe it seemed silly the way she talked made it all seem silly it does you know when you give it names like the cone of power new bloods all right in this sort of situation when youre strong enough to absorb it when youre weak it can just be like a conduit for infection that actually ernie said was not quite what i meant by new blood lets try and look at this objectively everything was ticking over quite nicely not brilliant bit wackery round the joints but basically all right given the times were in until this bog body turns up the man it all comes back to the man you think so mr dawber the man himself rather than what people have made of him its all the same ernie said thats the whole point of a human sacrifice milly stood up and went to the window opaque with night and rain how longs it been raining now mr dawber over a day nonstop has to be and corning harder still streams been out over the church field since tea time and the moss the moss will rise it does you know absorbs it like a sponge in according to the records the moss rose three feet in a thunderstorm ernie laughed see thats me the chronicler the great historian head full of the past but we dont learn owt from it really do we the past is our foundation but we look back and say nay that was primitive were beyond that now weve evolved but we havent of course not spiritually not in a mere couple of thousand years its still our foundation no matter how crude and when the foundations crumbled or vanished weve got to patch it up best we can milly gill didnt seem to be listening she said i prayed to the mother tonight sent willy off to the church to learn what he could and then i went up to the well with a lantern and knelt there in the rain at the poolside with the mothers brokenoff head in me hands and i asked her what wed done and what we could do milly fell silent ernie dawber looked round the room at the grasses and dried flowers at millys paintings of flowers and gardens at milly herself always so chubby and bonny for the first time she looked not fat but bloated as if the rain had swelled her up like the moss and what happened ernie said after a while he thought of himself as one of the driedout roots hanging in bundles from the crossbeam shrivelled easy to snap but possessed of certain condensed pungency put him in the soup and he could still restore the flavour he looked closely at milly and saw she was weeping silently well he said softly if she was telling me anything milly said i couldnt hear it couldnt hear for the rain shaw said what have you got on under that cloak not a thing sitting at shaws mothers dressing table therese had rubbed some sort of foundation stuff into her face to darken her complexion and painted around her eyes but its not for you tonight you can get excited though if you like make him jealous shaw touched her shoulder through the black wool she turned and looked at him her eyes very dark the look said get away from me shaw winced he looked over at the bed at his mothers wellworn dressing gown thrown across it he was surprised she hadnt taken it with her therese he said how was she really when she left your mother fine shell be enjoying the change im not overhappy about it shes a dismal old cow but relax or rather dont relax look she didnt want to be here shes really not very sociable these days is she especially where the brewerys concerned he watched thereses eyes in the mirror she could always in any circumstances make things happen yesterday his mother had been almost hysterical when he said hed be bringing the gannons chairman over for drinks this morning the old girl was missing but therese miraculously shockingly was in shaws bed and therese said oh i popped in last night and we had a terrific hearttoheart liz and i shes become far too insular you know losing all her confidence anyway i persuaded her to go to the palace in buxton for a couple of days packed her case ordered her a taxi before she could change her mind wasnt that clever of me yes yes hed been so relieved the old girl would have been suspicious as anything if hed suggested it he remembered the malta idea hopeless but trust therese to win her confidence trust therese drifting around the house rearranging things how the house had changed in just a few hours a museum coming alive whatve you got there shed picked up a black cloth bag from the dressing table tightened its drawstrings and set it down again hair she turned the word into a long satisfied breath beautiful long black hair hair with a single gorgeous strand of white i had to use a wig for so long but theres no substitute for the real thing can i look of course not dont you learn anything if its taken out now it loses half its energy that was why it was important to leave her as long as possible and its nicely matted with blood too now which is a bonus its all moving too fast for me said shaw that comb does that tie in well the comb was a problem at first actually its had to be sort of reconsecrated were not touching that either until the moment comes she stretched her slim arms leanly tautly muscular emerging from the folds of the black cloak then i shall uncover the hair and run the comb through it you know how combing your hair can generate electricity if you comb it in the dark looking into a mirror you can sometimes see blue sparks ever done that with my hair therese laughed poor shaw one day perhaps shaw said im sure it must have grown another quarter of an inch since i you know since ma wagstaff there you are you see first you simply felt better now you even look better and after tonight shaw said im not sure i really want to be there ill be so scared ill probably screw up or something nonsense therese lifted the hood of the cloak how do i look her voice had a husky slightly scottish edge shaw shuddered chapter iii mungo macbeth figured at first irrationally that he must have reached the coast came over the hill through rain which was almost equatorial in its intensity and there was this sensation of bulk water below and beyond his headlights too wide for a river assuming britain didnt have anything on the scale of the mississippi in flood and there was a lighthouse across the bay the light was a radiant bluewhite and sent a shallow beam over black waves he couldnt see only unlike a lighthouse it wasnt rotating which was strange macbeth stopped the car and lit a cigarette hed pulled in for gas near macclesfield looked up into the hard rain and the lightless hills and abruptly decided after six years to take up smoking again thus far it was not a decision hed had cause to repent he turned off the wipers and the headlights the rain spread molecules of blue light all over the windshield the sign had said bridelow so this had to be it or rather that had to be it the road carried on straight ahead and from here it looked likely to vanish after a few yards under the black water which was no way to die macbeth finished his cigarette slid the car into gear still not used to gears and then set off very slowly headlights full on thinking of moira how mad she was going to be when he showed up wondering what her hair would look like in the rain moira cairns the one big thing the later it got the harder it rained the more frightened lottie became of the night and what it might hold not that she was inclined to show this fear not to the customers and especially not to herself every time she caught sight of her face in the mirror behind the bar she tightened her lips and pulled them into what was supposed to be a wry smile in the ghostly light from matts lovingly reconstructed gasmantle it looked to her gaunt and dreadful corpselike lottie shivered longed for the meagre comfort of the kitchen stove and its hotplate covers all right luv stan burrows said want a rest want me to take over big bluff stan whod been the brewery foreman first to lose his job under the gannons regime if she could afford it it would be nice to keep the pub install sun as fulltime manager and then clear off lottie shook her head he must have noticed her agitation she thought of a rational explanation to satisfy him stan it isnt dangerous is it you know with all this rain getting absorbed into the moss doesnt flood or anything well i wouldnt go out theer for a midnight stroll stan made a diving motion with stiffened fingers eight or nine foot deep in places you might not drown but youll get mucky still im saying that people have died out theer but not for a long time dont think about it best way hard not to lottie said living here used to be folk said a retired farmer called harold halsall as could take you across that moss by night in any conditions follow the light they used say beacon of the moss all dead now fell in most likely said young frank manifold bloody place this is eh moss on one side moors on tother wi owd quarries and such why do we bloody stay frank and his mates had spent the afternoon helping in the search for sam davis found dead in a disused quarry just before dusk bad do that frank harold halsall had picked up the reference used to be me brothers farm that never did well out of it our george salesman now cattle feed is it right that when they found yon lads shotgun hed loosed off both barrels leave it harold said stan burrows nicking a quick glance at lottie theyd spent nearly an hour discussing the sam davis incident before harold had come in stan probably imagined that was adding to lotties nerves the thought of being all alone here while whoever sam had been chasing when he went over the quarry was still on the loose if it was only that lottie turned away tell you what young frankd had a bit too much to drink again more than one person had been saying it was time he went out and found himself another job i wish i had a bloody shotgun fire a few off outside tchurch i would lottie groaned tonights other topic of conversation soon bring that bastard out said frank him and his children of god then id fill him in good dont think you would frank stan burrows said hes a big lad that curate once had trials for castleford somebody said nay hell quieten down let him get it out of his system all hes doings making what you might call a statement twat said frank dont rise to it stan said best way mothersll not stan realised hed uttered a word lottie preferred not to hear in her bar aye he said well it went quiet not sure what they were allowed to talk about be better for everyone lottie thought when ive gone she heard running feet on the cobbles outside and the gaslight sputtered as the door was thrown open the porch lamp showed up rain like sixinch nails all the lads looking up from their drinks jeez he wore a sweater and jeans he shook raindrops out of black wavy hair lottie didnt recognise him wet enough for you she said nobody drove out for a casual pint at the man ith moss on dark autumn nights and he certainly wasnt dressed like a rambler wet enough for jacques cousteau he said and grinned brushing droplets from his sweater it was lottie noticed a very expensive softknit sweater cashmere probably lottie laughed what would you like scotch he said please any kind no ice oh she said surprised youre american sorry i didnt mean to say it like that bloody hell young frank manifold called over i know visibilitys bad out there mate but i think thas missed the turnoff for highway it began just like any normal hymn well normal for them sort of hymn barry manilow might have written willie thought slow and strong with a rolling rhythm and a big soaring chorus undeniably catchy one of the angels of the new advent was playing the organ backed up by a portable drum machine with an amplifier set up under the lectern willie couldnt prevent his fingers going into action on his blue serge knees didnt reckon much to the words modern language but humourless no style he glanced at the girl in the jesus sweatshirt her eyes were glazed and unfocused she had a certain look willie had seen before but usually on people who were on something high she was high on god as he watched slow tears rolled down her white cheeks the hymn soared on joel beard stood in his pulpit apparently soaring with it eyes closed and palms upturned willie thought of his mother now lying in a chapel of rest in macclesfield how was he supposed to make funeral arrangements when the service would have to be conducted by this pillock the drum machine stopped and then the organ trailed away but the voices went on and the words were no longer trite no longer actually made any sense were in fact no longer what you might call words willie listened to the girl holia holia amalalia awalah gloriahailolalala he was bewildered all around him voices rose and fell and rose and swelled ululating together in a strange enveloping coda everyone singing different words ohyalala holy holy malaya amala he looked up at joel presiding angel and joel was smiling with his eyes closed for a while willie closed his own eyes and was at once carried away on it drifting aware that his fingers were stretching feeling as if they were coming directly out of his wrists nerves extending his fingers moved very lightly against his thigh sometimes not quite touching it something fluttering like a small bird in his own chest and rising into his throat mayagalamata that was me willie stopped stood very still for a moment opening his eyes and taking in the scene all those upturned palms all those eyes closed or glazed he sighed and slid quietly out of the pew and down the aisle to the church door it was bolted but nobody heard him draw back the bolts and slip out into the teeming rain standing in a spreading puddle at the edge of the porch willie looked up at where our sheila used to hold open her pussy he closed his eyes against the cold dollops of rain speaking in tongues he muttered speaking chanting singing in tongues language of the angels open up your hearts to god and hell fill your mouth with rubbish its a block he said to milly gill and ernie dawber theyre blocking everything out theyre surrounding um selves with sound and emotion but its like blanket emotion you feel good you feel youre being drawn into something its just like candyfloss you know what i mean like psychic candyfloss ernie couldnt remember when hed heard such a long speech from willie wagstaff always such a shy lad in and out of class you kept forgetting he was mas son and therefore even in a goddessoriented society he must have picked up a few tips its stirring things up though milly said and thats not good at all hallows youve got to be very careful at all hallows we probably asked for it willie said whole congregation going on strike like that he provoked it milly said he destroyed things dear to us he provoked us were we supposed to sit there and listen to his pious ramblings after that perhaps ernie said reasonably that was what he wanted to do provoke a confrontation its no great secret if you know what youre looking for that the religious practices in bridelow are not as elsewhere his brand of christianity views it with very serious disapproval not to say abject horror hans couldve said no to him milly gill said hans couldve said he didnt want a curate hans was a sick man millicent he did need the help and bridelow does change people you know straightened out a lad like beard could even be an asset its just everything happened so quickly left on his own in what he sees as an evil pagan parish the way he is now everythings either black or white which is what ma warned me about beware of black she said and beware of white aye willie said but wheres the black corning from mr beard thinks were the black milly said ernie almost smiled there she was in one of her endless wardrobe of floral dresses sitting on her flowerpatterned sofa with her flower pictures on the walls bundles of dried flowers and herbs dangling from the beams she was life she was colour flowers were all the children shed never had even if the flowers were wilting you keep saying that willie almost snapped hes god were satan youre avoiding the bloody issue there is bad here real bad ma saw it coming and we all said ah poor old womans off her trolley we ignored the signs look at that bloody tree as suddenly appears out on tmoss did anybody really check that thing out i never go on the moss ernie admitted no you dont mr dawber you like trest of us we cant turn it into allotments so we ignore it and when somebody like matt comes back and he looks out there and he says thais where were from well we pat him on the back we know hell settle down thats the trouble see weve all bloody settled down even the mothersve settled down this is not a place you can totally settle down youve always got to keep an eye open and perhaps ma was the last one who did its a balancing act ernie dawber heard in his head ma nagging him again willie was right even this morning going up to find liz horridge he was telling her to go away leave me alone ma get off my back i were out there willie said tother morning wi tdog young benjie kept going on at me oh theres a dragon out there uncle willie nay i said its bog oak but i went out tave a look just to satisfy him like dog come wi me and he knew what it were about and what did i do i buggered off sharpish i dint listen to tdog and i made fun of ma i made fun of ma over matts coffin and the witch bottle scared stiff shed ask me to do it i dint mind helping pinch tbogman back bit of a lark that were but opening matts coffin willie shuddered wimp he said thats me she was right milly said matt wasnt protected we were putting him in as the mans guardian what use is a guardian without a sword as usual ernie dawber schoolteacher man of words man of science was floored by the exquisite logic of all this who was it he asked delicately who dug them up millys sigh was full of despair i cant begin to guess mr dawber so many signs we could see them but we couldnt see a pattern ive been praying to the mother for a pattern cant seem to get through even to meself its like all the wires are crossed or theres a fog theres a fog in the church willie said theyre making one white fog you cant get through because its like all your lines of communicationve been pulled down the holy well the church ma its like the white and the black have joined forces to crush us and what are we supposed to do there was no colour in millys cheeks what can we do when were so weakened and we dont know who were fighting or why ernie dawber thought so many sad bewildered frightened people an invisible enemy an ancient culture feebly fighting for its soul he noticed that all of willies fingers lay motionless on his knees you know what i think ernie said calmly i think we need another sacrifice chapter iv milly gill shifted on the sofa it creaked eh ernie dawber smiled in a resigned sort of way he was sitting on a straightbacked chair still wearing his old gaberdine mac his hat on his knees i dont know the story of the man in the moss he said any more than anybody does some say he came all the way from wales or even ireland that he was sent as a sacrifice well that seems likely but we dont really know for certain why he was sacrificed willie said i thought then he shut up some historians speculate it was to keep the romans at bay said mr dawber but we dont know that and in the end the romans werent so bad they were a relatively civilized people bit stiff and starchy like joel beard but nowt wrong with them really they taught us how to build proper roads and walls and useful things like that but i like to think we taught them a lot as well we said willie the celts the earliest real civilization in europe cultured spiritual knew how to fight when it was needed but not military like the romans the celts never sought to impose order only to recognise the order that existed around them and the moods of nature and the atmosphere shades of things ma said aye said willie remembering shades of things moderation said mr dawber equality respect for each other nature animals for religions a simple logical philosophy and one ive tried to pass on to generations of schoolkids just like my forefathers did and do you know aye willie said it worked it always worked kids leave school bugger off to the cities rebel against their parents and their parents values and that but theres summat about bridelow what we learned here we didnt reject i suppose cause it was so different radical like in its quiet way little island willie sacred island of the celts little island of moderation in an ocean of extremes takes some protecting that a balancing act mr dawber turned his hat round on his knees hes nervous willie thought ive written a new edition of the book of bridelow what you might call the unexpurgated edition just for me own benefit really just to reason things out youll find it in a blue typing paper box on top of the big bookcase in my study willie said whyre you telling us that maybe it should be printed just one copy to be kept in safekeeping for posterity as a reminder of how bridelow was and why it was what it was to look back on when everythings changed when the outside worlds absorbed us willie looked hard at the stately old chap trying to remember what mr dawber had been like when he was young when hed taught him for four years he couldnt he glanced at milly who was silent pensive mr dawber he said why are you telling us now you see thats the obvious explanation to me said mr dawber looking down at his hat thats what he died to save not to prevent anything as transient as another roman invasion he died to protect a way of life a whole attitude the celtic way something worth dying for dont you think happen willie said cautiously i think id like to die for that said mr dawber milly gill leaned forward on the floral sofa and lifted one of his liverspotted hands from his hat brim what are you trying to say mr dawber the old chap said difficult times lass the outsides invading us the white the black joel beard gannons yes milly let go of his hand it is an invasion the worst kind the kind you dont notice until its on you you see i dont quite know how its done mr dawber said matteroffactly i thought you might how whats done mr dawber why the triple death of course i dont like the way youre talking mr dawber you see i wouldnt like to cause any trouble for anybody that is i wouldnt like it to look like murder so what ill do is happen retire to the seaside health reasons the owd chests never been good got relatives in bournemouth you know bournemouth milly repeated aye and nobodyll be interested enough to prove otherwise ive packaged up the deeds and stuff of the house and ive left them with the manuscript to go to hans when he returns with instructions that the house should be let peppercorn rent to somebody as needs one happen a new historian wont be called dawber but that wasnt much of a tradition was it anyroad ive tied things up very nicely actually illve gone to the seaside aye willie said you sound like you could use a holiday mr dawber good long rest eh ill have that all right in the moss wearing a chilling halfsmile he carried on talking as if he couldnt see the pair of them staring at him frozen you know when i first read the british museum report it sounded quite horrific but the more i thought about it well the garrotting bit and the cutting of the throat that was mostly symbolic he wouldnt have felt any of that because theyd have tapped him on the head first you see mr dawber milly stood up i cant believe what im hearing and ill not have you talking like this in my house any more im an owd man millicent ive done me bit had some good times and youll have some more no he shook his head therell be no more good times for any of us unless we do summat drastic theyve taken the man in the moss this is far worse than the university or the british museum taking him hes gone to the dark and its allhallows the celtic new years eve i know what day it is milly snapped im supposed to be a bloody witch time of change time to look back store whats useful and important discard the old stuff as isnt time when worlds overlap time to act sit down millicent act willie came aware of the power of the sheeting rain could hear it smashing at the roof slates a power surge brought a quiver to millys tulipshaded standard lamp the lady bartender said stan would you take over im sorry and steered mungo macbeth into a back room a big chillylooking kitchen who are you she demanded he told her his name again he insisted he was a friend of moiras he repeated what hed said in the bar that he needed to talk to her urgently shes not here why did you think she would be the woman was goodlooking with a strong face but she also looked like she was carrying a lot of trouble her eyes vibrant with anxiety she crossed the flagged floor to a big iron stove and laid her hands on it macbeth said i didnt think shed be here specially not this inn this was the first place i came to is all with lights on after i crossed the bridge what bridge over the water its a bog she said its not water im a stranger never came this way before im sorry if i seem ignorant mrs castle she said oh jesus macbeth said i guess that means youre matt castles widow im sorry why should you be she said sharply you didnt know him did you all you could hear in the kitchen was the sound of rain splashing on the yard outside with the force of a broken firehydrant no he said i knew that moira thought a lot about him shit whatd i walk into here yes she bit her lip look the last i heard moira was staying at the rectory i called the rectory there were quite a few people there they said she was uh no longer around the born agains that would be what would they know how farve you come from glasgow glasgow you drove all the way down from glasgow in this well mr im sorry macbeth yes well i suppose it isnt too surprising quite a few blokes have done crazy things for moira cairns a faint smile penetrated the anxiety look well make some phone calls shall we see if we can find out where she is theres a chap called willie wagstaff who might just know its funny hes not in tonight actually ill give him a ring youre very kind im sorry i just had no idea who you were thats all right is this your inn what i mean is you uh do you need somewhere to stay tonight mr macbeth she gave him a look that was almost a plea i guess i do he said you have a room yes she said gratefully i have a room ive spent the last couple of days studying and thinking mr dawber said in the end you see im a man of logic christ willie thought preserve us from logic bridelows is a peculiar logic but logic it is but our grasp of it has been gradually weakened cant build a wall willie said cant keep the modern world out for ever we did have a wall milly said despondently but i dont think i was cut out to be a brickie willie longed to give her a cuddle for his benefit as much as hers longed to build up the fire with crackling logs to block out the rain his kind of wall he thought about joel beard and his bornagain mob exulting and singing in tongues in the dying church their kind of wall mr dawber picked up millys chubby hand and held it tonight lass if this wall finally comes down itll most likely be tonight because somebody has the man and theyll use him for evil and thatll finish it old buggers spent more than a couple of days on this willie thought mas been schooling him theyre looking for openings looking for cracks in the wall been gathering out there for years hundreds of years mr dawber looked steadily at milly youve got to replace the man my dear her willie spluttered she has ma would have taken charge but sadly shes not here which puts you in the firing line millicent im afraid and youve got to be strong youre a big girl if you dont mind me saying so big enough to wield the knife milly screamed and dragged her hand away mr dawber said i know itll hurt you more than it hurts me and im sorry i really am lass he stood up and straightened out the skirts of his mac when i said i didnt go out on the moss any more i wasnt being strictly truthful i spent a lot of time out there last summer after the man was found working out where he lay in relation to the village and also in relation to the path marked out by the beacon of the moss result is i know just the place to do it nay willie said mossll have shifted besides there were no beacon in them days you mean there was no church clock the beacon was a real beacon on the hill where the church now stands and the moss was more like a lake water to reflect the light willie stood up look mr dawber well forget you ever sad all this if you will mr dawber put on his hat ill leave you two for a bit perhaps you might summon the mothers whats left of them as are well enough to come out on a night like this and have a chat about it hey come on willie said get some sleep mr dawber well see you tomorrow have a proper chat all right no ill not sleep ive a few things to sort out few private things to burn letters and such he looked at his watch its ten to nine now ill be back for you soon after eleven milly shrank away from him mr dawber you dont seriously i do he said sternly and its got to be tonight tonight has the power the word is samhain millicent although i realise the mothers have gradually dropped the old terminology and on a practical level the moss is swollen with rain when it goes down things will be absorbed again taken in mr dawber milly gill whispered dont do this to me please perhaps before i return somethingll have happened this night to make you see the sense of it ma dead that young lad up on the moors how many do you want where for instance is he pulled down his hat never mind he turned round at the door and a broad smile was channelled through the wrinkles from the corners of his mouth to his eyes and his face lit up like a christmas tree im not unhappy tha knows be a lovely thing mr dawber turned the key in the double lock and unbolted the front door to the fierce rain and the night chapter v you been there before the house mmmm i suppose chrissie said i should be flattered its possibly our first official date what did you say his eyes flicking over to her then back to the road quick as the windscreen wipers you havent been listening to anything ive been saying have you of course i have doesnt matter youre obviously preoccupied she hadnt wanted to come with him anyway being actually in the process of trying to lose his attentions without losing her job even if he had been comparatively spectacular in bed of late did you say something about a date i said it was possibly our first official one where were actually seen together without a collapsible coffin between us i was being flippant roger youre here as my assistant he said coldly oh thanks very much youll be paying me then actually there was no real need to be especially nice to him no way he could get her fired knowing what she knew about him and his dealings behind the scenes with the man they were going to meet what a bloody awful night she said now they were up in the hills it was coming down so hard the wipers could hardly keep up i wonder what witches do when its pissing down what almost a croak witches what about witches its halloween i was wondering what witches do when its raining this hard whether they call it off or do it in the sitting room cant dance naked in this can you well i suppose you could youre on a pretty short fuse tonight roger no im not he snapped why dont you just tell me whats bothering you apart from the usual of course he didnt reply sod this chrissie thought anyway it was my understanding that your friend john peveril stanage lived in buxton or somewhere why pray tell is he holding his halloween party in bridelow look it was too dark to see but she could tell his hands were throttling the steeringwheel its not a party its just a gathering a few drinks and a few drinks but not a party she was starting almost to enjoy this and the reason its in bridelow the bridelow brewerys been bought by gannons ales right and it now emerges that stanage has been a major gannons shareholder for some years and recently increased his holding oh substantially is now in fact about to become chairman of the board i suppose hes got to do something with all his book royalties and things apart from setting up bogman museums roger didnt rise to it kept on looking at the road what you could hope to see of it seems shaw horridge thats the son of the original brewery family is about to become engaged to stanages niece they own bridelow hall which is where were going ill probably be underdressed chrissie said putting on a posh voice for braidelow hawl if it was that innocuous why was roger so nervy wheres your wife tonight working how are things generally soso everything all right in bed these days chrissie for chr he hurled the car into low gear and raced up a dark twisty hill no clammy peaty feelings any more what the hells the matter with you tonight whats the matter with you when they crested the hill she saw a strange blue moon what on earths that its the beacon of the moss roger said in a voice that was suddenly tired look im sorry sorry i ever got committed to stanage i admit im in too deep all right she saw the bog below them in the headlights it looked like very burned ricepudding its as though he owns a piece of me roger said bought me just as surely as hes bought gannons ales i mean last weekend when i went to london chrissie i didnt go to london i was at stanages place in buxton in buxton yes thats where look im a scholar an academic not religious not impressionable im basically a very sceptical person you know that chrissie stifled it absolutely she allowed herself a deep deep breath but tell me this who gave the bogman a penis roger slowed down for the causeway across the moss he seemed to slump on the wheel she could have sworn she actually heard him gulp i did ha i used a piece of gut what they thought was part of the duodenum he sounded relieved to be telling someone moulded with peat and something stanage gave me a a stiffening agent how ridiculously sleazy it sounded hadnt done much laughing though had she when she saw the thing lying there projecting its bloody great menacing cock into the lights actually it was pretty sick they set off very slowly across the causeway it seemed to be raining harder than ever here why she said as if she really didnt know scholar academic sceptic not impressionable ha he insisted itd you know do the trick said id obviously become very close to the bogman and the bogman had this sounds very stupid power and i should use it you didnt laugh in his face because you needed him no i didnt laugh because because he isnt a man you can laugh at youll know what i mean when you meet him look do you really think id go discussing my private difficulties with well with anyone i mean my bloody wifes a doctor and i couldnt talk to her about it of course i did think things would be different with you because i was a bit of a slag i suppose and not very bright in comparison with doctor mrs hall and because i was impressed with this big glamorous archaeologist who was on telly a lot and flattered no of course not what do you think i stick to honesty roger you were doing very well so you discussed your little problem with mr stanage i didnt intend to well obviously he just seemed to know he looked at me into me almost smiling faintly as if hed decided to find something out about me that i didnt want him to know and then he said try something for me would you sympathetic magic he called it i knew if i didnt give it a go hed know somehow and if anyone saw it id just blame the students but then but then it started to work chrissie said or something did probably the power of suggestion as you know he said you must have been halfdismissive and halfelated and halffrightened i suppose i know thats three halves but im not very bright as we established god almighty roger what have you got yourself into hes a strange man his knowledge is very extensive indeed but yes there is something i cant say i like some of his books are very weird roger i havent read his bloody books you should just keep your mouth shut when were there thats all at the party its not what is it then roger drove up off the causeway past the entrance to the big stone pub the man ith moss and into the main village street halfway up the street greasy light seeped out of a fish and chip shop but it seemed to have no customers not surprising in this weather the blue moon turned out to be shining out of the church wall must be a clock with a face each side of the steeple but no hands no numerals how strange the clock lit up the inside of the car and rogers bearded face chrissie began to feel uneasy come on then roger as if the blue clock was lighting him up for interrogation what else are you hiding yes he turned right before the church back into darkness ill tell you stanage says he can get the body back oh yes who from i dont know how i dont know what do you know he says we should all get together those of us whove been close to him him him chrissie lit a cigarette turn round she said what turn the fucking car round roger im not having anything to do with this he stopped the car abruptly in the narrow road and it skidded into the kerb the rain drummed violently on the roof and splashed the dark windows it was savage and relentless like a thrashing from god chrissie please she blew smoke in his face he choked back a cough chrissie i dont want to go on my own grow up roger listen im just a little bit scared too cant help it if only for my for my reputation well naturally but i cant not go can i and say goodbye to everything make him you know make him what angry he said pathetically she couldnt see his face she didnt want to she gritted her teeth turn it round i said lay off eh frank i wanna know come on he cant just fucking show up middle of the night and not tell us why dont want no more fucking mysteries in this place had it up to here with fucking mysteries go home frank youve had too many too many what listen fartface youre not my fucking foreman no more not your pub neither whats your name mate macbeth had had too many bad experiences of telling his name to guys in bars kansas he said jim kansas kind of fucking names that frank if you dont go home aye go on finish sentence stan what you goin do if i dont go i shall pick up that big bottle of long john said mrs lottie castle appearing in the doorway and ill use it to bash out all of your front teeth frank manifold thats for starters out its raining young frank said and he giggled but he went macbeth started to breathe again sorry the barman stan said to him everybody seems to be on edge tonight the other guys in the bar were draining their glasses coming to their feet well leave you to it lottie i think shut the place i would youll get no more custom tonight not in this now stan looked meaningfully at macbeth lottie said hes staying stan nodded dubiously and didnt move hes an old friend of matts lottie said couldnt make it for the funeral right stan accepted this and shrugged into his overcoat night then lottie good night mr kansas macbeth was curious this woman didnt know him from bill clinton and here she was letting her regular customers and the help go and him stay the night normal way of things the woman being a widow this wouldve been no big surprise he had to admit but she was a very recent widow also she didnt seem to have even noticed what he looked like she looked tired drained eyes swollen she dragged out a weary smile mr mungo ive located willie wagstaff he doesnt know where moira is but he says he doesnt mind talking to you if you dont keep him too long hes at his girlfriends thats the post office about a hundred yards up the street same side right uh what did you i told him i thought you were all right i hope you are macbeth said mrs castle whats going on here just why is everybody on edge whore all these people at the rectory ask willie she said and just so you know he used to play the drums in matts band so hes known moira a long time do you want to borrow an umbrella thanks i have a slicker in back of the car what if im late ill still be up lottie castle said whatever time it is just hammer on the door lottie bolted the door behind him top and bottom then she went through to the back door and secured that too she put on some coffee partly to combat the rain noise with the warm poppoppop of the percolator earlier shed pulled through a threeseater sofa from the living room that never got lived in there was a duvet rolled up on the sofa tonights bed would have been if shed been alone in the pub shed put the american in bedroom three the one dic used when he was here soon as hed left yesterday shed changed the bedding aired the room it was just across the passage from her own were bad dreams somehow stopped at source when you were no longer alone in the building that of course would depend on whether they were dreams on the refectory table was a local paper with the phone numbers of two estate agents ringed the ones that specialised in commercial properties give that a try first see if anyone was interested in a lossmaking pub before resorting to the domestic market former village inn full of character dramatic rural location reduced for quick sale well did she have a choice was there any kind of alternative lottie poured coffee strong but with a little cream which she left unstirred thin white circles on the dark surface because black coffee was apt to make her think of the moss she left the cup steaming on the table stood in the centre of the room for a moment with her sleeves pushed up and her hands on her hips matt she said you know i didnt want to come but i didnt complain i supported you i gave up my lovely home strange but all the time he was dying he never once allowed a discussion to develop about her future but then they never actually talked about him dying just occasionally about him being ill and he obviously wasnt afraid he was just amazing when you thought about it too preoccupied you were always a selfish bastard matt she said standing on the flags hands on hips giving him a lecture dont see why i should feel ashamed do you feeling not so unhappy because there was someone to wait up for she left on a walllamp in the kitchen went through to the bar leaving the door ajar switched the lights off one by one at the panel beside the mirror leaving until last the disused brass gasmantle which matt had electrified the porchlight would stay on all night gilding the rippling rain on the window lottie moved out into the darkened stonewalled bar collecting the ashtrays for emptying wondering what willie would make of the american with the silly name whod driven down from glasgow on the wettest sunday of the year to find moira cairns matt would have done that matt would have killed for moira and there was a time when she would have killed moira because of it but it didnt seem to matter any more when the gaslight came back on behind the bar lottie dropped all the ashtrays with a clatter of tin the gas mantle was fitted with on electric bulb under the little gauzy knob thing and it looked fairly realistic or so shed thought because shed never seen the original gas until now oh yes this was gas being softer more diffused she almost felt she could hear a hiss did they hiss or was that matt matt whose face shone from the mirror behind the bar enshrouded in gaslight lottie stood with her back to the far stone wall her hands found her hips against which untypically they trembled she said very quietly oh no ernie dawber knew that if he allowed himself to think about this he would at once realise the fundamental insanity of the whole business he would see sense but bridelow folk had traditionally answered to laws unperceived elsewhere therefore it was not insane and it required another kind of sense which could never be called common so he simply didnt think about it at all but did the usual things he would do at this time of night cleaned his shoes tidied his desk leaving certain papers however in quite a prominent position love letters they were from a woman magistrate in glossop with whom ernie had dallied a while during a bad patch in his marriage some thirty years ago hed decided not to burn them after all his wife had known and the woman was dead now why not make one little bequest to the village gossips in the letter he was leaving for hans hed written let the vultures in why not let them pick over my bones but discreetly let it be so that nothing of me exists except a name on the cover of the book of bridelow suddenly he felt absurdly happy he was going on holiday he made himself a cup of tea and set out a plate of biscuits wondering what archaeologists two thousand years hence might have made of this the stomach yielded the digested remains of a compressed fruit not indigenous to the area but which may have constituted the filling for what nutritional documents of the period tell us were called fig rolls he chuckled ate two biscuits drank his tea and sat back in his study chair both feet on his footstool he did not allow himself to contemplate the kind of knife which might be used to cut his throat or the type of cord employed for the garrotting or whether the blow to the back of his head would be delivered with a carpenters mallet or a pickaxe handle but feeling that he should at least be aware of what had happened on this particular day in the world he was leaving he switched on the radio for the ten oclock news not such a bad time to be leaving chaos behind what used to be the iron curtain more hatred between european nations than thered been since the war a psychopath killing little girls the west country but then at the end of the national news this police who earlier today found the body of a man after a ninehour search of the south pennine moors say theyve now discovered a womans body less than a mile away in the burnedout wreckage of a car however they say there appears to be no link between the two deaths the first body found in a quarry has now been formally identified as a yearold farmer peter samuel davis the womans body not yet identified was badly burned after the car a bmw saloon apparently left the road in wet conditions plunged over a hundred feet into a valley bottom and burst into flames ernie switched off the radio his fingers numb picked up his telephone and rang the post office perhaps before i return somethingll have happened this night to make you see the sense of it sense he thought feeling cold all of a sudden its all gone beyond sense chapter vi chrissie shrieked come on come on come on and beat with both fists on the door until it shook she was wearing a short mac said to be showerproof but that depended what you meant by shower and shed taken no more than two minutes to run like hell down the street and she was panting and absolutely bloody soaked when the door opened chrissie practically fell inside god shaking water out of her hair expecting glasses chinking laughter maybe the clunkding of a onearmed bandit certainly not silence and dimness and a redhaired woman with lips drawn tautly back and painfilled frozen eyes im sorry i mean this is a pub isnt it youre still open arent you i mean if youre not i only want to use the phone to call a taxi box the woman said in a strangled whisper as if she had a throat infection up the street yes i know but ive no change i excuse me but are you all right really dont know better come in thanks god what a night car the woman cleared her throat excuse me your car broke down actually i had a row with my boss boyfriend well not either after tonight i just got out of his car and walked off well ran off with this weather i mean isnt it awful im making a puddle on your floor sorry when shed rubbed the rain out of her eyes chrissie saw she was indeed it what seemed to be a public bar nobody here apart from her and the woman hey im sorry i really thought you were open and the door had just jammed or something and youre really not well are you the woman had her back to the bar which was dark only the shapes of bottles gleaming can you she gripped the edge of a table as if to steady her voice excuse me but can you see a lightfitting like an old gasmantle side of the bar er yes yes i think so is at on well no could she be blind then the woman just son of folded in on herself as if afflicted by some awful stomach cramp or period pain and chrissie s brain dried out quickly the man ith moss this was matt castles wife hey she said come on sit yourself down you on your own mrs castle nodded and chrissie led her to a corner seat opposite the bar and bent down to her make you a cuppa tea she shook her head ive got coffee im ok honestly just a shock ive had a shock can i send for anybody relatives a doctor please mrs castle said just dont go thats all come through phones in the kitchen she got up and walked to the bar and when she reached it a tremor seemed to pass through her and she pushed quickly through a door in the back wall chrissie followed her into a big farmhousetype kitchen taking off her sodden mac and tossing it into a corner useless thing underneath she was wearing her navyblue suit over a light blue silk blouse and pearls classy and understated for john peveril stanages soiree she thought with a sardonic shudder just keep talking mrs castle said ill be all right in a minute she was wearing a big sloppy icelandictype sweater but she still looked almost blue with cold and she hunched herself over the stove chrissie went and stood next to her and folded her arms well this chap i was with called roger married of course im his bit on the side except thats not as frivolous or irresponsible as it sounds for either of us well it never is is it really mrs castle was just looking into space there was a full coffee cup on the table but the coffee had gone cold a whirl of cream almost solid on the top like piped icing rogers a prat chrissie said theres no getting around that hes got a terrific opinion of himself and yet at the same time hes obviously a bit intimidated by his wife shes a doctor he wanted something else less demanding which was me one slightly shop soiled divorcee off the bottom shelf flattering eh high powered wife so hes looking for something cosy and undemanding and worst of all a bit cheap you know what i mean mrs castle nodded and struggled to smile a little bit of colour in her cheeks she was actually very attractive good bones i mean you talk about undemanding he didnt even have to go anywhere to pick me up we work in the same office im his secretarycumpersonal assistant soon found out what that meant realising shed never talked to anybody about her and roger before maybe this could turn out to be unexpectedly therapeutic but at the end of the day chrissie went on his biggest love i mean listen to this his biggest love whos far more important to roger than cither me or his wife is a squidgy little brown man whos been dead about two thousand years and came out of a bog now can you ow a kind of mad revulsion in her eyes mrs castle had suddenly swung round from the stove grabbed hold of chrissies wrist and was digging her nails into it as if chrissie thought pulling away cold to make sure im actually flesh and blood i tell you what mrs castle i reckon youre the one who would benefit from talking about it where are we going exactly rog mustnt be so anxious mfriend mind holding the umbrella oops two hands please or youll lose it huge golf umbrella anything else would have been turned inside out by the sheer force of the downpour hard vertical brutal rain there thats stopped em from dithering i wasnt d surrounded by ditherers dont worry i like em shaw used to be a ditherer didnt you shaw ditherer stammerer cowardly little bastard fixed it though didnt we fixed everything right then if were all ready in we go been here before rog darkness cold never pretty chilly isnt it chilly this hear that tess poor roger thinks its chilly this is tess my niece arent you darling and what shall we say about these others what they are is a bunch of unfortunates befriended by the lass shes so good hearted uncle please apologies my love yes up the stairs is where we go onwards and upwards into the attic of death do you like that not really relax relax relaxation the key to everything shaw knows that dont you mboy up again ought to be a lift be totally creamcrackered time we get there how you feeling now rog a touch lightheaded now actually how many drinks did i have i cant just the one roger just the one famous for our cocktails arent we tess whats that smell new one on you is it rog what a terribly sheltered life you must have had mboy oh dear god ah now lets not bring that chap into it roger im going to be sick no youre not youre going to get used to it no time at all now relax the dead cant harm you dont look at it dont look at it dont oh lord whats happening to my head no actually im lying again thats a common myth perpetuated by morticians youre quite right the dead can indeed harm you in the most unexpected ways the dead can harm you horribly laughter laughter all around by the time macbeth walked into the room behind the post office the sense of there being something deeply wrong at this rainbeaten village everybody seems to be on edge tonight had become so real it was starting to affect the air the atmosphere itself seemed thin and worn and stretched tight like plastic film and faces were pressed up against it trying to breathe two faces one chubby and female that ought to have looked healthy and a small male face under a brown fringe a face out of wind in the willows or somesuch both faces pressed up against the tight air of a small and crowded room full of flower pictures flower fabrics and flowers macbeth finding it hard to introduce himself i uh harder still to explain what he was doing here mrs castle lottie right thought maybe you could tell me where i could find a a friend of mine aye the little guy said look can i ask you how close were you to moira lad a slow kindly voice but macbeth felt the damp behind it i guess id like to be closer he said frankly rain from his black slicker dripping to the floral carpet rain making deltas on the window and small pools on the sill rain coming down the chimney and fizzing on the coal fire and yet all the flowers in the room on the walls in the pictures on the womans dress contriving to look parched and dead the woman said bleakly since willie spoke to lottie weve had a phone call moira the womans wise eyes were heavy with a controlled kind of sorrow a hammer inside macbeths head beat out no no no sit down lad the little mousy guy said pulling a chair out from under a gatelegged mahogany dining table on the table was a bottle of whisky its seal newly broken beside it two glasses well of course i dont believe in it you see chrissie i never have all right maybe its not a question of not believing i mean is there a name for a person who just simply doesnt want to know chrissie warmed both hands around her coffee cup for that matter is there a name for a man who professes to be above all that superstitious nonsense but is more than happy to let it cure his impotence and then he can go back to not believing in it again i think bloody hypocrite might be one way of putting it lottie said but but tonight god am i really saying this tonight you saw the ghost of your husband chrissie shuddered it really did go all the way up your spine wasnt going to use that word never liked it ghost what does it mean lottie was he really there i mean his spirit was his spirit there lotties voice rose discordant like a cracked bell yes i think it was and crushed his spirit crushed she thrust a fist to her mouth swallowing a sob chewing her knuckles let it come chrissie said and lottie wept some hot frightened tears yes he was a man of spirit always endless enthusiasm for things what first attracted me but theres a negative side to enthusiasm isnt there ob session lottie sniffed first there was the woman moira not only beautiful but young and worst of all worst of all chrissie talented the thing i couldnt give him support yes but inspiration youre beautiful too chrissie said ineffectually thanks lottie said was maybe in the right light doesnt mean a lot on its own though does it dont get me wrong it never flowered this thing over moira they never actually did it i know that now but i think thats worse in a way dont you i mean the longing goes on doesnt it the wondering what it might have been maybe i should have let him work it out but i gave him an ultimatum her or me and his son dic hed have lost dic too it coincided all this you see with an offer she got to join another band he made her take it it was the right thing to do martyrdom chrissie said he didnt get over her exactly he just went in search of a new obsession and ended up reviving an old one which was coming back to bridelow not my idea of heaven on earth not tonight anyway chrissie said looking over to the window it was like staring into a dark fish tank naturally i encouraged him sent him up here at weekends with dic and a picnic lunch safe enough i just didnt think it would ever happen then they found that blasted bog body and he just went nuts over it kept going to see the damn thing like visiting a relative in hospital or prison or somewhere next thing he hears the brewerys been flogged off and this place is on the market and i was just carried along like a whirlwind picks you up and you come down somewhere else you never wanted to be lottie stopped as if realising there was little more to be said and then he got ill and died she nodded at the door to the bar that gasmantle he worked for hours on it place was a tip plastering needed doing but all he was bothered about was his precious gasmantle bit of atmosphere matt all over tunnel vision i read once chrissie hesitated an article in some magazine at the dentists this chap said there were certain things they came back to gh dead people christ that sounds even worse anyway things theyd been attracted to in life aye makes sense hed come back to his bloody gaslight rather than me i didnt mean it that way sort of landmark for them to home in on like a light in the fog you could always have it taken down hed go daft hed hold it against me for ever what did he look like his old self or what he looked terrible lottie started to cry again why cant you ever learn to button it kid chrissie told herself it was very misty lottie said through a crumpled handkerchief he kept fading and then like a bad tv picture in the old days remember as if i suppose your chap was right as if he was trying to hold on to his old gasmantle for comfort and something was trying to pull him back back where into the darkness behind the mirror he couldnt see me im sure he couldnt see me at all am i going mad chrissie no more than any of us do you want me to stay with you tonight ive nowhere else to go lotties hands clutched each other began to vibrate shes wringing her hands chrissie thought ive never seen anybody actually wring their hands before the truth is lottie said i hated him by the end there was nothing left but the negative side no enthusiasm only obsession he was when it comes down to it a very nasty man lottie stared into her empty coffee cup as if trying to read a message in the grains but he was also dying you see and you arent allowed to hate dying people especially if the nastiness is to some extent out of character and therefore you think must be connected with the dying chrissie lit another cigarette when my mother was dying towards the end i wanted it to be over for her sake but if im honest partly for my sake too i dont think were talking about the same thing luv christ almighty lottie covered her ears isnt that bloody rain ever going to stop listen to me chrissie said when you thought when you saw this when he was in the mirror tonight did you hate him then no i felt sorry for him dont get me wrong i was very frightened but at the bottom of that there was a pity it was the gasmantle putting that together wiring it up was about the only innocent gentle thing he did here i was irritated at the time but when i look back its the only thing makes me want to cry for rum chrissie stood up i dont know why but i think we should put it on the light i mean the gas thing why because if that represents the nice harmless side of him perhaps you should show him you recognise that i dont know maybe its stupid but perhaps he wants your forgiveness perhaps he wants to know you remember that side of him the good side so maybe if you gave him a sign that you understood then he hed be you know at peace isnt that what they say who chrissie shrugged old wives i suppose old mothers in this village ok lottie came wearily to her feet lets try it might make you feel better might at that they went through to the darkened bar and chrissie lifted the flap and went round to the customers side so they were standing either side of the brass mantle in the arrow of light from the kitchen she could see it was on a hinged base screwed into the wooden frame of the bar and projecting about eighteen inches behind it on lotties side was the mirror in a victorian mahogany frame chrissie made herself gaze into the mirror and saw only her own dim reflection looking rather pale and solemn perhaps we could say a prayer lottie no thanks lottie said well at least think of him as you press the switch think of the good times my memory isnt what it was said lottie no im sorry youre doing your best all right matt listen if you can hear me at the end of the gasmantle a feeble glow appeared switch it off a second lottie lets get this right i didnt lottie said in a voice which rose in pitch until it cracked switch it on merciful god chrissie pulled from somewhere in her past please the small light at once flare to a dazzling magnesium white huge shadows reared lottie screamed once and backed off into the kitchen when the bulb exploded with a crack like snapping bone chrissie found herself at the far end of the bar trying to hug the stone wall chapter vii listen macbeth said clutching millys plump arm let me call the cops maybe it wasnt her car dont make it worse lad willie wagstaff said his eyes hollowed out with grief ive already been on to um i said me wife were out in a bmw and i were worried sick after hearing the news i didnt want to get involved in identification or owt so in the end i said the wifes car were red and they said this one was grey had been grey and give me the registration and i went off sounding relieved relieved jesus i dont understand macbeth stared desperately around the room these things dont happen i just dont fucking understand they do happen willie said hopelessly especially here milly was looking hard into the fire especially now shurrup said willie gruffly how far you come lad glasgow the one big thing he thought god damn and closed his eyes against the pain she was special willie said we all knew that yeah he whispered special like your mother milly said i think we knew that too and now theyre both dead leave it luv its coincidence is it macbeth opened his eyes something badly wrong here but did he care and what could he do anyway one week before that moira cairns had been a face on an old album cover one week a chance meeting an inexplicable cascade of bones a talk on the terrace in the aftermath thered be another album now the best of moira cairns in memoriam even if hed never met her hed be grieving in one week shed become the core of his existence a woman whose last glance at him had said fuck off there was a guy he heard himself saying who meant her harm donald told me the dogs disliked this man intensely on sight willie wagstaff and his girlfriend were both staring at him the duchess wanted me to look out for her you know the duchess said wherever she went shed be touched with madness whos the duchess willie asked macbeth noticed that the fingers of willies left hand had struck up a rhythm on the side of his knee he seemed unaware of it macbeth said her mother the gypsy macbeth nodded he looked out of the window a big van with a blue beacon and an illuminated sign had stopped down the street the sign said ambulance is this rain never gonna ease off is it normal no milly said its not normal who was the man you said there was a man who meant her harm macbeths mind slipped out of gear for a moment he panicked clutched at the air the air in the room so dense the rain bombarding the roof the duchess said if there was a problem and you were to deal with it she need never know need she and how badly hed wanted to deal with it and wanted her to know and now it was too late to deal with it and sure she would never know john peveril stanage he said and the other two people in the room slowly turned and looked at each other and willie blanched the fingers of both hands were slamming into his knees and this time he was aware of it but seemed unable to stop it when the ambulance arrived at the chip shop for maurice winstanley both maurice and his wife dee were in a state bordering on hysteria i knew summat like thisd happen i never wanted to open me dee shrilled a skinny little woman how could you work in a chip shop and be that thin it fascinated one of the ambulance men for a couple of seconds until he saw how badly burned maurice was they had to treat his arm best they could but there wasnt a whole lot they could do on the spot what with maurice gawping around and then kind of giggling with pain and his wife going on and on like a budgie on amphetamines i says to him whos going to come out for chips night like this he says what about all them young people up at church theyll be starving before tnights through i says all right i says you want to do it you can do it on your own the ambulance man had fancied a bag of chips himself especially after that drive over the hills and across the moss gruesome hed been driving and felt sure he could see the bloody peat rising and sucking put one wheel in there youd have had it all right mr winstanley if we can get you out this way wheres your stretcher then he can walk cant he mrs winstanley i was going to say we need to get him in as quick as we can he might need to go to the burns unit but chips would never be the same again how gutchurning an appetizing smell like that could become when on top of battered cod and mushy peas there was the subtle essence of frazzled flesh the result of maurice winstanleys right arm blistering and bubbling in the fryer lucky you havent got a heart attack case as well dee said he let out such a shriek im not surprised luv any of usdve gone through the roof oh this were before he stuck his arm in tfat i says now whats up i says and he turns round white as a sheet i says whatever have you done and then he does it thirty years frying and he shoves his arm in i dont think he knew what he were doing at all in the ambulance racing back across the moss maurice shivered and shook a lot a red blanket round him his arm in about half a mile of bandage never believe me lad she never will i wouldnt believe me dont matter how long youve been at it mr winstanley you can always have an accident no not that now maurice looked like a chip shop proprietor maurice was a fat man maurices big cheeks had that highcholesterol glow about them and there were black smoky rings around his eyes she had to believe that naturally maurice said she seen it happen fact it were only tbloody agony of it brought me round see and i couldnt even feel that at first i were looking at it a good two seconds i thought whats that pink thing in tbloody fat dont think about it mr winstanley well not be long now what dyou reckon to uniteds chances then i dont want to talk about united lad i hate bloody soccer listen no it werent that shell not believe ive allus been a clumsy bugger no see what it were as caused it in tfirst place id just seen summat as frightened life outer me froze me to tspot you know numb i were numb sounds like my motherinlaw ok christ said maurice winstanley subsiding into his pain whats the bloody use even though deirdre winstanley opened all the windows into the place the smell of fried skin wouldnt go away only seemed to get stronger when she opened the door susan manifold having seen the ambulance ran across the street through the torrent asking her what was wrong could she help his own fault dee said silly bugger thirty years i dont know will he be all right will any of us im sorry susan manifold stepped inside the chip shop to escape the wet wrinkling her nose at the smell well look at it dee gestured at the water now level over cobbles and the drains werent taking it she seemed more worried about that than maurices injury or perhaps she was looking for something to take her mind off it will it flood susan asked never has before but theres always a first time look at them drains is there nowt you can do im not a plumber said susan no said dee but youre a mother oh come on susan flicked back her ashblonde fringe we cant alter the weather couldve once not you maybe susan happen before your time old wives tale susan said carelessly and the full horror of what shed said came back at her like a slap in the mouth she was betraying milly gill and the memory of ma wagstaff but god help her mother help her she had no belief in it any more upset she walked back across the drowned cobbles frank wasnt home yet from the pub when he did arrive hed be drunk and nasty another problem the mothers were supposed to be able to deal with dee winstanley slammed the door that was stupid what shed said stupid what susan had replied stupid what maurice had done stupid to have lived behind a stinking chip shop for thirty years stupid stupid stupid and the smell wouldnt go away the layer of fat from fish and pies and peas and fried human skin hung from the ceiling like a dirty curtain and the fluorescent tubelight was a bar of grease dee threw up the flap stumbled behind the counter slammed down the chromium lid on a fryer full of flabby chips congealing together like a heap of discarded yellow rubber gloves couldnt clean that tonight just couldnt cod and six pennorth o chips please the nerve of some people were closed dee yelled into the thick air around the high counter and six pennorth o chips dee sighed some people still thought it was funny to demand six pennorth o chips same as what theyd asked for in old money when they were kids weve had to close early she explained patiently maurices had an accident gone to hospital all the chips are ruined she peered through the shimmering grease at the persistent customer recognised the voice straight away just couldnt put a name to it pennorth o chips please the customer clambered through the lardy light and she heard the clatter of coins on the glass counter you deaf or summat matt i cant serve you its mauricetheyve taken maurice off in thambulance hes had a and six pennorth at first there was no sound in the crowded flowery sitting room except for the endlessly percussive weather and willie wagstaff s fingers on his jeans picking up the same rapid rhythm john peveril stanage macbeth repeated in a stronger voice because the named had the same effect as throwing three aces into a poker game doing this for the duchess willie said never heard of him about a second too late to be convincing and macbeth suddenly furious was halfway out of his chair when there were four hollow knocks at the front door all the more audible for being way out of synch with willies fingers and the rain mr dawber milly gill said tonelessly but made no move to answer the door chapter viii milly gill half rose and then sat down again and looked at willie and then at mungo macbeth im sorry mr macbeth sorry tove given you such awful news but spreading her hands what else can i do telling him to get the hell out in other words macbeth stood up but made no move toward the door i dont think so he said the hollow knocking came again a little faster this time a little closer to the tempo of wagstaffs restless fingers why dyou do that macbeth said in no mood for tact with your fingers willie looked nonplussed like nobody ever asked him that before he has a problem with his nerves milly gill said hastily if you dont mind mr macbeth theres a gentleman come to see us so they know who it is knocking comes at the door latish and they know what its about before they open up sure macbeth said thanks for your time maybe he should go cancel his room at the inn drive out of here head back north maybe organise a flight home and call on the duchess could he ever face the duchess again he nodded at willie wagstaff followed milly gill to the door good luck he said not sure why he said that and then something told him to turn around and he found willie on his feet a whole series of expressions chasing each other across the little guys face like videotape on fastforward look willie was clasping both hands between his legs like a man who badly needed to use the john its not nerves its hey the big woman pulled back her hand from the door catch a few minutes ago you were telling me to shut up i know lass but happen weve kept quiet too bloody long this moira dead finished me that has too many accidents going right back to that lad who fell off top of the brewery too much bad luck and when i hear jacks name hang on a minute lad milly let ernie dawber in milly said if its jack which i she swallowed if it is weve got to sort it out for ourselves oh aye like weve sorted everything else out let him in this ernie dawber was a short stout dignifiedlooking elderly guy in a long raincoat and a hat he didnt look pleased at being kept wailing in the rain he looked even less pleased to see macbeth this blokes a friend of moiras willie wagstaff explained mungo macbeth old guys handshake was firm eyes pretty damn shrewd my condolences he said im sorry mr dawber willie said ill not mess about this lad mungo reckons moira he took a breath he reckons theres a connection with jack with john peveril stanage willies voice was so thick with loathing that macbeth had to step back not possible ernie dawber said i know what youre saving but its not possible no said willie he was banished willie in the fullest sense fortyodd years ago in all that time hes never once tried to come back and if your ma was here now shed go mad at you for even saying his name aye but shes not shes dead willies voice hardened suddenly under very questionable circumstances ernie dawber shook his head youre clutching at straws milly gill said leave it willie weve problems enough jack couldnt set foot in this village while ma was alive willie shouted hes a rich man now willie hes got everything he needs and like mr dawber says hes never once tried to get back in why should he aye said willie why should anybody want owt to do wi bridelow whys bridelow suddenly important whys it on everybodys lips when things hereve never been so depressed why mr dawberll tell you hes got the same disease willie stop it off willie brought a hand down on the gateleg table with a crack bogman fever that little bastards contagious look at matt he got too close for his own sanity how close did you get mr dawber that you want to die for it as well did you ever think itd got at your mind staid cautious old ernie dawber man of letters he turned away ernie dawber human sacrifice dont make me laugh stop it milly gill advanced on willie like she was figuring to pull him apart how dare you little man theres things we never can laugh at maybe somethings turned your mind jesus macbeth stepped between them bogman fever human sacrifice what kinda shit is this guy in the bar said everybody was on edge tonight i figured he was making small talk back off huh removing his hat ernie dawber stepped further into the room leaving the door ajar behind him no visible easeup in the rain could i ask you mr macbeth like the evil scottish king had all his buddies iced thats as maybe ernie dawber said but could i ask you sir what precisely is your interest here i got nothing to hide macbeth let his arms fall to his sides i fell in love with a woman the noise from outside was like niagara and now shes dead macbeth said some bastards keeping secrets about that maybe its time for me to research a few ancestral vices yeah he shifted uncomfortably starting to sound like some steepjawed asshole out of one of his own tv shows perhaps said ernie dawber we should all calm down and discuss this and for what its worth history being my subject despite the bards best efforts to convince us otherwise macbeth was actually quite a stable monarch ernie macbeth pulled out a chair i wasnt so pissed about this whole thing i could maybe get to like you he sat now somebody gonna tell me about john peveril stanage only milly gill still looked defiant she folded her arms pushed the door shut with her ass oh hell tell him willie ernie dawber said it had been novelty value and now it was wearing off chris wasnt stupid he wasnt blind being bornagain to god didnt blind you to common sense most of them were young they sought chris conceded a vibrancy and an excitement in religion which the church had failed to give them they found it at outdoor rallies in marquees and packed rooms that were more like dancehalls and now they were back where for many of them it had begun first time around in the stone clad starkness of an oldfashioned church to defend it joel had told them against evil but an evil they could not see nor comprehend and chris an elder of the church of the angels of the new advent was asking himself is this man this figure of almost prophetlike glamour this embodiment of the biblically angelic is this man entirely sane joel chris shambled over to the lectern a lean bearded man in a lumberjack shirt er how many hours has it been exactly are you counting chris no but i know the heats on in here but its still pretty cold bit of an ordeal for some of these kids youre saying their faith isnt strong enough like the pe teacher he used to be chris thought loftily disdainful of youngsters shivering on a wintry playing field of course not chris said but dont you think dont you think this church is clean now this thing is deepseated chris joel clutched at the lectern for strength the muscles tautening in his face you think you can eradicate centuries of evil in a few hours he looked down at the wooden pedestal lectern as if seeing it for the first time and then sprang back look look at this the lectern was supporting a blackbound bible open across spread wings of carved oak its an eagle chris said lots of them are eagles this is not an eagle joels hands retracted as if the lectern were coated with acid look chris didnt understand an owl is a pagan bird joel intoned calmly like a bombdisposal expert identifying a device step away from it go down and open the door he closed his eyes breathed a brief intense prayer for protection gently detached the bible carried it to a choir stall and then hefted the lectern in both arms as though uprooting a young tree doorjoel gasped feeling less than certain about this chris preceded him down the aisle hesitantly he held open the church door and then the porch door until joel had staggered out and with an animal grunt hurled the lectern far into the rainy tumult of the night they heard it crash against a tombstone filthy conditions joel stumbled back into the church slapping at his surplice a strange fixed look on his face is this natural all this rain is it natural chris its only rain joel youre not seeing this chris are you youre not seeing it at all all heads were turned towards him as he walked back up the aisle chris sensed an element of uncertainty among their devotion perhaps joel was slightly aware of it too for he raised his eyes to the altar oh lord give them a sign give them proof he stood where the lectern had been his coronet of curls looking dull as if tarnished by the rain chris found himself praying silently for deliverance from what was becoming a nightmare it was joel spread his big hands helplessly the width of the aisle evil dont you see it wasnt an eagle it was an owl a symbol of what they would call ancient wisdom it was a satanic artefact cant you understand it had to be removed praise god someone called out but only once and rather feebly a man in a white tshirt drifted up to joel as if to congratulate him shake him by the hand when joel opened his arms to embrace his brother he felt a blast of cold air against his chest puzzled he looked down and saw that his pectoral cross was missing must have become hooked around the lectern and hed thrown it out of the door as well he felt angry with himself now he had to visualize the cross but he saw his brother angels open arms and he smiled his brother was smiling back his brothers eyes were brown and swirling like beerdregs in a glass thank you joel said thank you for your support thank you for your faith couldnt recall the name but he knew the face although he d seen it only once before joel chris said you ok seen the face by lamplight and edged with lace in a violated coffin joels eyes bulged he felt his jaw tightening his lips shrinking back over his teeth his throat expanding under pressure of a scream but he didnt scream he would not scream instead he stretched out his arms and grasped his terror to his bosom joel a voice behind him chris but so far away too far away a dimension away from deaths cold capsule in which joel embraced a column of writhing darkness comprised of a thousand wriggling frigid worms begone but it came out breathless thin and whingeing from between his clenched teeth he tried to project the missing pectoral cross in front of him a cross of white fire gasping in the name name of god as the cold worms began to glide inside his vestments and to feed upon him to devour his faith in gods name begone joel stop it hands either side of him clutching at his arms the cross of fire had become a cross of ice joel roared like a bull they were pinioning his arms while the cold worms sucked at his soul his own brothers in god offering him as sustenance for the voracious dead aaaaargh a boiling strength erupted in his chest in the centre of the silence the black bag was brought to the woman from the bag a thick dark stole uncoiling a slender vein of silver or white winding it around her hands like flax and holding it up and showing it to the corpse twisting it in the candlelight hair human hair two feet of it three bound together with a strip of greywhite hair rippling through it the womans hands moving inside the tent of hair with a certain rhythmical fluidity as the pipes moaned an aching lament the watchers mumbling and out of this a single voice rising a pale ribbon of a voice singing out i conjure thee and winding back into the mumbling with the winding of the hair hes coming hes coming and hes strong up against the vestry wall four of the men around him so he couldnt break away he wailed in despair whose side are you on blood in the aisle one man sitting up on the flags head in his hands semiconcussed chris pressing a tissue to a burst lip joel its all gone wrong youre seriously scaring people some of the women want to leave get out of here they cant they cant go out there now not safe do you not see joel im sorry theyre saying its probably safer out there than it is here with with you lock and bar the doors go on do it now lock and bar the doors joel please theyre saying you all that screaming and wrestling with with evil the infested dead with yourself joel oh my god this is awful somebody wipe his mouth where is he joel flailed but they held him where is he the spirit was he expelled tell me lets go back to the rectory shall we have a cup of coffee come back later when weve all you know calmed down whats happened to your face you hit me joel no yes you were like a man poss we couldnt hold you please joel youve been under a lot of stress fighting it fighting for our souls stinking of the grave filthy womancunt let me come on youre scaring people lets get some air please matt castle spirit of matt castle soiled soiled spirit joel matt castles dead and was here look declans hurt i think he hit his head he needs a doctor please illusion temptation they want you to open the doors and let them in if you dont do it of your own free will theyll get inside you fill you up with worms make you think things that arent true let me go i command you to let me go let him go chris just let him go we cant hold him all night matt castle its face was matt castles but i looked into its eyes and its eyes were the eyes of satan yes yes but its gone now joel i swear to you its gone you you defeated it you were more powerful you you threw it to the ground and it sort of disintegrated ah yes we saw it we did didnt we richard so joel come back to the rectory ok you need a coffee and a lie down after your exertions after your oh god help me was it wearing your struggle what was it wearing i well it wasnt i mean too clear not from where we were standing a a shroud was it and glowing sort of glowing joel felt his face explode liars his chest swelled arms thrashed one man was thrown across the vestry like a doll spinning dizzily around until the stone wall slapped into his nose they heard him squeak and a quick crack of bone and then joels white surplice was blotting up bullets of blood come on lets get out now dont go near him what about martin pick him up come on oh my god its all right its all right somebody stop them screaming joel heard scrambling and scuffling stifled shouts and squawks and screams bolts being thrown the soulless slashing of the rain and a shrilling from inside of him something squealing to be free at first he wouldnt move paralysed with dread then he began to laugh it was only the mobile phone at the leather belt around his cassock he pulled it out and inspected it a deep fissure ran from the earpiece to the pushbuttons he had difficulty dragging out the aerial because its housing was bent the phone went on bleeping at him he tried to push the send button but it wouldnt go in joel became irrationally enraged with the phone and began to beat it against the wall went on beating it when the bleeps stopped and a tinny little faraway voice was calling out mr beard would have continued until it smashed to pieces in his hand had he not recognised the voice mr beard can you hear me yes are you all right mr beard theyve all gone who the angels he giggled the angels have flown as angels are apt to do you wont run away from this will you never mr beard i told you once do you remember about the devils light how no one could cross the moss at night except for those for whom the devil lit the way yes i remember isnt it time you told me who you were ill do better than that mr beard ill meet you when where tonight stay in the church be alone no choice have i and yet i know you could always run away from it teasing ill never do that im not afraid you know i tonight ive embraced evil and i know i know that i am never totally alone well said mboy together well put out the devils light thank you joel said nobody else believes in me thank you thank you for everything he started to weep with the joy of the sure knowledge that he was not alone part nine feast of the dead from dawbers secret book of bridelow unpublished samhain i in bridelow new year is celebrated twice once in late february at candlemas the feast of brigid and st bride when we look forward to the first signs of spring and also of course at samhain now sadly discredited as halloween the feast of the dead this remains the most mysterious of celtic festivals a time when we remember the departed and the tradition bequeathed to us a time also when the dead may be consulted although such practices have been actively discouraged because of the inherent danger to the health and sanity of the living chapter i it was bad what he learned about john peveril stanage so bad it made macbeth wonder how the hell the creep had ever gotten published as a writer for children without some kind of public outcry and yet he felt there was something crucial they werent telling him something they were edging around it was i believe an incident with the cats that was the first indication ernie dawber was saying because that was the first direct attack on ma not your ma willie the old ma bob and jim willie said sadly they was always called bob and jim very slowly macbeth had been building up an image of this village as somewhere arguably more celtic in the ethnic and religious sense than any known area of scotland wales ireland or even upstate california and because hed never seen the place except at night and through equatorial rain this image was clearer and more credible than it ought to have been hed learned that ma wagstaff some kind of matriarchal figure had died under what the people of bridelow if not the medics considered questionable circumstances hed learned the significance of the man in the moss about which he recollected reading a down page item in the new york times some months back altogether hed learned more than it might normally have been considered wise for them to tell him and he guessed theyd opened up to him for two basic reasons a because they saw what moiras death had done to him and b because they and most other sentient beings in bridelow had good reason to believe they were in some deep shit whatd he do to the cats macbeth asked not sure he really wanted to know more a question of what he would have done willie said if old ma hadnt caught him with his magical paraphernalia and his knife and the poor cat tied to a bread board hed be about twelve at the time little swine milly said there were two cats on her knee one black one white i can just about remember it willie said i were only a little kid i remember old ma shut herself away for a long time most of a day just her and the cats one had white bandages on its front paws thanks to jack but it was better than no head and none of us was allowed to go near except them as was summoned always the practice at a time of crisis said ernie dawber i remember not long after i became a teacher at the school walter boston who was vicar then he shuffled in one fine morning and called me out of class i was to go and present myself to old ma at once well i wasnt entirely sure in those days of old mas role in the community but i knew enough not to argue so it was class dismissed andoff i went ernie dawber was sitting in a stiffbacked chair his hat on his knees and a cup and saucer balanced on the crown of it so in i go and theres old ma sitting like you milly cats on knees and our ma was there too still known as iris in those days although not for much longer anyroad they said i was to go back and talk to each of the children in turn and find out if any of them had had dealings with jack macbeth said we talking about what i think were talking about depends milly gill said nowadays what they call ritual childabuse is mostly just a cover for paedophile stuff for jack the abuse was incidental the ritual was the important bit lets put this in context ernie dawber said the bridelow tradition is very much on the distaff side and most of us accept this its a gentler softer kind of of witchcraft macbeth said milly said we dont like that word mungo it implies you want to use it to do something all we wanted was to keep a balance its more like you know conservation thats why women have been best at it not got that same kind of aggression not so arrogant as men in general ernie dawber sniffed once but what i wanted to say was that you dont get a tradition carried on this long unless theres a certain power milly said immense power concentrated here said mr dawber power macbeth was still sitting at the gateleg table there was a small amount of whisky left in his glass what kind of power we talking about milly rearranged the cats lets just say that if you wanted to do something youd do it a lot better in bridelow than you might elsewhere willie said for most of the lads here its no big deal we used to say it were womens stuff back in the days when you were allowed to talk like that so it were a while before anybody realized that jack stanage ill call him that though thats just an invented name he writes under that jack stanage had been like studying he always had a girl ernie said any girl any girl or woman he wanted thisd be from the age of about thirteen bit more precocious in those days than it might seem now yes milly said and they all looked at her milly looked down at the cats and said no more i didnt notice that so much said willie hurriedly him being a few years older than me what i noticed was the money he always had lots of money he was generous with it too if you went along with what he wanted you to do he could show you a good time could jack milly didnt look up not when youre ten years old she said uh yeah macbeth reached over to his slicker pulled out the paperback blue johns way ernie dawber picked it up with a thin smile you read it leafed through it in light of what i just heard i wondered if maybe not so much an allegory mr macbeth as mungo when i know you better mr macbeth not so much allegory as a case of only the names have been changed so let me get this right macbeth was cautious this is a guy who gravitates towards the uh arcane a guy who might like to try and harness other peoples powers maybe willie looked up what are you thinking about macbeth finished up his whisky it made him feel no better im thinking about moira cairns he said soberly and im thinking about a comb to joel beard former teacher of physical education the issue had always seemed such a simple one if good was to triumph over evil then good required strength good needed to work out regularly and get into condition indeed he found a direct correlation between the heavy pectoral cross and the powerful pectoral muscles needed to support it but he couldnt find the pectoral cross hed found the wooden lectern one of the owls wooden legs missing smashed up against the horridge family tomb now he was down on his hands and knees in the sodden grass the rain pummelling his back not that he felt powerless without the cross not that he felt like a warrior without his sword he could stand naked and know that his spiritual strength came from within but mr beard are you here joel stopped scrabbling in the grass felt his back stiffen the fluid tenor voice had curled with ease around the tumult of the night it was he realized suddenly the voice of a man who might have been a priest its all around you mr beard youll see the signs everywhere in the church joel stood and was drawn towards the voice and the question which had tormented him for so many months who are you they stood opposite each other at the porch door joel thought he was the taller but only just he couldnt see the mans face under his black umbrella the man stepped inside the porch and lowered the umbrella you dont know me ive never seen you before joel said water cascading down his face sweet refreshing rain rain out of darkness was not so sweet the man waited languid in the doorway under the porch lantern he wore a loose doublebreasted suit of black or charcoal grey its many years since i was here mr beard its changed thankfully otherwise i simply wouldnt have been able to come in joel said i took it upon myself to remove certain offensive artefacts well done mboy the mans face split into a sudden grin revealing large teeth unexpectedly yellow in his candlewhite face who are you joel said why are you doing this my name said the man extending a long slender white hand is john and i was born here joel took the hand firmly he had developed a manly handshake which some recipients apparently found crushing this hand he found when his fingers closed on it was not crushable it was like hightensile steel he recognized strength may i come in he asked politely m dear boy the man called john stepped to one side interesting weather have to say that washes away the murk of the past perhaps did you find it was murky when you lived here mr beard it was layer upon layer tell me small point what are your views on the ordination of women i deplore it said joel from the heart i shall always deplore it well said probably hasnt escaped your notice that the socalled spirituality of this place has been steered for generations by women they call this spirituality joel gestured towards the space where the pagan abomination had spread her legs john lifted his hands my point entirely expressed in various ways many years ago before i was made to leave not much more than a boy at the time excluded and then sent away do what they like these closeknit communities made to leave because you stood out against their witchery john shrugged its barely credible said joel ill be quite frank with you joel may i call you joel i feel weve known each other so long now ill be quite honest i promised myself that one day id see them and their way of life destroyed can you understand that vengeance is mine sayeth the lord however in certain circumstances were all tools are we not ive always seen myself as a tool quite john pulled open the inner door into the church itself and stepped through into the amberlit interior he moved like a partially blind man feeling his way he kept touching things placing his hands on the walls the pillars the pewends as if surprised that he was not receiving electric shocks its been cleansed joel said but its still vulnerable was hans gruber here in your time who oh the collaborating minister no i left many years before he arrived fellow called boston in my day but much the same y know much the same a quisling theyre all tamed within a remarkably short space of time which is why i thought you should be alerted how did you know id come here dear boy could you have resisted it besides which there was archdeacon flemming oh friends of friends y know joel was vaguely disappointed hed seen his mission to bridelow in terms of divine orchestration rather than human machination and yet could not the two be interlinked gone mostly unchallenged for centuries y know john said and so when local papers were passed to me relating your adventures in sheffield it was clear you were the man for the job as it were all the nambypamby clerics around all the airyfairy new age nancyboys no anybody could rattle them joel it was going to be you john walked slowly up the nave even the amber lights failed to colour the pallor of his skin or the snowwhite hair receding in ridges from his greyfreckled forehead used to have crosses here made of twigs and things dangling down kiddies would be sent out to collect the entrails gone i dealt with it and their nasty little shrine at the edge of the moor but your friends have chickened out why was that there was joel shook water from his curls a manifestation of evil some of them couldnt cope john i have to know are you a priest johns yellow teeth reappeared joel he said ive told you as much as i can about me and more than i should i thought so said joel he paused it isnt over is it if it were you wouldnt be here well deduced joel m boy have you ever been up to the lamp joel stared at him he felt an almost chemical excitement in his stomach the socalled beacon i said wed put it out didnt i i said between us wed put out the devils light so after you m boy where to the stairs do you have a hammer i believe theres one in the shed bottom of the churchyard john looked at his watch no time old lad witching hour approaches have to make do with what weve got he grinned affable relaxed and not quite like any priest joel had ever encountered stanage fixed it macbeth said so moira would be performing at the celtic convention he also requested that she play a certain song called the comb song which was of uh personal significance to her i know willie wagstaff started to pour out more whisky then changed his mind and capped the bottle i was there must be ten years ago when that song was recorded my contribution seems to have been chopped in the final mix but she wanted friends around her during the session she invited matt and me but matt couldnt come i think probably lottie wouldnt let him macbeth was a mite dismayed said she hadnt told anyone the background to that song before she didnt lad far as i know she just wanted us to be there she never told us what it were about and i didnt ask macbeth felt a small pinprick of tears quickly to cover up he began to tell them about the deerhead incident see just before it happened it grew real cold in that room and real tense like a thunderstorms on the way afterwards this guy who i now know to be stanage is close up to moira and hes bleeding from one eye probably got hit by a shaft of bone looking back i get the feeling there was some kind of contest thats too mild a word some kind of struggle battle of wills and thats what caused it i started thinking of two stags locking horns but there was so much energy milly gill was nodding so much energy that it exploded in the atmosphere and brought down all these things see another thing moira felt pretty negative about the deer heads the idea of guys like the earl blasting off at defenceless animals for kicks and then hanging the heads on their walls not the old celtic way she said to boast about i dunno the superiority of one species over another or maybe i heard that someplace ernie dawber chuckled the celts were more likely to display human heads but even then as you say not gratuitously it does sound doesnt it milly said if what you say about him bleeding is correct that if there was a contest then moira won it he wouldnt like that willy said macbeth sensed that beneath the table the little guys fingers were beating bruises into his knees he found his own fists were clenching but whyd he target moira thats the question whatd he want with her willie said well its no coincidence is it ernie dawber looked up at the wallclock handpainted with spring flowers i dont want to hurry you but im not sure where this is getting us willie stood up suddenly his nose twitched in disgust getting us a damn sight further than talk of sacrifice mr dawber macbeth said sac and ernie dawber put a finger to his lips dont you think for his own good it would be better if mr macbeth were to leave us bollocks to that willies eyes flashed and he thumped a hand down on the table milly gill said willie and bollocks to your daft ideas mr dawber we might have taken some bullshit off you when you was headmaster but not any more if jacks behind this least we know what were up against and you think that makes it any better willie ernie dawber shook his head no this is a man who was a danger to us all at the age of sixteen now hes rich and powerful hes had half a lifetime of indulgence in esoteric studies of what you might call the most dubious kind hes got a hatred for bridelow inside him thats been fermenting for about half a century and youre saying we dont need drastic action to protect us if john peveril stanage is in some way responsible for the death of moira cairns macbeth said grimly please just point me in the right direction and i will go bust this bastards ass willie and his woman looked at each other stark hopelessness in their eyes i hope youre not trying to tell me said ernie dawber with dignity that our american friend is in some respect less irrational than i am i wouldnt try to tell you anything mr dawber youre the schoolmaster and i know my place willie ive had it lass ive had enough of this crap if you want to go out on the moss and kill mr dawber just do it he stopped because the door had opened macbeth saw there was another woman in the room standing quite still watching them she was young maybe midtwenties rain sparkled in her thin blonde hair and there were big globules of it like tiny winking lights against the dark blue of her duffel coat you left the post office door unlocked again milly youll have armed robbers in cathy ernie dawber stood up his hat in one hand the cup and saucer balanced on the other i thought youd gone back to college you really think i could leave at a time like this mr dawber sit down please the girl walked into the room glanced at macbeth and thought for a moment then apparently decided to go ahead anyhow am i right in concluding mr dawber youve been offering yourself as a replacement for the man in the moss macbeth closed his eyes wondering briefly what the prospects were of him awakening in his hotel bedroom in glasgow with a real lulu of a hangover and moira cairns still alive someplace when with a sigh he opened them again into the slightly tawdry light of milly gills manypetalled parlour milly was saying how long have you been on the other side of that door cathy long enough the girl turned back to the old man mr dawber lets get one thing cleared up the man in the moss was in what in his day would have been considered the prime of life to us hed be a young lad ernie dawber placed his cup and saucer on the table and took his hat in both hands he was fresh meat mr dawber said cathy whereas you and i trust you wont take offence are driedup wizened and probably as tough as old boots what im saying is you wouldnt be much of a sacrifice mr dawber ernie dawber cleared his throat in the last war catherine when hitler was planning an invasion of these shores from occupied france the er pagans of southern england held a ritual on the beach at hastings or somewhere in cold weather and an old man went naked and allowed himself to die of exposure thus setting up a barrier against the nazi hordes i dont believe that old story either mr dawber macbeth could tell by the way ernie dawber was turning his hat around in his hands that the poor old guy was close to tears cathy said i know you love bridelow more than any man alive anyone alive young lady sorry but throwing your life away isnt going to help anyone least of all the poor devil whos got to do the deed you wont accept this i know you wont but youre like a number of people who got too close to the man in the moss youre drawn almost into another world you contemplate things that under normal circumstances cathy lass these are not normal circumstances yes but why are they not whys everything been allowed to go haywire youve got to ask yourself when all this started and how ive spent a long time talking to pop and cathy pulled damp pale hair out of an eye look you know theyve been seeing matt castle in the village willie wagstaff jerked and stiffened and went white macbeth couldnt take any more he got up walked over to the window and listened hard to the rain until it turned the girls steady voice into white noise crazy disconnected phrases seeping out like when you drove into a new state and your car radio was catching some stray police waveband and when she looked into the fryer the fat had all congealed and gone black black like peat macbeth pushed his forehead up against the window rolling it repeatedly on the cold wet glass he was too tired for this but couldnt imagine how hed ever sleep again from dawbers secret book of bridelow unpublished the triple death three was a sacred number for the ancient celts i dont know why nobody does obviously but think of christianity the holy trinity now think of the celtic triple goddess maiden matron hag think if you like of the law of three as taught by the cosmologist gurdjieff one force or two forces can never produce a phenomenon writes his colleague p d ouspensky going on to explain about i the positive force ii the negative force and iii the neutralizing or motivating force i like to think of a threepin plug for the safe performance of which the third force the earth is so essential although i dont know if this is an adequate analogy whatever the explanation the celtic gods appeared to have demanded a sacrifice in triplicate before the necessary energy might be released and sometimes the cycle of death seemed to operate according to some preset cosmic mechanism for instance the eminent celtic scholar dr anne ross has described the legendary demise of the sixthcentury irish king diarmaid whose triple death by weapon drowning and burning was foretold by seers diarmaid poured scorn on this until his enemies struck at the feast of samhain when the hall was set ablaze and diarmaid run through with a spear seeking safety from the flames the king plunged fatally into a vat of ale the celts have always had a great sense of comic irony chapter ii death no peace in it you struggle towards the light and the light recedes or maybe its the bastard darkness has grabbed hold of your feet hauling you back cloying sweating darkness darkness like a black suit thats too small for you darkness like black peat the kind of dark you dont come out of until youre long long dead and even then its somebodys mistake anythings better than this kind of darkness forget about heaven hell would be better joke so ok this guy he goes to hell right and its not what he was expecting no hot coals and stuff just all these other guys standing around drinking cups of tea up to their necks in liquid shit and they pass him a cup and hes thinking hey you know this could be a lot worse and then the devil himself strolls in horns cloven hoofs spiky tail the whole getup plus a big smile and the guys faces all drop and the first guy thinks hey whats the problem the evil one seems affable enough and then the devil beams at them all and he says ok boys tea break over back to your tunnelling this could be the secret of the damned universe tea break over boys back to the fucking tunnelling oh jesus help me im cold and sweating and dead timegap and you wake up into it again and theres the light in the middle distance only this time the light doesnt back off the light comes right at you a big dazzling explosion of light and all you can think is leave me alone huh just leave me alone let me go back into the shit into the black peat im not afraid of the dark im crying but im not afraid the ministers daughter cathy gruber pushed through the multitude of the born again into the rectory drawing room mungo macbeth following wondering how come she didnt throw all these jerks into the street a fire was blazing in the hearth a sofa pushed close to the heat a woman stretched across it she had her eyes shut and she was breathing hard her long dark hair hung damply over an arm of the sofa a small group of people was clustered around one guy was on his knees he held an open prayer book it looked as still as solemn and as phoney as a preraphaelite death scene macbeth thought as cathy knelt down next to the guy with the prayerbook how is she now in and out of sleep has she spoken about it she has to you know chris if she keeps all the details bottled up its going to cause a lot of trauma chris said who is this man i believe we talked on the phone oh the american i passed you on to joel didnt i some asshole zealot said macbeth and cathy frowned at him im sorry to say poor joels still in there chris said still in the church best place for him cathy said let him cool his heels for a while chantal can you hear me the woman on the couch moved eyelids twitching like captive moths cathy held one of her hands this really is a wonderful lady chris said to macbeth i dont know what wed have done cathy makes you think you underestimated the benefits of an oldfashioned anglican upbringing shes not at all fazed by any of this why im sticking close to the kid said macbeth i was fazed clean outa my tree some hours back he nodded at the sofa this lady your wife were united in god chris said as chantals eyes opened and then shut again what happened to her she was raped chris said baldly chantal moaned macbeth focused cynically on chris who looked to be about his own age and still had the remains of that bland doped look you could guarantee to find on a proportion of fundamentalist christians children of god mormons and sundry followers of the sublime light cathy stood up keep her warm call me if she wants to talk maybe sensing the tension she led macbeth away the house seemed stuffed with men and women feeding their bland doped faces with biscuits and potatochips drinking coffee from paper cups they were in small groups many holding on to each other and they werent talking much although a few were praying silently heads bent and palms upturned against their thighs macbeth decided this was probably better than mass hysteria you want coffee cathy shook her head he followed her into the hall she brought out keys unlocked a door led him into an unoccupied room with book cases and an upright piano macbeth said cathy reassure me that woman really was raped in addition to everything we got a rapist on the loose the girl pushed the door into place stood with her back to it she thinks she was raped seems shed gone back alone to the church to plead with joel to come out says she was thrown across a tomb and had sensations of violation cathy looked him in the eyes unsmiling im afraid that what we have on the loose is something that used to be matt castle the room was silent apart from the rain on the window which by this time macbeth hardly registered you believe that already he knew better than to make it a question its a lot for you to swallow in one night cathy said but bridelow used to pride itself on having a certain spiritual equilibrium and now somebodys turned the place into a battlefield opposing forces black magic as i understand it doesnt work quite so well without there being something equally extreme to ignite it like opposites attract cathy nodded my old man is an ordinary oldfashioned country clergyman whos learned not to ask too many questions joel beards an extremist same background as this bunch somebody engineered it that joel should come to bridelow with a mission to wipe out the remains of some very innocuous downbeat paganism we thought there was an understanding in the diocese that you dont put unstable fanatics into bridelow but id guess somebody was simply blackmailing the archdeacon this is the bosscleric as you say the bosscleric simon whos gay and whos been more than a bit indiscreet in his time and the blackmailer stand up john peveril stanage this is the one man whose name is never mentioned in bridelow the one writer whose books you will never see on the paperback rack in millys post office you were outside when i told them about that stuff with the bones in scotland cathy went on nodding she looked very young still had on her damp dufflecoat and a college scarf wound under her chin mungo i cant tell you how sorry i am about moira i sincerely blame myself i should never have let her drive away in that state he felt his eyes narrow state i think i must have been the last person to see her alive she was very down im afraid shed picked up a bug of some kind and she was upset over the burglary someone broke in here and stole some things from her including this famous comb which she kept in a secret pocket in her guitar case they stole the case just the comb seemed silly im afraid i didnt really believe her about that at first shit macbeth clenched his fists how would this sonofabitch know precisely where she kept the comb mungo cathy hesitated she told me shed only shown one person where she kept that comb wasnt me no said cathy it was matt castle the ubiquitous matt castle what was her relationship with this guy she was in his band and that was all she was always very insistent about him never touching her yeah but i bet he wanted to i know he wanted to he was crazy about her men tend to oh gosh im sorry the irony of it said macbeth is i never got to touch her either but i doubt cathy said not without compassion if youre of quite such an obsessive temperament something hurts is all maybe its selfpity i uh thought she was gonna change my life maybe she has you mind if we get off this subject tell me about castle yes cathy sat on the arm of what must have been her fathers wingbacked fireside chair matts son dic reckons his fathers lust unrequited lust for moira just got progressively worse with age eventually developing into almost a perversion about women with long dark hair macbeth was seized for the first time by the reality of something more potentially souldamaging than either grief or anger he said that woman in the room across there yes cathy said calmly i noticed that too this was more like it this was much more like hell christ i feel just awful pain in the head behind the eyes a growling pain put me back put me back into the nice warm shit youve got to come with me the devil urges hot coals roaring and crackling all around the inside of a furnace but without the pretty colours a black furnace with one cold flashing piercing flame piss off leave me alone look i havent got much time stabbing her through the eyes with his needle of light youve got all the time there is pal all the time there ever was and all the time theres ever gonny be that no enough for you please for christs sake listen will you get rid of the damn light sorry i forgot youd been in the pitch dark so long ill put it under my jacket that any better yeah youre ok satan you know that try and sit up get your fucking hands off me listen to me you have to get moving who is this its me dic dic castle light on his face dark red hair matts jawline matts stubborn lips she coughed it made her head ache she said all she could think of to say was it you was it you who took my comb no he said no i didnt i know who did who her back hurt as she sat up like it mattered now bloke called shaw horridge but thats not important right now no the name didnt seem to mean anything to her look dic i dont want to seem stupid but what are you doing here what am i doing here and where in christs name is here maybe they were both dead maybe hed been sent to offer her a cup of tea its a storage building back of the brewery brewery bridelow brewery you have to come now moira please im supposed to have gone for a pee thats all theyre going to start wondering where ive got to and then we could be in a lot of trouble she stood up there was mist to struggle through thick grey mist a monster rose over her and opened its jaws bridelow

hell wasnt speed was it i dont know i really dont know much about drugs bridelow brewery she said whys that scare me bridelow brewery bridelow black on her feet now panting leaning against something

listen theyve got my dad propped up in there and his clothes and the pipes and me and you please just go what did you just say a shuddering creak and he pushed her out and it was like somebody had thrust her head down the toilet and flushed it she gasped come on he took her arm she could make out the shapes of trees and a sprinkling of small lights among the branches not that way whats that tower part of the brewery cant you go any faster im sorry they catch you im telling you theyll kill you shed stopped she was shaking somebody was pouring bucketfuls of water directly into her brain she clapped her hands to her head she screamed christs sake shut up dic my hair voices lights moira run take the lamp thrusting it into her hands heavy wet metal dont use it till youre away from here running footsteps my hairs gone he pushed her hard in the back and then she heard him take off in the opposite direction shoes skidding on the saturated ground dic run he was almost howling just run dont lose that lamp dic what have they done to my hair where have they taken my fucking hair chapter iii surprising how vulnerable you felt in a tomatocoloured japanese sports car up here on a night like this ashton took it steady he wondered how much water can a peat bog take before it turns into something the consistency of beef broth not his manor the natural world the unnatural world was more like it a number of the people with whom ashton conversed at length usually across a little grey room with a microphone in the wall were creatures of the unnatural world as for the supernatural world i dont know why ashton told himself as he drove towards bridelow moss but in a perverse sort of way this is almost invigorating to be faced with something you cant arrest matters which in no way can ever be taken down and used in evidence completely out of your depth he looked down at the moss there was an area of manchester called moss side in which the police also sometimes felt out of their depth so choked was it with drugs and violent crime did the name imply that once centuries ago it had been on the edge of somewhere like this and if so how much had changed not the kind of thing policemen tended to think about gary ashton facing retirement in a year or two spent an increasing amount of time trying to think about things policemen did not tend to think about intent on not becoming just a retired copper working as consultant to some flash security firm and tending people who couldnt give a shit with his personal analysis of the criminal mind and endless stories about collars i have felt just lately ashton had been trying to talk to people as people knowing that in a very short time he would be one of them a wellcontrolled tremor in her voice inspector ashton im extremely sorry to bother you at this time of night but you did say if anything else disturbing occurred i should let you know immediately yes yes mrs castle but i meant in the nature of a breakin unless a crime has been committed or is likely to be im sorry but this is not really something the police can do anything about except he hadnt said any of that what hed said was yes ill come but as long as you understand i wont be corning as a policeman turning off the telly in his frugally furnished divorced persons apartment reacting to a peculiar note of unhysterical desperation in a womans voice and getting into practice for doing things not as a policeman surprising how vulnerable you felt not being a policeman on a very nasty night proceeding in an easterly direction across a waterlogged peatbog in a tomatocoloured japanese sports car to see a woman about a ghost well ernie dawber said finally i think it must be obvious to all of us where they are willie said macbeth wasnt fooled you know he knew we was keeping summat back lets hope catherine keeps him out of our way come on willie theres nobody but us going to see to this milly gill was hugging bob and jim and looking ernie thought a bit like his mother had looked when shed switched off the radio after the formal declaration of world war two what are you going to do well i know were only men millicent but were going to have to stop this thing dont know how mind have to see when we get there ernie put on his hat where the hall the brewery by eck i wish id listened to my feelings so used to them coming to nowt see thats the problem i remember examining the list of gannons directors last summer this was just after the takeover was mooted i know willie said j s lucas occurred to me too just momentarily like but i thought i were being paranoid milly looked blank lucas were tname of jacks father not many folkd know that ernie watched willie struggling into his old donkey jacket with the vinyl patch across the shoulders not seen that for some years lad had put on a few pounds in the meantime milly gill slid the cats from her knee well all i can say is you seem determined mr dawber that one way or tother youll not see tomorrows sun time comes millicent when being an observer is no longer sufficient and what about you willie feller who liked to pride himself on his cowardice true willie said but this is family im just praying ernie said as theyve not done owt to liz horridge willie grinned always had a bit of a thing for liz dint you mr dawber she couldve done no better than arthur horridge ernie said generously and mightve done a good deal worse eh willie was over by the window not slackening off at all bloody rain mossll be treacherous for weeks were not going to the moss said ernie were not going anywhere near the moss he was still thinking furiously about what young catherine had said about obsession that he himself had been trapped just as surely as matt castle and dr hall that there was indeed something powerfully emotionally disruptive about the bogman ernie glanced at milly gill who was not he reassured himself in mas league not yet determined that one way or tother youll not see tomorrows sun aye well ernie dawber thought well have to see about that the tapping on the study door was firm but polite cathy opened it they were corning out anyway though without much direction at some point macbeth had suggested they simply call the cops but cathy said the cops must already be looking into moiras death how were they supposed credibly to plant the idea that the accident was in some way unnatural chris stood in the doorway weve come to a decision he said thank you for your hospitality but we want to go back back cathy said to the church oh cathy said but you cant chris smoothed his beard were deeply ashamed cathy we had no faith we watched joel struggling with the demon and we thought hed gone mad he has cathy said tautly and now this attack on chantal she was the only one of us whose belief in joel was sustained when the chips were down she went back and she was physically and spiritually attacked could have been killed we let that happen open up did she chris stared at her in horror i mean to you cathy said irritably did she tell you exactly what happened to her come on chris a womans voice called from behind its only half an hour to midnight im sorry chris said god protect you god protect you both cathy flung the door wide there was a whole crowd of them gathered behind chris let me spell it out for you all of you youve all been used joel was used somebody wanted to break down the churchs defences these are defences built up over centuries yes said chris we were the last line of defence not understanding unlikely to be capable of understanding and we were afraid we lost faith in our brother joel we deserted him when he most needed us and it took the violation of our sister sister macbeth said shes your goddamn wife and joel was right too chris backed away about this man turn him out cathy turn him out and come with us of course im not going to bloody turn him out hes got good reason to be angry a friend of his died tonight chris didnt blink come on chris in gods name the woman behind him cried im coming cathy grabbed his arm what im saying to you chris is that its not safe for you to go back in that church any of you you wont do yourselves any good and youll probably do us all a lot of harm chris said pityingly our trust is in almighty god in whom to our shame we temporarily lost our faith and for that we have much to make up whatever happens in there will be his will he gave you a brain chris to think with you know have you given up thinking for yourselves letting him do all your thinking now is it chris pulled his arm away eyes full of drifting cloud pray for us cathy yes said cathy when theyd gone but who am i supposed to pray to because he was used to making a recce before venturing in ashton drove once up the village street turned around on the parking area by the church and drove slowly back towards the pub just as well he was driving slowly twice people hurried across the street two men together and two women individually flapping like chickens in the blinding rain there were lights in most front rooms lights in the chip shop but a closed sign on the door water gushed down the sides of the road down the hill where did it all go into the moss ashton followed the water as far as the pub where the only light was the hanging lantern over the front porch illuminating the sign the man ith moss no picture what would it have shown why had they given the pub that name possibly a couple of hundred years ago when nobody could have guessed there was an ancient body in the bog or could they ashton pulled on to the forecourt and dashed for the door lottie castle he could spot a liar in seconds he could also tell when people were deluded and he could of course spot people who were daft or innocent enough to be led up the garden path but this lottie castle now heres a cool intelligent woman who is definitely not lying a woman you could with confidence put in a witness box in front of george bloody carman qc and heres a woman claiming to be haunted you know why i half believe this ashton still quizzing himself as he huddled on the doorstep in his trench coat illfitting slates in the porch letting water trickle down his collar because this is s woman who sincerely doesnt want to believe it and it also yes an attractive widow well whats wrong with that the woman who answered the door however was not lottie castle but if ashton the human being was disappointed ashton the copper was back on duty the second he identified her miss erwhite chrissie aye he said chrissie and is dr hall here too not exactly here gary is it gary tonight hard to say ashton said stepping inside hard to say now her won smooth smoky voice taunting her as she struggled through the dripping wood booming out from the old disused recording studio in her head the voice sneering never let them cut your hair or tell you where youve been or where youre going to from here everything leaking out now from that slashed and razored head raw thoughts exposed at birth to the cold and spitting night for a bad long time shed stood alone among some trees and wept and sobbed and cursed and refused to believe it they can put it back cant they christs sake they can sew peoples arms back these days first the horror then the anguish and the horror and anguish and the rage all shaken up this wild combustible cocktail who she screamed to the invisible sky who them dic had headed them off theyd gone after dic and she was alone in the filthy night everything rushing back with nervesearing intensity the savage rain smashing it into her naked head along with the insistent bump bump bump of the taunting mental walkman and the things dic said stanage of course yeah the celtic expert the writer john peveril stanage never read his books too young for me by the time id heard of him but im going to kill that man that man is dead memories on the plane to dublin for a gig matt holding up a paperback the bridestones should read this tell you where im coming from moira politely looking up from joseph heller or somesuch mmm sure get round to it someday and then the american macbeth at the earls castle this writer stanton stanhope is he mad this guys face is white john peveril stanage the pale predator at the castle the combhunter the hairsurgeon moira clung to a tree its mesh of leafless branches keeping most of the rain off her but when her head penetrated a jagged tracery of twigs she could actually feel them graze her scalp she screamed in despair last one ok last scream last curse then you start to think god you drift through life listening to your conscience and your instincts and premonitions all your airy fairy feeling and you never think moira listen theyve got my dad propped up in there meaning an effigy a dummy representing the spirit they wanted to conjure necromancy the black side of spiritualism you collect in the appropriately drawn and consecrated circle the most intimate possessions of the dead person those things his clothes carrying his smell his sweat and those things the pipes he would most hate to leave behind and those me dic people who were close to him and and you the things after which he craved moira moved deliberately out from under the tree stared up into the sky until she was blinded by the rain and then hung her head and let the night drench her they took the comb they cut off my hair they have me they have my essence they have used these things to summon matt castle from the grave chapter iv how young frank manifold had ended up at the brewery he didnt exactly remember what he did remember was his anger reaching galeforce as soon as the cold rain hit it slung out again slung out like a kid from the only pub in bridelow settle down frank cool it eh frank dont you think youve had a couple too many frank int it past your bedtime frank theyd say it once too often in fact tonight they had said it once too often what frank remembered first was bunching his fists on the pub forecourt and looking around for somebody to hit and seeing only rain and smeary lights in the windows of houses folk as wouldnt come out in it merely for the pleasure of being filled in by young frank another thing hed thought about was hitting a wall but hed done that once before and his fist remembered and wouldnt go through with it the soft option wouldve been to go straight home and have a row with the wife but if susan didnt feel like a row she wouldnt let you have one simple as that susan who insisted that being in the mothers union was just something you agreed to so as to keep the numbers up but who could look at you through slitted eyes and take the anger out of you easy as letting tyres down dont want that he remembered thinking want to keep the anger raging through the rain in just his jeans and his ordinary jacket sopping wetthrough in minutes deciding at one stage i know what ill bloody do ill go up the church and duff over a few born again christians nowt against christianity as such nowt against hans gruber a southerner but a straightup bloke just that when it came to that big prat joel beard when it came to tshirts with jesus saves on the front and grinning tossers stopping you in the street to asking how well you knew god when it came to getting accosted by tasty women with praise the lord across their tits when it came to it truth was frank didnt hate born again christians anywhere near as much as he hated gannons which he supposed must be why hed ended up pissing hard and high against the main door of the brewery thinking maybe he could kick a couple of windows in before he sobered up which was how come he saw the lights and how come he found the main door wasnt locked well this were a bit of a turn up frank stood a while getting rained on and stared upwards summat weird about this light coming out the sides of the wooden boards on the topmost windows the owd malt store as was from what frank had heard from his exworkmates and his dad that malt store hadnt been used in twenty years when gannons had the winching system repaired on the outside of the building there was no suggestion it had been for winching sacks all the way up to the top again because the owd malt stored been shut and boarded up make it look authentic for was what everybody thought frank wandered around to the side of the building and there was the platform thing right at the top summat had been winched up there tonight obviously fucking cowboy brewers happen the owd malt stored been refurbished happen they was having a little cocktail party up there for the directors right then see about that frank went in she knew sure how ill she was soaked through and shivering feverish temperature racing up the thermometer about to ring the little bell knew also that she could never look into a mirror again not ever and yet her mind had never seemed so clear a cold searchlight ruthlessly spearing into dark and musty corners felt weak as hell and sore and she walked with difficulty through the leafless waterlogged wood but her mind was an athlete leaping chasms of dark thoughts her mind was an engineer constructing complex bridges what were looking for moira mumbled stopping moving closer to the stocky blistered trunk of an oak switching off the lamp is something longterm like a longterm connection between matt and stanage this had happened before matts enthusiasms were unstoppable if matt finds interesting echoes in a book matt goes in search of the author take this as fact matt meets stanage matt and stanage find so much common ground that secrets are shared at least on matts side nobody other than matt could have told stanage about moira cairns and the comb say that by the time these two men meet shes stupidly recorded the comb song and both matt and stanage are scenting magic and stanage has stored all this away for future reference moira sank down against the fat scabby tree trunk finding an almost sheltered spot between two huge protruding roots enclosing her like legs sheets of rain on three sides like touching in a cavern behind a waterfall ok if stanage has learned about the comb hes learned a whole lot more of matts secrets maybe passing on a few tantalizing but useless bits of information of his own about the old celts and the pennine pipes in return worth it because he sees such terrific potential in matt the most wonderful raw material for his own research because matt maybe like stanage is ruled by his compulsions only stanage is cleverer she closed her eyes and she was back in the ballroom of the earls castle his face is an unhealthy white he has light grey eyes and grey freckles on his expanse of forehead theres a whiteness all about him growing into arms like the branches of trees like antlers he is linked to the skulls on the walls he is the horned god the hunter of heads he has taken her hair and she sees it all with such brutal clarity detached from her wonderful magical combreared hair her earliest most important expression of individuality and free thought hands to her head couple of inches left less in places aw what the hell youre alive what dyou want huh revenge she shivered with fever and fury hands inside the guitar case stanage is feeling for the comb he is feeling for your soul two hundred miles away matt castle is lying in wait for death maybe matt in the last morphine minutes of his life is also reaching out for you those arms of sick smoke coiling out of the baronial fireplace if stanage gets access to your soul to the core of matts craving then stanage will have a link with matt that extends beyond death stanage will have a hold on matts spirit with the comb and the cloak and the longhaired girls always the long dark hair dic after a charity gig she was waiting for him in the car park about twentyone twentytwo about my age long dark hair the craving kept alive in the darkness of shopdoorways and the backs of vans and manipulated and moulded and twisted stanage has recreated me as spiritbait for matt hes taken my soul and thrown away the husk but why moira wondered so physically achingly tired now enclosed in the roots of a malformed oak tree an electric lamp on her lap why can i think so well why can i see all this so clearly unless thats to be my final torture that and a dawning unquenchable hatred for matt castle frank made his way quietly as his shoes would allow up the narrow iron stairs past the deep fermentingtanks up another flight past the coppers it were bloody dark but frank had been up here that many thousand times it didnt matter and the smell the lovely familiar smell better than sight that smell better than women halfway up the third flight leading to the mash tuns frank choked back what he thought was going to be a hiccup but turned out to be a sob he stopped in a moment of despair how was he going to live the rest of his life without this wondrous rich stale sour soggy aroma how was he going to survive he clambered to the top staggered out on to the deck clutching for support at the thick copper pipe connecting the malt mill to the mash the big luna around him his old mates get um out a voice was rasping in his gut gannons get the bastards out get the brewery back for bridelow he leaned panting over the side of one of the tuns and his breath echoed in its empty vastness one more flight he went threequarters way up to a door thatd always been kept locked for safetys sake for as long as hed worked there voices behind it not terribly subtle what time is it coming up to elevenfifteen no time for that then really i a light laugh halfexasperated just cant get over what youve done i really didnt think you were that clever now look you know presumably that we mustnt actually kill you not yet anyway dont care do what you want youre just a slag couldnt have a a crash a moan a rolling on floorboards all right come on pick him up sit him next to his dear daddy let him have a good whiff bind his arms very firmly palms up ok and at approximately ten minutes to twelve are you listening at ten minutes to twelve you can open his wrists frank was in a fog he heard it all but couldnt make sense of the words and some kept repeating on him kill whiff palms up open his wrists it was a womans voice not a local accent more words rambled down the steps franks brain tripping over them sometimes he seemed to hear the key words before they joined actual sentences trickle dont go mad just want a trickle at first steady plop plop plop well be well into it by then once you get the trickle going you come back and join us very quietly you say nothing blood to blood what if he screams he wont if he does you can cut another vein slow release is best i mean i was going to do this anyway this way we get an instant connection blood to blood blood to oh yeah and who would it have been if this one hadnt suddenly become available blood oh right franks hands were sticky on the iron stairrail brain couldnt handle it past his bedtime turn back go home sleep it off eh but there was a voice he recognized the voice that said it didnt care the voice that called the female voice a slag the voice of the owner of the wrists which would be opened at precisely ten to twelve but just a trickle unless it screamed frank screamed frank was screaming now as all the lights went on frank screamed dic as a figure shimmered in the doorway at the top of the steps and a new smell mingled with the malted air a smell just as warm just as rich just as moist but the new smell went up young franks nose and forced his mouth wide open like a bucket he belched up half a gallon of beer and bile which spouted up in a great brown arc and then slapped down on the metal steps manifold you dirty uncouth lout should have guessed frank looked up into supercilious wrinkling nostrils he began dumbly to move up the steps his shoes skidding on his own vomit his hands trying to make fists his chest locked tight with hatred his drinkrubbery lips trying to shape a word which eventually came out like another gob of harsh sick horridge gonna have you said the rough voice in franks gut this time gonna take you apart you smarmy twat he slipped and his hands splashed on the steps shaw horridge stood quite relaxed in the doorway a shred of a smile on his lips you are an absolute oaf manifold franks fists turned into claws and he took what he imagined to be a great leap up the final three iron steps towards horridges throat horridge didnt move at all until franks head was on a level with the top of the stairs at which stage a foot went almost idly back and then momentarily on top of mellow aroma of malt the sour stench of vomit and the sweetrancid essence of rotting flesh frank experienced the absurdly pure tang of bootpolish as shaws shoe smashed through his teeth and was wedged for a second in his gullet choked retching he threw up his arms to grab the foot but the foot was receding just like the rest of shaw horridge young frank realized he was flying slowly and almost blissfully backwards it seemed a long time until he thought he heard a metallic ching as his head connected with something solid metal everywhere in a brewery and a dull fractured crump somewhere inside his brains wherever they might be splattered chapter v there was a rustling over the tumbling water noise this was what awoke her how could she have slept how could she and half a second later there was a light in her eyes and people moving behind it two of them moira reared up back to the tree a spitting cat come on come on then hands curling into claws pray that one is stanage because she would die before theyd take her back shed die raking his face one of them gasped the other said by eck hed heard it before so it was no big surprise the hackneyed country and western with chorus leave your sorrow come and join us shed those sins fold the joy within one time macbeth had directed this madefortv picture about the crooked evangelist boyd c beresford the fourth spent a whole ten days cruising the bible belt stuff like this churning out of the carradio out of hotelroom tv sets out of mission halls and marquees until even arid atheism began to look like a safe haven so he was not impressed not even when they started singing in tongues because he knew how easy this stuff was to fake even while you were convincing yourself you werent faking it and all the healing that lasted just long enough for the relatives to throw in a two hundred dollar donation you feeling better sister or maybe your faith isnt yet strong enough for you to be healed go away begone heathen this real big born again christian on the church door stained jeans and a grungy parka tattoos on both wrists one involving what looked like it used to be a swastika on fire before it got reprocessed into a bulky crucifix fascist punk finds god it happened classic demonstration of what cathy had said earlier about one extreme igniting another listen i dont plan to cause any trouble macbeth said wisely all i want is to talk to joel beard i would like for you to bring him out here that too much of a problem cathy had said mungo you have an open honest face youve got to get to jowl talk some sense into him long as you go easy on the casual blasphemy he has to listen to you youre not from bridelow and youre not a woman tell him what you like but get him to evacuate that place they think theyre safe in there theyre just so naive theyre children the big guy with the ex swastika said you got five seconds to get them filthy heathen feet the other side of this sacred threshold beat up on a pagan for the lord jesus listen macbeth said urgently go tell joel that pastor mungo macbeth of the uh east side evangelical mission would like to speak to him youre lying swastika said but with audibly less conviction than a moment ago god will forgive you for that macbeth said maybe hes not there swastika blurted out he is everywhere said macbeth no joel i mean joel when we got here we couldnt find him hes vanished what do you mean vanished hes just gone well whered he go for chr where might reverend beard have gone flash of fear in the guys small eyes why dyou think were praying so hard so your friends have returned john stood bathed in blue light the blue was in the old glass around the enormous lantern round panes set in the four exterior walls were frosted white there wasnt much to it joel had expected more perhaps the remains of a clock mechanism but there was no sign of there ever having been one i knew they would joel said i knew it was impossible for them to forsake their god for very long john smiled his teeth shining blue still joel said i wont say im not relieved shall i go down tell them what we are going to do he moved towards the top of the stone steps lord no johns face grew solemn theyve fled once yes joel said im sorry the room was about nine feet square in any other church it would be the belfry here it was the lamphouse the lantern hung from the pinnacle of the roof it was perhaps five feet in diameter there was lead around the rims of the glass circles in the walls but no remains of numerals it had clearly never been a clock inside the bluish milky glass set into an old iron frame he could make out the incandescent shapes of three big electric bulbs john said used to be an oil lamp you can tell big candles before that probably a lure for the spirits of the moss joel remembered his nightmare in the cellar room imagining the lantern laying an iceblue beam over still water channels of rain glistened like icicles on the glass the light was quite ghastly dehumanizing john with his pale flat face looked almost demonic joel glanced sharply away afraid of the illusions this evil light could evoke though theyd been up here over half an hour he became aware for the first time of a small door in the shadows to his left whats in there do you know lets see shall we john moved lightly across the boarded floor pushed and twisted at a handle no fraid its locked joel closed his eyes and listened to the singing the hymn was trailing into a drone of tongues male and female voices flowing into a bright river of praise he tried to let it flow into him on all sides of them up here in the tower the night sky was roaring with rain how long little under ten minutes impatient are we joel excited why cant we just switch it off and go you see a switch anywhere m boy be on a circuit time switch anyway what good would that do no have to smash it violence im afraid strength what youre about isnt it joel strength might no room for nambypamby nancyboy clerics on the front line mmmm yes joel said youre right im ready for that midnight then back at the rectory macbeth said what could happen to those people spell this thing out reaching the front door hed heard cathy on the hall phone extension saying i dont know ill call you back putting down the phone to let him in now in the study sitting on the edge of the piano stool she said how can i say what could happen youre nowhere in this game until you accept that nobody can ever say for certain whats going to happen and anyone who thinks he can or that he can manipulate it is due for a hell of a shock one day macbeth said what game game you just said in this game cathy shrugged life i suppose but he wasnt aiming to back off ok so whats the bottom line whats the worst thing could happen before you answer bear in mind what i saw in scotland and that moira is dead and that i dont believe i have a great deal i care about left to lose cathy said calmly ive lived in bridelow all my life ive acquired knowledge of certain things ok and most of today ive been talking very seriously to my father whos had to deal with things most clergymen dont even read about sure macbeth said impatiently whats your point put it this way if it was pop in there id be less worried so what youre saying is in the great metaphysical ballpark these guys are strictly littleleague lets say theyre hardly ready for what theyre up against they create their own universe you see these people in this little universe everything is down to the will of god and all evil can be defeated fast as a prayer when real evil shows its hand it can be so traumatic theyll flip flip is right cathy said flip is the least of it real evil stanage is the man no one here ever talks about stanage is evil beyond what ordinary people care to envisage ok macbeth said first thing you cant stay here alone in case these people come back with some even more screwball ideas than they had when they left she looked kind of suspicious whats the alternative i reserved a room at the inn you take that ill stay here oh said cathy i see the big macho bit mungo how can i say this youre the one who shouldnt be here on his own what you want me to do drive outa here things didnt work out with moira lets draw a line under all of this ok well both stay here ill take the sofa ill call mrs castle mungo im not going to stay here im going to millys we have things to discuss and its women only im afraid my advice is take your room at the man get some sleep you look allin if theres anything you can do well ring you oh macbeth said i promise sure this was moira all over again macbeth just go away huh i dint recognize you willie was almost in tears god help me i didnt know who you were i think there was a similar problem mr dawber said drily in the garden of gethsemane on the third day willie could tell mr dawber was almost as pleased as he was but there was a shadow across it mr dawber said seeing somebody you thought was dead theres bound to be an element of shock take her home willie take her to millicent cathy moira said unsteadily on her feet willies donkey jacket around her shoulders willie reckoned she also was in shock whatever you like he said i cant believe this i just cant believe it its a miracle it were on tnews they found your car bottom of a bank ill tell you about it moira said it was your car oh aye willie said his voice rising there were a body in it police found a womans body he stared hard at her in the torchlight he wondered if she knew where she was he wondered if she knew what had happened to her beautiful hair he was glad that when hed touched her putting his jacket around her shed been stonecold and damp but solid mr dawber was silent if he had any curiosity about the body in the bmw he was keeping it to himself lets not hang about willie said mr dawber you go the old man said quietly ill carry on youre never going up there on your own mr dawber no way ill go if i want to mr dawber said and there was a distance in his voice nobody tells the headmaster what to do remember aye and if i arrive back there without you millyll kill me you know that much mr headmaster sir mr dawber said mildly this lassll be catching her death if you dont be on your way please mr dawber dic moiras body pulsed either of you seen dic castle not since the funeral willie said gone off teaching lottie said in stockport or somewhere you seen him mr dawber there was no reply willie swung his torch round mr dawber mr dawber had gone roger hall asked is he mad the effects were wearing off he didnt feel so elated he did feel quite relaxed he did not feel there was anything bizarre about this why on earth should he therese arched an eyebrow she was not beautiful but she was compelling he wouldnt kick her out of bed well of course hes mad she said didnt that occur to you he knows so much how can you know so much be so learned and be insane the candles around the circle were half burned down the other people squatting crosslegged the people therese was helping the people who did what they were told gazed dulleyed into the candle flames and never spoke look at it this way roger therese said youre quite a learned man yourself would you say you were insane matt castle slumped in his chair he wore a white tshirt and was quite obviously and horribly dead but he didnt offend roger hall any more roger laughed but stanage i mean he does know what hes doing dic castle something as primitive as chloroform administered to him on a rag was bound and taped into a metalframed chair with his wrists upturned this did not offend roger either nor did the hypodermic on the table hes done it before therese said many years ago he dug up a corpse dead no more than a week to tap her knowledge it is as youve gathered yourself all about knowledge i thought that was just wonderful he went into bridelow churchyard at night and dug the old girl up with the sextons spade he was about nineteen at the time he just you know has absolutely no fear thats half the battle when you think about it yes she was right conquering fear was the vital first step fear of being caught out fear of the law fear of humiliation look at shaw therese said shaw was a fantastically good subject because he was so utterly screwed up so socially backward to begin with six months ago shaw was scared to walk into a pub by himself now hes killed two people and hes never been happier hes out there now and if anybody tries to disturb us hell you know without a second thought and youre telling me all this he wanted to pinch himself he wanted to find the smell of matt castle nauseating and he couldnt youre one of us therese said generously youve been one of us for months wed never have got the man out of the british museum without your help and youd never have had the balls to get him out without ours come on its time have another drink i mustnt roger said coyly accepting a glass one final question therese what would have happened to chrissie if shed come to the house with me who oh the secretary the divorced secretary with no immediate family in the area that chrissie dont ask roger dont ask and you wont be told the truth therese poured them all a drink from an unlabelled brown wine bottle cheers said a dull emptylooking woman called andrea therese moved to a bench in the corner of the room opposite matt and slipped a cassette into a black ghettoblaster from the largest of several black bags she withdrew the pennine pipes and laid them at matts feet from the portable ghettoblaster seeped the weeping faraway opening notes of lament for the man dic squirmed from one of the bags therese took a pencilslim plastic handled craftsmans knife which she handed to owen a weedy expressionless man ill give you the signal therese said if it disturbs you you may tape his mouth chapter vi refusing a whisky gary ashton said im not saying i dont believe this ladies ive seen too many weird things put away too many weird people we all do sometimes youre facetoface with real evil and youre laughing it off you laugh off criminals blaggers toerags you dont think too hard about it youre a copper not a shrink not a priest you nick the buggers put them away thats where it ends meaning you cant help us lottie said far as the laws concerned mrs castle theres one crime been committed here somebodys pinched an archaeological relic hed sat there and hed drunk coffee and hed sympathized hed trusted them too both of them they were frightened more than if theyd been robbed although he knew buggerall about wiring and such hed been and examined the electrified gasmantle and fitted a new bulb and sure enough it didnt come on fuse probably hed said wheres the fusebox and lottie had said never mind truth was the bloody thing had fused at the wrong time and put the shits up two women who were already mentally stressed ghost in the mirror pipes in the night strange atmosphere aye there was there was a strange atmosphere all over this whole village tonight it hit you soon as you crossed the moss too much rain for a start as if it was natures attempt to cool something down to put out a fire somebody was busy stoking under this place put that in a bloody police report show that to the superintendent strange atmosphere there was a very strange atmosphere boss and then chrissie white said what hed been faintly hoping she might what if i knew whod stolen the bogman ah then id have a lot more leverage wouldnt i chrissie chrissie said have you heard of a writer called john peveril stanage my kids used to read him avidly he glanced at lottie one grown up now the other still lives with his mother and her new feller aye john peveril stanage what about him hes got plans to fund a permanent museum for the bogman as you know roger would run it stanage would have permanent access to the bogman so why would he nick it i presume you are saying he nicked it or had it nicked i dont know chrissie said i just think he has why ashton began to feel less hopeful cause hes invited roger to some sort of gathering at bridelow hall and hes told him he might be able to find out where it is thats not the same thing chrissie also its presumably only what dr halls told you well thats right i suspect theres a lot more to it than that cant you get some of your blokes and raid it or something oh aye ashton said the police are always raiding private parties at the homes of the rich and influential matter of course mrs white normal procedure happen the chief constablell be one of the guests or the mp what if theyre doing i dont know what to call it black magic or something well its not basically against the law luv matter of religious preference in the eyes of the british legal system unless it involves children or animals of course you think it does chrissie said rogers been messing about with the bogman ashton tried not to laugh i really dont think thatd have them cancelling leave at the vice squad mrs white chrissie and mrs castle i sympathize you know i do or i wouldnt be here if you want me to do anything as a policeman ive got to have something hard solid and preferably nothing at all to do with the supernatural lottie said angrily you think i ashton held up a hand no i dont thats why i came youre a nice woman and things are happening to you that you dont understand and dont particularly want to understand i admire you mrs castle but im wasting your time all right im sorry youd better get off home to your flat said ashton what i said was there was nothing i could do as a copper as things stand however i also attempt be a bit of a human being on the side anything i can do in that capacity ill be happy to do it just as long as its not illegal and doesnt mean saying tara to me pension hows that thanks chrissie said despondently but were all of us semiqualified human breaking off at a hammering on the door lottie looked up sharply initial alarm ashton noted soon subsiding into weariness oh hell id forgotten about him ive not even made up his bed whos this an american chap moiras boyfriend better let him in before he sets soaked ill go ashton said never know what else it might be this time of night do you moiras your daughter is she milly had given up on security the post office door was on the latch cathy burst through it throwing off her coat where is she im here just dont look at me milly had built up the fire with great cobs of coal moira was hunched over it feet on the redtiled hearth a glass of guinness between them her jeans and sweater hung from a wire line under the wooden mantelpiece she wore a dressing gown of millys with a design of giant daisies there was a pink towel around her head cathy grinned helplessly moira said take more than death to kill me huh is that it ernie dawber wondered determined not to see tomorrows sun and will anyone will we ever even see the sky again getting a bit whimsy ernest aye i am that ma been whimsy all night offered meself as a sacrifice ma wanted to go out on the moss and not come back bit pathetic eh he walked with a measured pace towards bridelow hall shining his torch making no attempt to conceal his approach well what would you have done ma doctor tells you it could be two years could be six months or less you start to think where am i going to be when it happens where would i like to be more than bridelow bridelow as it is now with the shades of things and the balance where else could i go and actually be any bloody use his saturated hat was moulded to his head the sodden brim as heavy as a loaded tea tray little problem in the brain ma thats why i was thrown a bit when your willie lost his rag and raised the issue of my mental state ernie chuckled i suppose youd have seen the black glow on me too eh owd lass and said nowt but did you see it around yourself happen not ernie became thoughtful he didnt need his torch lit when the hall came into view for the hall was all lights upstairs and down and brought back with a momentary thrill a picture of the old days when arthur and liz held open house for the brewery workers and their relatives and friends which amounted to the whole village in those days liz in a glittery gown arthur permitting his stern eyes a twinkle behind those forbidding hornrims and shaw shaw was never there on such occasions shaw they said was shy shaw could never say the headmasters name mr derder mr dawber shaw said easily he stepped out from the brewery entrance gate the stem of a stylish golf umbrella propped elegantly across his left shoulder his dark suit was perfectly dry good evening lad ernie said heavily ive come to see your mother small problem there mr d mothers spending the weekend at a hotel in buxton autumn break brave of her lad conquered the agoraphobia then has she she hasnt got agoraphobia mr dawber shes simply rather a retiring person shy even as you were yourself shaw perhaps its an hereditary problem dealt with yours though didnt you lad one alters as one gets older shaw horridge sheltered from the downpour was smirking it brought out the headmaster in ernie perhaps heredity says it all standing his ground dripping id like a chat shaw horridge and id like it now hed almost said my office at once for a second shaw looked disconcerted ernie pocketed his torch i wont go away wont you shaws smirk vanished and was replaced by an expression ernie didnt recognize but which he found surprisingly menacing come up to the house then shaw said two phone calls was all it took one to headquarters one to the doctors house at least this was something ashton could do theyd given him a name in connection with an incident under investigation he could check it out thanks very much doc ashton said owe you one lottie was over by the stove again deep lines in her face the permanent frown years of matt castle in the making ashton reckoned but not irreversible the american macbeth was sitting at the kitchen table watching him in silence black hair stuck to his forehead tension coming off him like vapour chrissie white was watching the american what was coming off her wasnt quite seemly under the circumstances well then ashton said putting down the phone they were all staring at him now your miss cairns i suppose im right in assuming she was nowhere near her middlefifties macbeth breathed out in a rush god damn grey hair said ashton somewhat overweight but macbeth sat down next to chrissie but it was her car clearly with another womans body in it whats that say to you mrs castle any other women missing god macbeth had his head in his hands his body sagged relief no way you could fake that chrissie smiled thinly well she said thats all right then lottie said what did she look like she was badly burned apparently as i say midtolate fifties plumpish grey hair quite short so who is she and what was she doing in miss cairnss car macbeth looked up there were tears in his eyes ashton let his gaze rest on the american there is of course another question two perhaps where is miss cairns and what does she know about this womans death hey macbeth said come on has to be asked sir and other questions like whats brought this american all the way from glasgow in the worst driving conditions of the year so far and whats he doing in this country anyway macbeth said how official is this well now ashton said that depends doesnt it macbeth said nothing for nearly half a minute then he spread his hands ok how much you know about a guy name of john peveril stanage chrissie gasped and ashton allowed himself a sigh of manifest satisfaction moira was choking jesus what the hell is this stuff shurrup and get it down milly said yeah but what ma wagstaffs crisis mixture said milly last bottle tastes like something scraped off the floor at a foot clinic cathy said seriously drink it moira we need you she drank it she drank it all every last nauseating mushroomcoloured drop all the time watching cathy over the glass the girls narrow face taut with concentration dic moira let milly take the glass away thank you cathy what are we going to do about dic i told you didnt i cathy said i said it wasnt dic who took the comb aye you did im sorry but whys he with stanage howd he get into this and the girl the woman therese pure poison lady strychnine but dic was helping them dic was helping us cathy snapped us the mothers you told me hang on im confused you said you werent one you said your father wouldnt i didnt know you well enough i lied its ok to lie sometimes except to yourself sure moira sighed dic lied to himself a lot he lied about his father he lied about not hating his father i know maybe we all lied to ourselves about matt aye willie wagstaff was sitting on the arm of the sofa i never wanted him to come back to bridelow me he were too disruptive you know he paused like our jack how it happened cathy said dic read stanage as a kid his dad was all for it imaginative stuff full of celtic reverberations she looked up at willie in appeal they didnt know you see matt had been away too long he didnt know stanage was jack lucas not at first makes sense willie said it were a long time before any of us found out peveril stanage derbyshire placenames peveril of the peak nothing too local how should we know he were never on telly never give interviews to tpapers so like a lot of kids cathy said dic wrote him a fan letter but unlike a lot of kids he got a reply inviting him to visit the great man beginning of a beautiful friendship it was stanage who persuaded dic to learn the pennine pipes matt was delighted as youd imagine dic having always rejected traditional stuff why would stanage be so interested in dic moira asked he wasnt he was interested in matt theyd known each other as kids obviously and stanage was looking for ways into bridelow that was his ruling obsession to get back at them at at bridelow specifically at the mothers the bridelow establishment the keepers of the bridelow tradition the keepers of i dont know the balance milly said the keepers of the balance god knows said willie they tried to sort him out they tried everything he were just just bloody bad what can you say and when he like finally overstepped the mark he had to go he were halfway gone by then anyroad gone off to university smartest lad ever come out of bridelow can say that again moira said slowly how do you mean overstepped the mark willie looked at the others milly nodded willie said bitterly he desecrated a grave spell it out little man milly said softly he dug up owd ma that were me granny mas ma been dead a week he had it all timed milly said the right day the right hour the right position of the moon all this he had to know you see he had to know what was being denied to him because he was a man a gout of rain came down the chimney on the fire a red coal cracked in two with a chippan hiss moira said he did this necromancy he tried to get information out of a dead woman willie reached for millys hand she said i was only a youngster i only know what i was told later by ma she said there were things he knew things he threw in her face that he couldnt possibly have learned from anyone else so either old ma told him stuff on her deathbed which is so unlikely as to be moira started to feel sick and it wasnt ma wagstaffs crisis mixture willie sooner or later matt would know about this guy what he was we never talked about it lass but aye sooner or later but hed be too far in maybe by then to be charitable in the end though its two of a kind exiles wanting in men said milly men wanting knowledge and now hes doing it to matt what he did to your gran dic told me he said hes got my dad how can we know milly said matts coffins full of soil cathy said listen the night dic brought you to the rectory afterwards he had a few drinks got a bit mixed up he was approached there was a sexual approach he thought it was you what a compliment cathy frowned next day he told me about it hes always told me things he was in a hell of a state he needed calming down you can tell how easily they get people moira nodded she knew well enough i said you were with me the whole time cathy said so it couldnt have been you thank you and then we talked about it for ages it was our only way in for dic to go along with it see what happened i think he saw it as a way of getting out of the influence of his dad and stanage and the whole thing moira started shaking her head lamb to the slaughter hes been through hell cathys eyes looking hot with sorrow yes theyve got matts body yes theyve been arousing him moira covered her face with her hands theres stanage and this therese calls herself therese beaufort he claims apparently that shes his niece thats crap all kinds of peopleve been attracted to him over the years hes you know hes magnetic i know moira rubbed her eyes i know his kind who else detritus theres a satanictype cult based in sheffield thats been holding rituals on the moors in the old bronze age circles been going on for years they move as close as they can to bridelow its got a reputation in the occult world you can imagine place of power moira felt herself back in the churchyard deformed stone across the moor hopping like a toad a quick splash of blood therese cathy said tess shes tessasomething dic says she came up from the welsh border tess brings them along theyre revolting that farmer there was a farmer killed on the moor sam davis he came to see pop last week lights in the night rams killed his wife reckoned they were even sacrificing babies its not unknown moira said i believe some of these cults are actually breeding babies for sacrifice how did that guy die fell down a quarry at night how do you know that about the babies read it in the news of the world moira said quickly look you say they get as close as they can to bridelow but they cant get in right you told me the other night there were defences the kind you cant see milly said jack could let them in down in cambridge jack was mixing with all kinds of people jack was learning all the time we had to do something or else bridelowd be just like everywhere else soiled only more so because because it was a place of power right we had to do something milly said or ma did ma was the only one could do it why moira hunched forward hands clasped i mean what what could ma do milly looked down into her lap where willies hand lay come on milly moira said almost angrily what is it youre not telling me cathy do you know yes cathy said i think so chapter vii ernie had taken off his hat placed it on the hallstand where it was still dripping five minutes later when shaw horridge shouted get out get out mr dawber get out before i kill you six months ago ernie would have had a regretful laugh at that six months ago shaw wouldnt have been able to say it without a hell of a struggle now it was quite apparent that shaw would indeed like to kill him and certainly could and it wouldnt be his first time feelings ernie had ignored his feelings his whimsy they were never specific enough never quite accurate he was a man and also a scholar in his own small way and feelings in bridelow were what women had and now when it was probably too late he was finding out what feelings were for he stood by the hallstand over his head hung a leaded lantern in a wroughtiron frame tasteful one of lizs earliest purchases your mothers no more in buxton lad than we are now she is shaw seemed about to stamp his foot with his folded umbrella he prodded the air an inch or two from ernies eyes ernie didnt move nearest she got to buxton is a bmw motorcar at the bottom of a bank shes in a police mortuary lad thats where your mother is known it as soon as he and willie had found the cairns lass known it really for most of the day that she was dead youre off your head mr dawber not yet lad soon happen but not yet ive told you once to get out i wont tell you again shaws eyes glittered like broken glass kill me eh you think i wont no i know you would ernie picked up his wet hat held it in front of his chest like a breast plate took a big long breath saw before him the little lad in class i of the infants fairhaired faircomplexioned tall but slightly built brought to school that first morning by stocky swarthy arthur horridge arthurs dark brown hair already greying at the temples ernie looked into shaws pale malevolent eyes just like you killed your granny eh lad shaw drew back across the hall his mouth twisted up and opened on one side his face alternating between a sneer and a stare of more than slightly crazed vacant incomprehension whats this whats this nonsense what are you babbling about youre an old fool mr dawber havent they told you shaw hasnt your father told you my fathers dead i only wish he were lad i you your fathers jack lucas john peveril stanage thats thats absolute crap you want to hear about this shaw shaw had backed up against the flockpapered far wall his mouth twisting noiselessly from side to side both hands over his head hovering half an inch above his baldness when i was a little lad ernie leaned his back against the hallstand relaxed there was a bit of a kerfuffle in bridelow minor scandal soon hushed up years before i learned the details anyroad ma wagstaff iris morris in those days young lass bit of all right too but wild nowt anybody could tell her wasnt going to stay in little bridelow was she off to the city our iris most weekends met a feller as youd expect educated smoothtalker name of lucas shaw horridge was standing with his legs apart panting a little came back pregnant wouldnt be the first one prospective father buggered off soon as he found out the old story and folks in bridelows always been liberal enough about that sort of thing except iris was a bit special direct line see presented to the mother same week she was christened expected somehow to have a daughter this is nonsense shaw said im going to kill you hear me out first eh i killed someone else tonight i killed manifold young frank i killed him just moments ago i dont think so ernie said uncertainly the idea of shaw horridge coping with young frank with a few drinks inside him was still a bit laughable wasnt it i did ill show you let me finish lad eh where was i a daughter yes they expected shed have a daughter first thats the way it is usually but no it was a boy and a most peculiar child white all over no yes folks said its retribution she sinned sinned not so much against god but against her heritage and the child a changeling they said know what that is shaw child of another species shall we say a cuckoo that was the word they used changelings my word as a folklorist all nonsense of course happen just a genetic throwback but cuckoo was what they said not out loud of course whispered it though when iris wasnt about but then she got married to len wagstaff and had three more and the family closed ranks a bit and the things john did later were covered up at first until it wasnt possible to cover them up any more what things pranks at first not the worst you say about them but if you were being charitable youd call them pranks cruel pranks perhaps they made him feel better shaw said eh you do something brave you push yourself and you start to feel better do you yes you can do anything if you push yourself into places you wouldnt normally go oh aye look at this for instance how do you think i got this he was doing it again letting his hands hover half an inch from the bald part of his head i dont understand ernie said cant you see shaw leapt about flinging switches until the hall was blazing with lights wall lights ceiling lights lights over five mirrors reflecting his bounding figure look look i was completely bald at the front even two weeks ago i was bald aye well shaw bent his head towards ernie it threw off light like a steel helmet well well what shaw straightened up know when it began to grow again when i agreed to get rid of the old lady your grandmother thats crap you come here you give me all this bullshit how stupid do you really think i am mr dawber ernie thought very carefully before he spoke stupid enough he said stepping away from the hallstand bracing himself to think your hair is growing again the fire hissed again there was a visible bubbling among the coals have to get alf beckett to fit you a cowl on tchimney willie wagstaff said prosaically to milly moira moved her legs closer to the fire feeling she might never be truly warm again your brother hes your brother halfbrother said willie but it counted for nowt once hed gone he were never spoke of again and after that ma never looked back and there was a new respect for ma milly gill said that she was able to do it do what what did she do personal banishing rite milly said she walked around the village boundary three times within a day and a night she walked barefoot placing stones calling on elements not usually invoked but he was a strong presence even then be july of that year when he come back willie recalled end of his second year at cambridge arrived in a fancy sports car wherever he went milly said he could make money or get people to give him things theres an owd tree willie said just this side of tmoss fore you get to tpub jack piled his car into that broke both arms elsie ball as were landlady of the man in them days she dint recognize jack at first went out to help him but he wouldnt come out of his car couldnt come out just sat there until the ambulance come ma were standing at top of street she knew who it were too far apart to see each others faces but i remember elsie saying clouds were hanging down hanging low like a thunderstorm were about to burst and then jack went away milly said and we never saw him again he knew hed never get back in long as ma were alive said willie and moira saw the fingers of his left hand beginning to crawl up the side of his knee so moira said if he wanted to get back why should he he were rich he were becoming famous he had everything he could wish for except his heritage moira said he tried to destroy his heritage milly insisted no he tried to restructure it surely he tried to rebuild it around himself it was a placid earthrelated female religion and he wanted to harden it into something he could use milly looked at her with suspicion ive encountered it before moira said no he was never going to walk away from that all the time hed be building up his armoury of contacts inside bridelow matt and dic we know about there are probably others shaw horridge willies fingers were drumming hard the brewery hed bought into gannons he mustve done that purely to get hold of bridelow brewery who took the comb bloke coiled shaw horridge but thats not important right now yes moira said willies fingers going like hell both hands now the bloody scale of the thing too big for us to see maybe we never wanted to see it hed gone right ma says thats it never mention him again and youll never see him again and we never have except said milly in shaw willie looked at her moira watched his eyes widen it was a mothers thing milly said never talked about i think mr dawber knew but thats all probably not many people remember now and i was just a child but when eliza mccarthy first arrived in bridelow it was as jacks girlfriend all jacks girlfriends were from wealthy backgrounds liz didnt last long i dont suppose she was beautiful enough it was probably just the family link with the duke of westminster that interested him milly pulled one of the cats on to her lap began to stroke it from neck to tail what happened i believe is that they had a row and jack just drove away and left her in tears in the street which was where ma found her this was before the banishing aye willie said something dawning she spent the night with us it were the year before me dad died hed gone to the man he were in tdarts team and i remember lying in bed and hearing ma and this lass talking for hours probably what you heard was ma warning her off jack next day when jack didnt come back ma introduced liz to arthur horridge and two months later they were engaged well four days before the wedding liz is hammering on mas door in a terrible state shes pregnant milly hauled the second cat on to her lap as if she needed reinforcement jack jack on the outside he cant get into bridelow but he can still get to his exfiancee bastard both of willies hands fell away from his knees cathy shook her head in distaste how could she you didnt know him milly said when i was nine years old he took me and two other little girls for a walk on oh you dont want to hear it was nothing by comparison with what else hes done but he could walk in and even if you didnt really like him hed get what he came for liz it wasnt rape as such you could learn to live with that anyway ma had a long chat with arthur horridge and shaw was born and he was arthurs son and nothing more was ever said i cant believe all this willie said cant believe we never thought we didnt think of the bugger any more better not to wrote his books under the name john peveril stanage we knew that so it was as if the jack lucas we knew had gone for good pouring all his worst fantasies into his books huh moira said something like that takes that american lad to come in here and drop jacks name in our laps before we put two and together oh said cathy mungo he still thinks moira spun so fast the towel unwound from her hair cathys hand went to her mouth but failed to stifle a cry they did that to you they cut off all your moira let the towel fall oh moira tears sprang into cathys eyes deliberately calm moira said they needed my hair to entangle matts spirit they locked me in an outhouse in the dark they couldnt kill me because that would have released my spirit defeating the object so they kept me in this sensory vacuum sedated with mogadon or some shit that turns you into a comatose nonperson so that your energy your personality your essence can be stolen moira stood up reached under the mantelpiece for her stiffening jeans cathy i you invoked the awful word mungo disgusted to feel a tiny smile pulling on the muscles at the corners of her mouth he still thinks youre dead cathy said hes over at the man id better call him uh huh moira shook her head i dont know how macbeth got here or why and i dont have time to find out im starting to see everything clear as hell her mind burning up with it they stood either side of the beacon of the moss heads bowed joel had asked shouldnt we pray we should meditate john had said joel stood in the blueness of it and tried to concentrate his mind to absorb the rise and fall of tongues from beneath to achieve a holy stillness but his thoughts lumbered apelike around the shadowed walls of the chamber he could not see johns face could only sense the mans awesome containment its time john said very quietly raising his head reaching up beyond the top of the great lantern examined the chain by which it hung from the thick long smokeblackened beam come beneath it joel catch it as i release it and while joel crouched arms full of light john reached up and unhooked the chain the lamp was unexpectedly heavy joel stumbled but held it pulling down several feet of electric flex which had coiled between the beam and the wall the lamp did not go out good john said now lower it to the floor they both stood back the pointed top of the lantern was now on a level now with joels groin kick it in john urged joel tried to see his face but saw only the bared blue teeth and blue steel ripples of hair he couldnt move this is the pagan light this is the lure very few people dared cross the moss mr beard except those for whom the devil lit the way have you heard that legend have you heard it yes joel panicking i heard it from you you told me and do you believe it consider the evidence i believe joel intoned that this is a place of pagan worship i have seen the signs i have seen the woman with the opened cunt i have dreamed of her and i have seen the dead walk and you know that this night is samhain the feast of the dead and that the light is shining out across the peat to welcome the dead to this place it shall not happen joel lifted his foot aware as never before of its size and its weight and he plunged it with a shattering through the glass lantern and watched the shower of shards blue and then white pierce the tumbling shadows the bulbs joel now the bulbs joel felt his lips stretched tight as his foot went back again and again lightbulbs exploding all of them whorls of jagged colour and then there was the creak of a door opening a rapid clumping of footsteps and his neck was wrenched back and the last thing he saw before the last bulb blew was johns luminescent teeth as the man held up a scimitar of white glass nine inches long joel bit rubber and felt his knees buckle before he was even aware of the single dull heavy blow on the back of his head for a long time here was only night and then there was a lake and a naked woman on a hill and the woman smiled with a sorrow deeper than the lake and joel wanted to scream i recognise you i recognise you now for what you are but the woman was gone and there was only a void of dark sorrow and johns voice coming very quickly words running together some in an archaic and alien language and a few that he could understand that by the laying down of the blood another deeper male voice joining johns in fractured counterpoint and shall be recompensed for that which we have borrowed joel trying to speak his arms pinned behind him confusion and humiliation turning to a savage anger as his chest swelled and his elbows jerked and there was a grunt behind him and he spat out the rubber and jerked his head forward and inside him he let out a great roar of rage and only a liquid gurgle came out and he felt his very soul was pouring out through his throat and something heavy thrust into the small of his back and there was a shattering explosion and joel was out into the flooded sky and falling through the slipstream of his blood part ten moss chapter i nobody in the house had been able to get to sleep anyway because of the rain and then the chief started to howl a terrified yelping sort of howl sending benjie hurtling down the stairs and his mam screaming from the landing hell go in a kennel that dog im warning you and the chief carried on howling even with benjies arms light around his neck and benjie shouted back up its that dragon again mam heard his mam snort from the landing mumbling into the dogs fur same as killed me gran and benjie thought he should get dressed and take the chief out into the street so his howling would wake up the whole village and everybody would be able to escape before the dragon came out of the moss moira was already dressed when they heard alfred beckett shouting in the post office shop shop milly brought him through and alf stood there getting his breath back raindrops glittering in his moustache theyve put it out he gasped holding on to the back of the sofa bastardsve put out the light willie pushed past him and dashed through the office to the front door hes right beacon of the moss milly explained to moira whats that mean that its out its happened before obviously powerfailures and such but with all the rest of it youre saying its cumulative right ill go up willie called back no moira snapped theres been too much rushing in fars i can see cathy the mothers how many are there its a ragbag milly said how dyou call a meeting the old days used to be said we never needed to call them at all well how about we try the phone huh theyll all be in bed jesus wept if i had any hair id be tearing it dic castle knew that a common way of committing suicide was to cut your wrists while lying in a bath of warm water and that it was largely painless letting life seep away he was not in a bath of warm water but he supposed sedation had the same effect in that he was aware of not trying to scream through the sweating adhesive tape across his mouth but just sitting there bound by string and wire to his chair wondering how long before it was over his hands were painlessly numb cloth tourniquets around both wrists so that the blood flow was regulated like an eggtimer he wasnt even resentful any more hed got moira out hed led them away from her and they didnt know shed gone with the sound of the rain muffling her hysteria him they thought hed just chickened out and run away and now theyd caught him and maybe this was what theyd intended for him all along blood to blood he watched their faces philip the glum satanist owen the exnurse whod given him valium through a vein andrea the careinthecommunity mental patient whod killed but not exactly murdered two small boys many years ago therese who thought she was already halfway to being a goddess dr roger hall who just wanted to meet the man in the moss real evil dic realized was a bit bloody pathetic outside the apprentice at the gate was feeble shaw horridge probably more inadequate than any of them because he had had money and privileges on a scale incomprehensible to most of the others over in the loft at the church dean also known as asmodeus had been hiding for hours with terence the hulking occult bookseller from salford awaiting their mentor the revered john slaveringly eager for whatever grotesque experience hed prepared for them the more perverse the more sensuously exciting dic had ceased some while ago to be shocked hed already seen in his father the damage caused by the perversion of a utopian dream he was twentyfour hed seen matt castles jolly infectious pioneering spirit shrivel to a sour fanaticism and then hed died and now because of his father dic would die too taped into a wooden chair with the blood draining slowly from his wrists blood to blood dic was staring across the circle with a vaguely surprising sense of pity into his fathers eyes when a movement made him turn his head therese had shuddered therese was sitting crosslegged although her legs were hidden in cloak and shadow there were candles ordinary white candles in glass jars because of the draught seven of them arranged around the circle which had been painted on the wooden floor in white and was actually two concentric circles a yard apart in the space between the circles they all sat like shadowy party goers gathered for charades dregs but therese had shuddered yes she breathed hes done it cant you feel it and as if shed signalled to them the inadequates started mumbling some far back in their throats making unintelligible noises as though trying to disengage their dentures revolting bastards in time the mumbling became more intense and seemed to encompass the figure sprawled rotting and stinking in the wooden armchair dic could look at it now with little sense of shock and no sense of relationship at the withering lips drawn back the yellow of teeth the stiff spouting hair above eyes wide open but glazed like a cods eyes on the slab his father of course if youd suggested to chris that it was a game a recreation like golf or squash or amateur theatricals chris would have been most resentful and his reply would probably have been as he would now admit somewhat pompous and selfrighteous born in hemel hempstead chris was an accountant in sheffield he was thirtyseven had had his own house on what was now a minimal mortgage since the age of nineteen so that when he married chantal four years ago life had not exactly been an uphill struggle with foreign holidays and two cars from the beginning and the fact that god had not yet seen fit to bestow upon them a child well perhaps that indicated god had other work for them chris had always been a churchgoer however as hed intimated in passing to the american macbeth the anglican faith had long since ceased to satisfy his intense need for a more dynamic relationship with his deity baptism into the church of the angels of the new advent with its fullthroated highoctane worship and its promise of real religious experience was the fulfilment of what chris had been anticipating all his thinking life within eighteen months hed become an elder of the church dealing with its finances investing its reserves getting the best deal for god it filled his life god therefore filled his life and god was not a hobby the validity of the church of the angels of the new advent had been confirmed by the acceptance at theological college of one of its founders brother beard who had been called by god to go out into the straight church and reform it from within gods reasoning had become all too clear to chris when joel had been called to bridelow his appearance at their house last night in search of sanctuary had made chris and he was sure he could also speak for chantal feel very honoured and he would have admitted this now very excited when joel had spoken of his discovery of the symbols of pagan devilworship in the lords house chris had been on the surface appalled and underneath he might not yet have admitted this thrilled and when joel had telephoned them this morning with a dramatic plea which said more or less bring in the troops the war has begun chriss blood had begun to race it was not a recreation it was not a hobby it was not just an unusual and stimulating way of spending sunday hiring a coach and everyone piling in prepared to fast through the night bar the odd cup of coffee to bring light where once was darkness it was a war when the initial joyous element had been rather dispelled of mental stress by first joel and then perhaps influenced by joels rather overheated display chantal chris the lords accountant had decided that a more precise and ordered approach was required if they were to avoid further humiliation when theyd returned a little shamefaced hed taken it upon himself to bar the church doors and state that there was to be no more wandering in and out for coffee and anyone experiencing anything irregular should simply clasp the hand of his or her brother or sister and pray for it to pass and there had been hymns and prayers without handclapping since they had learned that some faiths considered there to be a demonic element in this and the familiar flow of exultation had once more been attained until chris himself had heard a distant crash from somewhere above and foolishly disregarded it until the reality of their struggle became distressingly at first evident he heard and felt it begin it began with a cooling of the air and a creeping change in the vibe of the chant hoooolyamallaaagloriagloriamalalaglorytogodglorytogod the girl next to him had been singing melodiously her voice high and pure and sweet and then too sweet cloying in fact with an acrid saccharine aftertaste which he was actually beginning to taste in his own throat and then becoming simpering and childish peevish and playground rhythmical holygod holygod holyholyholygod goldyhod goldyhod golyhold holygold godlyhole godlyhole godlyhole and then it happened very quickly sort of whooooosh like a small hurricane of bad breath there was a wafting sugary smell which soon became sweetly putrid like the bad orange at the bottom of the bowl as the chant the pure song of tongues suddenly was sounding raucous and guttural women cackling hideously enticingly and men making grunting retching foul pig noises were doing it chris thought in a kind of euphoric dismay as a slimy earth taste arose in his throat we are exorcizing the evil just that nobody had told him it would be quite so unpleasant and stimulating when paul their musician who had admittedly never been all that proficient began to force a vicious grinding discordance through the organ pipes chris stepped out into the aisle and ran up the steps of the pulpit from where he observed that at least five angels of the new advent had begun hurriedly to divest themselves of their apparel he also saw three men one a kind of albino with a cherubs mouth emerge from the vestry and calmly let themselves of the church by the main door they were laughing there was still no sign of joel joel who was this joel chris saw no more for he was attacked by one of his squealing sisters and his face clawed and he enjoyed it immensely mungo macbeth had specialized for over ten years in the downmarket kind of tvmovie in which people fell wildly in love and moved heaven and earth to find fulfilment in someones arms between times hed done cop movies about hardbitten cynical cops who underneath it all had feelings same as anyone else however apart from the ones whod given him parking and speeding tickets macbeth had never before met a cop who was not being played at unreasonable expense by some asshole with a beach house and security gates love stories did not end before they had even begun with the death of the love object and cop movies were never about cops who sat in your car in an endless monsoon which by the way was becoming seriously frightening and said well im buggered if i know how to handle this mate they were parked up by the church in macbeths car on account of the greyhaired wearylooking cop wasnt even sure his would stand up to the conditions macbeth also pretty tired said how about you just call up the precinct house and have a bunch of uniforms directed this way ashton said how about you get sensible pal i apologise look ashton said it seems very likely a crime has been committed but what scares the living shit out of me is that the possible criminal element in all this does not seem to be the worst aspect if you get my meaning yeah and if i were to contact my headquarters and somebody there did actually take me seriously their first instruction i know this much would be do nothing ashton scrubbed at the misted windshield im not in the mood for some shinyarsed politician telling me to do nowt theres summat nasty here i dont know how to react but i have to right i dunno macbeth said it was different somehow when i thought moira was dead how do you know shes not ashton demanded blunt as a sledgehammer what are you saying christ im saying help me im saying im not playing this by the book because theres no book i know of covers it im saying that normally as a copper id want nothing at all to do with you because i dont know you from adam but at least you look a bit too soft and innocent to be a villain and if im not playing it as a copper i need some help and youre all im bloody got ok macbeth said reluctantly first question you equipped with a piece eh are you armed are you thick ashton said or just american macbeth shrugged and started up the car ok he said lets crash the party hoping moira would be there but not not involved ok lottie said fifty yards from the church make a right so if i reverse he never got to do it the hirecar was surrounded by people they were banging on the windows and the roof shortly after shaw horridge stopped screaming ernie dawber tried to get past him to the front door and this proved to be a bad mistake his second bad mistake for a long time shaw had been tearing around the hall clutching at his head hed have been tearing his hair if thered been enough to get a grip on it was a squarish hall with a high ceiling and these five mirrors three of them fulllength put there by liz to spread the light it had not been the place to break the spell how could the lad ever have convinced himself that his hair was growing again when the opposite was true hadnt he looked in a mirror recently and if he had what had he seen certainly not what all five mirrors had reflected tonight before shaws tenuous selfcontrol had snapped and hed picked up a chair of victorian mahogany and swung it above his head around the walls and his shining baldness was reflected a thousandfold in the hail of flying glass as ernie cowered on his knees by the hallstand protecting his face with his hat when he made a dash for the door shaw was on him in one bound his sharp pale face aglitter with blood and glass bright as jewellery how did you do it how did you do it old man it was some minutes before ernie came to understand that the poor crazed boy was holding him responsible for the disappearance of his hair listen to me ernie said gently they lied to you lad they lied about everything your hair the brewery your poor mother they bewitched him twisted his mind before ernie could choose the least inflammatory words shaws face convulsed he snatched up the chair again and smashed it down on the hallstand an inch from ernies ear snapping off two legs get it back shaw shrieked get my hair back and if this was a dream it didnt matter thered be no awakening anyway dic thought about his mother all shed had to put up with from the bastard she should have married a secondaryschool head or a bank manager in wilmslow or an airline pilot working out of ringway all that grit gone to waste on a twobit musical maverick committed to a primitive instrument you could barely get a proper tune out of made him want to weep the candles were burning low either this or his vision was going blood to blood he tried to catch the eyes of the bitch therese as she cried i conjure thee matthew empowered by the highest strength i conjure thee the candles guttered the pennine pipes lying like a dead cormorant in his fathers rotting lap began to throb and to squirm as though they were full of maggots i conjure thee matthew under penalty of being burned and tortured in the fires for ever and ever i conjure thee to appear before me and to answer my questions air farting through the pennine pipes until they squeaked and heaved in their wrapping of black hair with a single white streak i conjure thee matthew by the power of thine own base desires to appear before me in a pleasant and human form and to present to me the spirit of thy father of the moss slipping in and out of dream samhain and they said the walls were thin as paper he thought he saw a quiver on the yellow peeling lips of his fathers corpse i conjure thee a man with a knife nothing ornate or ceremonial just a cheap craft workers knife with a red plastic handle one of the untouchables bending over dic and huffing and panting by the highest power and by the angels of the firmament the numbing power of the drug fell away from dic like an old raincoat leaving him naked all his nerves singing his cheeks bulging like a trumpeters with a vast scream taped into his face for ever mmmmmmm he screamed into the adhesive tape and by the angels of the deep and with the blood that was thy blood and shall be again matthew the knife cut through the tourniquets at his wrists and dic closed his eyes feeling nothing in his numb etiolated arms and yet feeling the blood rise in fountains i conjure thee chapter ii hey stop this bloody car come on big shambling guy macbeth recognized as stan the bartender but stan wasnt interested in macbeth youre the copper arent you happen ashton said warily there was stan and some of the other guys whod been in the bar when macbeth arrived but not the kid whod figured to punch him out also there was willie wagstaff macbeth leapt out grabbed the little guy by the arm willie hey listen up the body in the car this was not moira oh said willie his mind was clearly elsewhere he kept glancing over his shoulder towards the church and around the street stan was bawling into the car window at ashton bloody hooligans fanatics youre the police get um out willie that means shes not dead you hear me im only one policeman sir and im off duty you knew willie you knew goddamn it they dont know youre on your own stan said supposed to be flaming christians shouldve heard the language just knock on tdoor and tell um tsling their hooks whats the problem were getting wet macbeth said goddamn it you know willie where is she gary ashton annoyed was out of the car slamming the door holding both hands up all right quieten down whats so important macbeth backed out looked around the small assembly cathy know about this willie nodded urgently eight or nine of them now almost a mob macbeth said gary theres a bunch of wellmeaning but seriously misguided people in there take it from me these guys arent shitting they need to be got out and we need to get in stan said soberly just dont want more trouble than we can handle ashton stood in the rain pulling on his jaw ok he said eventually if i can clear this church out for you maybe you can do something for me afterwards all right stan shrugged causing his oldfashioned plastic raincoat to crackle willie said something about mr dawber looking upset his fingers compulsively chinking the coins in his pocket and another thing ashton said im not a policeman youve never seen a policeman here tonight you got that moira pulled on the navy blue duffle coat jesus havent worn one of these in years this makes me a mother mother maiden hag cathy said its all the same in bridelow just as well moira said i dont qualify as any of the above where are we going milly led her out into the street not far mind you dont drown in the gutter not far turned out to be ma wagstaffs little stone terraced cottage its step awash but still gleaming white in the beam of the lamp dic had given to moira listen im getting worried about dic shed said a few minutes earlier to cathy me too cathy said but they couldnt kill him could they for the same reason they couldnt kill you surely no moira had said dubiously but sometimes you can do more harm to someone than killing themd be you know milly unlocked the front door and put on lights moira took in a tiny and ancient parlour with more bottles than a pharmacy or maybe this was a pharmacy there was a light of sadness over the room i dont know where to start milly said well we dont have much time whered she keep her you know recipes and stuff milly smiled wryly in her head oh shit moira began to open cupboards in the side and found more bottles there were a few dozen books maybe thered be papers stuffed inside one of them whats upstairs her bathroom her sewing room her bed are we sure she copied it down i remember seeing a map a plan kind of i know i did keeping jack out it wasnt something you went into lightly you know moira felt a light breeze on one side of her face it smelt vaguely of sage something that hadnt been done for centuries milly said and it had to be exact i dont know what to say maybe if moira turned very casually around and looked back through the doorway into the hall where she saw a little woman in misty shades of grey and sepia a little woman who might have been formed had it been daylight had there been sun by the coalescence of dustmotes the little woman slowly shook her head and disappeared moira turned back into the room its not here she said softly ma wagstaff had no map chris picked up the pink tshirt and held it up in front of him and started to laugh across the front of the tshirt was inscribed thank god for jesus he looked at it for long seconds it made no sense to him no sense at all any more it was gaudy it was trite it was meaningless the girl who was called claudette looked a whole lot better without it curled up asleep under the pulpit draped in velvet curtains torn down from the vestry nice tits chris remembered paused wasnt that a pretty bloody sinful thing to contemplate in the house of god yeah well shed be pretty cold though claudette when she awoke it was getting bitter in here those ambertinted lights created a completely false impression of warmth making the pillars seem mellow the communion wine had helped a bit gerry the solicitor from rotherham had found two bottles in the vestry well why not it was a socalled pagan place wasnt it it wasnt a sin to drink heathen wine sin chris shook his head so trite only problem was after that wine he wanted a pee forget it hed decreed automatically about a quarter of an hour ago nobody goes out although for the life of him he couldnt remember why nobody should go out except that while it might be cold in here it was extremely wet out there frankly chris reckoned he could probably use a piss a pint and a bag of chips in that order stupidest thing theyd done had been to let the bloody bus go that was joel again silly sod burn your boats hed instructed them well it was all right for him hed cleared off somewhere least he could have done was left his mobile phone around they could have got reg hattersley out of bed and bribed him to fetch his coach back chris surveyed his little band all fortyseven of them the angels of the new advent highflown name eh for an assorted bunch of misfits whose sole connecting factor was the conviction that their lives were one course short of a banquet only one course note they all had their own houses and decent cars and dishwashers etc some of them were wandering around rubbing their heads a couple had lit cigarettes his watch told him it had gone midnight this was getting ridiculous he remembered the singing breaking up into selfparody and a few of them had torn clothes off mostly the ones clad in propaganda clobber like this silly tshirt and then thered been isolated outbursts of anger and resentment mostly towards joel beard whod brought them to this dump and then abandoned them but not before going berserk and assaulting martin whod lost a tooth and declan who was convinced he was suffering delayed concussion and of course convincing chantal shed been raped by an evil spirit i ask you chris said scornfully aloud when someone started banging on the door he wandered across suspicious whosat who am i talking to an authoritative kind of voice yes chris said equally peremptory this is the police the voice said levelly i dont know who you are but i have to inform you that you have no legal right to occupy this building and im suggesting you vacate it immediately if you unbolt this door and everyone comes out without any trouble i can promise you that no further action is likely to be taken if however yeah chris said this really was the police a distant voice berated him his own voice within his chest he heard it say get thee hence tempter what he might well have said out loud an hour ago what a plonker hed been i do strongly advise you sir not to play sillybuggers open this door please chris gazed at the oak door probably six inches thick at the iron bolts four inches wide where is your power the inner voice bleated pathetically at the policeman blow it down why dont you with your foul satanic breath mustve been nuts chris thought all of us mass hysteria yeah all right he said resignedly and drew back the bolts there were cheers of relief from the brothers and sisters sprawled among the pews though glances were exchanged milly didnt ask her how she knew there was nothing in the house there was silence then milly said what are we going to do now dont know about you moira said but i think im gonny cry moira willie was in the doorway about a yard from where mas ghost had stood milly shook her head its not here little man willie nodded unsurprised she werent much of a fileraway of stuff cept for foulsmelling gunge in the bottom of owd bottles dont knock it moira said less than half an hour after forcing down mas crisis mixture she was inexplicably feeling stronger than she had in some while moira willie glanced behind him to where the rain bounced off mas moonwhite doorstep dont you think yeah moira said i know i know she sighed ok come away in macbeth suddenly selfconscious she found herself mindlessly reaching for the duffelcoat hood to cover the desolate ruins of her hair ach she said and let her hands fall to her sides when he stumbled over the threshold this mungo macbeth of the manhattan macbeths he was looking no more smooth and glamorous than the average drownedrat hiker from the moor willie had told her briefly how the guy had driven all the way from glasgow with three crucial words john peveril and stanage mungo she said her voice unexpectedly husky i dont know what im gonny do with you and thats the truth macbeth smiled a soft stupid wetfaced smile she could tell he hadnt even noticed her hair the one big thing he said almost in a whisper and made no sense it fact it was all crazy moira thought horrifically crazy he shouldnt be here he didnt know what the hell he was into he didnt have a chance and did any of them chapter iii eventually benjie had persuaded his mam to let him take the chief to his bedroom where the german shepherd squeezed himself into the gap between the wardrobe and the wall sat there with his ears down and panted a lot come on lad benjie whispered sitting up in bed in old ninja turtle pyjamas but the chief wouldnt move he kept himself in this dark corner and there was pleading in his sad brown eyes above the noise of rain benjie could hear other village dogs howling in the distance when he lay down and shut his eyes he realised that the way the chief was panting meant he was really howling too but the chief was smart the last thing he wanted was to have himself taken out to the shed when benjie opened his eyes again he saw lightbeams flitting across the curtains like car headlights which would have been all right only the back of the house overlooked the moss and there were no cars on the moss except months ago when the lorries and jcbs had been out building up the road and theyd found the bogman benjie scrambled to the end of his bed leaned over and stuck his head through the gap in the curtains he gasped it were like fireworks night out there lights all over the moss like smouldery bonfires lights swooshing like rockets through the rain from one side to another sometimes going across each other but no noise except for the howling dogs and the rain the lights lasted no more than ten seconds and then it was all gone and benjie couldnt see anything apart from the water rolling down the glass but when he lay in bed the light showed up in the space between his eyes and his closed eyelids he saw the moss lit up greenish now all green and glowing except for the dragon tree and that was twice as big now its branches all gnarled and knotted and black among whirling spinning lights two of them spiking up into the sky arms like giant horns with groping claws on the end and the whole thing was breathing dragging up big soggy lungfuls of peat and soon it was going to burst and its arms would gather up the whole village benjie felt a scream coming on and chewed the bedclothes instead not wanting to be put out in the shed with the chief and get gobbled up first macbeth watched chris and chantal sink side by side into the sofa at the rectory they didnt seem like the same people i really am tired chris said im shagged out and then clearly shocked at himself he looked up at cathy im sorry i dont know what im saying catherine has something got inside me am i possessed cathy waved it away chris youve got to tell me very quickly no evasion what happened in there chris tugged at his beard i just dont know first of all it was fine we felt how we used to feel holy special and then it all went wrong really quickly it went dirty it was like baptism chantal said hugging herself with goosebumpy arms only in reverse in our baptism our rebaptism we throw off some of our outer clothes symbolically and were submerged in water it could be a river or well hire a public pool for an afternoon and you come up cleansed and purified thats it chris said eyes full of agony thats right only this was like being submerged and some of us threw off our christian clothes and we came up not so much dirty well yes dirty but worse really like it was before people smoking chantal recalled in church but it didnt feel like church it didnt feel like anywhere yeah and blaspheming in an everyday sort of throwaway fashion and we drank god forgive us we drank the communion wine like it was any old pop it didnt matter we were like the mass of godless people out there we didnt need religion any more we had no use for it catherine im confused well burn in hell for this i think weve started to burn its ok cathy said soothingly the fires out now she turned to moira and macbeth its obvious isnt it it was the final sterilization well moira said you cant just drain the power of centuries out of stone you can only take it out of people you let them absorb it through their mindless passive ritual and then you snuff out the light blow their shaky faith up their faces and leave them empty and when they walk out totally knackered like this guy here theyve drained out everything that was left in the church forgive me macbeth said whyd they wanna do that because the church is the sacred centre of the village cathy said its got to be neutralized before you can she stopped for breath and couldnt go on replace it with something black and horrible moira said what what can we do to help chris asked rather feebly cathy rounded on him you can keep your bums on that settee call in all your friends and dont move until your coach comes for you and then you can go away for ever steady cathy moira took her arm wants to know if hes possessed cathy said with a sharp laugh well of course hes possessed possessed of a very slow brain moira look theres a copper out there who wants to go up the hall with stan burrows and a bunch of his mates and do some sorting out as they put it so stop him moira said you try and stop him look they go up there mobhanded god knows what could happen its pretty damned obvious and were looking at something planned months ago that stanage has shut down the church to deflect a lot of energy towards the second natural focus the secondhighest building in bridelow the brewery right and whats at the very top of the brewery building thowd maltstore willie wagstaff said impatiently disused moira happen this is over me head but why dont we go up there mobhanded and flush the buggers out because you cant fight this thing with primitive violence i swear to you willie those guys go up there theyll wind up killing each other its like how come you can put a bunch of ardent biblepunching bornagain christians in a church and they come drifting out an hour or so later with this amazing bornagain apathy hes right though moira cathy said we cant just stand around doing nothing somebody ought to go up there its what ive been trying to tell you willie cried all eight fingers beating at his thighs somebody has mr dawbers up there and mr dawbers been in a mind to do summat daft ok moira said come on willie well go in my car macbeth offered moving to the door ah not you mungo what macbeth counted three seconds of silence before he tore off his black slicker and slammed it to the rectory lino with a noise like a gunshot willie jumped back on the sofa chris and chantal gripped hands now listen up macbeth snarled everybody just fucking listen up i have had it i have had it up to here with getting told to butt out i am sick to my gut with being treated like some goddamn halfwit with a stupid name who had the misfortune to be born five generations too late to be part of any viable heritage either im in or i start figuring a few things out for myself and maybe ill kick the wrong asses and maybe i wont but thats your problem not mine it all went quiet shit macbeth thought which reject script did that come out of he picked up his slicker and put it on ok said moira carelessly you drive mungo cathy i dont know what to say except please keep that cop off our backs for as long as you can and maybe if you can get the mothers together in one place that might be best would everybody fit into ma wagstaffs parlour some of what happened next macbeth did not follow several times he wished hed never left glasgow once he wished hed never seen moira cairns twice ernie dawber had said his throat was very dry and would it be possible to get a drink of water he was sprawled in a corner between the hallstand and the front door there was broken glass all around him he thought hed sprained his ankle when he fell when you tertell me shaw horridge was still standing feet apart amidst the wreckage of the mirrors his mouth looked permanently twisted because of a cut which extended his lower lip there were stripes of blood down both cheeks freckles of glass still glittered either side of his thin nose what can i tell you ernie croaked he planted his seed in bridelow and that seed turned out to be you was ma going to have your mother turned away same as they did with your father and leave arthur horridge humiliated three days from the altar course she wasnt shed been in the same situation i cercer i cercercant accept it mr derder aaargh with both fists shaw began to beat his own head ernie felt his agony the way he used to experience the lads frustration all those years ago when shaw was the best reader in the class and couldnt prove it they never told you because not many outside the mothers union knew about it me i put two and two together after a bit but i said nowt it was none of my business ma kept an eye on you but shed never go too close she never wanted you to be tempted or to get too close to the shadow side for your own good please lad a cup of water if i terturn my berback on you youll be out i dont think i can even walk lad how derderdo i know that kerkerkeep talking ernie swallowed i remember once arthur came to see me arthur knew of course arthur was inclined to link your stammer directly to the circumstances of your conception and he said ernie he said why doesnt she do something ha why doesnt she cure the poor lads stutter arthur i said if you knew how much pain that causes ma her own grandson gergrandson angry tears joined the blood on shaws cheeks i used to stand outside werwith the other kerkerkids derdaring each other to look into the werwindows shed cherchase us all off werwerwitch owd witch she was frightened shaw frightened for you scared that one day she might have to banish you as well because of what might be in your blood didnt want you exposed to the shadow side thats why after your after arthur died shed never come up to see your mother even when liz became agoraphobic and wouldnt come down to the village she didnt want to go near you she didnt want you ever to know who you were or to become drawn to the shadow side which in the end he thought you were you were a sitting duck wanted to ask what happened to your mother what happened after she forced herself to come down to the village and scream tor sanctuary outside mas door while you were inside presumably for who else would it be who else could destroy mas defences so surely who else would ma allow to push her downstairs i didnt kerkill her you know shaw said suddenly she said she was derderdead already dead already and at that moment directly above ernies head the door chimes played their daft little tune and there was a banging on the glass panels and mr dawber ernie shaw jerked from the waist as if the electric doorbell had been connected to his testicles gergo away ernie grabbed a breath and raised his voice its willie wagstaff shaw let him in eh mr dawber come on shaw ernie shouted you know willie across the hall the front door shuddered as a boot went into it flat under the lock shaw leapt across the hall and threw himself against the back of the door as the foot went in again and then he sprang back lurched towards ernie face full of blood and glass terror confusion and fury he turned tore open a whitepanelled door on the other side of the room and flung himself into the passage beyond as the front door heaved and splintered open willie was alone his eyes flickered under his mousy fringe in the bright lights ernie give us a hand willie done me ankle i think wheres the lad let him go eh hes got a lot to think about we need to get to the brewery if its not too late never mind that willie got a hand under ernies arm can you thats fine thats excellent mr dawber hang on to me the brewery moiras seeing to that that lass by eck willie youre shes not just that lass mr dawber take my word anyroad mungos with her the yank he give me his car keys we need to get you back youre our last hope mr dawber come on ill tell you the body was up against a huge metal tub there was the smell of beer the smell of vomit and a smell macbeth would soon recognise again as the smell of blood i dont know him moira said ive never seen him before macbeth covered his mouth with his hand this was it the final proof hed halfimagined he was never going to get that this affair was real life and death bad death this is crazy moira he grabbed hold of the iron railing for the coldness of it only it was slick with something and he jerked his hand away i never saw a stiff before never saw a dead relative never went to a funeral with an open coffin moira had nothing to say to this she turned her lamp on mans face his whole head was a weird shape like it had been remoulded violently there was blood over the face and down from the rim of the big tank macbeth felt his gut lurch he leaned over the side of the huge beer vat and he threw up shamed by the way it echoed around the scrubbed metal he turned back to moira wiped his mouth she was kind enough to direct the beam of her lamp away from him real macho stuff huh either im in this with the rest of you or ill go solo start kicking asses or maybe ill just throw up the shitburger i had near carlisle im sorry he said that was unavoidable thing is i do recognise him his name is frank he was in the pub earlier was pretty smashed he certainly looks pretty smashed now moira said sounding harder than he liked to hear he was shocked he fell looking up the steps all slimy with something that stank you could convince yourself of anything macbeth ok after you up there well were no going back now oh shit please get me outa here ok you stay down here then wait for me no jesus but like i mean what if theyre waiting for us theres nobody here macbeth howd you know that i was listening and watching and you know no he didnt fucking know but he wasnt going to make an issue of it he went slowly up the metal steps she stayed at the bottom lighting his way until he reached a blank wooden door he hesitated looked back down the stairs at where the beam bounced off the white walls and cast a soft light on her she looked smaller than he remembered inside this bulky duffel coat too big for her by a couple of sizes and yet she seemed strangely younger without most of her hair well shit of course hed seen that soon as hed walked in out of the rain it was the most awful mutilation like slashing the mona lisa taking the legs off of the venus de milo it was a goddamn offence against civilization but was it selfmutilation was it like a novice nun cuts off all her hair to give herself to christ and this was why hed never even mentioned it this was why willie being in the car too all hed said to her by way of explanation for him being here was the duchess asked me to lookout for you to which shed made no reply moiras face creased sympathetically now in the white light look mungo fact is if the sight of this poor guy made you chuck your lunch youre not gonny find it too pleasant in there theres no shame in that willies pretty squeamish too which is why he was glad to go off in search the old schoolmaster guy so if you what im saying is this isnt your problem you really dont have to put yourself through this and you do yeah she said im afraid i do me more than anybody he just stared down at her goes back nearly twenty years this is the consequences of getting involved with matt castle hes dead yeah moira said macbeth said people here keep seeing his ghost thats what they say you believe that yeah moira said what am i gonna find behind that door you dont ever have to know mungo thats what im trying to tell you aw shit macbeth said the hell with this he scraped the hair out of his eyes opened them wide and pushed open the door with his right foot chapter iv willies youngest sister was in her dressing gown

assembled mothers they exchanged a look which said this is hopeless altogether there were seven of them squeezed into mas parlour standing room only although at least a couple were not too good on their pins and needed chairs susan milly cried wheres susan staying in with the little lad ethel susans mum told her franks not back likely on a bender she wont leave the little lad on his own on a

bit of space on ttable how is he hes resting had a bit of a do wi shaw horridge willie was spreading out sheets of foolscap paper thank god for mr dawber i say anything to do with bridelow he collects whipped it off ma fore she could put it back of tfire looks complicated its not as bad as it looks theyre all numbered see and they join up so weve got a complete map of tvillage wi all the key

the top of church field with half a brick she could do one of the closer ones said cathy if you or i take the holy well we still havent got enough milly lowered her voice and what kind of commitment well get out of half this lot i dont know ma was right weve been hopelessly complacent we let things slide we havent got a chance theres always a chance cathy said and even willie thought her voice was starting to sound a bit frail she was overtired lumpy bags under her eyes thin hair in rats tails what said milly approaching hysteria and willie had never seen that before against a feller whos spent half a lifetime stoking up his evil against that hideous girl against all them practising satanists theyre idiots cathy said any idiot can be a satanist aye said milly and any idiot can make it work if theyve got nowt to lose all right cathy turned to willie hows alf getting on moaning willie said reckons cement wont hang together wi all the rain stan burrows and themve fixed up a sort of a shelter for him i told him i says you can do it again proper sometime alf just make sure it sticks up tonight i called in at sals too and young benjiell be along wi a pile of stuff for a new cross

when i put me mind to it thatll make it ten then cathy said still not enough but were getting there please milly please dont go negative on me now macbeth closed the door behind him as if to prove he wasnt really a wimp and could handle this alone and he didnt come out for a long time maybe half a minute and there was no sound from him either and moira panicked i was wrong theyre all there theyre waiting for us moira he called out more than a wee bit hoarse just at the point when she was about to start screaming i think i need some help at the foot of the final stairway the air was really sour full of beer and vomit blood and death she took a breath of it anyway she was face it more scared than he was and whenever she was really scared she went brittle and hard surfacecynical a shell no thicker than a ladybirds she wanted a cigarette she wanted a drink she wanted out of here hold your nose macbeth advised opening the door he sounded calm too calm he was going to pass out on her any second and of course she didnt hold her damn nose did she and the stench of corrupted flesh nearly drove her back down the steps i covered that one over macbeth said couldnt face it a circle within a circle candles burned down to stubs not much more than the flames left and all the rearing shadows they were throwing watch where youre walking macbeth said the attic light was brown and bleary with sweat grease blood several chairs inside the circle two of them occupied one was a muffled hump beneath old sacking all i could find macbeth said i dont think you should uncover it i dont think anybody should not ever a yellow hand poked out of the sacking she stared at it trying to imagine the yellow fingers stopping up the airholes on the pennine pipes its this one macbeth said behind her moira please moira turned and took a step forward and her foot squelched in it congealing blood bucketsful you dont have to do anything like that cathy said its not as if im asking you to bare your breasts or have sex with anyone under a full moon or swear eternal allegiance to the goddess pity said the blonde one trying and failing to hold her cigarette steady all you have to do cathy said is believe in it just for as long as youre taking part i dont though luv lottie castle said and i cant start now however cathy noticed she couldnt stop herself looking over their shoulders towards what was probably the gasmantle protruding from the side of the bar cathy had heard all about the gasmantle from the policeman ashton who was standing by the door at this moment observing but keeping out of it because as hed pointed out there was no evidence of the breaking of laws except for natural ones yes you do chrissie said youve always believed in it thats been half the problem and how the hell would you know that oh come on the last couple of hours ive probably learned more about you than anybody in this village and you know more about me than id like to have spread around yes said lottie i suppose so and how do you come into this luv always struck me as an intelligent sort of girl university education oxford isnt it thats right mrs castle oxford no polite names tonight its lottie and im chrissie said the blonde you know about your husband cathy said you know what theyve done cathy luv he ceased to be my husband the night he needed somebody else to close his eyes for him well a fair time before that if truth were known ive had half a lifetime of matt castle and thats more than anybody should have to put up with and i can say that now because i can say anything tonight believe me as soon as cathy had walked in shed spotted the two glasses smelt the booze all right she said forget your husband lets talk about your son lotties face hardened immediately into something like a clay mask dic what about dic just i dont think hes dead macbeth said oh jesus jesus moira put down her lamp in the blood the light tilted up at dics face but they couldnt kill him could they for the same reason they couldnt kill you surely willie was right mungo we shouldve been up here mobhanded thought i was being clever being stupid stupid but sometimes you can do more harm to someone than killing themd be you know tights macbeth snapped you wearing tights under there huh no whats oh jesus dic please dont be dead shit said macbeth handkerchief i dunno whats in these pockets its no my coat yeah is this a handkerchief how big is it ok tear it in half fold em up make two tight wads macbeth was peeling off the thick adhesive tape binding dics arms to the chairarms both arms were upturned palms of the hands exposed veins exposed there was a welling pool of rich dark blood at each wrist and it was dripping to the floor each side of the chair there was a widening pond of blood congealed around its blackened banks lateautumnal flies from the roofspace crawled around drunk on blood ok now you hold his arm above his head youre gonna get a lot of blood on you i got more blood on me than i can handle moira muttered you sure you know what youre doing mungo i never did it for real before but ah you dont need to hear this shit just hold his arms right gimme one of the pads see we got to hold the this is a pressure pad right so you push it up against the wound with both thumbs like hard idea is we stop the blood with the pad then i wind this goddamn tape round just about as tight as i can make it is he breathing how the fuck should i know now the other arm hold it up over his head and shit get the tape off his mouth chrissakes moira didnt we do that the tape across dics mouth stretched from ear to ear moira tore it away and dic mumbled do you have to be so rough moira jumped away in shock macbeth yelled keep hold of that fucking arm willya aw christ youre no dead im no dead said dic feebly and be giggled dont talk said moira youre gonny be ok mungo hes lost a lot of blood dont i know it im paddling in it he needs to go to a hospital this is strictly amateur hour cant say how long its gonna hold fars i can see they cut the vein if theyd cut the artery this guyd be long gone they cut the vein each wrist taped his arms down the blood goes on dripping takes maybe a couple hours to drain the body how long they had you like this pal not the faintest dic said i was on valium i think intravenous so id know what was happening but wouldnt care thats good see the dope slows down the metabolism and that goes for the blood flow too this is weird stuff moira this left me way behind a long time back moira said do you know why dic dic nodded at the hump under the sacks do me one favour macbeth said i saved your life least you can do is let me keep that fucking thing under wraps thats matt isnt it dic dic nodded he was lying back in his chair both arms still flung over his head and black with dried and drying blood moira didnt recall ever seeing courage on this scale maybe the valium had helped but it was more than that suppose you know dic said where theyve gone we have to get you to a hospital when youre on valium and youre still terrified you know it must be pretty awesome looks pretty cruddy to me macbeth said well get you down the steps ok well get you out of here hes not sane you know i dont reckon he was all there to begin with lived in his own fantasy world like dad and that guy hall he closed his eyes bloody cathy the things you do for love eh mungo moira said how about you go downstairs to one of the offices find a phone get us some transport for dic youll be ok macbeth looked like he couldnt get out fast enough sure get hold of cathy you got the number called it enough times from the phonebooth he hesitated in the doorway dics blood on one cheek go moira said when they were alone she said dic i need to ask you matt i gave him blood dic said and you he nodded at the thing in the other chair moira sighed sooner or later she had to face this she hooked a finger under a corner of the sacking the dead couldnt harm you you get used to him dic said with a driedup bitterness you start to forget he ever looked any different she pulled away the sacking the smell was putrid it was the kind of smell that would never entirely leave you and some nights would come back and hover over you like the flies that were clustering around matts withered mouth the lips already falling from the teeth i was afraid to look at him in his coffin dic said mum said there was no shame no shame in that dic moira said whats that in his lap the pipes that stuff wrapped around the pipes you know what it is moira reached out with distaste and snatched the bundle from the lap of the corpse air erupted from the bag and the pipes groaned like a living thing or a dying thing she cried out and dropped the pipes but held on to what had been around the pipes black hair drifting through her fingers in the flickering candlelight a glimmer of white which of them did it her voice so calm she scared herself which of them actually cut it off dic said the woman id guess therese they wanted him strong and driven you know his eyes kept closing maybe he was about to pass out from loss of blood she didnt know what you did in these circumstances did you let him rest or did you try to keep him conscious keep him talking he seemed to need to talk i gave him blood he said blood feeds the spirit or something like that bloods very powerful in magic and he winced coughed nodded at the hair sos desire and what moira said staring into matt castles impenetrable sightless eyes stuffing the hair into a pocket of the duffel coat did he get from the bog body wrong question dics eyes closed and didnt open for several seconds moira was worried dic said i think you should be asking what it got from him his eyes werent focusing listen i dont know whether they got what they were after all kinds of noises were coming out of that moira picked up the sacking tossed it over matt with a shudder hall was trying to talk to it had a few phrases in medieval welsh i dont think it made any sense in the end he was screaming at it stanage was screaming at therese it didnt go how they hoped does it ever i cant believe these people i can moira said what went wrong couldnt find the comb was one thing stanage was furious moira bent over him his eyes were slits dic why couldnt they find the comb because id taken it i think earlier on i took it out of the bag knew they were saving it for the climax where is it now he tried to shake his head im sorry moira said well get you out of here listen if i leave you now can you bear it mungoll be back in a minute only i want to get away on my own dic can you hear me dics eyes were closed he was halflying in his chair hands still thrown back behind his head there seemed to be no more blood seeping under the tape didnt they say that your blood stopped flowing when you died dics canvasseated wooden armchair still stood in the pond of his blood mostly congealed like mud like the surface of a peatbog dic no reply but he was still breathing wasnt he she touched his fingers they felt cold like marble dic tell mungo tell him not to worry tell him just tell him ive gone to meet the man chapter v there was a strange luminescence over the moss as though the rain itself was bringing down particles of light she could see its humps and pools and she knew there were people out there could hear their voices scattered by the rain the moss was swollen up like a massive pincushion and every heavy raindrop seemed to make a new dent she walked openly to the door of the man ith moss and hammered on it shouted lottie a few times all the lights were on lights everywhere in the bar in all the rooms upstairs but nobody here ok she switched on her lamp and walked around the back to the yard where the stable block or barn place was matts music room its door hung open the hasp forced they hadnt even bothered to disguise their visit when they came to borrow the pennine pipes switching off her lamp moira went quietly in she put on no lights the air inside seemed to ripple with greens and browns like sea light mosslight the carpets on the wall tautened the air dead sound no echoes she took off her coat found the old settee the one with its insides spraying out sat down with the lamp at her feet and thought peacefully of matt and felt no hatred all gone released it had taken her nearly ten minutes to get here ten minutes in which the rain had crashed down on her sparsely matted skull and shed yielded up her anger with a savagery even the night couldnt match screamed a lot cursed him for what hed done all those years of lies and craving abuse of lottie abuse of dic abuse of her from afar divulging to the crazy stanage the secret of the comb letting stanage set him up set her up in scotland letting stanage into his weaknesses so that the longhaired girls appeared on cue this therese playing the part with an icy precision drawing out of man the thin wire of desire by which they could anchor him i used to think she was a substitute me own creation like creating you out of her while he was no longer sure that this was not in essence moira i shouldve known shouldve known you wouldnt leave me to die alone im drawing strength from the both of you the bogman and you had stanage known that matt was dying was man chosen because he was dying so that his spirit chained to stanage and therese chained willingly to bridelow by the old celtic magic could be controlled after his death so it could be used as a conduit to reach the man the spirit of the moss the guardian of the ancient celtic community at the end of the causeway moira walking quickly down from the brewery finding her way quite easily this time back into the village avoiding the car racing with full headlights up the brewery road probably in answer to macbeths summons avoiding any people she happened to see on the street especially women this god help me is my task go over it again get it right heres what happened the villagers steal the man to do with him whats been done so many times with bits of bodies found in the moss give him a good christopagan burial at the next public funeral but this isnt just another bit of body this is the complete perfectly preserved remains of the original sacrifice laid down with due ceremony after undergoing the triple death this is powerful this will reverberate and wise old ma wagstaff realizing presumably just how powerful mixes up her witch bottle with a view to protecting matts soul from any dark peaty emanations not realizing that its the man in the moss who needs protection against the tortured corrupted manipulated spirit of matt castle got to get him back got to get him out of their control got to lose all the hatred because thats their medium hatred and lust and obsession when stan the bartender and gary the cop came for dic macbeth was pacing the room trampling in the blood where is she where the fuck is she almost ready to shake the poor guy get some sense out of him god almighty he heard from the bottom of the steps its young frank dont touch him you cant help him now he were threeparts drunk fighting drunk drunk most nights since he lost

to me i saved your goddamn life said to tell you dic mumbled that shed gone to meet the man holy shit macbeth slammed his fist into the back of the seat yeah dic said i didnt like the sound of it either but there wasnt much i could do drifting on an airbed of memories hey matt you remember the night the van broke down on the m and we put on a thankyou gig for the aa guys at three in the morning at the newport pagnell services blurry light coming off the moss through the rain theyre out there ok and its cold and its wet and the moss is filthy and swollen no place to be matt no place to commit yourself for all eternity or until you might be summoned by those to whom you mortgaged your soul hey remember when you left the pipes in the hotel room in penzance and willie ran all the way back from the hall and i went on stage alone and i only knew four solo numbers and im into an encore of the first one before willie dashes in with the pipes the slimy mosslight from the high windows awakening the barn finding the womanly curves of the old martin guitar this was your place matt this was where you put it all together this was your refuge so i wantedi wanted in to be part of that to go in the moss too but you dont now do you its warm in here aw hell its freezing you just better wish it warm hen wish it warm until you can feel it she picked up the lamp from the floor at her feet and took it across to a wooden table she switched it on directing its beam to the centre of the settee picked up matts martin guitar went back and sat in the spot with the light on her face she strummed the guitar the strings were old and dull and it was long out of tune one of the machineheads had lost its knob so she just tuned the other strings to that one it would do she sat back closed her eyes against the lamps beam although the battery was running out and the light was yellowing she imagined the moss black and cold and stagnant now youre out there you know the terrors the moss holds the deep deep ageold fear death doesnt have to be like that matt come on come on back come to the warm she pictured matt as hed been once stocky muscular vibrant with enthusiasm come come to to me and in a low and smoky voice she began to sing to him the mothers union was congregated in the high norman nave of st brides church above the mothers hung a ragged cross made of branches cut by benjie from a rampant sycamore hedge at the bottom of the rectory garden the branches still dripping were bound with chicken wire and tangled up with hawthorn cathy walked in out of the rain under the reassuringly gross widened flange of the sheelagh na gig cement particles among the coils of her hair alf beckett had also brought the statues out of the shed and several long coloured candles were now lit he was up in the lamp room now fixing up a highpowered floodlight supplied by stan burrows whod been in charge of the electrics for the bridelow wakes party which was usually held on the church field on may day eve except for this year when there was still too much media attention due to the bogman twelve cathy said after a quick headcount were waiting for moira she doesnt have to be here milly said if shes with us shes with us cathy was glad to see milly had at last taken charge the assembly was not inspiring including as it did women like dee winstanley whod declined to follow her mother into the union on the grounds that they didnt get on and two lesbians who ran a smallholding up by the moor and had never been allowed to become active members because their motives were suspect a pile of wet stones glistened on an old wooden funeral bier under the pulpit all right milly clapped her hands lets make a start shall we i want to begin by calling down a blessing on this church if youd all form a rough circle from where weve pushed the pews back milly wore a long dark blue dress decorated by a single brooch in the shape of two intercurled holly leaves she closed her eyes our father she began and our mother sees herself in colours and she weighs her powers in her hand the comb song the song of night and invocation in the singing of it things happen and the comb safe in its pocket in the guitar case protects you from evil but this is not your guitar this is matts guitar singing the song of invocation to the dead strings of matts guitar in matts music room and no protection it was in the morning the women filed silently out of the church most of them muffled in dark coats under scarves and hoods so macbeth couldnt tell who was who there was a bulky one he figured was milly two who were slightly built were walking together cathy he whispered cathy neither of the women replied each clutched a stone they walked out of the church porch under a weird carving of a grotesque deformed creature all mouth and pussy at this point they divided some proceeding down the path toward the main gate two moving up toward the graves the others following a narrow path down into a field which disappeared into the peatbog moira moira no answer the rain continued the fuck am i gonna do nowt said willie wagstaff nowt we can do its in the lap of the gods ernie dawber was with him leaning on a walking stick they moved under the porch with macbeth gazing out toward the moss nobody spoke for a while then he said halloweens over now right samhain lad said ernie lets not cheapen it in bridelow we used to celebrate samhain on november first so you could say our day is just beginning or not said willie as the case may be or not ernie agreed macbeth said how deep is the uh moss normally ernie said no more than a few feet in most places tonight i wouldnt like to guess i dont think weve ever had rain this hard so consistently for so long have we willie could it flood soaks it up said ernie like a sponge its rivers that flood not bogs theres a river running through it isnt there not much of one what are those women doing we never ask lad said ernie ever thought of becoming a local tour guide ernie shrugged macbeth said what are those lights i cant see any lights lad its gone it lasted no time at all it was like a white ball of light it seemed to come out the bog then it vanished didnt see it did you willie ok macbeth said he was getting a little pissed with this old man tonight mr dawber its my belief you seriously offered your life for this place im not gonna say thats extreme i dont have enough of a picture to make judgements what i would like to know is that uh compulsion you had has that passed seemed at first like ernie dawber was going to ignore the question and macbeth could hardly have blamed him for that willie wagstaff didnt look at the old man rain apart there was no sound willie was not performing his customary drum solo then ernie dawber took off his hat it seems silly to me now he said in his slow precise way worse it seems cowardly i went to see the doctor tother night been feeling a bit unsteady for some weeks theyd done a bit of a scan found what was described as an inoperable cyst ernie tapped his forehead in here willies chin jerked up eh could pop off anytime apparently aw hell macbeth said forget i spoke no no lad it was a valid question ive been writing a new history of bridelow one thatll never be published chances are ill not even finish the bugger anyroad but its about all those things i didnt dare put into the proper book maybe its the first proper book who can say id like to read that macbeth said one day dont count on it lad anyroad i thought well its given you a good life this little place you and a lot of other folk and now its in trouble is there nowt you can do and when youre on borrowed time lads its surprising how you focus in directions nobody in their right mindsd ever contemplate he chuckled or maybe its not our right minds that were in most of the time maybe just for a short space of time i entered my right mind now theres a cosmic sort of conundrum for you mungo thanks macbeth said he put out his hand ernie took it they shook now about those lights aye lad i saw the lights and thats another conundrum the moss is no mans land no man has cultivated it no man has walked across it in true safety what we see in and on and around the moss doesnt answer to our rules ive not answered your other question yet though have i macbeth kept quiet there was another ball of white light it came and it went in the semisecond it was there macbeth saw a huge awesome tree shape with branches that seemed to be reaching out for him involuntarily he shrank back into the porch is it past ernie considered the question no if i thought itd do any good id be out there now offering my throat to the knife he turned back toward the moss there was another light ball coming faster now quite frankly lad said ernie conversationally i think its too late and in the chamber of the dead forgotten voices fill your head it said hoarsely going to show me moira tried to stay calm but couldnt sing any more she was desperately cold this famous comb this time she had no comb to show him but you never leave yourself open like that you never confess weakness to them what will you give me if i show you the comb six pennorth o chips laughter rippling from the corners of the room the lamplight was very weak now in her face behind the light a shadow chapter vi they had told chrissie to look out for a seat at the top of the church field it wasnt hard the church field was the piece of uncultivated spare land continuing down from the last of the graves to a kind of plateau above the moss chrissies torch found the seat on the very edge of the plateau what she hadnt expected was to find someone sitting on it normally this time of night shed have been scared to death of getting mugged somehow holding this daft stone that didnt seem a possibility she found herself sitting next to him on the wooden bench in the pouring rain someone had lent her a long dark blue cagoule and she knew very little of her face would be visible it was like a dream hello roger she said he turned his head his hair was flat and shiny like tin his beard dripped into the neck of his blackened barbour he peered at her he didnt seem to recognise her nose is it chrissie it is indeed not a very nice night roger one way and another he was silent a long time then he said i spoke to him him him that must have been nice for you both so it was worth it roger said in the end was it was it really oh yes i mean its knowledge isnt it nothing is more valuable than knowledge what about love said chrissie i dont understand roger said no i dont suppose you do so what did he have to say to you who him oh roger stood up drenched and shiny and rubbed his knees as if they were stiff do you know i cant really remember i expect itll come back to me he didnt look at her and began seeming oblivious to the rain to stroll away along the path which led back from the plateaus edge and wound down towards the moss chrissie waited until hed gone from sight and then gently placed her stone beneath the seat and stood very quietly and said the words theyd told her to say a curious thing soon as ernie dawber admitted he too could see the balls of light then they became clearer its a bit like balllightning ernie said theres been quite a lot of research although the scientific establishment hasnt formally acknowledged it talking in his schoolmasters voice macbeth thought because it puts him on top of a situation he doesnt understand any more than the rest of us they do seem to be a manifestation of energy anomalies within the earths magnetic field often occur im told on faultlines whats that mean and theres also a theory that they can interact with human consciousness so that when we perceive them we actually bring them into existence if that isnt backtofront logic what do you say willie im more worried about that treething mr dawber young benjie calls it a dragon bog oak i thought it were come up out of tmoss all of a sudden like got a wicked kind of macbeth said there are people out there around the tree daft buggers ernie squinted through the rain macbeth was watching a haze of light rising from the tree as if someone had set fire to it but the flames instead of eating the wood had risen through it like one of those phoney log effect gasfires the light had risen above the tree and its boughs looked to be clawing at it as though to prevent it escaping and the moss itself seemed to rise in protest macbeth felt a thickening tension in his gut mouth dry he watched the haze of light spread out like a curtain and then hover over the moss maybe six or ten feet from its surface this is unearthly the light was drifting towards the edge of the moss towards the hulk of a building near the peats edge all things are natural ernie dawber said with a tightjawed determination if some are beyond our understanding whats that place thought he was hearing distant screams back of the pub willie said thats thowd barn back of the pub where we used to rehearse wi matt the lights over it the lights hanging over the roof ernie dawber said i dont think i can see it any more moira cairns put down the guitar and turned towards the door two of them the mosslight on the two tombstone speaker cabinets either side of the door both of them standing in the entrance with the cabinets either side of them john peveril stanage and the girl therese so kill me moira said simply you know we cant therese said not until you give him back moira reached to the table and turned the lamp on to them not much energy left in it now but enough to show her neither of these people was wet had they been inside the inn all the time had they been expecting her or was this merely the nearest vantage point for the moss who are those people out on the moss then moira asked with the devil tree do you know mdear he said i cant actually recall any of their names she remembered him so well now the dapper figure the white hair rushing back from his greyfreckled forehead like breakers on an outgoing tide the cherubs lips a man as white as the bones tumbling from the walls i cant believe she said all the trouble youve gone to getting to know matt inside out all his little compulsions what are we looking at here years we dont have time for a discussion stanage said we want you to release him you cant hold him for much longer you simply dont have the energy moira said wheres the man made a big mistake there you know john you stole him away you took responsibility for him you took responsibility for the vacuum the mossll no wear that was an old guy in the village tonight hed figured out the way to square things with the moss was another sacrifice maybe that was right it was absolutely right mdear stanage said with a sudden smile saw to that on the very stroke i believe of midnight when the beacon of the moss was extinguished so was someones life a young fit active life a jolly good replacement for the man if i say so myself who moira felt her facemuscles tightening also her stomach why just like the original sacrifice a priest the triple death a blow a slash and a fall and then gathered up and offered to the spirit of the moss our spirit all square mdear all square the reverend joel beard you killed the reverend joel beard and consigned him to the moss well hell sweetheart dont sound so appalled no friend of yours was he he struck you word has it i suspect he mistook me for your friend moira said she let her gaze settle on therese worryingly young black hair perhaps dyed sullen mouth and the cloak her cloak this is the wee slag then is it john doesny look a lot like me did she wear a wig before she got hold of the real thing shes angry enough moira stanage said less cordially dont make it worse shes angry with me aw jesus the poor wee thing ma heart goes out shes no satisfied with ma hair now would she like to cut off ma leg would that make her happy you think john therese hissed and uncoiled like a snake and took a step towards moira stanage laid a cautionary hand on her arm emerging from his dark sleeve the hand looked as white as an evening glove this is futile stanage said abruptly leave us tess would you mind awfully i can take her therese spat shes old her sexualitys waning she cant hold him i can take him from her watch me tess darling no one is questioning your lubricious charms but i suspect this is not about sex leave us steel thread in his voice please therese gathered up her cloak and left without another word stanage closed the door and barred it moira instinctively moved into a corner of the ruptured settee clutching the electric lamp to her breast right bitch obviously a man who could shed his charm like an overcoat thatd become too heavy she became aware of a scar about an inch long under his right eye a souvenir from scotland and he was aware she was looking at it the barn seemed to shift on its foundations and there was a crunch and a series of flat bangs she didnt let her eyes leave him she knew what it was books falling over as a shelf collapsed the shelves were all makeshift held up by bricks neither of them had moved dont make me angry stanage said we seem to be a little short of bones in here moira said that affect your performance does it books just dont respond so effectively maybe you just dont have that same affinity i borrowed one of yours from ma wee nephew one time thought it was really crap john lacked authenticity you know john peveril stanage was tightening up inside she could tell that could feel the contractions in the air mammy help me mammy wherever you are im in really heavy shit here you know you want me to sing to you john would that help your concentration she began to sing very softly for the night is growing older and you feel it at your shoulder she could feel matt castle at her shoulder a wedge of cold energy and more shut up stanage said could smell the peat in him now pulling the blue plastic lamp between her breasts until it hurt feeling the shadow behind her huge and dense and pungent with black peat dont turn around dont look at him but john peveril stanage was looking stanage was transfixed all at once there was complete quiet the rain macbeth said the rain stopped damn futile observation everybody here could tell the rain had stopped he found he was in the middle of a crowd under the smiling snatch people called our sheila been so busy watching the weird lights on the moss he hadnt noticed the mothers returning without their stones one of them standing next to him shaking out her hair wheres moira it was milly shes not with you cold panic grabbed his gut youre telling me you havent seen her we couldnt wait for her we had thirteen stones to put down cathys had to take two milly glanced around cathy not back yet listen macbeth grabbed her shoulders moira told dic shed gone to meet the man i figured that meant she was part of your operation milly shook her head id be terrified to meet the man i dont know mungo i really dont know what she meant im sorry you all right willie demanded tired exhausted weve done all we can willie thats the most i can say i doubt itll be enough oh mr dawber looking out across the moss oh good god in the centre of rainless stillness there came a noise overhead like deep bass thunder like the exploding of the night like the splitting of the sky and they all saw it the reason they all saw it was that bridelow moss was suddenly lit up like a football ground the beacon of the moss was back not blue this time but icewhite and a thousand times more powerful its alf s arc light some woman explained knew hed have it fixed before long what was that b oh mother oh mother help us whats that at first macbeth was simply not able to believe it there was no precedent it was outside the sphere of his knowledge first thing he saw snagged in the floodlight was the malformed tree with branches like horns the horns of a stagbeetle he thought now because an insect was what the tree resembled or a bunch of brittle twigs insignificant compared with what was growing out of the moss beyond behind and far far above it it was happening on the edge of the light at what was surely the highest point of the moss macbeth thought of a mushroom cloud he thought of hiroshima he thought of nagasaki he thought in images on cracked film in black and white he heard shrill screams from the moss and he thought shit its the end of the goddamn world mushroom was wrong more like a dense bunch of flowers or a cauliflower a gigantic obscene black cauliflower burgeoning monstrously from the bog the silent air was dank with a smell like the grave and up close the sour smell of primitive bowelmelting fear what is it milly screeched what is it mr dawber it cant be what what people clutching at one another ernie dawber said hollowly its burst macbeth just stood there watching the liquid vegetable form in a kind of slow motion the bogs burst ernie dawber cried out aghast its bloody burst everybody into the church fast wheres cathy milly shrieked above the tumult of rising panic she went down to take the last stone where where to to the pub the back wall under the old foundation stone its the last one as the air suited to thicken macbeth began to run down through the graveyard towards the street and by the time his feet hit the cobbles a wall of cold black liquid peat was thundering into the village like volcanic lava what have you done i obviously have an affinity john peveril stanage grinned with the moss you are a fucking insane man what is sanity stanage said as the high windows blew out and the whole roof of the barn was smashed down by the blackest of nights from dawbers book of bridelow the bog burst the scale and severity of the bridelow bog burst has caused widespread shock and disbelief although it was not without precedent such phenomena have occurred infrequently within recorded history usually after a period of inordinately heavy rainfall when the surface layer of vegetation becomes too weak to retain the liquefied mass of peat beneath several minor bogslides have been reported in recent decades after a midsummer thunderstorm in a peat slide affected a large area of meldon hill bog in the northern pennines leaving two scars in the blanket peat about metres long and metres wide many centuries earlier but closer to the site of our own disaster was the eruption of chat moss near manchester which leland an historian in the reign of henry viii records as having brast up and destroied much grounds and much fresche water fische therabowt and so carried stinking water into the mersey and carried the roulling mosse to the shores of wales part to the isle of man and sum into ireland one cannot but suspect a certain exaggeration in this account but those of us who experienced the horror of that night those who lost friends or loved ones or only their homes will carry with them to their own graves the smell the texture and for some the very taste of the black and ancient vegetable matter we call peat from dawbers secret book of bridelow unpublished a tall order owd lad to try and unearth the truth from the black to make sense out of what happened to consider whether my beloved bridelow has a future and if so what kind i thought at first to put it off until after the official government inquiry from which therell obviously be a report for public scrutiny however thats not likely to emerge for months and when it does its bound to be a dry civil service document full of scientific guff and a list of safety recommendations for communities which happen to be situated on the edge of large unstable peatbogs ernie you said youre the only man who can put all this into any sort of human and historical perspective you must get it down while its fresh before it becomes part of bridelow mythology what you really meant was while youre still with us ernie and wholl read it owd lad lets hope you said sadly that nobody outside of bridelow will ever have to so im writing this in your study at the rectory while youre up at the church conducting your first evensong since the burst thanks to your charity ive been sleeping whenever the lord permits it in the little spare room it the top of the house emergency accommodation my own house exposed up by the school being one of the first destroyed seemed when it was happening like armageddon most of what we knew and loved engulfed by a dreadful destructive force perhaps the merciless anger of the lord which we had brought upon ourselves by clinging to our primitive christian paganism while all those around us them across the moss had long since been converted and embraced the light embraced the light dont make me laugh theres more black out there than youll find in bridelow even now under its dark blanket of peat peat preserves the moss preserved the ancient dead and two millennia of fear violence sickness and dread and other things of which we do not speak of which we cannot speak of which matt castle all those years ago could not speak only let it pour away out of the pipes as he wandered in his agony upon the moss it has absorbed all our overflowing emotions this moss like a gigantic psychic cesspit it has preserved and it has neutralized an archaic chemical cathartic ignore me hans im getting too deep or too whimsy as ma wagstaff would sometimes rebuke me poor owd lass avoiding getting to the simple physical horror of it thousands of tons of the filthy stuff liquefied peat stink i dont think ill ever get rid of it from the back of my throat and certainly not from the back of my thoughts not as long as i breathe cowering in the choir stalls we could hear it descending all around the church still hearing the echo of that cataclysmic thunderclap in aftershocks of rumbling and roaring and we thought the church would implode the walls collapse in upon us with a shattering shower of stained glass but the church held the makeshift autumn cross swayed and rustled the lights went out and came on again bar the one above the door but the church held more than my house did reason it went it was on the wrong side of the street the first explosion the actual burst sent the fountaining filth hundreds of feet into the air why bits of it were found on the moor five or six miles away but when it settled into a mere tidal wave a bit they say like the tip slide which killed all those poor kids in south wales it was the buildings on the west side of the street that took it the post office the chip shop bibbys general stores poor old gus bibby couldnt have known a thing his flat over the shop was filled up in seconds with liquid peat as dark and evillooking as the comfrey oil in one of ma wagstaffs jars naturally the man ith moss the most westerly building in the village on the very edge of the bog is now under a great morass of muck selling it wont be a problem for lottie castle now just a question of collecting the insurance more than enough for a semi in wilmslow at least thirty people died in the village that night how many were simply victims of the bog burst may never be established which is you will agree just as well quite a few are believed to have perished instantly out on the moss although again an exact number will probably never be known perhaps over hundreds of years the bodies will be disinterred perfectly preserved no doubt like our man museum pieces although perhaps not because the burst will be part of recorded history so people will understand or will they do any of us even now know precisely what happened or why except for dr roger hall who was seen by his assistant mrs white to be heading for the moss a short time before the burst most of those who died out there in conditions which recall what ive read of the black horrors of the somme will remain unidentified many were likely to have been men and women long estranged from their families or disowned by their relatives because of the unacceptable practices in which they indulged themselves i know very little about socalled satanism whether this is simply a convenient name we have given to those who seek personal power over others through supposedly supernatural means whether as some say they sacrificed newborn babies out on the moor in order to reconsecrate the stone circle i certainly dont know that i do not want to know all i do know is that extremism of any kind has never taken root in bridelow where a practical paganism and a humble christianity have comfortably linked hands for so long many of the dead sadly were members of the fundamentalist christian group called if i have this right the church of the angels of the new advent a large number of them including their leaders mr and mrs christopher montcrieff heard the mighty thunderroar and believing it to be the dawning of the day of judgment as forecast in the book of revelations rushed out of the rectory into the street with arms and i would like to think hearts upraised and in seconds were buried alive not that many would have remained alive for long under that glutinous mess most being crushed or drowned or suffocated very rapidly mouths and noses and lungs clogged for ever some of those who did survive had been trapped in pockets of air under beams or walls or other protective bullwarks although just as many were killed by masonry which was crumbling like crisp toast under the weight of hundreds of tons of peat the first death largely overshadowed by what was to come remains officially unexplained the body in the bmw motor car did indeed prove to be that of my old friend eliza horridge there will be an inquest and it will probably record an open verdict for liz appears to have died not of injuries sustained in a car accident and the subsequent fire but some hours earlier and of hypothermia due to exposure there is no question that liz was suffering from an agoraphobia exacerbated by the fear that her presence was no longer welcome in bridelow following the sale of the brewery to gannons i feel therefore that none of us who knew her is exempt from blame and that fearing the imminent reappearance of her old lover john lucas whom i shall henceforth to keep him at a distance refer to by his adopted nomdeplume of john peveril stanage courageously overcame her illness to seek the aid of her onetime protector iris wagstaff and when ma who then had herself but a short time left to live failed to answer her door liz feeling she dare not return home became confused and wandered out on to the moor i cannot bring myself to contemplate those cold wet hours of mental agony and desperation before she succumbed to fatigue and lay down to the sad sleep from which she would never awaken i can only assume that her body was discovered on the moor by the sick satanic brethren recruited by stanage and his temptress and conveniently employed most of them by gannons and then remember we are not dealing here with wholly rational people someone decided to put lizs body into the car from which they had removed miss moira cairns before destroying it as the police could establish no link whatsoever between liz and miss cairns it was assumed the car had been stolen but inquiries i am told are not yet complete as to the part played in this affair by the brewery well its the economic heart of the village it was obviously a target for someone with malice in mind i realise now that perhaps the very first death of what we might quite justifiably call bridelows war was that of andy hodgson the young worker who fell to the ground during the reassembly of the rusted pulleyandplatform mechanism used originally for winching sacks to the highest level of the brewery that old malt store which was to become the unholiest of temples it is my belief that andy hodgson was himself a foundationsacrifice to consecrate the malt store in one of several corruptions of celtic ritual performed in an effort to crumble the edifice of our tradition the platform was later used there can be no doubt to winch up the body of matt castle stolen from its grave for despicable necromantic purposes it was early days though and andys death was clearly less elaborate than that of poor joel beard for whom i shall always have a certain respect whose body remains buried somewhere out on the moss and perhaps far more deeply now than was ever intended the brewery in an eastern corner of the village much shielded by trees was unaffected by the burst when a certain police officer paid a discreet visit the following morning he did not find what he apparently had been expecting the remains of matt castle and young frank manifold had disappeared a mystery not i suspect much of one i think if i were to question a few former regulars of the man ith moss particularly the estimable mr stanley burrows i might discover that in the aftermath of the burst and all the panic and confusion the number of bodies in the bog had been surreptitiously supplemented the aforementioned policeman an untypically thoughtful and philosophical officer approaching retirement wishes it to be recorded that he was not in bridelow on the night of the disaster and is unlikely to return although i am informed this officer has been undertaking some private stresscounselling with a certain widow in his own time it was to be two days before the other bodies were discovered at the brewery i shall come to this those of us including benjies dog and mas cats who sought sanctuary in the church remained unharmed although it was terrifying to feel the building almost rocking around us surrounded by rescuesquads in the wan light of early dawn we could see peat four or five feet deep in parts of the churchyard like an obscene black parody of snowdrifts most of the graves had disappeared just the heads of crosses showing our sheila remained in position looking perhaps more disgruntled than usual with her most public parts gunged up with peat although their yards and gardens were submerged the houses on the right of the street had been spared the worst and these included ma wagstaffs cottage wherein we came upon something inexplicably strange dic castle was sitting in mas old rockingchair in an atmosphere of unexpected tranquility he had been brought to the house at his own request after stan burrows and a certain policeman had been unable to find cathy gruber curiously calm dic had insisted they leave him alone and with so many horrors competing for their attention they didnt argue for long and so the lad sat himself down in the rocking chair and slept through all the roaring and the screaming and he dreamed of an old lady rather irritably bandaging his wounds continually assuring him that she had better things to do i myself have seen those wrists now still within a week the scars are scarcely visible i am a schoolteacher and an historian a man of facts i make no comments upon this the american mr macbeth mungo why not could so easily have followed the rest of us into the church and saved himself but instead displayed exceptional and foolhardy courage i doubt if he himself knew whether it was cathy or miss moira cairns he thought he could save but in his desperate race down the village street he must have felt himself to be close to the epicentre of an earthquake drenched by the insidious black liquid with cobs of semisolid peat falling like bombs all around him and the crackling roar of collapsing buildings on the western side eventually the young man reached the man ith moss and must have been horrified by what he found for the pub began with the second storey its ground floor buried under a black avalanche the lantern over the front door half submerged but still eerily alight mungo knew the peat would be far too deep to enable him to reach the rear of the building in the normal way so he waded out to the boundary wall now no more than a foot above the surface clambered on to it and moved perilously like a tightrope walker around the forecourt until he reached the yard at the rear at the end of which was the remains of the barn which had been used by matt castle for his music an anteroom to hell oh jesus the fuck am i gonna do i cant handle this theres nobody alive here there is nobody alive clawing at his eyes filling up with the black shit and what if i find her body you expect me to deal with that duchess you sent me down to here to bring her body back that it well fuck you duchess f hold it voices close up maybe these were echoes of voices from before the deluge peat preserving the last blocked screams of the dying drop it darling simply drop it itll pull you down drop the stone listen to me now drop the stone and wade away because believe this another four or five paces and youll be in over your head and it wont matter drop the stone and back away now and save yourself all you can do mdear get stuffed cathy macbeth saw that after the rain after the blast there was a lightness in the sky still night but somehow drained of darkness a phoney dawn bringing things and people into visibility cathy was waistdeep in the peat her fine fair hair gummed to her skull she was looking up but not at the rainedout sky above her balanced upon a fallen roofspar an apparition glowing white or so it seemed undamaged by the night or the storm of peat was the writer john peveril stanage macbeth crouched on his wall it was clear that stanage knew exactly why cathy was holding above the level of the peat a single grey boulder the kind from which these tough drystone walls had been constructed and it was clear also that he believed part of the psychological mesh hed helped weave the mystical dynamic hed set in motion long ago that if this boulder should be put in place in some particular place hed be able to proceed no further in the direction of bridelow he believed this in the air a glimmering light on metal stanage had hold of a length five feet or so of copper pipe this was not mystical even as macbeth struggled to his feet the pipe began to swing no as he fell from the wall the pipe smashed into cathy macbeth rolled into three feet of liquid crud and came up like a sheep out of the dip found it hard to stand upright the stuff up around his waist and it was so goddamn heavy filling up the pockets of his slicker he shrugged out of the slicker stood there breathing like a steam engine black shit soaking into his fucking useless bloomingdale menswear department cashmere sweater cathy where the f who are you said stanage macbeth scraped peat out of his eyes it doesnt matter he said he heard cathy spluttering beside him glanced briefly at her something oozing out the side of her head something that wasnt peat he pushed himself in front of her slime slurping down the front of his pants cold as hell cathy just do as he says and get outa here willya cathys hands came out of the mire with a kind of sucking sound and they were still clutching the grey stone he saw her grinning small white teeth in a small blackened face go macbeth screamed get the fuck outa here he heard the wafting of the copper pipe through the moist air and he threw himself forward and met it with his body hard into the chest and his skin was so cold and numb that if it cracked a rib or maybe two he didnt even feel it he wrenched hard on the pipe and heard a grunt and then stanage was tumbling from the end of his roofspar and breaking the surface of the moss with a splat and macbeth went under and when he came up the peat felt a whole lot colder and he couldnt even cough it out of his lungs because of the long fingers like a wire garotte around his throat from dawbers secret book of bridelow unpublished mungo macbeth having instructed her in his distressingly restricted new york parlance to remove herself cathy realized she had little choice but to do as he said the girl cannot swim even if anyone could in liquid of this consistency and temperature and her only hope was to get help you must remember that cathy was in a state of some bewilderment she had not seen the bog burst only heard the thunder roar and like most of us could have had no concept of the scale of the devastation but the village must have looked very different shockingly so with the converted gaslamps on one side of the street protruding no more than a few feet from the murky surface of what had now become an extension of the moss and the poor girl must have been appalled by the sight of the collapsed cottages the telephone box protruding from the peat like a buoy and the post office in ruins behind it she waded frantically back to the wall placed the grey stone on top hauled herself up after it and sat there a while shattered by what she had seen and halfstunned by the blow from the pipe which had landed on her shoulder and rebounded on to the side of her head she knew there was blood there mingling with the rivulets of peatwater from her hair but she did not touch the wound preferring to remain ignorant of its extent and severity so long as she could function cathy tells me rather ashamed that her mind at this point had simply blanked out mungo macbeth and what might be happening to him at the cold hands of john peveril stanage she sat on the wall with the grey stone on her knees beyond pain beyond fear beyond fatigue beyond thought even beyond prayer and when all feeling had gone apart from a sense of failure and despair something came to her now problems it is not my place to be credulous and speak of vision nor would i wish to use the clinically dismissive term hallucination of course i have read the stories the eyewitness testimony from lourdes to fatima to knock and walsingham and occasionally i have been impressed and heartened but most times left cold and more than a little sceptical i have heard of similar eyewitness reports from the edge of bubbling streams in the peak district of derbyshire and yes from our own holy well above bridelow and these have not been chronicled at all for in the view of devout roman catholics our lady is hardly considered to be the same figure as their lady although both have been seen to shine with a silvery aureole as of the moon rather than the sun well cathys lady youll laugh or perhaps you wont wore a duffel coat she appeared to be sitting next to the lass on the wall she was not beautiful cathy says but her aura of feminine grace was so powerfully calming that the air became still and soft and moist and even the rugged stones beneath her felt like cushions she remembers hanging her head her chin upon her chest and the lady stroking her hair or at least it was stroked about the duffel coat my researches tell me that the priests and priestesses of ancient britain the shaman class if you will would usually be attired for ceremonial purposes in a loose hooded garment of blue wool quite when the duffel coat as we know it reappeared i dont know my knowledge of social history has never extended to fashion trends but it has always struck me as curiously meaningful that while most coats are fastened with plastic buttons or zips the duffel is secured by pegs of wood or even more interesting of horn but i digress the next thing cathy remembers is standing at a point halfway between the end of the pub forecourt and the first of the ruined cottages the peat was up to her knees our lady of the duffel coat was gone and so was the stone cathy says she felt nothing neither relief nor the old despair she was an empty vessel it was not until later that she would recall the lady in any supernatural sense she had been as real as the stone which cathy had no memory of depositing now there was only the practical problem of avoiding death on the drowning side of the village the beacon of the moss was alight again courtesy of alf beckett and his floodlight it threw a strange glimmer on the black surface of a new river flowing between great banks of peat down the middle of the street from out of a mound of peat a stiffened arm protruded the fingers curled and black from behind her cathy heard voices she turned her back on the street and waded towards the sound coming at last to the most southerly part of the village which ran down to the moss near the causeway and where she remembered lottie castle was to have placed her stone it was here that cathy became the last person to see shaw horridge and therese beaufort later formally identified as one tessa byford alive the effects of the burst at this southern point were somewhat less marked although the moss had overflowed the causeway in places which was to cause serious delays for the rescue service vehicles it had not reached a lifethreatening depth for an adult the man and woman were thighdeep at the edge of the causeway and cathy was about to call out to them when she realized who they were lady strychnine as shed referred to therese was hissing at shaw to get back and leave her and attempting to disengage his hand from around her wrist shaw it appeared was trying to drag her back towards the village and laughing in a voice which cathy has described to me as surprisingly coarse and cruel come on shaw was shouting almost gleefully come back you can do it youll feel so much better he kept repeating this phrase hitting her with it cathy says and pulling at her arm and therese was screaming shrilly and at one stage actually vomiting with fear lotties stone you see cathy is telling me therese couldnt go past the stone and it was then that i realized cathy shakes her head in incomprehension that it had worked that wed done it that the bridelow mothers union was able to function and knowing what she knew about the woman not half of what we now know cathy felt no great pity when shaw horridge quickly let go of thereses wrists and suddenly delivered an enormous blow to her face with his fist all this time cathy had been backing away up the street towards the village centre and she turned around just once to see shaw horridge walking very slowly and deliberately up the street with thereses slender body hanging limply from his arms as i recorded earlier it was two days before the corpses were found this happened when an executive of gannons accompanied the companys insurance assessor into the brewery to see what minor damage had occurred they would hardly have bothered to go into the malt loft even it had not been firmly locked and no keys apparent as it was they progressed no further than the second level where the coppers stand these are the huge tanks in which the wort as the initial preparation is known is mixed with the hops or bog myrtle in old bridelow brewery days which preserve the beer and give it that allimportant bitter quality it appeared that shaw quite methodically had lit the oil boiler and gone about the beermaking process on his own something which to my own knowledge he had been able to do since the age of twelve under the paternal eye of arthur horridge the operation must have taken shaw several hours by which time the village was teeming with urgent life fire and ambulance personnel moorland rescue teams television crews at least two helicopters overhead i wonder what state was therese in during this period was she conscious did she know what was to happen was she already forcibly conveyed beyond a boundary which she had been psychologically incapable of crossing unassisted in any state to object the copper by the way is also known as the brew kettle because in it the hops are boiled into the wort preparatory to the addition of yeast they say the insurance assessor passed out after finding the bodies of shaw and therese which must have boiled for nearly two hours before the boiler reaching dangerlevel had automatically cut out was this i wonder another example drowning boiling and perhaps in thereses case simultaneous strangulation of that ancient mystery the celtic triple death what was shaws state of mind was he angry embittered remorseful or a dangerous brew of all three tell me i ask cathy when you heard them on the edge of the moss was shaw stuttering as he used to do you know youll ferferfeel berberbetter no she says im pretty sure he wasnt im glad i say poor mungo his larynx full of peat his eyes staring up in terminal terror into the eyes of the madman stanage his mouth no doubt full of flip new york obscenities which he now knew he would never utter poor lad the stranger in a strange land thrown upon the scottish shore with the instruction i am told to discover his roots by eck how gullible some of these americans are apt to be and the winds of fate nay the typhoons of fate can sometimes pick you up and put you down precisely where you wanted to be only when you look around do you realise its the very last place you wanted to be he found his celtic roots all right we might not wear kilts or speak a different language or owt like that but i reckon weve been closer in bridelow to the true celtic way shades of things ernest aye thank you ma than youll find in any lonely hamlet in sutherland or connemara and i think it will survive i think the mothers will watch over the rebuilding of a stronger bridelow i doubt theyll ever again let things slide cathy wont let them did you know hans by the way that your daughter was coming to the end of her second and final year at a very reputable theological college outside oxford i bet you didnt i bet she just kept telling you she was doing postgraduate research or something of that order but ma wagstaff knew ma wagstaff spoke more than once of the one wholl come after me and everybody laughed because it sounded so quaintly biblical they have a fund you know the mothers a bank account in glossop or macclesfield or somewhere to which unexpected windfalls and bequests are added from time to time and there was sufficient money in that to put cathy through theological college without anyone knowing if all goes well itll be the reverend cathy soon and in a few years all things being equal bridelow will have its first woman minister oh aye you can count on it you really think the archdeacon wont give us his full backing in ensuring that the lass is appointed by eck lad weve got enough dirt on that bugger to buy his soul off him and were not afraid to use it makes you think though doesnt it another giant step for mankind in little bridelow probably the first official anglican clergy person as well have to say equipped to serve both god and the goddess by eck couldve given macbeth twentyfive years at least this bastard his face white as a skull white as the skulls that tumbled from the walls in the earls castle so long ago in another time another life but so goddamn strong his hands so hard so tight around macbeths throat that macbeth figured one finger must have been driven nail first through the skin through the flesh and up his windpipe where it had lodged and swollen to the size of a clenched fist he fought to breathe but there was no air left not anywhere in the world stanages eyes had receded into his skull as he thrust macbeths head down under the water once twice second time he came up macbeths eyes were popping too far out probably for eyelids to cover and he was seeing nothing through the black water only his inner eyes saw everything with a helpless clarity this is how it happens this is how you drown his lungs hard as concrete his whole body filled up with peat gonna be preserved for all time for ever i remember you now he heard stanage saying scotland yes an american followed the cairns creature around like a bloody lamb stanage must have known the last question the one macbeth couldnt speak the one which even his blackedout eyes could no longer convey he said almost gently she died and macbeth stopped resisting surrendered to the limitless night bloody unfortunate really didnt want her dead at a crucial stage but itll be ok i suppose she wont be doing much yet theyre very bewildered you see mboy at first it can take about three days well weeks months years in some cases oh she was doubtless better prepared than most but however developed they are its three days minimum fore they can do damage stanage wore a black jacket over a white shirt the shirt was spotless suddenly this was the worst thing a spiritual travesty macbeth dying felt sick at the injustice of it caught her unawares i think when it came mboy even though she certainly did have a spirit damn well caught me unawares on one occasion as you saw bitch but the scottish business that was really forcing macbeth under the dark water again this time no struggle get it over but stanage brought him up again just a small clash of egos in comparison small clash of egos this though this is a splendid shakeup past and present worlds colliding macbeths eyes cleared a moment he saw a big yellow grin roof coming in i was expecting it threw myself under a table central beam oak beam came down on her if shed had all her hair ironic really i wouldnt have seen it happen not in quite such exquisite detail crrrrunch like an eggshell eased his grip a fraction so that a thin jet of air entered macbeths lungs he used it motherfucker stanage laughed what lord no you ever see my mother closed up macbeths throat fucked a sister or two that was fun for a while strengthens the old family ties goodnight mboy dont suppose your passing will cause much of a vibe on the ether last thing macbeth saw with gratitude was some dark shit on stanages shirt mustve sprayed it out with motherfucker from dawbers secret book of bridelow unpublished they havent found his body and happen they never will peat preserves oh aye it does that but how much of what peat preserves should be preserved its not natural thats the problem dust to dust all things must pass all things must rot for in rotting theres change thats the positive aspect of physical death all things must change nothing changes much in the peat so peat in my view works against natural laws living on the edge of it bridelow folk have always been aware of the borderline between what is natural and what isnt this is not whimsy but all the same ive had a bellyful so ive decided on balance that i wont die here happen my soulll find its way back who can say but the lord and willie wagstaff decided one rainy night that the peat was not for me so im taking the hint and ill pop me clogs somewhere else thank you very much also to be realistic i think i need what times left to me to do a bit of thinking and i reckon bridelow is too powerful a place right this minute to get things into any sort of perspective so im off to bournemouth owd lad dont you dare say owt and dont anybody panic either when i say bournemouth i mean bournemouth ive a cousin runs a little guest house up towards poole harbour your cathy says shell come and see me and bring milly and theyll try their hand at a spot of the old bridelow healing doctors cathy says what do they know aye what do the buggers know well see he could taste the peat on her face nothing ever tasted as good he wanted to believe it he didnt wherever she goes that young woman shes bound to be touched with madness he thought if were both dead maybe i got a chance this side i dont talk not if it hurts there was light in the sky this time maybe the real thing dawn all souls day his ass was wet everything was wet no the duchess said now who is the white man no macbeth screamed fuck you duchess she wont take too kindly to that no he said please no tricks no more tricks he opened his eyes shut them tight again stanage you motherf hes gone believe me hes the other side he cant get across whether hes alive or dead he cant get across macbeth opened his eyes kept them open kept staring and staring eggshell he said said her head was smashed like an eggshell whose head yours when the roof came in i hope not moira said putting a hand for the first time to the remains of her hair she wrinkled her nose but i sure as hell kept bloody still underneath that beam until hed gone can you walk i mean can you stand up macbeth leaned his back against the wall and did some coughing coughed his guts up felt better not a whole lot better and the way his goddamn heart was beating he got his eyes to focus on her are you real do i no look real her slashed hair was in spikes her face was streaked with black peat and blood he couldnt tell what she was wearing except for peat uh yeah he said i guess you look real and i did we come through this come on moira said we need to move holding on to each other macbeth still feeling like he was dreamwalking they made it back across the forecourt to where the peat came no higher than their thighs and then moiras plastic lamp went out which seemed to bother her a lot just hang on mungo things coming to pieces thats ok his brain felt like it was muffled mossy we dont need a light any more suns here someplace figured that even if she walked away from him at the top of the street even if she walked away for ever he had all the light hed ever need no moira stopped been through a lot me and this lamp theres blood on it is it mine or stanages macbeth panicked then he spun around in the peat saw the roof of the man ith moss the cavedin roof of the barn spars and serrated masonry projecting jaggedly into the half light hes gone moira said you sure hes gone how can you be sure someone like that he can go that easy he stared down into the peat like a pair of hands might break and drag him down or even worse if there were hands down there underneath please god macbeth breathed as a hand went around his arm its ok mungo is it is it ok are you still real oh jesus he started to weep mungo moira said wasny that easy clawing at his hard white face at his nose his teeth going at him like a madwoman blood oozing greasy warm blood and once i saw his eyes never really seen his eyes before in his eyes is this like languorous amusement the damage im doing is superficial and hes laughing at me behind him theres a shadow on the moss the shadow isnt moving behind me this warm breath on my neck i dont even have to turn around to know how putrid this breath is deathroom breath but i do turn around i turn my back on john peveril stanage and matt castle is there man castle is crouching on the moss he is very still still as stone still as the bounding toadstone on the moor before it leaps his feet do not touch the peat hes maybe five yards away but i can smell his breath he is breath all breath a mist on the moss hes in his element is matt castle i dont remember this mungo said i dont remember any of it these things sometimes happen out of time you know moira looked up at where the beacon of the moss shone down not blue somehow pale gold like an early sun in a twinkling she looked down at the plastic lamp its back piece hanging off where you put the batteries in dic gave me this when he rescued me from the outhouse its just a wee cheap thing made in taiwan where the flu comes from it had gone out and then it came on and when it came on matts essence spirit began to squirm like dic was sending him a message you know and i turned around and the light shines in the eyes of john peveril stanage and stanage backs off backs off too far hes starting to scream agony bitter frustration and somehow im hitting him with the light the finest brightest light ever came out of taiwan and his eyes are this orangey colour floating further back further away like the diminishing tail lights of a car disappearing into the night kept hitting him with the light mungo but hed gone over gone out of the bridelow circle maybe a couple of feet was all it took like an electric fence you know shock just hurled him back maybe he drowned was no my problem she was still fiddling with the lamp trying to put it back together and then there was just the two of us you puking your guts out mungo i dont know what happened maybe were talking providence maybe here hold on to this a wee minute she gave him the plastic base and two batteries fell out and plopped into the peat then something else fell out after them and she caught it what this was macbeth saw was a little metal comb like a dog comb with a whole bunch of teeth missing dic moira stared at the comb he stole it back he told me but i moira cairns started to laugh mungo macbeth never heard anyone sound quite so elated laughing fit to cause ripples in the peat laughing enough to bring on another goddamn bog blowout she fell down in the swirling street with a filthy splash and she dragged him down on top of her both arms around his neck the comb in one hand and she was kissing him hard on the mouth and the peat on her lips tasted like maple syrup when eventually they came to their feet she linked her arm into his and started to lead him along the western side of the street to where the beacon of the moss flashed a tired signal to the sun the black peat was quite deep around them but it was feeling cool now and good tea breaks over she said turning towards him the peat around her lips and she started to laugh again in lovely big peals teabreaks over boys back to your tunnelling yeah mungo macbeth said huh from dawbers secret book of bridelow unpublished hans before i go i can understand your feelings about the death of the young farmer sam davis but i dont think you should blame yourself from what youve told me he was a headstrong lad and if hed listened to you in the first place hed have left well alone and might be alive today easy for me to say but its what i believe and at least his stories of night activity among the circles on the moor were our pointer to the location of the bog body it was obvious what they would do with him switch him from the sanctity of the churchyard to the poisoned earth of a onceholy place which had systematically over a long period been reconsecrated in the name of evil cold storage nowhere colder the policeman i understand expected to find him in the loft at tile brewery but his body was never taken there i suspect that even stanage knew that his ancient spirit would be impossible to confront unless it was diffused through matt castle matt castle who they thought they could command we are all so stupid are we not to believe that anything beyond the physical can ever truly be controlled by mankind so we all went up there thats me and the mothers and a few lads to do the labouring went by day stroke of noon with as much brightness in the sky as anyone has a right to expect this time of year you know that place still reeks so much of evil that it could be an environmental and spiritual menace for centuries i dont know what theyll be able to do about that anyroad willie wagstaff and stan burrows went in and dug up the bogman and dumped him in a wheelbarrow and we brought him back to bridelow where he now lies in what i think you will agree is a place of ultimate safety no witch bottle we didnt want to insult her
