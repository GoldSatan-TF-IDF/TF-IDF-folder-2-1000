the wolves of willoughby chase one it was duskwinter dusk snow lay white and shin ing over the pleated hills and icicles hung from the forest trees snow lay piled on the dark road across willoughby wold but from dawn men had been clearing it with brooms and shovels there were hun dreds of them at work wrapped in sacking because of the bitter cold and keeping together in groups for fear of the wolves grown savage and reckless from hunger snow lay thick too uponthe roof of willoughby chase the great house that stood on an open emi nence in the heart of the wold but for all that the chase looked an inviting homea warm and wel coming stronghold its rosy herringbone brick was bright and wellcaredfor its numerous turrets and battlements stood up sharp against the sky and the crenelated balconies corniced with snow each held a golden square of window the house was all alight within and the joyous hubbub of its activity con trasted with the somber sighing of the wind and the hideous howling of the wolves without in the nursery a little girl was impatiently dancing up and down before the great window fourteen feet joan aiken high which faced out over the park and commanded the long black expanse of road will she be here soon pattern will she was her continual cry we shall hear soon enough i dare say miss bon nie was the inevitable reply from her maid who on hands and knees in front of the fue was folding and goffering the frills of twenty lace petticoats the little girl turned again to her impatient vigil she had climbed up on to the window seat the better to survey the snowy park and was jumping on its wellsprung cushions covered in crimson satin each time she bounced she nearly hit the ceiling give over miss bonnie do said pattern after a while look at the dust youre raising i can hardly see my tongs come and sit by the fire we shall hear soon enough when the trains due bonnie left her perch reluctantly enough and came to sit by the fire she was a slender creature small for her age but rosycheeked with a mass oe tumbled black locks falling to her shoulders and two brilliant blue eyes equally ready to dance with laughter or flash with indignation her square chin also gave promise oј a powerful and obstinate temper not al ways perfectly controlled but her mouth was sweet and she could be very thoughtful on occasionas now when she sat gazing into the fire piled high on its two carved alabaster wolfhounds i hope the train hasnt been delayed by wolves she said presently nonsense miss bonnie deardont worry your pretty head with thoughts like that replied pattern you know the porters and stationmaster have been the wolves of whloughby chnse practicing with their muskets and fowling pieces all the week at that moment there was a commotion from down stairs and bonnie turned her face alight with ex pectancy as the noise of dogs barking men shout ing and the doorbell clanging continued she flew recklessly along the huge expanse of nursery floor gleaming and polished as glass and down the main staircase to the entrance hall her impetuosity brought her in a heap to the feet of an immensely tall thin lady clad from neck to toe in a traveling dress of swathed gray twill with a stiff collar dark glasses and dull green buttoned boots bonnies headlong rush nearly sent this person flying and she recovered her balance with an exclamation of annoyance who is guilty of this unmannerly irruption she said settling her glasses once more upon her nose can this hoydenish creature be my new pupil ii beg your pardoni bonnie exclaimed picking herself up so i should hope am i right in supposing that you are miss green i am miss slighcarp your new governess i am also your fourth cousin once re moved the lady added haughtily as if she found the removal hardly sufficient oh bonnie stammered i didnt knowthat is i thought you were not expected until tomorrow i was looking for my cousin sylvia who is arriving this evening i am aware of the fact miss slighcarp replied coldly but that does not excuse bad manners where pray is your curtsy rather flustered bonnie performed this formality with less than her usual grace joan aiken lessons in deportment i see will need priority on our timetable miss slighcarp remarked and she turned to look after the disposition of her luggage you sir do not stand there smirking and dawdling but see that my valises are carried at once to my apartments and that my maid is immediately in at tendance to help me james the footman who had been exchanging grim aces with the butler over the fact that he had re ceived no tip at once sprang to attention and said your maid miss did you bring a maid with you no blockhead the maid whom lady green will have appointed to wait on me well i suppose miss pattern will be helping you said james scratching his head and he shoul dered one of the nine walrushide portmanteaux and staggered offto the service stairs will show you the way to your room said bon nie eagerly and when you are ready i will take you to see papa and mamma i hope we shall love each other she continued leading the way up the mag nificent marble staircase and along the portrait gal lery i shall have so much to show youmy collec tion of flint arrowheads and my semiprecious stones miss slighcarp thinned her ups disapprovingly and bonnie fearing that she had been forward said no more of her pursuits here is your apartment she explained presently opening a door and exhibiting a commodious set of rooms cheerful with fires and furnished with elegant taste in gilt and mahogany and here is my maid pattern to help you miss slighcarp drew down her brows at this but acknowledged the remark by an inclination of her the wolves of willoughhy chase head pattern was already kneeling at the dressing case and drawing out such articles as the governess might immediately need i shall leave you then for the moment said bonnie preparing to go she turned to add shall i come back in half an hour but was arrested by the sight of miss slighcarp snutching a heavy marble hairbruiih from its rest and striking a savage blow at the maid who had taken out a little case appar ently containing letters and papers prying wretclil who gave you permission to med dle with my letters she cried bonnie sprang back in an instant all her violent temper roused and seized the brush from miss sligh carps hand hurling it recklessly through the plate glass window she picked up a jug of warm water which a housemaid had just brought and dashed it full in the face of her new instructress miss slighcarp reeled under the impacther bon net came off so did her gray hair which apparently was a wig leaving her bald dripping and livid with rage oh dear am so sorry said bonnie in conster nation i did not mean to do that my temper is a dreadful fault but you must not strike pattern she is one of my best friends oh patternhelp heri the maid assisted miss slighcarp to replace the damp wig and repair the damage done by the water but her compressed lips and nostrils showed how little she relished the task an angry red weal was rising on her cheek where the brush had struck her gol said miss slighcarp to bonnie pointing at the door bonnie was glad to do so half an hour later joan atken though she returned having done her best in the meantime to wrestle with her rebellious temper shall i escort you to mamma and papa now she said when the governess bade her enter miss slighcarp had changed into another gray twill dress with a high white collar and had laid aside her me rino traveling cloak she permitted bonnie to lead her toward the apart ments of her parents having first locked up several drawers in which she had deposited papers and placed the keys in a chatelaine at her belt bonnie whose indignation never lasted long danced ahead cheerfully enough pointing out to her com panion the oubliette where cousin roger had slipped the panel which concealed a secret staircase the haunted portico the priests hole and other features of her beloved home miss slighcarp however as she followed wore on her face an expression that boded little good toward her charge at length they paused before a pair of doors grander than any they had yet passed and bonnie inquired of the attendant who stood before them if her parents were within receiving an affirmative an swer she joyfully entered and running toward an elegantlooking lady and gentleman who were seated on an ottoman near the fireplace exclaimed papal mammal such a surprisel here is miss slighcarp come a day earlier than expectedl miss slighcarp advanced and made her salutations to her employers i regret not having come up to london to make arrangements with you myself said sir willoughby bowing easily to her but my good friend and man of business mr gripe will have told you how we are the wolvesof willoughby chase situatedon the eve of a departure with so much to attend to i had been aware that we had a distant cousinyourself maamliving in london and i entrusted mr gripe with the task of seeking you out and asking wliether you would be willing to un dertake the care of my estates and my child while we are abroad my only other relative my sister jane is as perhaps you know too frail and elderly for such a responsibility i hope you and bonnie will get on together famously here miss slighcarp in a low and grating tone told him the story of the hairbrush and the jug of water omitting however her unprovoked assault in the first place upon poor pattern sir willoughby burst into laughter did she do that the minx eh you hussy and he lovingly pinched his daughters cheek girls will be girls miss slighcarp and you must allow some thing for the natural high spirits and excitement at tendant on your own arrival and the expected one of her cousin i shall look to you to instill in time a more ladylike deportment into our wild sprite lady green who was darkhaired and sadeyed and who looked very ill here raised her voice wearily and asked her husband if that were not a knock on the door he called a summons impatiently and the stationmaster entereda black dingy figure twisting his cap in his hands the down train is signaled squire he said after bobbing his head in reverence to each of the persons present in the room is it your pleasure to let it proceed surely surely said sir willoughby my little niece is aboard itlet it approach with all speed joan aiken how clid you come from the station my man walked let orders be given for solly to drive you back in the chaisewith a suitable escort of coursethen he can wait there and bring back miss sylvia at the same time oh thank you indeed sir said the man with heartfelt gratitude bless your noble heart it would have taken me a weary while to walk those ten miles back and it is freezing fast thats all right said sir willoughby heartily mustnt let miss sylvia die of cold on the train besides the wolves might get you and then the poor child would be held up on the train atl night for want of the signal never do eh well bonnie what is it miss oh papa said bonnie who had been plucking at his sleeve may i go with solly in the chaise to meet sylvia may i no indulgence should be permitted a child who has behaved as she has done remarked miss sligh carp oh come come miss slighcarp come come maam said sir willoughby goodnaturedly young blood you know besides my bonnies as good a shot at a wolf as any of them run along then miss but wrap up snugremember youll be several hours on the road oh thank you papa goodbye goodbye mamma dear goodbye miss slighcarp and she fondly kissed her parents and ran from the room to find her warm est bonnet and pelisse reckless foolish indulgence muttered the gov erness directing after bonnie a look of the purest spite the wolves of willoughby chase but hey exclaimed sir willoughby recalled to memory of miss slighcarps presence by the sound though he missed the sense of her words if the trains only just signaled how did you come then maam you cant have flown here hey for the first time the governess showed signs of confusion ierthat is to say a friend who was driving over from blastburn kindly offered to bring me here with my baggage she at length replied a bell clanged through the apartment at that mo ment the dressing bell said sir willoughby looking at a handsome gold watch slung on a chain across his ample waistcoat i apprehend miss slighcarp that you are fatigued from your journey and will not wish to dine with us a meal will be served in your own apartments he inclined his head in a dignified gesture of dis missal which the governess had no option but to obey two two days before these events a very different scene had been enacted far away in london where bon nies cousin sylvia was being prepared for her jour ney sylvia was an orphan both her parents having been carried off by a fever when she was only an in fant she lived with her aunt jane who was now be coming very aged and frail and had written to sir willoughby to suggest that he take on the care of the little girl he had agreed at once to this pro posal for sylvia he knew was delicate and the coun try air would do her good besides he welcomed the idea of her gentle companionship for his rather har umscarum bunnie aunt jane and sylvia shared a room at the top of a house it was in park lane this being the only street in which aunt jane could consider living un fortunately as she was very poor she could afford to rent only a tiny attic in such a genteel district the room was divided into two by a very beautiful but old curtain of white chinese brocade she and sylvia each had half the room at night aunt jane sleeping on the divan and sylvia on the ottoman during the daytime the curtain was drawn back and hung ele the wolves of willoughby chase gantly looped against the wall they cooked their meals over the gas jet and had baths in a large enam eled chinese bowl covered with dragons an heirloom of aunt janes at other times it stood on a little occasional table by the door and was used for visit ing cards they were making sylvias clothes aunt jane with tears running down her face had taken down the white curtain which would no longer be needed and was cutting it up fortunately it was large enough to afford material for several chemises petticoats pantalettes dresses and even a bonnet aunt jane mopping her eyes with a tiny shred of the material murmured i do like to see a little girl dressed all in white i wish we neednt cut up your curtain auntie said sylvia who hated to see her aunt so distressed when im thirtyfive and come into my money i sliall buy you a whole set of white brocade curtains theres my angel her aunt replied embracing her but wlien you are thirtyfive i shall be a hun dred and three and she set to work making the tucks in a petticoat with thousands of tiny stitches sylvia sighed and bent her fair head over another with stitches almost equally tiny she was a little depressedthough she would not dream of saying so at the idea of wearing nothing but white especially at her cousin bonnies where everything was sure to be grand and handsome now let me think muttered aunt jane sewing away like lightning what can we use to make a traveling cloak she paused for a moment and glanced round the room at the lovingly tended pieces of sheraton and joan aiken hepplewhite furniture the antimacassars the per sian screen across the gasjet kitchen the window curtains were too threadbare to useand in any case one must have window curtains at last she recollected an old green velvet shawl which they sometimes used as an extra bedcover when it was very cold and they slept together on the ottoman i can use my jettrimmed mantle instead she said reassuringly to sylvia after all one person can not be so cold as two by the day of departure all the clothes had been finished nothing much could be done about sylvias shoes which were deplorably shabby but aunt jane blacked them with a mixture of soot and candle grease and sylvias bonnet was trimmed with a white plume from the ostrichfeather fan which her aunt had carried at her comingout ball all sylvias be longings were neatly packed into an old carpetbag and aunt jane had made her up a little packet of provisions for the journey though with strict injunc tions not to eat them if there were anyone else in the compartment for ladies never eat in public they were too poor to take a hackney carriage to the station and aunt jane always refused to travel in omnibuses so they walked carrying the bag be tween them fortunately the station was not far nor the bag heavy aunt jane secured a corner seat for her charge and put her under the care of the guard now remember my dear child she said kissing sylvia and looking suspiciously round the empty com partment never speak to strangers tip all the ser vants immediately i have put all the farthings from the wolves of willoughby chase my reticule at the bottom of your valise do not model yourself on your cousin bonnie who i believe is a dear good child but a little wild give my fond regards to my brother willoughby and tell him that i am in the pink of health and amply provided for and if anyone except the guard speaks to you pull the communication cord yes auntie replied sylvia dutifully embracing her she felt a pang as she saw the frail old figure struggling away through the crowd and wondered how her aunt jane would manage that evening with out her little niece to adjust her curlpapers and read aloud a page of dr johnsons dictionary then all sylvias fears were aroused tor a strange man entered the compartment and sat down he did not speak however and took no notice of her and the train shortly afterward departing her thoughts were diverted into a less apprehensive vein as she watched the unfamiliar houses with their lighted windows flying past it was to be a long journeya night and a day the hour of departure was six oclock in the eve ning and sylvia knew that she did not arrive at her destination until about eight of the following eve ning what strange forests towns mountains and stretches of countryside would they not have passed by then as the train proceeded at its steady fifteen miles an hour she had never been out of london before and watched eagerly from her window until they had left the houses behind and she was driven to study the toes of her own shoes so lovingly pol ished by aunt jane the thought of the old lady carefully preparing for her solitary slumbers was too much for sylvia joan aiken and tears began to run silently down her cheeks which she endeavored to mop with her tiny handker chief made from a spare two inches of white bro cade here this wont do said a voice in her ear sud denly and she looked up in alarm to see that the man at the other end of the compartment had moved along and was sitting opposite and staring at her sylvia gave her eyes a final dab and haughtily con centrated on her reflection in the dark window but her heart was racing should she pull the communi cation cord she stole a cautious glance at the mans reflection and saw that he was standing up appar ently extracting something from a large leather port manteau then he turned toward her holding some thing out she looked round enough to see that it was a box of chocolates about a foot square by six inches deep swathed around with violet ribbons no thank you said sylvia in as ladylike a tone as she could muster i never touch chocolate all the same she had to swallow rapidly a couple of times for the tea which she had shared with aunt jane before the journey although very refined had not been substantialtwo pieces of thin breadand butter a cinnamon wafer and a sliver of caraway cake she knew better however than to accept food from strangers and as to opening her own little packet while he was in the carriagethat was out of the question she shook her head again now come alongdo said the man coaxingly all little girls like sweeties know sir said sylvia coldly if you speak to me again i shall be obliged to pull the communication cord the wolves of willoughby chase he sighed and put away the box her relief over this was premature however for he turned round next minute with a confectioners pasteboard carton filled with every imaginable variety of little cakes there were jam tarts maids of honor lemon cheese cakes chelsea buns and numerous little iced con fections in brilliant and enticing colors i always put up a bit of tiffin for a journey he murmured as it to himself and placing the box on the seat directly opposite sylvia he selected a cake covered with violet icing and bit into it it appeared to be filled with jam sylvia looked straight ahead and ignored him but again she had to swallow now my dear how about one of these little odds and ends said the man i cant possible eat them all by myselfcan i sylvia stood up and looked for the communication cord it was out of her reach shall i pull it for you inquired her fellow trav eler politely following the direction of her eyes up ward sylvia did not reply to him she did not feel though that it would be ladylike to climb up on the seat or armrest to pull the cord herself so she sat down again biting her lip with anxiety to her inexpressible relief the stranger after eating three or tour more cakes with every appearance of enjoyment put the box back in his portmanteau wrapped him self in a richly furred cloak retired to his own cor ner and shut his eyes a subdued but regular snore soon issuing from his partly opened mouth presently convinced sylvia that he was asleep and she began to breathe more freely at length she brought out from concealment under her mantle her most treasured possession and held it lovingly in her arms joan aiken this was a doll named annabelle made of wood not much larger than a candle and plainly dressed but extremely dear to sylvia she and annabelle had no secrets from one another and it was a great com fort to her to have this companion as the train rocked on through the unfamiliar dark presently she grew drowsy and fell into uneasy slumber but not for long it was bitterly cold and her feet in their thin shoes felt like lumps of ice she huddled into her corner and wrapped herself in the green cloak envying her companion his thick furs and undisturbed repose and wishing it were ladylike to curl her feet up beneath her on the seat unfor tunately she knew better than that she dreamed without being really asleep of arctic seas of monstrous tunnels through hillsides fringed with icicles her traveling companion who had grown a long tail and a pair of horns offered her cakes the size of grand pianos and colored scarlet blue and green when she bit into them she found they were made of snow she woke suddenly from one of these dreams to find that the train had stopped with a jerk oh what is it where are we she exclaimed be fore she could stop herself no need to alarm yourself miss said her com panion looking unavailingly out of the black square of window wolves on the line most likelythey often have trouble of that kind hereabouts wolves sylvia stared at him in terror they dont often get into the train though he added reassuringly two years ago they managed to climb into the guards van and eat a pig and once they got the engine driveranother had to be the wolves of willoughby chase sent in a relief enginebut they dont often eat a passenger i promise you as if in contradiction of his words a sad and sin ister howling now arose beyond the windows and sylvia pressing her face against the dark pane saw that they were passing through a thickly wooden re gion where snow lay deep on the ground across this white carpet she could just discern a ragged multitude pouring out oј which arose from time to time this terrible cry she was almost petrified with fear and sat clutching annabelle in a cold and trembling hand at length she summoned up strength to whisper why dont we go on oh i expect there are too many of em on the line ahead the man answered carelessly cant just push through them you seethe engine would be derailed in no time and then we should be in a bad way no i expect well have to wait here till daylight nowthe wolves get scared then you know and make for home all that matters is that the driver shant get eaten in the meantimehell keep em off by throwing lumps of coal at them i dare say oh sylvia exclaimed in irrepressible alarm as a heavy body thudded suddenly against the window and she had a momentary view of a pointed gray head red slavering jaws and pale eyes gleaming with ferocity oh dont worry about that soothed her com panion theyll keep up that jumping against the windows for hours theyre not much danger you know singly its only in the whole pack youve got to watch out for em sylvia was not much comforted by this she moved along to the middle of the seat and huddled there joan aiken glancing fearfully first to one side and then to the other the strange man seemed quite undisturbed by the repeated onslaught of the wolves which followed he took a pinch of snuff remarked that it was all a great nuisance and they would be late and com posed himsek to sleep again he had just begun to snore when a discomposing incident occurred the window beside him which must have been insecurely fastened was not proof against the continuous impact of the frenzied and ravenous animals the catch suddenly slipped and the window tell open with a crash its glass shivering into fragments sylvia screamed another instant and a wolt pre cipitated itself through the aperture thus formed it turned snarling on the sleeping stranger who started awake with an oath and very adroitly flung his cloak over the animal he then seized one of the shattered pieces of glass lying on the floor and stabbed the im prisoned beast through the cloak it fell dead tush said sylvias companion breathing heavily and passing his hand over his face unexpected most he extracted the dead wolf from the folds of the cloak and tipped its body with some exertion out through the broken window there was a chorus of snarling and yelping outside and then the wolves seemed to take fright at the appearance of their dead comrade for sylvia saw them coursing away over the snow come thats capital said the man wed better shift before they come back shift into another compartment he explained cant the voivcs of i illii hhy cimse stay in this one nowtoo cold for one thing and for another have wolves popping in the whole time nuisance no come along nows the time to do it sylvia was most reluctant and indeed almost too terrified to accompany him but she saw the force of his proposal and watched anxiously as he opened the door and gliinced this way and that right just pass me out those bags will you he had placed both his and hers ready on the seat she passed them out holding them in one hand he made his way sideways along tlie footboard to the next car riage door which he opened he tossed in the bags returned for his cloak and rug and finally reappeared and held out his hand to sylvia come along now my dear if you dont want to be made into wolf porridge he exclaimed with frightening jovialitv and sylvia timorously permitted him to assist her along the narrow ledge and into the next carrii e it was witli a sense of unbounded relief and thankiulncss that she heard him shim the door and make sure that the windows were securely fas tened excellent he remarked with a smile at sylvia which bared every tooth in his head now we can have another forty winks and he wrapped himself up again in his cloak careless of any wolf gore that might remain on its folds and shut his eyes sylvia was too cold and terrified to sleep she crouched as before in the middle of the seaticy shivering and expecting at any minute to hear the wolves recommence their attack against the window here we cant have this said a disapproving voice and she turned to see the man awake again and scrutinizing her closely not warm enough eh joan aiken here and then as he saw her wince away from the cloak he unstrapped a warm plaid traveling rug and insisted on wrapping her in it tired frozen and frightened sylvia was unable to resist him any longer put your feet up and lie down he ordered thats right now shut your eyes no more wolves for the time beingtheyve been scared away off to sleep with you sylvia was beginning to be deliciously warm her last recollection was of hearing his snores begin again three when sylvia woke it was broad daylight and the train was running through a mountainous region wooded here and there and with but few and scat tered dwellings her companion was already awake and munching away at an enormous piece of cold sausage sylvia felt herself to be nearly dead of hunger she remembered aunt janes precept never eat in front of strangers but surely aunt jane had not intended her to go for a whole night and a day without tak ing some refreshment and moreover the good soul could not have anticipated the dreadful perils that her niece was to encounter perils which had left sylvia so weak and faint that she felt she might never reach willoughby chase alive unless she could open her little packet and consume some of its contents perhaps she thought the shared adventure of the wolves formed some sort of an introduction to her fellow traveler she pondered over this matter for some time and at length driven by her ravenous appetite and with many timorous glances at the strange man she opened her carpetbag and took from her parcel of food one or two of the little dry rolls her aunt had provided joan aiken rolls that contained in each a liny sliver of ham frail and thin as pink tissue paper the remainder she put back for later in the day after this frugal meal she felt greatly restored and was not too discomposed when she saw that the man having devoured his sausage down to the twisted end was now smiling at her in a manner that was evidently intended to be the height of amiability there now we both feel better he remarked it was most kind of you sir to lend me your rug sylvia faltered couldnt let you freeze to death mdear could i not after youd shown such pluck and spirit over the wolves some little gels would have screamed and cried i can tell you will they come back again inquired sylvia glancing anxiously out the train was now running across a wide snowy plain daz lingly bright under the sun of a clear blue morning not till this evening he told her when we get to the wolds at dusk you can depend on it therell be wolves there to meet us no need eo worry though sylvia looked her doubt of this statement and he exclaimed pshaw wolves are cowardly brutesi they wont hurt you unless they outnumber you by more than ten to one if you feel anxious about it ill get my gun though i dont generally use it for small fry and to sylvias alarm he pulled down a canvas wrapped bundle that she had taken tor fishing rods and took from it a long heavy glinting blue gun opening a smaller bag he brought out a few car tridges and clapped them into the breech then turn ing to sylviashe winced away in alarmhe said the wolves of willoughby chase now my dear shall i give you a proof of my marks manship shall i eh oh no sir please dont please do not indeed indeed i am sure you can shoot extremely welll cant be sure till you have seen me and it will pass the time for us both so saying he opened the window at one end of the compartment while sylvia with her hands to her ears pressed herself as tar as possible into a corner at the other end now then whats there to shoot cant very well shoot cattle though it would be a rare joke ha hal theres a bunny bang got himdid you see him go head over heels sylvia had seen no such thing for her hands were over her eyes and her nose buried in the redandbhick patterned upholstery now a rookhes flapping along slowly ill wait till we catch him upthere tumbled down like a stone the fannerll wonder where he came from he fired one or two more sliots and then remarked but i mustnt waste all my cartridges must keep some for the wolves what and put the gun back in its case carefully cleaning it before he did so the com partment was reeking with acrid blue smoke and sylvia was nearly choking there i never asked if youd like to try a shot the man said but i fancy the gun would be a bit heavy for you as youre on the small sidea lighter fowling piece would be the thing for you indeed hope i shall never need to shoot at all said sylvia horrified at the very possibility of such an idea never know when it might come in usefulmy joan alken old mother used to say that every little girl should be able to cook play the piano sing and shoot sylvia thought of aunt janes very different cata logue o accomplishments for little girls in which crewel work purse netting and making paper doilies took high place and could not agree with him the thought of aunt jane made her sad once more and she sighed deeply are you going far the man asked lets get ac quainted my names grimshawjosiah grimshaw sylvia did not much wish to confide in him but she felt that if she did not talk to him he might get bored and recommence shooting out of the window anything was preferable to that accordingly she told him her name and that she was traveling to the house of her uncle sir wihoughby green he expressed great interest in this ah yes yes indeed ive heard of sir willoughby richest man in five counties isnt he sylvia knew nothing of that and youll have a fine time there eh shall you be staying there long oh yes you see my dear mamma and papa are dead and so am to live there now with my cousin bonnie and your uncle and aunt will look after you he said nodding oh not for very long she told him my poor aunt sophia is very delicate and it is necessary for my uncle to take her on a voyage south tor her health so they will be leaving very soon after i get there my poor cousin bonnie how she will miss theml but we shall have a governess who is related to us and of course there are many servants there to look after the wolves of willoughhy ch ie us and i hope that aunt sophy will soon be better and come back to englandaunt jane says that she is so pretty and kind he nodded again afternoon was now come upon themgray with promise of more snow the train had left the levels and was running into more upland countrywaste wide and lonely with not a living thing stirring across its bare and open expanses it was bleak and forbidding and sylvia shivered a little thinking what a long way there was yet to go before she reached her unknown destination the day dragged on to her relief mr grimshaw presently fell asleep again and sat snoring in his comer sylvia took out annabelle once more and showed her the landscapeit seemed to her that the poor doll looked somewhat startled and dismayed at the dreary prospect which was not surprising since her painted eyes had never before surveyed anything wilder than hyde park on a sunny morning never mind annabelle sylvia said comforting her well be there soon and there will be warm fires and many beautiful things to look at i expect bonnie will have many dollfriends for you to play with oh dear i only hope they wont laugh at you in your funny little old pelisse she felt rather selfreproachful about annabelles old clothes but there really had not been a scrap of the white curtain left by the time her own outfit had been completed she consoled herself and the doll as best she could and presently sang some quiet songs in an undertone when it seemed fairly sure judging by the loudness of mr grimshaws snores that she would not wake him with her singing f joan aiken at length darkness came anil poor sylvia was dis mayed by the sight while it was yet dusk of many aninial shapes streaming in a broken formation across the snow she heard again that lonely heartshaking cry of the wolves and wondered whether to waken mr grimshaw and tell him but the train chugged on its way without slowing and the wolves came and went in the shadows of the trees never approaching very near so that she felt it would be cowardly to disturb him and as long as there was no immediate danger she greatly preferred to let him sleep on it was now quite dark and sylvia wished very much that she had some means of knowing the time mr grimshaw had a great gold watch in his waist coat but this was covered up and she could not tell whether she was likely soon to reach her journeys end she had been in readiness since twilight with the last little hard roll eaten and the carpetbag buck led up and annabelle safely tucked away under her cloak once more all at once there was a grinding jerk and the train came with violent abruptness to a halt the wheels screeching in protest and the windows almost start ing from their frames oh what has happened what can it be cried sylvia mr grimshaw leaped to his feet and reached up ward to pull down his portmanteau from the rack but either from clumsiness or on account of the jolt with which the next coach struck theirs as it slid to a halt he gave the case too vigorous a tug it top pled forward and fell with a most appalling crash the wolves of wiuovghby chase directly upon his head telling him to the floor he lay apparently stunned sylvia was terrified she sat utterly fixed for two or three seconds and then rushed to the window which had fallen open when the train stopped and thrust out her head to see if there was anyone to whom she might appeal torhelp greatly to her relief and joy she discovered that they had actually stopped at a little forest station her portion of the train was at the extreme end oј the platform and the wildly swinging and flickering lamps did not enable her to read the name upon the notice board but slie saw that a little group of per sons carrying lamps and bundles were rapidly ap proaching down the length of the station appearing to glance into each compartment in turn as they pro ceeded she could not distinguish individuals of the group but gathered an impression of urgency from their manner an impression which was intensified by some indistinguishable shouts from the engine driver borne back on the wind help called sylvia leaning from her window help pleasel she was afraid that her faint cry would not be heard but at least one member of the group respond ed to it for there was an answering halloo and a small figure detached itself from the rest and darted forward sylvia is it you sylvia had hardly time to register more than a pair of bright dark eyes rosy cheeks black locks escaping from under a little fur cap before with a cry of mind now miss bonnie dont get so far joan aiken ahead a man had come up and was busy undoing the fastening of the compartment door miss sylvia is it miss well soon have you out of there he called cheerily wrestling with the frozen and snowcovered handle while bonnie somewhat im peded his activities dancing up and down blowing kisses to sylvia and crying poor dear sylvia you must be frozen never mind youll soon be warm and snug we have a foot wanner and ever so many blan kets in the carriage oh how i am going to love you what fun we shall have sylvia responded heartily to these overtures and then exclaimed urgently to the man who had now undone the door there is a gentleman here in need of assistance i greatly tear that he has been stunned by his suitcase pray pray can you help him lets have a look at him then miss the man said you pop out with miss bonnie and let james take you back to the carriage that will be safest for you but bonnie exclaimed all interest a man hurt oh the poor fellow we must help him solly we had better take him home the other members of the group had come up by now and there was clamor and discussion whats to be done cant leave the poor gentle man in the train like that tis another two hours to blastburn and like as not hed freeze to death well whatever you do said a whiskered man in a flat cap who appeared to be the stationmaster do it quick or the wolvesll settle the matter hark i hear them nowl weve not a moment to spare and an anxious toot from the engine drivers whistle seemed to indicate that he was likewise of this opinion the wolves of willoughby chase take him out then cried bonnie put him in the carriagel i am sure my father would wish it and james and solly agreeing mr grimshaw and his luggage were lifted forth together with sylvias carpetbag the door was slammed and the guard waved his green lamp smoke and sparks puffed back on the wind as the engine heaved itself under way and the train slowly ground forward the guard nim bly swung himself on board as the rear of the train passed them and sylvia glancing back as she was hurried along the platform by bonnies eager hand saw its serpent line of lights disappear winding through the trees now the grinding and hissing of the engine was gone sylvia could hear the howls of wolves distinct and frightening and she understood the haste of the party to be gone she received a confused impression of the small station building with its fringed canopy and scarlet painted seats as she was hustled through and then they came to the neat little carriage in front of which six black horses were steaming stamping and shiver ing under their rugs as impatient as the humans to a be off lay him on the seati cried bonnie thats it james now wrap a rug over him sois his luggage all there capital now sylvia spring in but poor sylvia was too exhausted and cold to manage it and i james the footman lifted her carefully up and de posited her on the opposite seat wrapping her in a beautiful soft blue merino rug and placing her feet upon a foot warmer bonnie snuggled in beside her and cried now we can go and indeed it was only just in time as james and solly swung themselves up and the station staff joan aiken dashed inside their little edifice there was a chorus of yelps and howls and the first of a considerable pack of wolves came loping into the station yard there was a flash and a deafening report as james fired his musket among them solly whipped up the horses who needed no whipping and the carriage seemed almost to spring oft the ground so rapid was the motion with which it left the building and lights behind there had been a new fall of snow and their prog ress was silent as they flew over the carpeted ground save for the muffled hoofbeats and the cry of the wolves behind them those poor men in the station exclaimed sylvia will they be safe oh yes bonnie told her reassuringly they have plenty of ammunition we always bring them some when we come and food tooand the wolves cant get in its only troublesome when a train has to stop and people get out but tell me about that poor man what is the matter with him was he taken ill no it was his portmanteau that fell on him and knocked him unconscious sylvia explained the train stopped with such a jerk yes the drivers always do that you see if the wolves notice a train slowing down they are on the alert at once and all start to run toward the station so as to be there when the passengers get out con sequently if a train has to stop here the driver goes as fast as he can till the very last moment in order to deceive them into thinking that he is going straight through but now tell me about yourself said bon nie affectionately passing an arm round sylvia and making sure that she was well wrapped up did you the wolves of willoughby chnse have a pleasant journey are you hungry or thirsty oh no thank you i had some provisions with me for the train we had quite a pleasant journey a wolf jumped into our compartment last night but mr grimshawthat gentlemanstabbed it to death and we moved into another compartment is he a friend of yours bonnie said nodding over this incident oh dear no i had never seen him before indeed i did not like him very much sylvia confessed he seemed so strange although i believe he meant to be kind the two children were silent for a moment or two as the carriage galloped on its way the soft rugs were delicious to sylvia and the grateful warmth of the foot warmer as it struck upward gradually thaw ing her numbed and chilled feet but the sweetest thing of all was the friendly pressure of bonnies hand and the loving brightness of her smile as she turned every now and then to scan her cousin i cant believe you are really here at last she said i wonder which of us is the taller what de lightful times we shall havel oh i cant wait to show you everythingthe poniesmy father has bought a new little quiet one for you in case you are not used to ridingand the hothouse flowers and my collections and the wolfhounds we shall have such games and in the summer we can go for excursions on the wolds with the pony trap if only mamma and papa did not have to go away it would be quite perfect she sighed poor bonnie said sylvia impulsively squeezing her cousins hand perhaps it will not have to be joan aiken for very long she received a grateful pressure in re turn and they were silent again listening to the crunch ot the wheels on the snow and the cry of the wolf pack now becoming fainter behind them in the distance there was something magical about this ride which sylvia was to remember for the rest of her lifethe dark snowscented air blowing constantly past them the boundless wold and forest stretching away in all directions before and behind the tramp and jingle of the horses the snugness and security of the car riage and above all bonnies happy welcoming pres ence beside her after a time bonnie said i wonder how that poor man is what did you say was his name mr grimshaw bonnie leaned across and plucked gently at his hand mr grimshaw mr grimshaw are you any better but there was no reply he must be uncon scious still she said i wish we had some restora tives to give himhowever we shall be at home in another hour pattern and mrs shubunkin will know what to do for him pattern is my maidand ohi such a dearand mrs shubunkin is the housekeeper presently sylvia began to nod and found her eye lids closing despite all her efforts to keep awake but she had hardly more than dozed off when the car riage stopped with a clattering and a barking of dogs and many shouts of greeting looking eagerly out of the window she saw the great rosy glittering facade of willoughby chase with every window shin ing a golden welcome they had arrived bonnie did not wait for james to open the car riage door she had it unlatched in a moment and the wolves of willoughby chase leaped out into the snow turning to help her cousin with affectionate care sylvia was stiff and dazed with fatigue and as bonnie led her tenderly up the great curving flight of steps and into the hall she received only a vague impression of many lights and much warmth people rushing hither and thither and a kindly voice saying poor little dear she is wearied to death james do you carry her upstairs while i ask mrs shubunkin for a posset the posset came steaming sweet and delicious and patterns gentle hands removed sylvias traveling clothes sylvia was too sleepy to study her surround ings before she was placed between soft smooth sheets and sank deep into dreamless slumber later in the night she awoke and saw stars shin ing beyond the white curtain at her beds toot sud denly she recalled aunt janes voice teaching her astronomy there is orion sylvia dear and the constellation resembling a w is cassiopeia oh poor aunt jane would she be lying awake too watching the stars would she be warm enough under the jet trimmed mantle what would she do at breakfast time with no niece to warm the teapot brew the bohea and make the toast gruel tears began to run down sylvias cheeks and she drew a long breath trying to suppress her silent sobs the next moment she heard feet patter across the carpet and two small comforting arms came round her neck a cheek was rubbed lovingly against her wet one what is it sylvia dear are you homesick shall i come into bed with you sylvia was on the point of revealing her worries joan aiken about aunt jane then she realized that she must not aunt janes pride would not let her accept help from her brother and so sylvia must not disclose that she was lonely and cold and poor but oh somehow she must find a means of helping her auntshe musti she musti dont cry bonnie whispered this is your home now and we shall do such delightful things together i am sure i can make you happy she hugged sylvia again and slipping into the bed began telling her of all the plans she had for sledging and skating and picking primroses in spring and days on the moors in summer sylvia could not help being cheered by this happy prospect and soon both children fell asleep the dark head and the fair on one pillow four next morning the children had breakfast together in the nursery which was gay with the sunshine that sparkled on crystal and silver and found golden lights in the honey and quince preserve miss slighcarp it seemed was to take her meals in her own apartments and of this sylvia was glad for when she met the governess after breakfast she found her a somewhat frightening lady cold and se vere and forbidding however aunt jane had taught sylvia well and in many respects it was found that she was ahead of bonnie you will have to work miss said miss slighcarp curtly to bonnie you will have to work hard to catch up with your cousin i am glad said bonnie hugging sylvia i want to work hard it is delightful that you are so clever we shall study all sorts of interesting things botany and greek and the use of the globes they did not do many lessons that morning after they had lain on their backboards while miss sligh carp read them a short chapter of egyptian history they were dismissed to their own devices sir wil loughby and lady green would be departing at mid day and he wanted to instruct miss slighcarp in vari joan aiken ous matters relating to the running of the estate and household of which she was to be in charge while he was away let us go and see how poor mr grimshaw is this morning bonnie proposed i am longing to take you to mamma and papa but miss slighcarp is with them now we will wait until she comes back they ran along to the chamber where the unfor tunate traveler had been placed and found there an elderly whiskered gentleman dr morne in consul tation with round rosy mrs shubunkin the house keeper they curtsied to the doctor who patted their heads absently it is a most unusual case he was saying to mrs shubunkin the poor gentleman has recovered con sciousness but he has clean lost all recollection of his name and address and who he is i have ordered him some medicines and he must be kept very quiet and remain in bed until his memory returns i will go and speak to sir willoughby on the matter perhaps if he were to see sylvia he would remem ber the train journey bonnie suggested he told you his name did he not sylvia yesmr grimshaw josiah grimshaw it would be worth a trial the doctor agreed and a footman just then arriving to inform him that sir willoughby was at liberty he left them while the children ventured unescorted into mr grimshaws chamber what was their surprise to discover that the pa tient was not in bed but up and standing by the fire wrapped in a crimson plush dressing gownl moreover he seemed to have been burning papers the voves of villoiiiby chnfe for the fueplke was full of black ash and the room of blue smoke he started violently as they entered slammed shut the lid of a small dispatch box and flung himself back into bed what the deuce are you doing here he growled who are you dont you remember sylvia mr grimshaw said bonnie i am bonnie green and sylvia is my cous in who traveled with you on the train yesterday never seen her in my life before and names not grimshaw he snapped dont know what it is but not grimshaw hes wandering poor fellow whispered bonnie he must have got out of bed in delirium we had best send mrs shubunkin to sit with him and see he does not do himself a mischief mr grimshaw was plainly most displeased at their presence in his room so they went off to tell the housekeeper that the invalid should not be left alone now come said bonnie then taking her cousins hand papa and mamma must be free now for i saw miss slighcarp downstairs as we crossed the stair head when they reached lady greens sitting room they found the doctor tliere speaking with sir willoughby and so you will let this poor man remain here so long as he is in need of attention the doctor was saying that is most kind of you sir willoughby and like your liberality eh well sir willoughby said couldnt turn the poor fellow out into the snow what plenty of room here he can remain till he gets his wits backtill we return if need be looking after him will give joan aiken the servants something to do while we are away youll come in and see him from time to time morne the doctor departed promising careful attendance on the stranger and wishing lady green a speedy return to health nothing like a sea voyage dear lady to bring roses back to the cheeks and so this is sylvia said lady green very kind ly when the doctor had gone i hope that you and bonnie are going to be dear friends and look after one another when we are away oh yes mamma bonnie exclaimed i love her already we are going to be so happy together then her face fell and her bright color faded for at that moment lady greens maid entered the room with wraps and a traveling mantle are you leaving now mamma so soon it wants but five minutes to midday my child said lady green as she wearily allowed herself to be swathed in her cloak sylvia observed how thin her aunts wrists were how languid her beautiful dark eyes silently the children followed downstairs in the bustle of departure servants darted here and there mound upon mound of boxes went out to the chaise sir willoughby tenderly supported his wife to the hall door there she enveloped bonnie in a long and loving embrace had a warm kiss too for sylvia and pale as death allowed herself to be lifted into the carriage they saw her face at the window with her eyes fixed yearningly on bonnie it wont be long mamma bonnie called her voice was strained and dry the wolves of willouglihy chase not long my darling be good children said sir willoughby hurriedly mind what miss slighcarp tells you now he pressed a golden sovereign into each of their hands and jumped quickly into the carriage after his wife ready james the whip cracked the mettlesome horses blew great clouds of steam into the frosty air and they were off the carriage whirled over the packed snow of the driveway passed beyond a grove of leafless trees and was lost to view without a word bonnie turned on her heel and marched up the stairs and along the passages to the nursery sylvia followed her heart swollen with com passion she longed to say some comforting words but could think of none it may not be long bonnie she ventured at length bonnie sat at the table her hands tightly clenched together i will not i will not cry she was saying to herself at sylvias anxious loving compassionate voice she took heart a little and gave her cousin a smile after all she thought i am lucky to have papa and mamma even if they have gone away poor syl via has no one at all come she said jumping up the sun is shining i will show you some of the grounds let us go skat ing but bonnie dear i have no skates and i do not know how oh it is the easiest thing in the world i will soon show you and as for skates papa thought of that already look bonnie pulled open a cup joan aiken board door and showed six pairs of white kid skat ing boots all different sizes we knew your feet must be somewhere near the same size as mine since we are the same age so papa had several different pairs made and we thought one of them was certain to fit sure enough one of the pairs of boots fitted ex actly sylvia was much struck by this thought on the part of her uncle and astonished at the lavishness of having six pairs made for one to be chosen likewise pattern pulled out a whole series of white fur caps and pelisses and tried them against silvia until she found ones tliat fitted ive hung your green velvet in the closet miss she said green velvets all very well for london but you want something warmer in the country sylvia could not help a pang as she remembered the cutting of the green velvet shawl and saw the sumptuous pile of white fur how she wished she might send one of the pelisses to aunt jane but next moment bonnie caught her hand and pulled her to the door dont go outside the park now miss bonnie pat tern said we wont bonnie promised snug in their furs the two children ran out across the great snowcovered slope in front of the house through the grove and down to where a frozen river meandered across the park after falling over two or three artificial cascades now stiff and gleaming with icicles the children sat on a garden bench to put on their skates then with much laughter and encour the wolves of willonghby chase agement bonnie began to show sylvia how to keep her balance on the ice why sylvia you might have been bom to it you are a thousand times better than i was when i be gan perhaps it is because aunt jane took such pains teaching me to curtsy and dance the gavotte balanc ing dr johnsons dictionary on my head sylvia suggested as she cautiously glided across to the oppo site snowpiled bank and then hurriedly returned to the safety of bonnies helping hand whatever the reason it is perfectly splendid we can go right down tlie river to the end of the park much farther skating tlian we can walking the wolves you see cannot catch us on the ice is the river froen all the way down yes all the way to the sea oh i cant wait for you to see this countryside in summer bonnie said as they skated carefully downstream the river is not nearly so full then it is just a shallow rocky stream and we bathe and paddle and the banks are covered with heather and rockrose it is so pretty is it far to the sea oh farfar fifty miles first you come to blast burn which is a hideous town all coal pits and ugly mills papa goes there sometimes on business and then at the sea itself there is rivermouth where papa and mamma will go on board their ship the thessaly bonnie sighed and skated a few yards in silence why she exclaimed suddenly is not that miss slighcarp over there it is not very safe to go walking so near the parks boundary the wolves have more than once been known to get in i wonder if she knows or if we should warn her joan aiken are you sure it is miss slighcarp said sylvia straining her eyes to study the gray figure walking beside a distant coppice i think it is are you tired sylvia can you man age another halfmile if we continue down the river it will curve round and bring us near to her i think we should remind her about the wolves sylvia protested that she was not at all tired that she could easily skate for another hour two hours if necessary and increasing their speed the children hastened on down the frozen stream the bank soon hid miss slighcarp from their sight it is very imprudent of her bonnie commented i suppose coming from london she does not real ize about the wolves sylvia secretly began to be a little anxious they seemed to have come a very long way the house was nearly out of sight across the rolling parkland and when they rounded the curve of the river they saw that miss sughcarp had cut across another ridge and was almost as far from them as ever sylvias legs and back unused to this form of exercise began to feel tired and to ache but she valiantly strove to keep up with the sturdier bonnie just round this next bend bonnie encouraged her and then we must meet her if not i do not know what we can dowe shall have reached the park boundary and moreover the river runs into woods here and the ice is treacherous and full of broken branches they passed the bend and saw a figurebut not the figure they expected a stout woman in a red velvet jacket was walking away from them briskly into the wolves of willoughby chase the wood she was not miss slighcarp nor in the least like her it isnt she exclaimed sylvia at the sound of her voice the woman swung round sharply and seemed to give them an angry look then she hurried on into the wood and disappeared a moment later they heard the sound of horses hoofs and the rumbling of carriage wheels j how peculiar can we have been mistaken but t no we could not have confused a gray dress with a red one sylvia said bonnie was frowning i do not understand it what can a strange woman in a carriage have been doing in our woods the road runs through there x but it goes nowhere save to the house a perhaps when we get back we shall find her per haps she is a neighbor come calling sylvia sug igested bonnie shook her head there are no neighbors then she seized sylvias arm look there is miss slighcarp sure enough the gray figure they had first observed was now to be seen far away behind them walking swiftly in the direction of the house i she must have turned back when we were between the high banks bonnie said repentantly and i have brought you so far poor sylvia i am afraid that you are dreadfully tired nonsense sylvia said stoutly we had to come land i shall manage very well i but she was really wellnigh exhausted and could not help skating more and more slowly bonnie bit her lip and looked anxious the sky was becoming overcast with the promise of more snow and worse pt would not be long until dusk joan aiken i have done very wrong bonnie said remorse fully i should have made you turn back and come on myself i should not have let you a sudden wind got up and sent loose snow from the banks in a scurry across the gray ice one or two large flakes fell from the sky can you go a little faster bonnie could not con ceal the anxiety in her tone try sylvia sylvia exerted herself valiantly but she was really so tired that she could hardly force her limbs to obey her i am so stupidi she said halflaughing halfcry ing suppose i sit here on the bank bonnie while you go home for assistance bonnie looked as it she were halfconsidering this proposal when a low moaning sound rose in the dis tance a sound familiar to bonnie and since yes terday full of terrible significance for sylvia it was the faroff cry of wolves no that is not to be thought of bonnie said decisively i have a better plan we must take off our skates can you manage make haste then they sat on a clump of rush by the rivers edge and with chilled fingers tugged at the knots in their bootlaces sylvia shivered as once again the wolf cry stole over the frozen parkland it had been bad enough heard from the train but now when there was nothing between them and those pitiless legions how dread it sounded the children stood up slinging their skates round their necks now we must climb this little hill bonnie said the wolves of willoughby chase here ill take your hand can you run famous sylvia you are the bravest creature in the world and when we get home i shall give you my little ivory workbox to show how sorry i am for having led you into such a scrape sylvia did her best to smile at her cousin having no breath to answer and tried to stifle all doubts that they ever would get home arrived at the top of the hill bonnie stood still and as it seemed to sylvia wasted precious moments while she glanced keenly about her through the rap idly thickening snowstorm ah she cried presently the temple of hermes we must go this way she tugged sylvia at a run down the slope and across a wide intervening stretch of open ground toward a little pillared pavilion that stood on an artificial knoll against some dark trees they had now put the river between them and the cry of the wolves which was comforting but sylvia was dismayed to see that bonnie was once more lead ing her away from the house where are we going bonnie she panted fight ing bravely to keep up i have a friend who lives in the woods bonnie returned i only hope he is not away let us rest a moment here they stood struggling to get their breath in the temple of hermes which was no more than a roof supported on slender columns oh bonnie look look sylvia cried in uncon trollable alarm pointing back the way they had come through the dusk they could just distinguish two small black dots at the top of the slope which joan aiken were soon joined by several others after a moment all these dots began coursing swiftly down the hill side in their direction there is not a moment to be lost bonnie said urgently make haste make haste halfleading halfsupporting the exhausted sylvia she urged her on through the deepening wood here bonnie seemed to know her way almost by instinct she passed from tree to tree scanning them apparently for signs in visible to her cousin here we are she exclaimed in a tone of unutter able thankfulness and to sylvias astonishment she put her fingers to her lips and gave vent to a long clear whistle more surprising still she was instantly answered by another whistle which seemed to come from the very ground beneath their feet a clear ringing voice called here miss bonniel here quick sylvia found a lithe brighteyed boy beside her helping her on taller than bonnie he was dressed entirely in skins he wore a fur cap carried a bow and hail a sheaf of arrows slung over his shoulder as the first of the wolf pack found their track in the temple of hermes and came raging after along the clear scent the boy turned fitted an arrow to his bow and sent it unerringly into the midst of the pursuers one wolf fell and his companions imme diately hurled themselves upon him with starving fe rocity that gives us a breathing space the boy ex claimed inside miss bonniel dont lose a moment with bonnie tugging at her hand and the boy guarding the rear threatening the wolves with his bow sylvia found herself whisked down a long nar the wolves of willoughby chase row path or passageway snowlined at first then floored with dead leaves it was dark she was in a cave and more curious still she could feel a num ber of live creatures pushing against her legs almost overbalancing her they were soft and smooth and she could hear an angry hissing coming from them which almost drowned the clamor of the wolves out side she would have cried out in fright if she had had any breath leftand then she and bonnie round ed a corner in the passage and saw before them the comfortable glow of a fire burning on a sandy hearth heapedup piles of ferns and dead leaves covered with furs lay against the cave walls and on these bonnie and sylvia flung themselves for even bonnie could now acknowledge that she was nearly fainting from weariness there said the boy following them in ive shut the gate theyll not catch you this time but what was you doing miss bonnie so far from the house on a night like this its not like you to take such a foolish risk as bonnie began explaining how it had come about sylvia was amazed to see a number oј large white geese waddle after the boy into the cave they looked rather threateningly out of their flat black beady eyes at sylvia and bonnie one or two of them thrust out their necks and hissed but the boy waved them back into the passage and flung them a handful of corn to keep them quiet lulled by the flickering firelight and the long white necks weaving up and down in the entrance as the geese pecked their corn sylvia who was half stupefied by exhaustion fell fast asleep joan aiken when she awoke it was to the sound of voices bonnie was saying anxiously but simon we cannot stay here all night my dear pattern will be so worried she will be certain the wplves have got us and miss slighcarp too will be concerned perhaps they have already sent the men out searching for us ill have a look in a moment the boy returned now if youll wake your cousin miss the cakes are ready and youll both feel better on full stomachs than empty he spoke with a pleasant country burr sylvia ly ing drowsy on her heap of leaves thought that his voice had a comfortable brown furry sound to it sylvial wake up bonnie said heres simon made us some delicious cakes and it you are like me you are ravenous with hunger indeed i am rubbing her eyes and smiling sylvia brushed off the leaves and sat up the boy had separated the fire into two glowing hillocks from between these he now pulled a flat stone on which were baking a number of little cakes the two children ate them hungrily as soon as they were cool enough to hold they were brown on the outside white and floury within and sweet to the taste your cakes are splendid simon bonnie said how do you make them from chestnut flour miss bonnie i gather up the chestnuts in the autumn and pound them to flour between two stones while they were eating he went along the entrance passage in a minute he came back to say wolves the wolves of willonghby chase have gone and its a fine sharp night all spiky with stars no signs of men out searching miss bonnie its my belief wed best be off now while the ways clear do you think you can walk as far as the house now miss sylvia oh yes yes i feel perfectly rested declared syl via but she was obliged to acknowledge when she stood up that she still found herself stiff and tired and would be unable to keep up a very fast pace i have badly overtaxed your strength this first day exclaimed bonnie selfreproachfully still if you can walk sylvia i think we should be off now and save our poor pattern some hours of dreadful worry certainly i can walk sylvia said stoutly let us start at once though inwardly her heart quailed somewhat at the thought of the wolves very likely still in the neighborhood a moment before we start the boy simon dug in shallow sand at the side of tlie cave and brought out a large leather bottle and a horn drinking cup he gave the girls each a small drink from the bottle it was strong heady stuff tasting of honey that will hearten you for the walk he said what is it simon metheglin miss i make it in the summer from the heather honey he picked up his bow and flung a few logs on the fire the children resumed their furs which they had taken off at their first entry into the warm cave i do love your home simon bonnie exclaimed i hate to leave it you miss he said grinning with your grand joan aiken house and a different room for each day in the year well yes of course i love that too but this is so snugl simon quieted the geese who raised their necks and hissed as the children passed them i wish i had another weapon to defend you with he muttered one bow is hardly sufficient for three i will cut you a cudgel when we are outside miss bonnie i know simon bonnie cried my old fowling piece that i left here that rainy day last autumn i have never thought of it since have you it still of course i have he said his face lighting up and carefully oiled too with neatsfoot oil it is in good order miss bonnie i am glad you reminded me of itwhat a fool i was not to think of it be fore i he took it down from where it hung on the pas sage wall in a leather sack bonnie somewhat to her cousins alarm and amazement handled the gun con fidently and soon satisfied herself of its being in ex cellent order and ready to fire now let us be off she said gaily i can keep the villains at a distance with this they went out into the clear sparkling night the new snow which had obliterated both their footprints and those of the wolves made a crisp carpet beneath their feet bonnie and simon kept a vigilant lookout for wolves and sylvia did too though secretly she felt she was almost less afraid of the wolves than of her cousin bonnies gun however there was no oc casion to use the fowling piece as the wolves ap peared to have left that region for the moment drawn away doubtless by some new quarry the wolves of willovghby chase their journey back to the house was quiet and un interrupted it is strange remarked bonnie in a puzzled voice that we do not see men out everywhere with lan terns searching for us why the time i was late back from picking wild strawberries my father had every man on the estate out with pitchforks and muskets aye said simon but your fathers from home now isnt he miss bonnie yes he is answered bonnie sighing i suppose that is the reason and she fell into rather a sad silence when they reached the great terrace bonnie sug gested that they should go in by a side entrance and thus avoid informing miss slighcarp of their return for it is possible that pattern fearing her anger has left her in ignorance that we were out she sug gested thoughtfully i believe pattern is a little frightened of miss slighcarp i am sure am sylvia agreed there is some thing so cold and glittering about her eyes and then her voice is so disagreeable i dare say that is the reason bonnie as they passed a large lighted window bonnie murmured that is the great library sylvia where my father keeps all his books and papers i will show you over it tomorrow why what a curious thing she exclaimed for glancing in as they walked by they saw miss slighcarp under the illumination of numerous candles apparently hard at work search ing through a mass of papers there were papers on chairs on tables on the floor beyond her at the far end of the room similarly engaged was a gentleman who looked amazingly like mr grimshaw could it joan aiken be he but at the slight noise made by their feet on the snow miss slighcarp turned she could not see the watchers who were beyond the lighted area near the window but she crossed with a decisive step and flungto the heavy velvet curtains shutting off the scene within what can she be doing bonnie exclaimed and was not that mr grimshaw dr morne said he should not get out of bedl perhaps she is familiarizing herself with the con tents of your fathers papers sylvia suggested did you not say she was to look after the estate and i am not sure that was mr grimshaw we had hardly time to see arrived at the little postern door they had scarcely knocked before it was flung open and pattern had enveloped them in her arms oh you naughty naughty precious children how could you how could you heres my poor heart been nearly broke in half with fright at think ing you was eaten by the wolves and miss slighcarp saying no such thing youd come home soon and me saying begging your pardon miss but you dont know this park and these wolves as i do and beg ging begging her to tell the men and sound the alarm but no my lady knows best whats to be done and its my belief nothing ever would have been done till we found some boots and buttons of you in the snow and the rest all ate up by wolves if you hadnt come home all by yourselves you good wicked pre cious naughty lambsoa and the faithful pattern relieved herself by a burst of tears not by ourselves pattern said bonnie hugging her tiglitly simon brought us home we were chased the wolves of willovghby chase by wolvesthough it wasnt exactly our faultand he hid us in his cave till they were gone never will i hear a word said against that boy some say hes a wicked vagabond gypsy but i say hes the besthearted trustiest ask him in miss bonnie and ill give him tlie christmas pudding that was too big to go in my ladys valise but the silent simon overwhelmed perhaps by patterns flow of words had melted away into the night without waiting to be thanked will he be all right breathed sylvia bigeyed with horror wont the wolves get him on the way home i dont believe they could ever catch him bonnie reassured her he can run so fist besides he has ins bow and then too he can climb trees and swing from branch to branch if they get near him never mind about him nothing ever hurts simon bustled pattern halfpushing halfpulling them up the little back stairs come on with you now till i get a posset inside you cold in spite of their furs the children were glad to be sat down before a glowing fire in the night nursery white pattern scolded and clucked and brushed the tangles out of their hair brought in with her own hands the big silver bathtub filled with steaming water in which bunches of lemon mint had been steeped giving a deliciously fragrant scent and bathed them each in turn afterward wrapping them in voluminous warm white hiinnel gowns next slie fetched little pipkins of hot savory soup sternly saw every mouthful swallowed and finally hustled them both into bonnies big comfortable bed with the blue swans flying on its curtains joan aiken for if theres any nightmares about wolves at least that way youll be able to comfort each other she muttered and as for miss slighcarp let her rest in uncertainty till the morning for im not going to her again coming home soon indeedl as it such a thing were likely and off she tiptoed leaving a rosescented night light burning and the peaceful crackle of the fire to lull them to sleep five the next morning dawned gray and lowering snow was falling fast out of the heavy sky the flakes hurry ing down iike dirty feathers from a leaking mattress pattern let the children sleep late and though when they woke she cosseted them by giving them breakfast in front of the nursery fire it was not a happy meal sylvia felt stiff and tired from her unusual exertions the itay before while poor bonnie was thinking every minute of her parents absence wondering how they had fared on their journey so far noticing the sad unaccustomed quietness of the house which was gen erally filled with bustleservants running to and fro stamp of horses and her father shouting his orders because he was too impatient to ring the bell sylvia kindly tried to distract her by asking ques tions about simon the boy in the woods has he always lived in that cave bonnie ie seems so strangel has he no father or mother bonnie shook her head none that he knows of he came to my father four or five years ago one autumn day and asked if he might live in that cave in the park he said that he had been working tor a farmer but the man illtreated him and he had walked half across england to get away from him joan aiken my father asked what he proposed to live on he said chestnuts and goose eggs he had a goose and a gander that he had reared from chicks papa took a fancy to him and told him that he might try it there are hundreds of chestnut trees in the park but he said simon wasnt to come whining to him if he got hungry hed have to turn to and work for his living as a garden boy and did he work as a garden boy no he lived on chestnuts and reared a great many geese mrs shubunkin buys eggs from him and every spring simon drives his geese up to london and sells them at the easter fair he gets on famously father often says he wishes he had as few worries bonnie sighed i wonder if he will always continue to live in the cave sylvia was beginning when pattern came in to clear away the breakfast things now then miss bonnie and miss sylvia nearly lesson time my dearies so make haste and get dressed they had been breakfasting in warm wad ded satin dressing gowns this is not my frock pattern said sylvia look ing admiringly at the clothes the maid had brought her there was a soft thick woolen dress in a beau tiful deep shade of blue that exactly matched her eyes it is a great deal prettier than anything of mine its one i ran up for you yesterday miss sylvia pattern said kindly my lady green bless her good heart thought you might be needing some warmer dresses for the country but didnt like to have any thing made for you until she knew what colors suited the wolves of willoughby chase you best before she left yesterday she bade me make up one out of this cloth which she had ready with a number of others there she added fastening sylvias dress at the back and turning her round if that doesnt bring out the color of your eyesi and heres some ribbons to match for your hair sylvias eyes none the less filled with tears at the thought that her aunt so ill and griefstricken at the idea of parting from her home could still spare time for such thoughtfulness come along said bonnie who meanwhile had been hurriedly putting on a darkred cashmere with a white lace collar we shall be late for our lessons the two children ran to the schoolroom while pat tern carefully folded and put away sylvias white dress miss slighcarp had not yet arrived and the chil dren beguiled the time by wandering round the room and looking at the many beautiful pictures that hung on its walls then as the governess still did not ap pear bonnie took sylvia through a door leading out of the schoolroom into her toyroom this was a large and beautiful apartment carpeted in blue its walls white its ceiling allasparkle with gilt stars in it was every imaginable toy and many that sylvia never had imagined even in her most wistful dreams occupying the place of honor in the middle of the floor was a stately rocking horse cov ered with real gray horsehair and so cunningly carved that he seemed alive his crystal eyes shone with in telligence thats dolphus said bonnie giving him a care less hug as she passed then those are all the dolls joan atken in that row of little chairs the largest is miranda the smallest at this end is con chita sylvias hand curled lovingly round annabelle hid den in her pocket but she resolved not to introduce her to this galaxy of beauties until the kind pattern had accomplished her promise and made a new dress tor her from a leftover piece of the blue material then sylvia thought annabelle would be quite pre sentable and some of the smaller dolls did not look at all proud this is the dolls house bonnie said grown ups arent allowed inside but you can come in of course sylvia whenever you like the dolls house large enough to get into was a cottage with real thatch and real canaries nesting in it there was a balcony stairs two stories a cooking stove that really worked and a lot of genu ine queen anne furniture including a beautiful wal nut chest full of queen anne clothes that fitted the children sylvia was trying a blue velvet cloak against her and bonnie was saying come and look at the other toys you havent seen half yet when they werp interrupted by a cough from the schoolroom and hurriedly bundled the clothes back into the chest ill show you the rest this afternoon whispered bonnie waving her hand toward a large cupboard in the wall with double glass doors sylvia had a tan talizing glimpse of numerous variously shaped bright ly colored toys on its shelves as they ran back into the schoolroom im so sorry we were not in the room to welcome you miss slighcarp bonnie began in her impulsive the wolves of willoughby chase way and then she stopped abruptly sylvia noticed her turn extremely pale the governess who had been examining some books on the shelves swung round with equal abrupt ness she seemed astonished to see them where have you been she demanded angrily after an instants pause why sylvia faltered merely in the next room miss slighcarp but bonnie with choking utterance demanded why are you wearing my mothers dress sylvia had observed that miss slighcarp had on a draped gown of old gold velvet with ruby buttons far grander than the gray twill she had worn the day before dont speak to me in that way miss retorted miss slighcarp in a rage you have been spoiled all your life but we shall soon see who is going to be mistress now go to your place and sit down do not speak until you are spoken to bonnie paid not the slightest attention who said you could wear my mothers best gown she repeated sylvia alarmed had slipped into her place at the table but bonnie reckless with indignation stood in front of the governess glaring at her everything in this house was left entirely to my personal disposition miss slighcarp said coldly but not her clothesi not to wearl how dare you take it off at oncel its no better than stealing two white dents had appeared on either side of miss slighcarps nostrils another word and its the dark cupboard and breadandwater for you miss she said fiercely joan aiken i dont care what you say bonnie stamped her foot take off my mothers dress miss slighcarp boxed bonnies ears bonnie seized miss slighcarps wrists in the confusion a bottle of ink was knocked off the table spilling a long blue trail down the gold velvet skirt miss slighcarp ut tered an exclamation of fury insolent ungovernable childl you shall suffer for this with iron strength she thrust bonnie into a closet containing crayons globes and exercise books and turned the key on her then she swept from the room sylvia remained seated aghast for halt a second then she ran to the cupboard doorbut alasi miss slighcarp had taken the key with her bonnie bonniel are you all right its i sylvia she could hear bitter sobs dont cry bonnie please dont cry ill run after her and beg her to let you out i dare say she will once she has reflected she cant have known it was your mothers favorite gown bonnie seemed not to have heard her mamma mammal sylvia could hear her sobbing oh why did you have to go away how sylvia longed to be able to batter down the cupboard door and get her arms round poor bonniet but the door was thick and massive with a strong lock quite beyond her power to move since she could not attract bonnies attention she ran after miss slighcarp after vainly knocking at the governesss bedroom door she went in without waiting for a summons a deed of exceptional bravery for the timid sylvia nobody was there the inkstained velvet dress lay the wolves of willoughby chase flung carelessly on the floor crushed and torn so great had miss slighcarps haste been to remove it sylvia hurried out again and began to search through the huge house wandering up this passage and down that through galleries into golden draw ing rooms satinhung boudoirs billiard rooms ball rooms croquet rooms at last she found the gover ness in the great hall surrounded by servants miss slighcarp did not see sylvia she had changed into what was very plainly another of lady greens gowns a rosecolored crepe with aiguillettes of dia monds on the shoulders it did not fit her very ex actly she seemed to be giving the servants their wages sylvia wondered why many of the maids were crying and why the men looked in general angry and rebel lious until she realized that miss slighcarp was pay ing them off and dismissing them when the last one had been given his little packet of money she an nounced now let but a glimpse of your faces be seen with in ten miles of this house and i shall send for the constables then she added to a man who stood beside her ridiculous quite ridiculous to keep such a large establishment of idle goodfornothings kicking their heels eating their heads off just so maam just so he assented sylvia was amazed to recognize mr grimshaw apparently quite restored to health and in full possession of his fac ulties he held a small blunderbuss and was waving it threateningly to urge the departing servants out of the great doors and on their way into the snow storm what a strange thing thought sylvia in aston joan aiken ishment can he be recovered or was he never really ill can he have known miss slighcarp before he seemed so different on the train at that moment she heard a familiar voice beside her in the rapidly thinning crowd of servants and found pattern at her elbow miss sylvia dear thank the good lord i saw you that wicked jezebel is paying us all off and sending us away but she neednt think im going to go and leave my darling miss bonnie do you and she come along to the little blue powder room miss sylvia this afternoon at five and well talk over whats best to be done but bonnie cant shes locked upl gasped sylvia in the schoolroom cupboardi she never has oh what wouldnt i give to get my hands round that shedevils throat muttered pattern thats because she knew miss bonnie would never stand tamely by and let her fathers old ser vants be packed off into the snow let her out miss sylvia i let her out of it quick she never could en dure to be shut up but i cantl miss slighcarp has the key theres anotherin the little motherofpearl cab inet in the anteroom where the javelins hang sylvia did not wait she remembered how to find her way to the little anteroom and she flew on winged feet to the motherofpearl cabinet she found the key ran to the schoolroom opened the door and in no time had her cheek pressed lovingly against bonnies tearstained one oh you poor precious oh bonnie shes wicked miss slighcarps really wickedl shes dismissing all the servants the wolves of willoughby chase what bonnie was distracted from her own grief and indignation by the tale sylvia poured out let us go at once she exclaimed at once and stop it but when they passed the big schoolroom window they saw the lonely procession of servants far away toiling across a snowcovered ridge in the park we are too late said sylvia in despair bonnie gazed after the tiny distant figures biting her lips is pattern gone too she asked turning to sylvia i believe not i believe she means to hide some where about the house sylvia old bonnie of pat terns wish to meet them that afternoon oh she is good she is faithfull exclaimed bon nie but will it not be very dangerous tor her sylvia said doubtfully miss slighcarp threatened to send for the constables if she saw any of the servants near the house she might have pattern sent to prison i do not believe pattern would let herself be caughc there are so many secret hiding places about tlie house and in any case all the officers are our friends round here at that moment the children were startled by the sound of approaching voices one of them was miss slighcarps sylvia turned pale she must not find you out of the cupboard hide quickly bonnie slie relocked the cupboard door and pocketed the key as there was no time to lose the two children slipped behind the window curtain miss slighcarp entered with the footman james as i have done you the favor of keeping you on when all the others were dismissed sirrah she was joan aiken saying you will have to work for your wages as never before the blue velvet curtains behind which the chil dren stood were pounced all over with tiny crystal disks encircled with seed pearls the little disks formed miniature windows and setting her eye to one bonnie could see that jamess goodnatured face wore a sullen expression which he was attempting to twist into an evil leer first you must take out and crate all these toys put them into packing cases they are to be sent away and sold it is quite ridiculous to keep this amount of gaudy rubbish for the amusement of two children yes maam at dinnertime bring some breadandwater on a tray for miss green who is locked up in that cup board shall i let her out maam certainly not she is a badly behaved illcondi tioned child and must be disciplined she may be let out this evening at halfpast eight here is the key the other child miss sylvia green may lunch in the schoolroom as usual plain food mind nothing fancy from now on the children are to make their own beds sweep their own rooms and wash their own plates and clothes yes maam after dinner i wish you to see to the grooming of the horses and ponies they are all to be sold save four carriage horses the childrens ponies as well maam certainlyl i shall find more suitable occupations the wolves of willoughby chase for the children than such idle and extravagant pur suits now i am going to be busy in the estate room you may bring me a light luncheon at one oclock chicken oyster patties trifle and a half bottle of champagne she swept out of the room the moment she had gone james went quickly to the closet and unlocked it saying in a low voice shes gone now miss bon nie you can come out he seemed greatly astonished to find the cupboard empty but next minute the children ran out from behind the curtain james jamest cried bonnie what does it all mean how dare she sell my toys and papas horses what is she doing it for why shes wickedl sylvia exclaimed indignantly shes a fiendl youre right miss shes a thorough wrong un said james gloomily when he had got over the sur prise of bonnies not being in the cupboard after all how your pa came to be so deceived in her ill never know but he had never met her it was arranged that she should come here to look after us by his lawyer in london mr gripe and after all she is a rela tive ah i see said james scratching his head even so its a puzzle to me why sir willoughby didnt rumble her when he saw her one look at her face would be enough to show the sort she is youd think but i suppose he was worried over her ladyship but james why is she dismissing the servants and why has she kept you on why miss i suppose she means to make hay while joan aiken the sun shinessave the servants wages and pop as much of your pas money into her own pocket as she can while hes away then before he comes back i suppose shell be off shes kept on three or four ser vants just to look after her like the worst of it is shes kept on all the untrustworthy ones groach the keeper and marl the steward that sir willoughby was giving another chance to after he was caught pil fering and prout the undergroom that drinksi dare say she liked the looks of their knavish faces i saw how it was going so i tried to make myself look as hangdog and sullen as i could and the trick worked she kept me on too i couldnt abear to think of you miss bonnie and miss sylvia being left all alone in the house with that harpy and such a pack of thieves poor pattern had to go in a mighty taking she was but she hasnt gone far bonnie told him and explained about the scheme to meet in the little blue powder room jamess face broke into a slow grin i might ha known she wouldnt be driven off so easily he said well well have a proper old coun cil then and decide what to do in the meantime id better be getting on with packing up these things miss bonnie or i shall lose my place and not be able to help you pack up my toys but you cant exclaimed bon nie in grief and horror looking at her treasured things couldnt you hide them away in one of the attics cant be miss bonnie dear shes going to go through em when theyre in the boxes i could save out a few though i dare say james said pityingly halfdistracted bonnie looked among her toys try the wolves of willoughby chase ing to decide which she could bear to part with dolphus must go for he would be missed and so must the dolls house and the bigger dolls but she saved concliita lier favorite and in ivory paint box as big as a tea tray and the skates and some of the beautiful clothes from the dolls house while sylvia mournfully sorted out the most interestinglooking and beautifully illustrated books from a large book case oh and i must keep my little writing desk james for i mem to write to papa this very day and tell him how wicked miss slighcarp is then hell soon come home ill put the desk in the attic for you miss prom ised james but its no use writing to your papa rather write to mr gripe why james why your papas at sea now his ship wont reach a port for three months oh dearnor it will said bonnie sadly and i dont know mr gripes address in london what shall i do for we cant cant endure this dreadful ness for three monthsand then it would be another three months before papa could come home even supposing mamma was well again just then they heard miss slighcarps step approach ing once more and her voice calling james come here i need your help to move a heavy deed box i must go miss whispered james hurriedly dont let yourself be seen ill bring your luncheon up by and by he hastened from the room the day passed unhappily as bonnie was supposed to be shut in the cupboard she could not leave the joan aiken schoolroom tor fear of meeting miss slighcarp and sylvia would go nowhere without her they tried various occupations reading sewing drawing but had not the heart to pursue them for long at noon they heard miss slighcarps voice in the passage out side bonnie whisked behind the curtain but the gov erness did not come in she was speaking to james again is that the young ladies luncheon this is the breadandwater for miss green maam he answered respectfully ill fetch miss sylvias tray when ive taken this in shes not to come out of the cupboard to eat it mind no maam he appeared grinning broadly planked a drylook ing loaf and a jug of water on the table and then whispered dont touch it miss bonnie just as soon as the old cats out of the way ill bring some thing betteri and sure enough ten minutes later he returned carrying a tray covered with a cloth which when taken off revealed two dear little roast partridges with bread sauce red currant jelly and vegetables youll not starve while im here to see after you he whispered the children ate hungrily and later james came back with a dish of tribe and took away the meat dishes carefully covering them again with the cloth before venturing into the corridor i wish i knew where the secret passage came out he murmured person the old steward always used to say there was a sliding panel in this room and a passage that led down to the dairy with that she the wolves of willoughby chase dragon on the prowl it would be rare and useful to have a secret way into here you might have a bit of a search for it miss bonnie well begin at once exclaimed bonnie it will be something to pass the time the moment james had taken away the pudding plates they began testing the walls tor hidden springs you start by the door sylvia and ill begin at the fireplace and well each do two sides of the room bonnie suggested it was a big room its walls covered in white linen told paneling decorated with carved garlands of roses palmed blue the children carefully pushed pulled and pressed each wooden rose without result an hour two hours went by and they were becoming dis heartened and beginning to feel that the story of the secret passage must have been merely an idle tale when sylvia suggested we havent tried the fireplace bonnie do you suppose it possible that part of the mantelpiece should be false clever girl said bonnie giving her a hug let us try it at once the mantel was large and beautifully carved from some foreign stone and a gray satiny surface it ex tended for several feet on either side of the fireplace to form two wide panels on which were carved deer with elaborately branching antlers the children ran to these and began fingering the antlers and trying to move them suddenly sylvia gave an exclamation as she pushed the deers head to one side the whole panel slid away into the wall leaving a dark aperture like a low narrow doorway youve found iti breathed bonnie oh what fun joan aiken this is let us go m at once and see where it leads sylvia you are the cleverest creature in the world and i do not know what i should have done if you had not been here eo keep me company i could not have home iti she was about to dart into the hole when the more prudent sylvia said should we not take lighted can dles i have heard that the air in this kind of disused passage is sometimes very foul and will put out a flame if we had candles we shouldbe warned in time very true i did not think bonnie ran to a cup board which held wax tapers in long silver holders and brought two each which they kindled at the fire then they slipped cautiously through the narrow opening bonnie leading the way we had better shut the panel behind us she said only imagine if miss slighcarp should come into the schoolroom and find it open what if we cannot open it again from the inside perhaps it will be possible to leave just a crack unfortunately the panel proved to be on some sort of spring as soon as sylvia touched it it rolled smoothly shut a small plaster knob seemed intended to open it from the inside but when bonnie rather impatiently pressed this it crumbled away in her hand how vexatious she said sylvia was alarmed at the thought that they might have immured themselves tor life but bonnie whis pered stoutly never mindl the passage must come out some where and it we are shut up at least it is no worse than being shut up by miss slighcarp the wolves of willoughby chase they tiptoed along through thick shuffling dust the passage was exceedingly narrow and presently led them down a flight of steep steps it was not pitch dark here and there a tiny hole let in a glimmer of daylight and placing her eye to these holes bonnie was able to discover their whereabouts now we are behind the great hall i can see the coats of arms this is the silvergilt anteroom now we are looking into the armory those are gunbarrels imagine this passage having been here all this time and my never knowing of it oh how i wish papa and mamma were at homel what famous times we should have jumping out and surprising them and we should discover a whole lot of secrets by over hearing peoples private conversations would that be honorable sylvia doubtfully whis pered perhaps not with papa and mamma but it would be quite another matter with miss slighcarp i mean to listen to her all i cani they soon had an opportunity to do so for the next peephole looked into the library and when bon nie put her eye to it she saw the governess in close consultation with mr grimshaw they were at the far end of the large room and at first out of earshot but they soon moved nearer to the unseen watchers poke up the fire josiah said miss slighcarp who was studying a large parchment this must be burned at once now that we have succeeded in find ing it the children heard mr grimshaw stirring up the logs and realizing that they must be standing be side the fireplace and that their spyhole was prob ably concealed in the chimneypiece it was possible that there was another opening panel similar to that joan aiken in the schoolroom but they were careful not to try pressing any projections having no wish to be brought suddenly face to face with their enemies take the bellows and blow it into a blaze miss slighcarp said she was reading the document care fully what a good thing sir willoughby was care less enough to leave his will at home instead of keep ing it with mr gripe it has saved us a deal oј trouble indeed yes said mr grimshaw comfortably and is it as you thoughtdoes he leave everything to the child almost everything said miss slighcarp she read on with compressed lips there is a legacy of twenty thousand pounds a year to his niece a few hundred to me in gratitude for my servicespahand some trifling bequests to servants mention too of his sis ter jane my distant cousin is she likely to come poking her nose and being troublesome not a fear of it mr grimshaw answered i made inquiries about her when i was in london she is extremely elderly and unworldly moreover she is frail and unlikely to last long she will never inter fere with our management of the estate excellent i wih burn this will thenthere on the fire it goesand you must set to work at once to forge another leaving everything to me have you practiced the signature sufficiently i could do it with my left hand mr grimshaw said i have copied it from every document in this room he drew a chair to a table at a little dis tance pulled a piece of parchment toward him and began slowly and carefully writing on it miss slighcarp meanwhile was tearing up and the wolves of willoughby chase burning a great many other documents the more confusion his affairs are found to be in the better she observed it will give us the more time to make our plans you sound very certain that hethat the event will take place suppose he should after all return my dear josiah said miss slighcarp meaning fully the master to whom i spoke was very certain about the state of the vessel he said she could not last another voyage but even if that plan should miscarry what then sir w cannot be back before a year is up we shall have ample warning of his return and can be clear away and embarked for the colonies before he arrives we shall never be caught what of the children you will not keep them here not for long they can go to gertrude said miss slighcarp ominously she will soon knock the non sense out of them now do not disturb me i must master the details of this deed she picked up an other document and began studying it absorbedly the children tiptoed on bonnie said sylvia rather fearfully after a few moments when she judged that they were well out of earshot of the library and its inmates what did miss slighcarp mean when she referred to the event and why was she burning my uncles will i am not certain confessed bonnie who was pale and frowning over this new evidence of miss sligh carps knavery but it is plain that she means noth ing but wickedness sylvia glanced in a troubled way at her cousin it was evident that bonnie did not wish to pursue the matter and they went on in silence for a while they joan aiken came to another spyhole which looked on to a pas sage and then they found themselves up against a blank wall the secret corridor appeared to have come to a dead end even bonnies heart sank for the candles were peri lously low when they heard the ciink of dishes and a familiar voice that of james broke into song so close beside them that they might have been touching him as i was a walking one morning for pleasure i spied a young knock on the walll bonnie whispered to sylvia and both children began banging on the panel as hard as they could the song broke off abruptly jamesi jamesi its us in here behind the panell can you let us out laws miss you gave me a fright jamess voice said i thought it was the hobgoblin for sure they heard him tumbling on the wall and tapped again to show him where they were suddenly there came a click and bright cold light and icy air rushed into their hiding place i always wondered why that great knob was there on the wall james said well laws miss to think of your really finding the secret passage thats cham pion that is they stepped out and found themselves in the dairy a brickfloored slateshelved room with several sinks where some of the dishwashing was done an outside door led from it to the stable yard and they could see the whiteness of the newfallen snow since this entrance too appeared to have no means the wolves of willoughby chase of opening it from the inside james arranged to leave it open artfully moving a tall cupboard so that it partly obscured the doorway and hanging a quan tity of horse blankets and other draperies to hide the remainder now at least no one need get shut up inside said bonnie the bother of it is that we can do nothing of the sort in the schoolroom it would look too queer the person in the passage will simply have to knock on the panel until somebody in the room lets them out but supposing it was miss slighcarp in the room goosel of course we should have to make sure before knocking that she was not in the room i dare say there is a spyhole do you go back along the passage now and look suggested sylvia and i will return to the schoolroom by the back stairs and let you out this was agreed to and sylvia hastened away glancing as she passed the open door at the stable clock to make sure that they would not be late for their meeting with pattern but it still lacked half an hour of five oclock the time appointed for the meet ing most unfortunately as she neared the schoolroom door she saw the gaunt bony form of miss slighcarp approaching from the other direction carrying in her arms a pile of linen sylvia was greatly alarmed when the governess swept before her into the schoolroom and deposited her burden on the table what if bon nie not realizing that the governess was in the room should have the imprudence to knock on the panel and ask to be let out of the secret passage now miss said miss slighcarp coldlysince the joan aiken departure of her employers she had made no slightest pretense oј being pleasant to either of the two chil drensince i am at present too busy to occupy my self with teaching you i have brought you a task so you shant be idle all these sheets and pillowcases require mending to work at once pleasel if they are not finished by tomorrow you will come under my severe displeasure small stitches mind yes maam said sylvia trembling trying to keep her eyes from wandering toward the fireplace i have a good mind to set that insolent child in the cupboard to this work too miss slighcarp muttered she moved to the cupboard door feeling in the reticule attached to the sash of her dress sylvia gasped with fright how very provokingi i gave the key to james sylvia let out a long quiver ing breath oј relief miss greeni the governess said rapping on the door of the cupboard i trust you are repenting of your outrageous behavior there was no reply from within the cupboard spirit not broken yet miss slighcarp moved away from the door well it will be breadandwater tor you until it is on thinking the matter over the light in that cupboard would not be sufficient to permit her to mend the linen this was no more than the truth sylvia reflected tor it must be pitch dark inside the cupboard just as miss slighcarp was about to leave the schoolroom a loud unmistakable rap sounded from inside the fireplace sylvia pale with fright sprang to the fender and began rattling the poker and tongs noisily pretending to poke up the fire and put a few more pieces of coal on it the governess paused sus piciously the wolves of willoughby chase what was that noise noise maam said sylvia innocently something that sounded like a tap on the wall it was this piece of coal miss slighcarp that fell into the grate sylvia spoke as loudly as she could and rattled the fire irons more than ever miss sligh carp seemed convinced and left after a sharp glance round to make sure that james had obeyed her com mand to pack up all the childrens toys fortunately this had been done the schoolroom and tovroom looked bleak and bare enough with all the gaily col ored games and playthings removed but sylvia com forted herself by recollecting the hidden store up in the attic as soon as miss slighcarp was safely gone sylvia ran to the secret panel and with trembling hands pressed the carved deers head praying that she had remembered the correct prong on the antlersto her unbounded relief the stone panel slid back as before and bonnie black dusty laughing and triumphant fell out into her arms oh is not this fun oh what a narrow squeak i had quite thought you were alone in the room for neither of you had spoken for several moments be fore i tapped is it not provoking there is no spy hole in this room the first one looks out on the upstairs landing but it is possible to hear voices from inside the passage so long as somebody is speaking what a mercy that you were so clever with the poker and tongs sylvia six at five oclock the two children stole cautiously to the little blue powder room which luckily was in a remote wing of the great house where miss sligh carp was not likely to make her way pattern was there already and greeted them with tears and em braces oh miss bonnie miss sylvia my dears whats to become of us thats what i should like to know with that wicked woman in charge of the house we shall be all right said bonnie stoutly she cant do anything very dreadful to us but oh pat tern what about you she will have you sent to prison if she catches you here she wont catch me said pattern confidently i crept in by the appleroom door when the other ser vants left and ive fixed myself up in the little south attic on the fourth floor as snug as you please my fine lady will never set foot up there you may be certain and ill be able to creep down from there and help you with your dressing and put you to bed and look after your things my poor lambsl oh that i should live to see such a wicked dayl but pattern how will you live bonnie was be the wolves of willough by chase ginning when james came quickly and quietly into the room what a lark he said the old cat nearly caught memet me in the long galleryand asked what i was doing i said going to see all the windows were shut for the night and she siid yes thats right we want no thieving servants creeping back under cover of dark thieving id like to know what she thinks she is the children told him patterns plan and he ap proved it heartily for i dont trust miss slighcarp not to starve these young ones or do something underhand if were not there to keep an eye on them he said ill look after their meals miss pattern if you see theyre snug and mended and cared for but miss bonnie dear youd best write off to your papas lawyer the very first thing and tell him whats afoot here but i dont know his address james eh thats awkward said james scratching his head who can you write to then how about aunt jane bonnie suggested to syl via she will surely know mr gripes address for i have heard papa say that mr gripe is in charge of her money yees said sylvia doubtfully but aunt jane is so old and so very frail that i am afraid the news would be a dreadful dreadful shock to her it might make her ill and then she is all on her own no you are right said bonnie decisively it is not to be thought of i know we will write to dr morne he promised that he would come from time to time in any case so there would be nothing odd joan aiken about asking him over and very likely he will know mr gripes direction in london or perhaps he can get the magistrates to commit miss slighcarp to prison said james that is a champion notion of yours miss bonnie do you write the letter and will ride over with it as soon as i get a chance i will wait for a few days suggested bonnie just so that miss slighcarp shant be suspicious and then will pretend to have the toothache a distant bell sounded and james sprang up there the old cat wants me for something and i must run ill be up to the schoolroom by and by with your suppers and he hastened away lett with pattern the children told her how they had discovered the secret passage leading to the schoolroom and she was delighted i can come up that way to dress and undress you and take your things away for washing she said what a mercy of providencel only you must take care never to tap on the panel unless you are sure miss slighcarp is not in the room bonnie said chuckling in any case let us hope it need not be for long dr morne will soon settle her when you tell him whats going on here hark theres the stable clock chiming the hour sylvia said bonnie i believe we should go back to the schoolroom so that presently james can come and let me out of the cupboard it would be terrible if miss slighcarp were to accompany him and find me not there during the next few weeks the children became halfaccustomed to their strange new life they hardly the wolves of willoughby chase saw miss slighcarp and mr grimshaw who were too busy discovering what they could make away with from sir willoughbys property to have time for the children james and pattern cared for them bringing their meals and protecting them from contact with the other servants who were a rough untrustworthy lot several times the secret panel proved exceedingly useful when miss slighcarp approached the school room on her daily visit of inspection and pattern busy performing some service for the children hastily darted through it there was little enough to do they dared not be seen skating and the snowy weather kept them near the house but one day prout the undergroom find ing bonnie crying for her pony in the empty stable whispered to her that he had not sold the ponies only taken them to one of the farms on the estate and that when the weather was better they might go over there and have a ride this news cheered bon nie a good deal to lose her pony feathers and the new one that had been bought for sylvia on top of everything else had been almost more than she could bear at last she decided that she could write to dr morne without incurring suspicion for a whole day she went about with her face tied up in a shawl complaining that it ached and that evening she crept up to the attic where her little desk was hidden and composed a note in her best handwriting with ad vice from sylvia dear doctor will you please come to see us as we dont think papa would like the things that are hap q joan aiken pening here and we cant write to him tor he is on board ship miss slycarp our wicked gov erness has dismissed all the good old servants and is making herself into a tyrant she wears mammas dresses and mr grimshaw is in league with her and they drink champagne every day yours respectfully bonnie green and sylvia green alasi next morning when bonnie gave james this carefully written note a dreadful thing happened james had the note in his hand when he met miss slighcarpwho seemed to have the knack of appear ing always just where she was not wantedand her sharp eyes immediately fastened upon it what is that james miss bonnie has the toothache maam she wrote a note asking dr morne it he would be so kind as to send her a poultice for it i see there is a heavy deed box in the library i want moved james come and attend to it please before you deliver the note unwillingly james followed put that note on the table she said giving mr grimshaw who was in the library a significant look as she did so while james was struggling to put the heavy box exactly where miss slighcarp required it under a confusing rain of contradictory instructions mr grimshaw quickly glanced at the direction on the note and then with his gift for imitating handwrit ing copied the address on to a similar envelope with a blank sheet of paper inside when jamess back the wolves of willoughby chase was turned for an instant he very adroitly exchanged one note for the other there then said miss slighcarp be off with you sirrah and dont loiter on the way or stop to drink porter in the doctors kitchen the instant james was out of the room she opened the letter and her brow darkened as she read it this must be dealt with she muttered i must dispose of these children without delayl and she showed the letter to mr grimshaw artful little minxesi he exclaimed you are right the children cannot be allowed to stay here when can we move them tonight he nodded james hurriedly saddled one of the carriage horses that remained in the stable armed himself with a pair of pistols in the saddle holsters and one stuck in his belt and made off at a gallop for the residence of dr morne who lived some five miles beyond the park boundary unfortunately when he reached his destination it was only to discover that the doctor had been called from home on an urgent casea fire in the town of biastburn in which several people had been injured and was not expected home that evening james dared not linger though he had been intending to reinforce bonnies note by himself telling the doctor how bad things were at the chase he could only deliver the letter and come away leaving a message with the doctors housekeeper imploring dr mome to visit miss bonnie as soon as possible then he made his way homeward a wolf pack picked up his trail and followed him but his horse its hoofs winged joan aiken by fear kept well ahead and james discouraged the pursuit by sending a couple of balls into the midst of the wolves who fell back and decided to look for easier prey the dull dark afternoon passed slowly by the children worked fitfully at their tasks of mending bonnie was no longer locked up but miss slighcarp made it plain that she was still in disgrace never speaking to her and giving her cold and sinister looks the sound of a horses hoofs had drawn both chil dren to the window on one occasion when miss slighcarp came suddenly into the room back to your work young ladies she said an grily whom did you expect to see pray i thoughtthat is we did not expect sylvia faltered it is james returning from his errand sol miss slighcarp gave them again that strange glance and then left them after commenting unfa vorably upon their needlework she returned to the library where she rang for james and gave him or ders that utterly puzzled him the carriage he muttered scratching his head what can she want the carriage tor at such a time dusk and then dark came and bedtime drew near the children had long since abandoned their sewing and were sitting on the hearthrug with arms en twined in a somewhat sorrowful silence gazing at the glowing coals which cast their dim illumination over the bare room it is too late i fear dr morne will never come today bonnie said sighing there was a gentle tap on the secret panel the wolves of willoughby chase patterni it is pattern said sylvia jumping up and she made haste to press the spring pattern came bustling out with a tray on which were two silver bowls of steaming breadandmilk besides little dishes of candied quince and plum heres your supper my iambs now eat that while its hot and ill be warming your beds and night things thank the good providence old patterns here to see you dont go to bed cold and starving when the last spoonful was eaten she hustled them into their warm blue flannel nightgowns and saw them tucked up in bed there my ducksl sweet dreams guard your rest she said and gave each a goodnight hug at this moment they heard miss slighcarps brisk heavy steps coming along the pas sage lawksame gasped pattern she snatched up the tray and was through the secret door in a flash just as it clicked behind her miss slighcarp entered through the other door carrying a lamp in bed already she said she sounded displeased the children lay wondering what fault she could find with such praiseworthy punctuality well you must just get up again she snapped dumping the lamp on the dressing table get up dress yourselves and pack a valise with a change of clothing you are going on a journey a journey the children stared at each other aghast they could not discuss the matter however as miss slighcarp remained in the room sorting through their clothes and deciding what they were to take with them sylvia noticed that she put out only their oldest and plainest things she herself was joan aiken given none of the new clothes that pattern had been making her but only those made from aunt janes white curtain whwhere are we going miss slighcarp she pres ently ventured bonnie had such a vehement dislike a of the governess that she would never address miss slighcarp unless obliged to do so to school to school but are you not then going to teach us maam have not the leisure miss slighcarp said sharp ly the estate affairs are in such a sad tangle that it will take me all my time to straighten them you are to go to the school of a friend of mine in blast bum but mamma and papa would never agree to such a thingi bonnie burst out indignantly whether they would or whether they would not is of no importance young lady why do you say that asked bonnie filled with a nameless dread because i had a message this afternoon to say that the thessaly the ship on which your mamma and papa set sail has been sunk off the coast of spain you are an orphan miss green like your cousin and from now on it is i who have the sole say in your affairs i am your guardian bonnie gave one sharp crypapal mammal and then sank down trembling on the sofa burying her face in her hands miss slighcarp looked at her with a strange sort of triumph and then left the room carrying the valise and bidding them both be ready in five minutes as soon as she was gone bonnie sprang upright the wolves of willoughby chase again it is not true it cant be she said it just to torment me but oh she cried what if it is true sylvia could it be true how could poor sylvia tell she tried to comfort bonnie tried to assure her that it must be lies but all the time a dreadful doubt and fear lay in her own heart if bonnies parents were no more then their only protectors were gone she thought with grief of cheerful goodhearted sir willoughby and kind gen tle lady green to whom now could they turn before the five minutes were more than half gone miss slighcarp had come back to hasten them with a vigilant eye she escorted them down the stairs and through a postern door to the stable yard where the carriage was waiting with the horses harnessed and steaming in the frosty night air sleepy and shivering they hardly had strength to protest when mr grimshaw who was there hoisted each into the carriage and then handed up miss slighcarp who sat grimly between them well a pleasant journey maam he cried gaily mind the wolves dont get you ha hal id like to see the wolf that would tackle me snapped miss slighcarp and then to james on the box you may start sirrah they rattled out of the yard and were soon crossing the dark and snowy ex panses of the park they had gone about a mile when they spied the lights of another carriage coming toward them it drew to a halt as it came abreast of them tis the doctor maam said james young ladiesi said miss slighcarp sharply they caught sight of her face by the swaying carriage light the look on it was so forbidding that it made them joan aiken shiver one word from either of you and youll have me to reckon withi remember that you are now go ing to a place where miss green of willoughby chase is not of the slightest consequence you can cry all day in a coal cellar and no one will take notice of you if i choose that it shall be so hold your tongues therefore not a sound from you while i speak to the doctor is that miss slighcarp the doctor called dr morne what brings you out at this time of night she spoke with false cordiality i received a strange message maammost strange a blank sheet of paper and an urgent summons to the chase is everybody ill can nobody write oh doctor she said sweet as syrup im afraid it must be some prank of those dreadful children they are so naughty and high spirited here she gave both children a fierce pinch there is nobody ill at the chase doctor i most deeply regret that you should have been called out for nothing let me give you ten guineas instead of your usual five there was a chink of coins as she leaned out of the dim coach and obscured the doctors view of its interior he rumbled dissatisfied very odd very cant say its like bonnie to do such a thing must be the other little minx dont care for being called out on false errands however very kind of you maam say no more about it still grumbling to himself he turned his horses miss slighcarp gave him a few minutes start and then told james to make all possible speed toward blastburn the wolves of wtlloughby chase the rest of the journey passed in silence both children were utterly cast down at this failure of their plan and bonnie was almost numb with grief and despair over the news about her parents try as she would to control herself tear after tear slipped from under her eyelids and the utmost that she could achieve was that she wept in silence she was too proud to let miss slighcarp guess her misery sylvia guessed it and longed to comfort her but the bony bulk of the governess was between them long before the end of the trip they were almost dead of cold and their feet were like lumps of ice for miss slighcarp had all the fur carriage rugs wrapped round herself and the children had to make do without they were too cold for sleep and could almost have wished for an attack by wolves but save for an occasional distant howl their passage was undisturbed it seemed that miss slighcarp was right when she said that the wolves feared to attack her at last they drew near the great smoky lights and fearsome fiery glare of blastburn where the huge slag heaps stood outlined like black pyramids against the red sky they clattered through a black and cobbled town where the people seemed to work all night for the streets were thronged although it was so late and presently drew up in a dark street on the farthest outskirts miss slighcarp alighted first and sylvia had just time to breathe hurriedly to james as he lifted her down youll tell pattern where we are gone james shell be so worried and to receive his nod before the governess pushed them along a narrow gravel joan aiken path toward the front door of a high dark house she rang a bell whose echoes they heard far within harsh and jangling almost at once the door flew open seven the door was opened by a thin dirty child in a brown pinafore with one white front pocket on which was stitched a large number six bonnie and sylvia were not certain it the child was a boy or a girl until miss slighcarp said its you is it lucy where is mrs brisket in here please miss lucy said with a frightened gasp and opened a door on one side of the entrance hall miss slighcarp swept through turning her head to say to bonnie and sylvia wait there dont speak or fidget then they heard her voice beyond the door gertrude it is i our plans are going excellently somebody shut the door and they could hear nothing further the little girl lucy regarded the new ar rivals for a moment her finger in her mouth before picking up a broom several inches taller than herself and beginning to sweep the floor are you a pupil here bonnie asked her curi ously the brown pinafore looked like some kind of uni formbut why was her hair cut so short even shorter than a boys and why was she doing housework hush whispered lucy her eyes flicked in terror joan aiken toward the closed door shell half kill me iј she hears me speak who breathed bonnie her mrs brisket bonnie looked as if she was on the point of asking more questions but sylvia hushed her not wishing to get lucy into trouble and lucy herself resolutely turned her back and went on wish her work stirring up a cloud of dust in the dim and stuffy hall suddenly sylvia had the feeling that they were being watched she raised her eyes and saw someone standing by the banister rail at the top of the illlit stairs staring down at them meeting sylvias eyes this person slowly descended toward them she was a girl of about fifteen tall and thin with a pale handsome sharpfeatured face she walked with a slouch and was very richly dressed in velvet with a band of fur round her jacket and several brace lets she carried a pair of silver skates she walked up to bonnie and sylvia surveying them coolly and insolently she made no remark or friendly gesture of greeting merely looked them up and down and then with a sudden quick movement tugged off sylvias white fur cap and tried it on herself it was too small hm she said coldly what a nuisance youre not bigger she dropped the cap disdainfully on the floor sylvias lips parted in indignation even she mild and goodtempered as she was would have pro tested had she not noticed lucys face behind the girls elbow grimacing at her in an agony of alarm evidently warning her not to object to this treatment wordlessly she picked up the beautiful white cap its fur dusty from the heap of sweepings on to which the wolves of willoughby chase it had fallen and stood stroking it while the girl said carelessly to lucy is my mother in there yes miss diana talking to miss shghcarp oh that old harridan she pushed open the door and they heard her say ma im going out theres a fair and allnight skating on the river give me five guineas she reappeared in the doorway jingling coins in her hand turned her head to say if either of the new girls is good at mending make her sew up my satin petticoat its split then she pushed haughtily past them and went out slamming the front door miss slighcarp summoned bonnie and sylvia to be inspected by their new instructress as soon as they saw her they recognized the lady whom they had seen driving her carriage near the boundaries of will oughby chase she was a tall massive smartly dressed woman her bigknuckled hands loaded with rings flashing red and yellow rubies and topazes she glanced at the children irritably her eyes were yellow as the stones in her rings yellow as the eyes of a tiger and she looked as if she could be badtempered these are the children gertrude miss slighcarp said that onepointing to sylviais tractable enough though lazy and whining and disposed to malinger this oneindicating bonnieis thor oughly insolent and ungovernable and will need constant checking and keeping down im not shes noti burst from bonnie and sylvia simul taneously but mrs brisket checked them with a glare from her yellow eyes speak before youre spoken to in this house young joan alken ladies and youll get a touch of the strap and lose your supper so lets have no more oe it they were silent but bonnies eyes flashed danger ously both as you can see continued miss slighcarp as if there had been no interruption have been grossly spoiled and overindulged theyll soon have that nonsense knocked out of them here said mrs brisket miss slighcarp rose i am leaving them in good hands gertrude she said i am very busy just at present as you know but when next we meet i hope you will be coming to visit me you have helped me in the past gertrude and soon i shall be in a posi tion to help you she said this last very significantly bonnies and sylvias eyes met was miss slighcarp intending to take complete possession of willoughby chase sylvia felt something like despair come over her but bon nie clenched her hands indomitably mrs brisket ushered miss slighcarp out and saw her to the carriage when it had gone wish a clatter ing of hoofs and a flashing of lamps she returned to the children we have no names here she said sternly you to sylvia will be number ninetyeight you number ninetynine come make haste the others are in bed long ago except for the night workers she led them through the hallwhere the little girl lucy swept frenziedly as soon as mrs brisket appeared though it was plain she was dropping with sleepinessand up flight after flight of steep uncar peted stairs on the fourth floor she pushed bonnie through a doorway hissing the bed near the door the wolves of willoughby chase and raised the candle she carried long enough to show a large bare room crammed with small iron cots on which children lay sleeping sometimes two to a cot one bed by the door was still vacant sylvia had just time to whisper good night be fore she was hustled up to the floor above and thrust into a similar bedroom she undressed in the pitch dark and fumbled her way into the bed which was narrow hard and inadequately covered ill never get to sleep she thought as she lay shivering miser ably trying to summon up courage to thrust her feet into the chilly depths of the bed she could hear the mill hooters wail and iron wheels clang on the cob bles somewhere a church clock struck midnight the whole of her short stay among the riches and splen dors of willoughby chase seemed like a dream oh how i wish i was still with aunt jane she thought unhappily but then i should not have met bonnie dear bonnie she turned over hugging the toothin toonarrow blanket round her suddenly a hand touched her cheek and a voice whispered sylvia is that you bonniel i had to come and make sure you were all right sylvia thought remorsefully how selfish she had been lying and pitying herself while bonnie had courageously dared the perils of the dark house to come and see her yes im all right quite all rightl she whispered she reached out and hugged bonnie run back to bed quickly someone may catch youl she felt sure that in this place the punishment for getting out of bed would be dire just came to make sure said bonnie dont joan aiken worry sylvia well keep each other company it wont be too bad and it we dont like it well then well run away though she said this so stoutly her heart sank where could they run to with miss slighcarp in oc cupation at willoughby chase see you in the morning see you in the momingi with the memory of bonnies comforting presence sylvia at last found the courage to push her feet down to the cold bottom of the bed and go to sleep but bonnie lay awake for hour after hour hearing the city clocks strike and the wail of the factory hooters and the rumble of wheels what shall we do she thought again and again what shall we do in the morning they discovered why the beds near the door were the last to be occupied while the sky outside was still black as midnight and the frosty stars still shone a tall girl thrust a great bell through the door and clanged it deafeningly up and down un til every shivering inmate of the room had thrown back her covers jumped to the floor and begun dress ing dazed and startled sylvia nearly tell out of bed where do we wash she whispered to the girl by the next bed hushi you mustnt speak the girl said and pointed sylvia saw a tin basin in one corner of the room with a bucket beneath it the biggest girl in the room broke the ice in the basin by giving it a sharp crack with her hairbrush then they all washed in order of size sylvia was last when it came to her the wolves of willoughby chase turn there was no more than a trickle of dirty icy water leet in the basin she could not bring herself to touch it she was about to start plaiting her hair when the big girl who had washed first said wait you julia fetch the shears yes alice the child who had told sylvia not to talk ran from the room and came back in a mo ment with an enormous pair of garden shears be fore sylvia realized what was to happen or had time to protest alice had seized hold of her pretty fair plaits and lopped them off one after the other then she chopped the remainder of sylvias hair off as short as possible leaving it in a ragged uneven fringe round her head there was no mirror in the room so sylvia could not see quite how bad it looked what do you mean by cutting off my hair she gasped hush its the rule mrs brisket doesnt allow long hair now get into line the other crophaired overalled children were in line already alice pushed sylvia into place at the back took up her own position at the front and led them downstairs sylvia caught a glimpse of bonnie at the end of another line which joined theirs bon nies hair too had been cut and she like sylvia had been given a brown overall to wear with a num ber on the pocket she looked almost unrecognizable like a thin darkhaired boy she gave sylvia a wry grin the files had assembled round tables in a large cold stonefloored room they stood waiting while three or four weary grimy exhaustedlooking chil dren among whom was lucy brought round bowls which proved to contain thin gray steaming por joan aiken ridge it was eaten without milk or sugar after it they each had a small chunk of stale bread with the merest scrape of dripping and that was the end of breakfast at this moment mrs brisket entered the room and the whole school stood up mrs brisket said grace and then looked sharply round where are the new girls she demanded bonnie and sylvia were pushed forward from their places at different tables toward the rear of the room she scowled at them i am told that you left your beds and communicated last night for that you will both miss your dinners who could have heard them sylvia wondered then she caught sight of the big girl alice who had cut off her hair in alices rather lumpish stupid face was a smug expression sylvia didnt do a thingi it was i who went to talk to her bonnie exclaimed silence miss i will not have this insolence you can miss your tea too perhaps that will teach you re spect now tasks number ninetyeight will work in the laundry eighteen show her what to do ninetynine you will be in the kitchen under cook she will see that you dont give any trouble there will be an inspection by the education officer this afternoon so i want you all in the class room at two oclock sharp eighteen and ninetyeight you must see that the night workers are waked in time she left the hall and the children dispersed quickly and silently to their various tasks sylvia was led off the wolves of willoughby chase by a thin wiry but quite friendly looking girl of fifteen or so who whispered that her name was emma dont we do any lessons murmured sylvia hush wait till were in the laundry then we can talk the laundry was a large external room stone floored and bitterly cold built out from the back of the house it contained many large zinc washtubs scrubbing boards two huge iron wringers and a great mound of coarse calico sheets and house linen waiting to be washed eight or nine other children came with them and set to work doggedly sorting the linen and filling the tubs at an outside pump the handle of which creaked so loudly that conversation could be pursued under cover of its noise dont whatever you do let her hear you talking warned emma were only allowed to say necessary things to each other her obviously referred to mrs brisket emma gave sylvia a tub a pile of sheets and a bar of rough yellow soap but do the parents allow their children to be made to work like this sylvia asked in bewilderment they are all orphans this is a charity school and mrs brisket gets some money for running it but as well she makes us do all the work and take in outside work too we do the washing for half blastburn then when the education officer comes round we go into the classrooms and pretend to be learning lessons do you like it here asked sylvia struggling to drag a bunch of heavy dripping cloth out of the cold water joan aiken emma glanced round cautiously but no one else was very near and the pump handle was going full blast leaning nearer she whispered its a horrible place but dont let anyone hear you say so the school is full of tale bearers every one is always hungryand mrs brisket rewards any one who carries her a tale against another person she gives them a bit of cheese she has a big laundry basket in her room full of bits of cheese ready cut up so that was why alice had reported on bonnies midnight visit sylvia herself who was still just as hungry after breakfast as before it felt her mouth watering at the thought of those bits of cheese when the sheets had been painfully scrubbed and rinsed three times by hands that were red and sore from the harsh soap and icy water emma showed sylvia how to use the wringer never touch it with your hands one girl lost her fingers in it now we always poke the sheets through with a stick she dumped the wrungout sheets into a basket and carried them out to the yard behind the house where there were long rows of henhouses and many washing lines when the sheets were hung up she and sylvia returned to the central heap for a new lot the morning seemed endless sylvia was soon al most exhausted from the heavy work and soaked through with icy water from the wringer which sprayed anybody who was using it presently the bell went for dinner sylvia had hoped that as she and bonnie were both to miss their meal they might at least meet and talk somewhere but she learned that people punished in this way were the wolves of willoughby chase obliged to stand at the back of the dining room and watch everybody else eat mrs brisket sat at the head table eating grilled trout and plum pudding and there was no chance to move a finger without being seen by her bonnie looked tired and rebellious she had a smear of coal dust on one cheek a cut finger and grease spots on her overall but she grinned at sylvia encouragingly at the end of the meal she seized the moment when all the benches were noisily pushed back to whisper it wasnt much of a meal to miss anywayl nor had it been one thin slice of cold fat pork a piece of beetroot and a small withered apple after dinner bonnie was summoned back to the scullery to help with the washingup while sylvia and emma went round with a bell to wake the night workers then sylvia realized that as the beds were insufficient for the number of children in the school half of them slept by night and half by day the night workers were always dropping with fatigue as they were liable to be roused for duties in the day time too but just the same they were envied as they performed their tasks without the fierce supervision of mrs brisket it was a hard job to waken them one by one they were clanged out of their slumbers and dragged from their beds at two oclock sharp the whole school yawning and shivering stood lined up in the heat less classrooms at haltpast two mrs brisket came round with the inspector the children were well trained as the door opened into each classroom they burst out in chorus joan aiken ai bi cl dl el fl g and so on until the visi tors had left in the next room it would be onel two threel four five ah i see they are getting on with their reading and arithmetic maam said mr friendshipp the inspector comfortably yes mr friendshipp as you see as i might have expected in such a wellrun es tablishment as yours maam and now mr friendshipp said mrs brisket when they had passed through the last room where bonnie and sylvia were standing come and have a small glass of port wine to keep out the chill after tea which bonnie missed the children were set to mending the meal had consisted of another small wedge of bread dry this time and a cup of water sylvia had contrived to save a half of her morsel of bread for bonnie and she pushed it into bonnies hands later as they sat working in the big gest classroom huddled together for warmth this was the only time of day when they were allowed to talk to each other a little the cooks a tartarl whispered bonnie if you say a word she hits you with the frying pan or any thing thats handy and the kitchen is filthyid sooner work in a pigsty we cant stay here sylvia no we cant breathed sylvia in heartfelt agree ment but how can we possibly get away and where would we go ill think of some plan said bonnie with invin cible optimism and you think too sylvia think for all you are worth sylvia nodded then she whispered hush diana the wolves of willoughby chase briskets looking at us and bent her head over the enormous rent in the satin petticoat which she was endeavoring to repair they had already learned that diana brisket was someone to dread her sharp eyes were everywhere ready to catch the slightest fault which she would then shrilly report to her mother and her bony fin gers were clever to prod or pinch or twist as she passed on stairs or landing she was cordially hated by the whole school after they had sewed or mended for two hours they were put to sorting bristles for broommaking while mrs brisket read aloud a chapter of the bible to them then there was suppera choice of bluish skim milk or a cup of thin potato soupand then they were sent to bed most of them so boneweary that in spite of hunger and the thin coverings they fell into bed and slept at once the dreamless sleep of exhaustion eight bonnie did not last long in the kitchen the second time that the cook hit her with the frying pan bon nie picked up a sauce boat full of rancid gravy and dashed it in the cooks face there was a fierce struggle but the cook one mrs moleskin a large stout woman with a savage temper at last thrust bonnie into the broom cupboard and reported her to mrs brisket mrs moleskin was used to having a dozen terrified small slaves running hither and thither at her beck and call and announced that she would not have bonnie working under her accordingly after a pun ishment which consisted of losing all her meals for two days bonnie was put on to doing the outside work which was considered a terrible degradation in fact she did not mind it half so much as being in the squalid kitchen outside work meant fetching in coal and kindling lighting fires sweeping the front and back steps cleaning windows and doorknobs digging the front garden and looking after the poul try bonnie who was as strong as a pony bore her two days starvation with stoical fortitude twice sylvia slipped her a piece of bread but the second time she the wolves of willoughby chase was caught by alice who snatched the bread and ate it herself subsequently reporting the affair to mrs brisket sylvia then had to forgo her own sup per and after that bonnie would not let her sacrifice herself one dark foggy afternoon when bonnie shivering in her thin overall was sweeping snow off the front path she suddenly heard a familiar whisper from the other side of the front railings miss bonniel miss bonniel simoni she cried out joyfully almost dropping the broom in her surprise miss bonnie why ever are you doing work like that hushi breathed bonnie looking back at the house to make sure that mrs brisket was not watch ing from one of the windows theyve sent us to school here simon but its more like a prison we cant stand it were going to run away i should think so too said simon with indigna tion sweeping paths indeedl and in that thin ap roni its downright wicked but simon what are you doing in blastbum came in to sell my geese of course he said wink ing cheerfully but to tell the truth i was looking for you miss bonnie james and pattern asked me to come we was all uneasy about you and miss sylvia whatll i tell them at that moment a coal cart appeared and stopped outside the house the coal man banged on the front door shouting coal upl coal upl coal up mrs brisket came out and ordered thirty sacks here you she said sharply to bonnie help the man carry them to the coal cellar who is that boy joan aiken she eyed simon suspiciously geese for sale geese for sale anybody want my fine fat geese he called displaying the two geese he was carrying under his arms mrs briskets eyes lit up she strode down the gar den to the gate and prodded the two geese with a knowing finger ill give you five shillings each for them boy ten said simon ridiculous not a penny more than seven shill ings fifteen shillings the pair maamand its a spe cial price for you because i never can resist a hand some lady said simon impudently guttersnipe said mrs brisket but she paid over the fifteen shillings and told bon nie to put the two geese in the fowl run in fact the price was a ridiculously low one as she well knew ill carry in your coal for a brown maam simon suggested very well she dug in her purse for another coin you can help the girlthe school inspector is com ing to dinner in half an hour and i dont want chil dren running to and fro and getting in the way when he arrives simon picked up one of the sacks without more ado and humped it across the garden to the coal cellar entrance a flap door directly under mrs bris kets drawingroom window mrs brisket unlocked the door and he tipped the coal down the chute and ran back for another load by the time he returned mrs brisket had gone indoorsleaving the key in the lock simon glanced round to make sure that he was un the wolves of willoughby chase observed the coal man considering that his help was not necessary had climbed back on to the seat of his cart and gone to sleep simon scooped a hand ful of snow aside and pulling a knife out of his pocket carved from the ground a hunk of yellow clay which he warmed and rubbed in his hands until it was soft taking the large key from the cellar lock he pressed it vigorously into the clay first on one side then on the other until he had two clear impressions of it then he put the key back in the lock whipped off his muffler damped it with snow and wrapped it carefully round the lump of clay which he placed under some bushes by the time bonnie came running back from shut ting up the geese he was hard at work carrying his fifth sack of coal dont you try to carry one miss bonniet he said with horror as she went matteroffactly to the cart theyre tar and away too heavy for you ill take them in the wheelbarrow bonnie said and fetched it from the shed mrs brisket would dock me of my supper if she looked out and saw that i was letting you do all the work does slie do that simon was horrified does she starve you not me bonnie said cheerfully i soon found out what to do when she cuts one oј my meals i make up on raw eggs i didnt much like them at first but when youre really hungry its surprising what you enjoy you mustnt stay herel simon exclaimed will you help us to run away simon that i willl but simon if were to escape we shall need some joan aiken clothes thats what has been worrying me she has taken our own things and our purses with our money so that we cant buy other things and if we walked about in these overalls everyone would know that we were escaped from the orphan school ill bring you clothes he promised boys things would be best i go to feed the hens every evening at six you could meet me then by the henhouses as soon as youve got the clothes if you went to pattern im sure she could give you something the difficulty will be to get sylvia out of the house for she never his an excuse to come outside except in the morning when shes hanging up washing and it would be too dangerous then wait till next week and ill have a key made to get you out can you get into the coal cellar from inside bonnie nodded all too easily she locks us into it as punishment quite often then i will give you a key to the outside door and you will only have to contrive to be locked in bonnie flung her arms round his neck simon ou aie wonderful now i must fly back or i shall be punished for loiteiing simon watched until she had run indoors then he shied the last lump of coal to wake the driver of the cart from his beery slumbers carefully took his piece of clay from its hiding place in the laurel bushes and holding it as if it were the most precious gold walked swiftly away to find the nearest locksmith sylvia was obliged to miss her tea she had been given a dress of diana briskets to mend and the task had taxed even her skillful needle so disgracefully the wolves of willoughby chase corn were its delicate flounces her head ached and her cold fingers were less nimble than usual conse quently the dress was not finished when diana wanted it she flew into a passion slapped sylvia and told her mother that number ninetyeight was lazy and refused to work in consequence sylvia had to stand at the back of the dining room with the other wrong doers at teatime while bonnie burned with sympa thetic fury during sewing time after tea bonnie chose a mo ment when mrs brisket was out of the room crept round to sylvia and pressed something into her hand eat it quick before she comes back sylvia looked at what was in her hand and saw with amazement that it was a little cake crisp and hoc from the bakery where did you get it bonnie it must be from simon i found two of them in the nesting boxes when i went to collect the eggs if id known that horrid wretch diana would make you miss your tea id have saved mine for you too and she whispered to sylvia the news of simons plan for them sylvia was pale already but she became paler still with excitement escape oh bonnie how wonderful here you finish this cake i think im too excited to eat it and she coughed no you must eat it sylvia you had no tea i cant my throat is too sore where shall we go bonnie well bonnie whispered frowning we cant very well go back to willoughby chase for theyd search for us there at once and if james and pattern tried joan aiken to help us theyd get into trouble what do you say to trying to get to london to see aunt jane oh bonnie yes dearest aunt jane how i long to know if she is all right sylvia spoke with such enthusiasm that she coughed again but how shall we get there bonnie it is such a long way and we have no money for train tickets i have thought of that very soon simon will be driving his geese up to london for the easter fair at smithfield market easter falls at the end of april this year and he will want at least two months to get there and we could go with him hush whispered bonnie for at this moment the door opened and mrs brisket reentered the room she cast her usual suspicious glance round the as sembled children before beginning to read aloud from a volume of sermons and they bent their heads and pretended to busy themselves over their work every night that week when bonnie went to feed the hens and collect the eggs her pleasantest task of the day she felt a tremor of excitement would the key and clothes be there but tuesday wednesday thursday and friday evenings went by without her discovering anything unexpected in the henhouse on saturday there was another inspection by the education officer this time in the morning he had really come to invite mrs brisket to dine with him next day but she always seized the opportunity of showing him how wellbehaved and biddable her pu pils were and she had them all standing in rows for an hour before his arrival the strain of this was too much for poor sylvia drenched through every day with cold water in the icy draughty laundry she the wolves of willoughby chase had taken a bad cold and was flushed heavyeyed and feverish just as the inspector entered the room where she stood she fainted quietly away that child maam is ill said mr friendship pointed to her with his cane very likely it is all a pretensel exclaimed mrs brisket looking at sylvia with dislike but on inspec tion it was plain that sylvias illness was genuine enough and mrs brisket angrily directed two of the big girls to put her to bed in a small room on the ground floor where sick children were kept so that they should not give the infection to others a basin of cold porridge was dumped in her room and as she was much too ill to eat it she would have fared badly had bonnie not come to her aid bonnie discovering at dinnertime that sylvia was missing whispered to the friendly emma to ask where she was ill in the locker room bonnie turned pale she had suspected for several days that sylvia was ailing though sylvia al ways stoutly denied it it she was ill how could they escape on the other hand if they did not escape what would become of sylvia it was not impossible bonnie thought that she might die of neglect and illattention in this horrible place with great daring bonnie took a chance when mrs brisket was inspecting the dormitories upstairs and ran in to visit sylvia whom she found conscious but dreadfully weak flushed and coughing a cup of cold water stood by her bedside here whispered bonnie here sylvia swallow this down its not much but at least its nourishing joan aiken and warm and she pulled from her pocket an egg only five minutes laid tossed the water from the cup out of the window broke the egg into it and beat it up with her finger im sorry sylvia that its so disgusting but it will do you good sylvia gazed with horror at the nauseous mess but bonnies bright pleading eyes compelled her to swal low it and it slipped more easily than she had ex pected down her sore throat then hearing mrs brisket descending the upper stairs bonnie covered sylvia as warmly as she could gave her a quick hug and dashed silently away that evening when bonnie fed the hens and searched for eggs she put her hand beneath one warm protesting feathery body and felt something hard and long among the eggsa keyl she pulled it out and found attached to it a label which said in pat terns printed script tomorrow night at ten look under the straw bales bonnie ran to the bales of straw which were kept for the nesting boxes and found behind them two warm suits of clothes a boys with breeches and waistcoat and a girls with a thick woolen skirt and petticoat both were of coarse material such as tinker children wear but well and stoutly made and both had beautiful thick sheepskin jackets lined with their own wool in the pocket of each jacket was a golden guinea bonnie guessed that the boys was for her and the girls for sylvia for sylvia could never be got to look like a boy oh how clever and good simon is he must have the wolves of willoughby chase got pattern to help him but will sylvia be able to travel we must manage it somehow she bit her lips with worry snatching the opportunity while it was dark and there was nobody about bonnie carried the two bun dles of clothes indoors and hid them in the coal cel lar behind a large mound of coal while she was sup posed to be filling mrs briskets evening coal scuttle and making up her fire during the evening she seized another chance to take a fresh egg to sylvia and whisper the news to her poor sylvia dutifully swallowed the egg and tried to be excited by the plan but she felt so weak and ill that she was sure she would never manage the escape though she dared not tell bonnie this bon nie could see for herself though how trail sylvia looked and she became more worried than ever sunday passed in the usual tasks mrs brisket departed after ten to the party at mr friendshipps leaving the school in charge of her daughter diana who as her custom was immediately began to bully and harry the children making them fetch and carry for her iron her clothes curl her hair and polish her shoes mrs brisket had forbid den her to leave the house but she had no intention ot staying in and was proposing to visit a bazaar on the other side of the town having calmly taken some money from her mothers purse here you she called seeing bonnie hurrying past where are you going with that hangdog look come here bonnie came as it unwillingly what have you got in your pocket bonnie made no reply joan aiken diana thrust in her hand and let out a shriek oј disgust she withdrew it and stared at her fingers which were dripping with egg yolk thief miserable little thief stealing the eggs from my mothers henhouse she raised the dripping hand and slapped bonnies face with it six months ago bonnie would have slapped her back and heartily but she was learning patience and selfcommand to be embroiled in a struggle with diana was not part of her plan though she longed to box the girls ears i was taking it to sylvia she said steadily your mother is starving her to death she has had nothing to eat all day but two raw onions is that any business of yours very well said diana white with temper since you think you can look after sylvia so well you shall look after her you can look after each other in the coal cellar alice help me shut them in alice and a couple of the larger worsenatured girls willingly did so others remonstrated as bon nie was pushed and sylvia still in her nightclothes halfcarried into the dark dirty place you shouldnt do it miss diana sylvias illit will make her worse exclaimed emma hold your tongue who asked you to interfere shouted diana and slapped her the door was locked and the key put in its accustomed place on mrs briskets parlor mantelpiece then after mak ing sure that everyone was in a properly cowed frame of mind diana wrapped herself in a velvet cloak and went out to the bazaar locking the front door and taking the key with her the wolves of willoughby chase meanwhile bonnie in the coal cellar was congratu lating herself on the success of her idea is she swiftly helped to dress the trembling shivering sylvia in her new warm doilies there sylvin now dont cry theres a lamb for i feel sure simon will have some good plan and will be able to tke us to a place where you can be prop erly cared for dont cry but sylvia was too weak to hold back her tears she sat obediently on a large lump of coal while bonnie prepared to change her own clothes but be fore she could do so there was a creaking of the lock and the door softly openednot the door to the gar den but tlie one through which they had been thrust in a head poked round itemmas bonnie sylvia are you all right you can come out and get warmi dianas out and alice has gone to bed bonnie felt the tears prick her eyes at this cour ageous kindness on the part of emma but how ill timed it was at any minute simon might arrive and she did not want anyone to know that he was help ing with their escipe she whispered to sylvia wait there sylvia for two minutes only two minutes and then ill be back and ran swiftly to tlie cellar door outside stood emma and a large number of chil dren all deathly silent in the passage that led from the kitchen one of them pointed upward meaning that they must make no sound for fear of alice bonnie was amaed and touched she had had no idea how popular her bright face and friendly ways had made her with the other children in the fairly short time she had been at mrs briskets joan aiken impulsively she hugged emma emma i wont forget this if ever i get away from this hateful place and oh i pray it will be tonight she said to herself ill send back somehow and get you out too but sylvia and i mustnt leave the cellar if mrs brisket or diana came back you would get into dreadful trouble she looked at the childrens anxious eager faces and wished that she could do something for them suddenly she had an idea she ran to mrs briskets parlor and brought out the large hamper of cheese which the headmistress kept for rewarding tale bear ers here quick girls eat this up she tossed out the chunks of cheese in double handfuls to the raven ous children cheesel oh bonnie cheesel wonderful cheese they had gobbled up most of the savory lumps before emma suddenly exclaimed but what will mrs brisket say ill take care of that said bonnie grandly she had been scribbling on a sheet of paper this is to pay for the cheese and she now signed it with her name fetched the guinea piece from her jacket pocket and put it with the paper on mrs briskets writing desk there shell be angry but she will see that i am the one to blame now emma you must lock us up in the cellar again and put back the key yesi as emma protested promise that will be best in the the wolves of willovghhy c nse end and she nodded vigorously to show that she meant it and went back into the cellar with great reluctance emma locked the door again instantly ronnie hung off her brown overall and hustled on her boys clothes which felt very thick and strange but comfortable oh how funny i must look i wish we could see ourselves here sylvia i saved a piece of cheese for you try to eat it it will give you some strength we must take our aprons with us it wont do to leave them behind or they will guess that we have got other clothes and may be in disguise she bundled them up and tucked them in her capacious pockets now for the key just for one awful moment it seemed as if the somewhat roughly made key would not open the outer door however wrapping a fold of her jacket over it and wrenching it with both hands bonnie got it round and raised the flap a gust of snowflakes blew into her face good its snowing so much the better we shant leave any footprints now sylvia you had better have my coat as well as your own she buttoned it on to her cousin who was really too ill and weak to make any objection and halfpulled halfhoisted her up the slope down which the coal was poured then swiftly she relocked the door put the key in her pocket and urged sylvia toward the gate with an arm round her shoulders we can hide in a laurel bush she whispered theres a thick one beside the front railings then if mrs brisket or diana should come back they wont see us i can hear the town clock striking tensimon should be here at any moment joan aiken and indeed as they reached the railings they heard his voice whispering miss bonnie miss sylvia is that you yes its us bonnie called back quietly and ran to open the gate nine sylvias ill bonnie muttered to simon as soon as they were outside the gate she can hardly walkl i think we shall have to carry her no she can go in the cart simon whispered back and then bonnie saw that he had with him a beautiful little cart drawn by a donkey her eyes lit up with delight why its the very thing isnt it the one from willoughby that we use for picnics hush yes whispered simon lets get away quick and then ill explain between them they lifted the trembling shivering sylvia into the cart she gave a little protesting moan as she came into contact with something soft that seemed alive what is it breathed bonnie the geesel they wont hurt her there are quilts and mattresses underneath swiftly and skillfully simon disposed sylvia in the cart on a warm mattress covered with several quilts thirty sleepy grumbling geese were pushed uncere moniously to one side and then when sylvia was settled allowed to perch all over and round her un til only her face was showing joan aiken there theyll keep her famously warm and in fact the warmth of the mattress and quilts and the soft feathery bodies on top was such that in two minutes sylvia was in a deep sleep and never even felt the cart begin to move will you ride too miss bonnie no ill walk at the head with you simon lets be off then they hastened away simon had tied rags round the wheels and they went silently over the cobbled road the only sound was the tippetytap of the don keys feet when they had turned several corners and put several streets between them and mrs briskets school both simon and bonnie breathed more freely no one will remark us now said bonnie as they passed into a wide naphthalighted street in the middle of the town where although it was nearly midnight trams still clanged up and down and pit and factory workers trudged to and fro in their clogs certainly no one would take you for miss bonnie green said simon chuckling you make a proper boy in those things haircut and all here i brought these for you he turned sank an arm into the cart and rummaged among the geese and brought out two sheepswoollined caps one of which he carefully placed over sylvias sleeping head the other he gave to bonnie who gratefully pulled it on for the snow was falling thick and fast miss pattern made them for you they werent finished in time to leave with the other things pattern oh did she make the clothes yes she did when she heard i was going to help you and james found the donkey and cartmiss the wolves of willoughby chase slighcarp was going to have sold them but james told her they belonged to parson and hid them away i reckoned it would be just the thing for our jour ney and miss pattern gave me a saucepan and a frypan and some cups and plates and a great pie theyre all in the back under the seat well have a bite to eat presentlyi dare say youre famished miss bonniebut not till were out of the town where is pattern asked bonnie shes gone back to live with her mother at the lodge she sent her dear love but didnt dare ask you to call in for miss slighcarp passes there every day and theres only the one room as you know if theres a search tor you theyd be bound to go there its best pattern should not have seen you and is james still at the house yes he gave me the guineas to put in your pockets out of his wagesand gracious knows theyre little enough now ive spent mine already simon confessed bon nie and told what she had done simon shook his head at her but all he said was twas like you miss bonnie simon its ridiculous to go on calling me miss just call me plain bonnie simon grinned but answered indirectly have you got that coalcellar key with you heres a good place to get rid of it they were crossing the bridge over the wide river with its busy traffic of coal barges and wool wherries when bonnie produced the key and the two over alls he made them into a bundle with a bit of string weighted it with a cobble and threw the whole thing into the river then they went on with light hearts joan aiken the town presently gave way to country not much could be seen in the dark but bonnie caught dim glimpses of snowcovered slag heaps with here and there a great pit wheel or chimney then they passed fields enclosed in drystone walls after a while they were climbing up a long slow ascent the beginning of the wolds youd best have a bit of a sleep now simon suggested to bonnie after a couple of hours had passed were sate away and twill be morning by and by what about the wolves though bonnie said shant we be in danger from them id better help you keep a lookout have you brought a gun ay ive my bow and james gave me your fowling piece its in the cart but i doubt well not be trou bled by wolves its turned march now and with spring coming theyll be moving farther north were not likely to see any of them once were over great whinside what shall we do about sylvia simon she ought to stop somewhere till shes well enough for the journey ive been thinking that and i know the very place well reach it about six in the morning you get in the cart and have a nap now all right i will said bonnie who was begin ning to be very sleepy if youre sure the donkey can stand the load she patted the donkeys nose carolines pulled heavier loads than that so the cart was halted and bonnie carefully so as not to wake sylvia scrambled in and made a nest for herself among the feather quilts and the warm drowsy geese soon she too was asleep the wolves of willoughby chase when bonnie woke she lay wondering tor a mo ment where she was there was no clanging bell no complaining voices and instead of shivering under her one thin blanket she was deliciously comfortable and warm a cool breeze blew over her face the cart jolted and then she remembered what had been happening and said softly simon his voice came from somewhere in front yes stop the cart a moment i want to get out not worth it he said were nearly there bonnie wriggled to a sitting position and looked about her the sky was still mostly dark but day light was slowly growing in the east thin fronds of green and lemonyellow were beginning to uncurl among masses of inky cloud when bonnie looked back she could see that they had come over a great ridge of hills whose tops were still lost in the black ness of the sky to the north ahead of them was a little dale and loops of the white road were visible leading down to it over rolling folds of moor a tremendous bush lay over the whole countryside even the birds were not awake yet thats where well have our breakfast simon pointed ahead thats herondale were way off the main road now no ones likely to come looking for us here he began to whistle a soft tune as he walked and bonnie curling up even more snugly watched in great contentment as the lemonyellow sky changed to orange and then to red and presently the sun buist up in a blaze of gold simon what is it joan aiken theres no snow here often its like that he said nodding weve left snow tother side of whinside down in heron dale itll be warm presently they came to the last steep descent into the valley and simon then allowed bonnie to get out of the cart while he adjusted the drag on the wheels to stop it running downhill too fast all this time sylvia slept she stirred a little as they reached the foot of the hill and walked through a fringe of rowan trees into a tiny village consisting of three or four cottages round a green with a couple of out lying farms well go to the forge said simon and led the donkey across the green to a low building under a great walnut tree bonnie fell back and walked beside the cart smil ing at sylvias puzzled sleepy face the geese were beginning to stir and stretch their long necks and at first sight of them sylvia looked slightly alarmed but when she saw bonnie she smiled too and shut her eyes again smiths up said simon a thread of smoke drib bled from the forge chimney and they could see a red glow over the stable door in front while the noise of bellows came in a regular wheezing roar simon called over the forge door mr wildernessi the roaring stopped and there was a clink then a face appeared over the half door and the smith came out he was an immensely tall man wearing a blackened leather apron bonnie couldnt help smil ing he looked so like a large gende whitehaired lion with a pair of dark eyes like those of a collie the wolves of wuloughby chase dog halfhidden by the locks of white hair that fell over his forehead eh its you simon me boy what road can i help you carolines loosed a shoe said simon patting the donkey and as well as that wed like your advice about the little lass here shes not well childer come afore donkeys mr wilderness said he moved over beside the cart and looked down at sylvias face among the geese eh a pretty little fair lass she be whats amiss with her shes got a cough and a sore throat and a fever explained bonnie the smith gazed at bonnie wideeyed and thart another of em bless me whod ha thought it i took thee for a boy in that rig well shes sleeping fair in a goosefeather bed tha cant better that are they goose feathers he said to simon stuffed the quilts and mattresses myself said simon nodding my own geese champion goose grease for chilblains goose feathers for a chill well leave her in the cart shouldnt she be put to bed bonnie said doubt fully nay where lass ive only the forge and the kitchen where i sleep mysen nay well put her cart and all in the shippen shell be gradely there he led them round the corner of the forge and showed them how to back the cart into a big bam with double doors on each side when he opened these sunlight poured into the place and revealed that it was haltfull of hay and lined along the wall with lambing pens made from hurdles a tremendous joan aiken baaing and bleating came from these and walking along bonnie saw with delight that each pen con tained a sheep and one two or three lambs theres nought like lying wi sheep twothree days for a chesty cough pronounced mr wilderness the breath of sheep has a powerful virtue in it that and a brew of my cherrybark syrup with maybe a spoonful of honey in it and a plateful or two of good porridge will set her to rights better than the grandest doctor in the kingdom put her in the sun there lad when sun gets round we can open tother doors and let him in that side now for a bite o breakfast im fair starved and happen youll be the same if youve walked all the way fro blastburn weve a pie and some victuals simon said nay lad save thy pie for later porridge is on the forge fire this minute and whats better nor that the geese had climbed and fluttered out of the cart and were busy foraging in the hay bonnie after making sure that sylvia was well covered and had gone back to sleep was glad to come into the smi ths clean li ttle ki tchen which opened off the smithy and was as warm as an oven they sat down at a table covered with a checked redandwhite cloth mr wildemesss porridge was very different from that served in mrs briskets school it was eaten with brown sugar from a big blue bag and with dollops of thick yellow cream provided by mr wildemesss two red cows who stood sociably outside the kitchen door while breakfast was going on and licked the nose of caroline the donkey the wolves of willoughby chase after the porridge they had great slices of sizzling bacon and cups of scalding brown tea then the smith prepared a draught of his cherry bark medicine syrupy golden stuff with a wonderful aromatic scent and took it out to sylvia who was stirring drowsily she swallowed it down smiled a sleepy nothankyou to an offer of porridge and cream and closed her eyes again ay sleeps the best cure of all said mr wilder ness you look as if you could do wi a bit too my lass bonnie did begin to feel that she could do noth ing but yawn and so simon made her a nest in the hay and covered her with one of his goosefeather quilts here in the sun amid the comfortable creak ing of the geese and the baaing chorus of the sheep she too fell into a long and dreamless sleep they stayed with mr wilderness for three days until he pronounced sylvia better and fit to travel in the meantime simon helped the smith by blow ing the fire and carving wooden handles for the farm implements he made bonnie washed all his curtains tabledoths and sheets and aided by simon did a grand springcleaning of the cottage two months ago i shouldnt have known how to do this she said cheerfully beating mats on the village green going to mrs briskets at least taught me housework and how to look after hens mr wilderness was sorry to lose them when they went it thad ha stayed another twothree weeks th birds would ha been nesting and th primroses all showing their little pink faces herondales a gradely place i springtime joan aiken pink faces said bonnie disbelievingly dont you mean yellow nay theyre pink round here lass and the geran iums is blue but even with this inducement they wanted to press on to london they left with many farewells promising that they would call in on the return jour ney or come over as soon as they were safely back at willoughby chase the journey to london took them nearly two months they had to go at goose pace for in the daytime the geese hew out of the cart and wandered along as they chose pecking any edible thing by the roadside and as simon explained theres no sense in hurrying the geese or by the time we reach smith field theyll be thin and scrawny and nobody will buy em anyway said bonnie supposing mrs brisket and miss slighcarp have set people searching for us the search will surely have died down by the end of two months so they made their leisurely way picking flowers of which they found more and more as spring ad vanced and they traveled farther south watching birds and stopping to bathe and splash in moorland brooks at night they usually camped near a farm sleep ing in or under the cart in their warm goosefeather quilts if it rained farmers offered them shelter in barn or haymow often a kindly farmers wife invited them in tor a plate of stew and sped them on their way with a baking of pasties and apple dumplings in return sylvia did exquisite darning bonnie helped with housework and simon who could turn the wolves of willou hby chase his hand to anything plowed or milked or sawed wood or mended broken tools pattern had smuggled one or two books and bon nies paint box from the attic out to the cart with the food and clothes and these were a great resource on rainy evenings in the hay they read aloud to each other and simon who had never bothered about reading before learned how and even pronounced it quite a handy accomplishment he also took a keen pleasure in making use of bonnies box of col ors and sometimes could hardly he torn away from some view of a crag or waterfall that he was busy sketching the girls would wander slowly on with caroline the cart and the geese until simon fin ished at last caught them up at a run with the color box under his arm and the painting held out at arms length to dry sylvia and bonnie thought his pictures very beau tiful but simon was always dissatisfied with them and would give them away to any passerby who ad mired them several times people pressed money on him for them and once when they were stopping overnight in a little village named beckside the landlord of the inn the snake and ladder who had seen one of the sketches asked if simon would re paint his faded inn sign so they spent a pleasant day at the village feeding like gamecocks at the inn keepers table on roast duck and apple cheesecake while simon painted a gorgeous greenandgold ser pent twined in the rungs of a pruning ladder should you like to be a painter do you think simon sylvia asked i might he confessed id never thought of such a trade before eh though but theres a lot to learnt joan alken and i doubt id never have the money for a teacher bonnie opened her lips to speak and then checked herself sighing late in april they came to the top of hampstead hill among the gray old houses and the young green trees at the foot of the hill they could see the village of chalk farm and far away the great city of lon don spread out with its blue veil of smoke and its myriads of spires and chimneys sylvia felt a quicken ing of her heart to think she was so close to her dear aunt jane again how pleased the old lady would be to see her beloved little niecel they camped that night on hampstead heath near a tribe of gypsiesand indeed they looked like gyp sies themselves bonnie and simon were as brown as berries and their black locks were decidedly in want of cutting while even sylvia would hardly have been recognized for the thin pale fair child who had set out to willoughby chase so many months ago her cheeks were pink and her hair though not its orig inal length yet was thick and shining and reached to her shoulders they found an obliging dairyman in hampstead village who was willing to keep caroline and the cart for them in his stable and next day they drove the geese down into london you girls had best not come to smithfield mar ket said simon its a rough wild place not fit for little maids ive been thinking suggested bonnie how would it be if we tried to find mr gripes office while you are at the market sylvia can you tell us where law yers offices in london are usually to be found the wolves of willoughby chase sylvia said she thought they were in the region of chancery lane having inquired the way of a con stable therefore the girls accompanied simon as far as lincolns inn fields and there he left them with goosey and gandey the two parent geese who were never sold while he went on to dispose of the rest of the flock bonnie and sylvia wandered along outside the houses that surrounded the fields and saw on brass door plates the names of many attorneys barristers and commissioners for oaths but nowhere that of mr gripe at about midday when tired they were lying sun ning themselves on the grass and eating sliced beef and lemon tarts piocured at a nearby cookshop bon nie suddenly exclaimed look sylvia lookl isnt that mr grimshaw a portly middleaged man was walking across the grass toward a nearby archway sylvia scrutinized him closely and whispered yesi i am almost sure it is het if he would but turn his head this way we must follow him and find out bonnie said decisively it he too is in london we shall have to be on our guard the two children got up and calling their geese walked fast but not so as to attract his attention after the gentleman in question he passed through the archway descended some steps and turned into a small street where he stopped outside one of the houses perhaps it is his residence whispered sylvia they approached slowly unfortunately a large black cat was seated on the pavement and if there ho joan alken was one animal that goosey abominated it was a cat he set up a vociferous honking and cackling and the gentleman in the act of ringing the door bell turned his head and looked at the two girls his eyes passed over bonnie but he stared very sharply at sylvia for an instantthen the door opened and he was admitted oh mercy exclaimed sylvia do you think he recognized me for it was undoubtedly mr grim shaw i could not have sat so long opposite him in the train and been mistaken i am not certain if he knew you said bonnie uneasily it is possible you are not so sunburned as simon or i we had better not remain in this vi cinity they were turning to go when bonnies quick eyes caught sight of the brass plate by the door that mr grimshaw had entered look sylvial abednego gripe attorney fathers man of business is not that a lucky chance is it so lucky said sylvia doubtfully as they re traced their steps along the street i do not like the fact that mr grimshaw has gone to see him why can he have done so do you suppose no you are right bonnie answered thoughtfully it is very queer at all events we must not go to see mr gripe while mr grimshaw is there we had best wait until we have seen aunt jane and asked her advice they remounted the steps and saw simon crossing lincolns inn fields he waved to them triumph antly twentytwo pounds girlsl they fetched fourteen the wolves of willoughby chase and eightpence each he called as soon as he came within earshot we are rich heavens what a lot of money breathed sylvia let us be off to aunt jane at once said bonnie shall you want me to come asked simon diffi dently gracious yes why ever not im only poor and rough oh what nonsense said bonnie seizing his hand you cant come all this way with us and then desert us now just when things might turn out betteri syl via tell us how to get from here to park lane they finished their fourhundredmile journey rid ing on the open uper deck of one of the new horse drawn omnibuses geese and all though sylvia did rather shudder to think what aunt jane would say to this should she chance to be looking out of her window when they arrived aunt jane had many times told sylvia that no iidy ever rode in an omni bus and more particularly not on the upstairs deck i feel halfafraid confessed sylvia laughing look ing up at the familiar tall house with its grecian columns on either side of the door and white win dow boxes filled with lobelia look bonnie that is our windowthe attic one right up in the roof the windowbox fiowers are withered comment ed simon so they are that is not like aunt jane said sylvia puzzled she usually waters them so care fully the main door to the house stood open and they went in silence up the stairsup up again and still up as they passed a door on the fourthfloor land joan aiken ing it flew open and a young mans head popped out exclaiming is that the grocer have you brought my pies and turpentine oh in disappointment as he saw simon and bonnie and the geese sylvia had impatiently gone on ahead the young man eyed them in surprise a moment then shut his door again they caught up with sylvia on the top landing she was already tapping at aunt janes attic door it is strange she does not answer perhaps shes out shopping suggested simon but she always takes tea at this time of day it was five oclock she could not have moved away bonnie said with a sinking heart no exclaimed sylvia in relief here is the spare door key that she aiways keeps under the oilcloth in case by some mischance she should lose her other one she must be out after all we will go in and surprise her on her return she opened the door with the key and cautioning them by laying her finger on her lips tiptoed in bonnie and simon rather shyly followed and stood hesitating in the tiny hallway while sylvia went on into the one room which served aunt jane for kit chen parlor and bedroom suddenly they heard sylvia give a taint cry and she came back to them white and frightened what is it sylvia said bonnie anxiously it is aunt janel oh i think she must be dread fully ill or in a faintshe is there and so thin and pale and hardly breathing come come quickly they hastened after her simon pausing but a mo ment to shut the geese out on the landing they saw the poor old lady stretched on her bed under the wolves of willoughby chase w the jettiimmed mantle her eyes were closed and her breathing was rapid and shallow aunt jane whispered sylvia it is i sylvia there was no reply ten all three children retreated on to the landing once more it seemed dreadful to stay in the little close room and talk about aunt jane with her quite un conscious of their presence sylvia noticed that the window was shut the dishes unwashed a thick layer of dust covered everything what do you think is the matter with her syl via said her voice quavering i dont know said bonnie decidedly but what ever it is we must get a doctor to her at once yes bonnie how sensible of you but where shall we find one has aunt jane no regular doctor she always said she could not afford one said sylvia dissolving into tears she always said all her ailments could be cured by pparkinsons penny pink pills now come sylvia dont get those crying ways again bonnie began sounding cross because she was so worried when simon interposed i think i saw a doctors plate on the floor below wait a moment and ill go down and make certain he pushed past the geese who were roosting on the stairs and ran down to the landing below sure the wolves of willoughby chase enough by he door out of which the head had popped was a notice gabriel fieldphysician and chirurgeon simon knocked a voice shouted come in its not locked and so he pushed open the door and looked into a room which was in a considerable de gree of confusion several shelves along the walls bore a clutter of bottles phials and surgical implements a large table was covered with brushes jars and tubes of paint while the floor was almost equally littered with stacks of canvases and piles of medical books the young man who had looked out before stood with a paint brush in his hand considering a half finished painting on a large easel oh its you again is it he said seeing simons perplexed face come round the door what dyou want simon found something reassuring in his rather brusque manner please are you dr field sir yes i am the old lady upstairs is very ill could you come and look at her certainly just a moment while i wash my hands while dr field was washing and fetching a black bag of medicines from his bedroom simon stared at the picture on the easel like it said the doctor coming back yes said simon i do very much but im not sure about this bottom righthand corner it seems a bit too dark the doctor gave him a surprised look before wav ing him out of the door and hurrying upstairs he joan aiken brushed past the two girls and the geese without comment and made his way in to aunt janes bed side one of you two girls come and help me he said so sylvia went while the other two remained on the landing in a silence of anxiety and suspense they had to wait some time while dr field made a thorough examination of aunt jane then he and sylvia came out on to the landing again shes your aunt is she he said sharply well youve been neglecting her shes suffering from mal nutrition as none of them appeared to understand this word he added impatiently undernourishment shes been starving herself sylvia began to cry quietly oh poor poor aunt jane i should never have left her im to blame too said the doctor angrily i saw her coming upstairs a couple of weeks ago with her shoppingone egg and an apple i should have guessed what does she need sir said simon quietly ill go out and get it firstly champagne shes too weak to take any thing else at the moment you neednt bother about that ive a bottle in my room then beef tea eggs milk butter honey well go and get them said bonnie come on simon i saw a basket in aunt janes parlor sylvia you stay with the doctor and see to the champagne can you direct us to the nearest market sir we have only just come to london and dont know our way about dr field told them how to find the nearest mar ket and they ran off with their basket while sylvia the wolves of willoughby chase helped administer a few teaspoonfuls of champagne to aunt jane tipping it between her motionless lips youre the old ladys niece are you the doctor said ive only been in this house a month i thought she had no kin at all its high time she was prop erly looked after sylvia considered the doctor he had a kind sen sible face and she was inclined to confide the whole story to him and ask his advice but thought she had better wait till the others returned simon and bonnie soon came back they were loaded for as well as the food simon was carrying a small sack of coal and bonnie had a blanket and a fleecy shawl while they were out they had had a short brisk argument simon this is your money were spendingyour years money we shouldnt be doing it oh fiddlesticks he said uncomfortably any body would do all they could to help that poor old lady well i shall pay you back as soon as i possibly can simon if i ever get my own home and money back but otherwise you do understand youll have to wait till i can earn some money and gracious knows how many months that will be oh get along with you girl youre wasting time said simon goodnaturedly dr field suggested that they should do their cook ing downstairs in his room in order not to disturb the invalid so bonnie first borrowing aunt janes cook ery book set about scraping some beef and putting it to simmer with carrots and a teaspoonful of brandy simon lit a fire in aunt janes room and sylvia tip joan aiken toed about cleaning the place and setting it to rights every now and then dr field came and administered another teaspoonful of champagne and presently he reported with satisfaction an improvement in the patients breathing and a tinge of color in her cheeks your cousins cooked you a meal he said to sylvia and simon after a while better come down and eat it in my room they realized they had not eaten all day and were glad to come down bonnie had cooked a great pan ful of bacon and eggs which she cordially invited the doctor to share are you all cousins said he when they were eating among the paints and bottles of medicine oh no sylvia and i are but simons no relation where are all your parents they looked at each other and without the need for discussion decided that they could trust the doc tor bonnie told him the whole story ending with the sight of mr grimshaw at the lawyers office that morning and oh sir she ended with tears in her eyes can you tell me if the ship my parents sailed in truly sank truly what was its name the thessaly yes my poor child he said sadly i wish i could tell you otherwise but i read the report in the times myself it was said that the captain should never have set sail knowing the dangerous state of the ships hull it was said that someone must have paid him handsomely to do so and it was rumored that he himself had escaped in a small boat some hours before the wreck the wolves of willoughby chase bonnie could not speak for a moment she turned away to the window and bit her lip dr field went on hastily to break the unhappy silence the whole business sounds to me like a plot hatched up beforehand between this miss slighcarp of yours whos evidently a thorough wrong un and her precious friends grimshaw and mrs brisket whether gripe the lawyer has a hand in it too we cant be sure but l ve a friend whos a lawyer and as soon as old miss greens fit to be left ill go and see him and ask him what he knows about gripe oh could you sir thank you indeed their faces of gratitude evidently touched his heart for he said gruffly a couple of you can bed down here if you like ive plenty of cushions just shift some of those books and pictures and the skeleton off the sofa sylvia gave a faint scream she had not noticed the skeleton before one of you should sleep upstairs with the old lady and youd better all get yourselves a wash and brushup you look as it you can do with it the beef tea was ready now and sylvia with the doctors help fed some of it to aunt jane through a straw she opened her eyes once or twice but seemed hardly conscious of her surroundings yet with the aid of a couple of the doctors blankets sylvia made hersele up a couch for the night by the side of aunt janes bed they were all tired and went to sleep as soon as they lay down in the middle of the night sylvia awoke she had left a night light burning and by its faint glimmer she saw that aunt jane had raised herself on her pil lows and was looking wonderingly about her joan aiken mind auntie said sylvia spring up youll un cover yourself carefully she arranged the woolly shawl round her aunts shoulders again it is sylvia but no said aunt jane mournfully i have so often dreamed that she came back this must be just another dream no it isntl said sylvia forgetting to be careful in her joy and giving her aunt an impetuous hug it really is me come back to look after you and ive brought bonnie too sylvia my precious child aunt jane murmured and two tears slipped down her cheeks now aunt dear you mustnt you must get strong quickly please try to sip some of this said sylvia who had been hastily heating up the beef tea over the night light aunt jane sipped it and soon for she was still very weak she slipped off to sleep holding sylvias hand sylvia too began to doze leaning against her aunts bed halfawake and halfdreaming she dreamed that she was on top of a mountain the black ridge that they had crossed before they reached herondale she saw miss slighcarp coming up from biastburn at the head of a pack of wolves sylvia was dumb with fright she was unable to move nearer and nearer miss slighcarp came tramp tramp tramp suddenly sylvia was awake and listening and there were footsteps coming up the stairs she lay palpitating with her heart hot against her ribs who could it be the night was still black dark no light showed under the door if it was the doctor the wolves of willoughby chase surely he would be carrying a light the steps were very slow very cautious as if whoever it was wanted to make as little sound as possible sylvia knew that she must moveshe must a frantic cackling hissing and honking broke out on the stairs there was a yell a thud more cackling pandemonium what is it said aunt jane drowsily oh what can it be cried sylvia pale with ter ror but the noise had shaken her out of her paraly sis and she seized a candle lit it at the night light and ran to the door the scene that met her eyes when she held the door open was a strange one at the top of the stairs were two indignant geese still hissing and arching their necks tor battle prone on the stairs head down and cursing volubly was mr grimshaw simon held one of his arms and bonnie the other dr field in a dressing gown looking sleepy and considerably annoyed was emerging from his front door holding a piece of rope with which he pro ceeded to tie mr grimshaws hands and ankles breaking into peoples houses at three in the morning he muttered thats really a bit high its bad enough having children and geese camped all over the place it was lucky the geese sounded the alarm said bonnie pale but clutching mr grimshaw gamely true dr field agreed now lock him in the broom closet good ill just run down and bolt the outside door then perhaps we can have a bit more sleep well get to the bottom of all this in the morn ing joan aiken yawning they all went back to bed but sylvia de clared she was too scared to sleep without bonnie and so they brought up more of the doctors cushions and made a double pallet beside aunt janes bed eleven dr fields face at breakfast next morning was grim and the children were all rather silent the unseen presence of mr grimshaw in the broom cupboard put a damper on their spirits what do you suppose he was trying to do whis pered bonnie oh very likely just see if you were there said dr field doubtfully or try to frighten the old lady into handing you over if you should turn up later at all events you and the geese between you put an effective stop to him i shall take him straight to bow street after breakfast and put him in charge of the constables luckily aunt jane was a great deal better this morning after the doctor had inspected her he pro nounced that she might be given a little warm gruel and some tea and dry toast which bonnie and sylvia prepared aunt jane greeted bonnie kindly and de clared that she would never have recognized her which was very probable as the last time she had seen bonnie had been at her christening then syl via announced that she would remain with the old lady while the rest of the party went off with the prisoner the very sight oј mr grimshaw she said joan aiken made her feel sick with fright dr field considered this to be a sensible plan and he told simon to go out and whistle tor a hackney cab mr grimshaw was released from his closet but his bonds were not untied he was sulky threatening and lachrymose by turns in the same breath he begged for mercy and then swore he would get even with them thats enough my man you can spare your breath said dr field and showed him a blunder buss ready primed which he had taken out of his desk drawer at sight of this weapon mr grimshaw relapsed into a cowed silence shall i get my fowling piece exclaimed bonnie and then remembered that it was with the cart in hampstead dr field looked slightly startled but said he thought one weapon should be sufficient to keep the scoundrel in order at this moment simon came back to report that a cab was waiting below and after a solicitous fare well to aunt jane and sylvia bidding the latter keep the door locked and admit nobody they took their departure at bow street they waited only a very few minutes while the doctor haled his prisoner into the constab ulary office he soon reappeared accompanied by a couple of burly sharplooking individuals who marched grimshaw between them and they all piled into the cab again where is he to be taken now said bonnie we shall go to mr gripes office for some expla nation of grimshaws behavior dr field told her he has said that he worked for mr gripe the wolves of willoisghby chase they were soon back in the region of lincolns inn fields and drove up to the house that bonnie and sylvia had seen the day before a scaredlooking clerk hardly more than a boy admitted them into a waiting room and next moment a thin agitated grayhaired man hurried into the room exclaiming what can i do for you gentlemen i am abednego gripe he appeared excessively surprised to see the chil dren and the manacled mr grimshaw bonnie soon decided that he could not have hatched a dark plot to obtain possession of willoughby chasehe looked too kind and harmless one of the bow street officers spoke up i am sam cardigan sir an officer of the constab ulary here is my card can you identity this person here indicating mr grimshaw why yes said mr gripe looking at mr grim shaw with distaste his name is grimshaw he was a clerk in my office until he was dismissed for for gery ahal said the other bow street officer whose name was spock have you ever seen him since you dismissed him said dr field no indeed he would have a very cold reception in this office and yet he was seen entering here yesterday snapped cardigan mr gripe seemed surprised not to my knowl edge cardigan looked thunderously disbelieving and was about to burst out with his suspicions of mr gripe when the little clerk who had let the party joan aiken in and who had been standing in the doorway with eyes like saucers piped up please sir i saw him mr grimshaw darted a furious look at this speaker who are you said cardigan please sir marmot a clerk yesterday while mr gripe was out having dinner ththat gentleman as is tied up there came and asked me to give him the address of miss jane green sister to sir willoughby and you gave it him yes sir he said he wished to take her some divi dends dividends indeed growled dr field wanted to murder her more probably certainly not said grimshaw pale with fright i merely wished to ascertain from her if these chil dren who are the runaway wards of a friend of mine had taken shelter with her at three oclock in the morning a fine story more likely you wanted to terrify her into signing some document giving you power over the children and what about this letitia slighcarp continued dr field glaring at the lawyer were you respon sible for sending that female fiend to feather her nest at willoughby chase mr gripe looked very much alarmed she is a distant relation of sir willoughby she came with the highest references he began from the duchess of kensington i have them still he pulled out a drawer in a cabinet and produced a paper cardigan scanned it a patent forgery he said at once i have seen the duchesss signature on many documents and it is utterly unlike this the wolves of willoughby chase then i have been dupedl cried mr gripe grow ing paler still but what can have been the object of this deceit why said bonnie indignantly miss siighcarp has taken our whole house for her own dismissed all the servants sent me and my cousin to live in a school that is no better than a workhouse or prison and treated us with miserable crueltyl and i believe too she and mr grimshaw had some hand in seeing that papa and mamma set sail on a ship that was known to be likely to sinki this is a bad business a very bad business said mr gripe no no cried mr grimshaw now nearly dead of terror we were not responsible for that the ship was sunk by an unscrupulous owner to obtain the insurance it was when i learnedthrough a friend who was a shipping clerkthat they were to sail on the thessaly that the plan took shape i had seen sir willoughbys letter to mr gripe asking him to seek out his cousin letitia slighcarp as an instructress for his daughter and soand so and so you conspired with miss slighcarp and forged her credentials said mr gripe angrily it is all very plain sir take him away gentlemeni take him away and keep him fast until he can ap pear before a magistrate after that it was very dull said bonnie reporting the scene to sylvia later i had to tell the bow street officers every single thing i could remember that miss slighcarp had done and the clerk wrote it all down and mr gripe looked more and more shocked especially when i told what i had seen when we looked through the hole in the secret panel joan aiken and watched them tearing up papas will and all the other documents and the end of it all is sylvia that mr grim shaw is committed to prison until the assizes when he will stand his trial for fraud and the bow street officers are to go to willoughby tomorrow to seize miss slighcarp how surprised she will be exclaimed sylvia with iively pleasure i almost wish i could be there to see but sylvia you are to be therel they most par ticularly requested that you and i should be taken too to act as witnesses but who will look after aunt jane inquired sylvia anxiously dr field has said that he would procure a nurse for a few days and it need be for only twoyou can return directly miss slighcarp is apprehended and sylvia as soon as aunt jane is well enough to travel i have asked mr gripe to arrange that she shall come and live at willoughby and be our guardian oh yes exclaimed sylvia her face brightening what a splendid plan bonnie it was a gay and lively party that assembled in the train next dayvery different from that earlier and sorrowful departure when sylvia had taken leave of aunt jane a special coupe compartment had been chartered and the bow street officers had no objec tion to simon and his geese traveling in it as well dr field was remaining to keep an eye on aunt jane but he bade the children a cordial farewell and invited them to come and sleep in his apartment again when they returned to take aunt jane to wil loughby mr gripe the lawyer was with them and tlic wolves of willoughhy chase had given his clerk instructions to procure a luncheon hamper from which came the most savory smells sylvia smiled faintly as size thought of the other tiny food packet and mr grimshaws sumptuous jam filled cakes i suppose he only pretended to have forgotten who he was when the portmanteau fell on him she said to bonnie so that he would be taken to willoughby said bonnie nodding how i wish that we had left him in the train still he did save me from the wolves there were no wolves to be seen on this journey the packs had all retreated to the bleak north coun try and the train ran through smiling pasture lands all astir with sheep and lambs or through green and golden woods carpeted with bluebells the day passed gaily with songs and storytelling even the dry mr gripe proved to know a number of amusing talesand in between the laughter and chat cardigan and spock the bow street officers bus ily wrote down in their notebooks more and more of the dreadful deeds of miss slighcarp recounted to them by bonnie and sylvia they reached willoughby station at dawn mr gripe had written to one of the inns at blastburn for a chaise and it was there to meet them how different this road seems said sylvia as they set off at a gallop last time i traveled along it there were wolves and snow and it was cold and darknow i can see primroses everywhere and i am so hot in these clothes that i can hardly breathe they were still wearing the tinker childrens clothes pattern had made them for there had been no time joan aiken in london to get any others made mr gripes eye winced when it encountered them for he liked chil dren to look neat and nicely dressed let us hope that miss slighcarp has not got rid of all our own clothes said bonnie when they reached the boundary of willoughby park they saw an enormous notice new since they had left it said willoughby chase school a select seminary for the daughters of gentlemen and the nobility boarders and parlor boarders principals missl slighcarp and mrs brisket what impertinencel gasped bonnie can she really have made our home into a school this is worse even than i had feared said mr gripe grimly as the chaise turned into the gateway they took the longer and more roundabout road that led to the back of the house for the bow street officers wanted to surprise miss slighcarp didnt you say there was a secret passage miss sam cardigan said to bonnie yes and a priests hole and an oubliette very good couldnt be better well put some ginger in the good ladys gravy he explained his plan to mr gripe and the chil dren and then they knocked at the back door it was opened by james miss bonnie mtss sylvial he exclaimed scarlet with joy and surprise they both flung themselves on him and hugged him james dear james are you all right is pattern all right what is going on here the wolves of willoughby chase terrible doings miss now now said sam cardigan pleasure at see ing old acquaintance all very well but business is business we must get under cover my man where can this carriage be concealed it can go in the coach house sir james told him theres only miss slighcarps landau now the carriage was hastily put away and the con spirators took refuge in the dairy now james said bonnie dancing with excite ment you must go and tell miss slighcarp that sylvia and i have come back and that we are very sad and sorry for having run away dont say any thing about these gentlemen yes miss said james his eyes beginning to twin kle shes teaching just now up in the schoolroom the pupils study tor an hour before breakfast is the entrance to the secret passage still open jame has miss slighcarp ever discovered it no to the second and yes to the first miss bon nie siid james and pulled aside the cupboard and horse blankets which he had arranged to conceal the opening capital go to her quickly then james tell her we are starving you dont look it begging your pardon miss said james grinning and left the room mr gripe and the two bow street officers squeezed their way into the secret passage simon who had left his geese in the stable yard hesitated but mr gripe said come on come on boy the more witnesses the better so he followed bonnie and sylvia spent the time while they waited for jamess return in artistically dirtying and untidy joan aiken ing each other rubbing dust and coal on their faces rumpling their hair and making themselves look as dejected and orphanly as possible james came back with a long face youre to come up to the schoolroom young la dies at once he led the way and they followed in silence the house bore traces everywhere of its new use as a school on the crystal chandelier in the ballroom ropes had been slung for climbing and the billiards table had been exchanged for blackboards the por traits of ancestors in the long gallery had been re placed by bulletin boards and the goldleaf and or molu tables were covered with chalk powder and inkstains even though they knew they had good friends close at hand the children could not control a certain swelled and breathless feeling in the region of their midriffs as they approached the schoolroom door james tapped at the door and in response to miss slighcarps come in opened it and stood aside to let the children through a quick glance showed them that all the furniture had been removed and that the room was filled with desks the more senior children from mrs briskets school were sitting at them with expressions vary ing from nervous excitement to petrifaction on their faces miss slighcarp stood on a raised platform by a blackboard she had a long wooden pointer in her hand mrs brisket was there too sitting at the in structresss desk she wore a stern and forbidding expression but on miss slighcarps face there was a look of triumph the wolves of willoughby chase so she saida long hissing exhalation so you have returnedcome here they advanced slowly and trembling until they stood below the platform miss slighcarp was so tall that they had almost to lean back to look up at her pplease take us back into your school miss sligh carp faltered bonnie were so cold and tired and hungry into sylvias mind came a sudden recollection of the grouse pies and apricots they had eaten on the train she bit her lip and tried to look sorrowful behind them james quietly poked the fire but no one noticed him all eyes were on the returning truants hungry said miss slighcarp youll be hungrier still before ive done with you do you think you can run away spend two months idling and playing on the moors return when it suits you and then expect to be given roast beef and pudding youll have no food for three days perhaps that will teach you something and you shall both be beaten and well see what a taste of the dungeons will do for your spirit james go and get the dungeon keys no miss said james firmly i obey some of your orders because ive got no alternative but help to put children in those dungeons i cant and wont its not christian and he left the room shutting the door sharply behind him ill get the keys letiria said mrs brisket rising ponderously you can be administering chastisement meanwhile miss slighcarp came down from her platform miss green she said and her eyes were so glitter joan aiken ing with fury that even bonnie quailed put out your hand bonnie took a step backward miss slighcarp fol lowed her and raised the pointer menacingly the children at the desks drew a tremulous breath but just as the pointer came swishing down the chimney piece panel flew open and mr gripe stepping out seized hold of miss slighcarps arm for a moment she was utterly dumfounded then in wrath she exclaimed who are you sir let me go at oncel what are you doing in my house in your house maam in your house dont you remember me miss slighcarp said mr cripe i was the attorney instructed by your distant relative sir willoughby green to seek you out and offer you the position of instructress to his daughter you brought with you a testimonial from the duchess of kensington dont you remember miss slighcarp turned pale and who gave you permission woman suddenly thundered mr gripe to turn this house into a boarding school who said you could use these chil dren with villainous cruelty beat them starve them and lock them in dungeons oh its of no use to protest ive been behind that panel and heard every word youve uttered it was only a joke faltered miss slighcarp i had no intention of really shutting them in the dun geons at this moment mrs brisket reentered the room holding a bunch of enormous rusty keys we cant use the upper dungeons letitia she the wolves of willoughby chase began briskly for lucy and emma are occupying them i have brought the lower then she saw mr gripe and behind him the two bow street officers her jaw dropped and she was stricken to silence only a joke indeed said mr gripe harshly mr cardigan place these two females under arrest if you please until it is convenient to remove them to jail you may as well avail yourself of the dungeon keys so obligingly put at your disposal you cant do thisi youve no right shrieked the enraged miss slighcarp struggling in the grip of cardigan i have papers signed by sir willoughby empowering me to do as i please with this property in the event of his death and appointing me guard ian of the children papers signed by sir willoughby pish said mr gripe scornfully you may as well know maam that your accomplice grimshaw who is already in prison has confessed to the whole plot at this news all the fight went out of mrs bris ket and she allowed herself to manacled by spock only muttering grimshaws a fool a paltry whin ing fool but miss slighcarp still gave battle i tell you she shouted i saw sir willoughby before he departed and he himself left me full pow ers at this moment a heavy tread resounded along the passage and they heard a voice exclaiming what the devils all this desks blackboards car pet taken uphas mhouse been turned into a re formatory h joan aiken the door burst open and in marchedsir will oughby green behind him stood james grinning for joy bonnie turned absolutely pale with incredulity stood so for a moment motionless and wideeyed then uttering one crypa ashe flung herself into her fathers arms well minx have you missed us eh have you been a good girl and minded your book i can see you havent he said surveying her lovingly rosy as a pippin and brown as a berry i can see youve been out of doors all day long instead of sewing your sampler and learning your je ne sais quoi and sylvia tooeh my word what a change from the littie white mouse we left here well well well girls will be girlsl but whats all this maam he continued ad dressing miss slighcarp threateningly whats all this huggermugger i never gave you permission to turn willoughby chase into a school no damme i didntl being my fourth cousin doesnt give you such rights as that but sir interjected mr gripe who at first silent with amazement had now got his breath back sir willoughbyl this is joyful indeed we had all sup posed you drowned when the thessaly sank sir willoughby burst into a fit of laughter ay so they told me at your officel we have been traveling close behind you mr gripei visited your place of business yesterday learned you had just de parted tor willoughby and since lady green was anxious to get back as soon as may be and relieve the childrens anxiety we hired a special train and came posthaste after you the wolves of willoughby chase but were you not in the shipwreck then sir wil loughby the reply to this question was lost in bonnies rapturous cryis mamma here too is she why yes miss and ettling to see you ill be bound before the words had left his mouth bonnie was out of the door sylvia from a nice sense of delicacy did not follow her cousin she thought that bonnie and her mother should be allowed those first few blissful moments of reunion alone together sir willoughby and mr gripe had retired to a corner of the schoolroom and mr gripe was talking hard while sir willoughby listened with his blue eyes bulging occasionally exclaiming why damme for sheer cool calm impertinent effronterywhy bless my soul once he wheeled round to his niece and said is it really true sylvia did miss sligh carp do these things yes sir indeed she did said sylvia then hangings too good for you maam he growled at miss slighcarp have her taken to the dungeons gripe when these two excellent fellows have breakfasted they can take her and the other harpy off to prison oh sir said sylvia well miss puss may i go with them to the dungeons sir i be lieve there are two children who have been put down there by miss slighcarp and they will be so cold and unhappy and frightenedl are there by joshual well all go said sir wil loughby joan aiken sylvia had never visited the dungeons at wiuough by chase they were a dismal and frightening quar ter never entered by the present owner and his fam ily though in days gone by they had been exten sively employed by ancestors of sir willoughby down dark dank weedencrusted steps they trod and along narrow rockhewn passages where the only sound beside the echo of their own footfalls was the drip of water sylvia shuddered when she remembered miss slighcarps expressed intention of imprisoning herself and bonme down here oh do let us hasten she implored poor lucy and emma must be nearly frozen with cold and fear upon my soul muttered mr gripe this passes everything fancy putting children in a place like thisi miss slighcarp and mrs brisket trod along in the rear of their captors silent and sullen looking neither to right nor to left the plight of lucy and emma was not quite so bad as it might have been this was owing to the kindhearted james who though he could not release them had contrived to pass through their bars a number of warm blankets and a quantity of kindling and some tapers to enable them to light a fire and he had also kept them supplied with food out of his own meagre rations but they were cold and miserable enough and their astonishment and joy at the sight of sylvia was touching to behold sylvia danced up and down outside the bars with impatience while james found the right key and then she hurried them off upstairs without waiting to see miss slighcarp locked intheir place the wolves of willoughby chase come come quickly and get warm by a fire pat tern shall make you a possetor no i forget pattern is probably not here yet but i think i know how it is done however they had no more than reached the great hall when they were greeted with an ecstatic cry from bonn ie sylvia emma lucye come and see mammal oh she is so different so much better they went rather shyly into the salon where pat tern who had been summoned by simon at full gal lop on one of the coach horses bustled about in joy ful tears and served everybody with cups of froth ing hot chocolate well a gay voice exclaimed wheres my second daughter and in swept someone whom sylvia would hardly have recognized for the frail languid lady green so blooming beautiful and brighteyed did she appear she embraced sylvia cordially made wel come the two poor prisoners and declared now i want to hear all your story every word from the very beginningi i am proud of you both and as for that miss slighcarp cousin of your fathers though she be i hope she is sent to botany bay but aunt sophy said sylvia your tale must be so much more adventurous than oursi were you not shipwrecked yes indeed we werel said lady green laughing and your uncle and i spent six very tedious days drifting in a rowing boat our only fare being a monotonous choice of grapes or oranges of which there happened to be a large crate in the dinghy fortunately for us we were then picked up by a small and most insanitary fishing boat manned by a set joan aiken of fellows as picturesque as they were unwashed who none of them spoke a word of english they would carry us nowhere but to their home port which turned out to be the canary islands in this boat we received nothing to eat but sardines in olive oil i am surprised these shocks and privations did not carry me off but sir willoughby maintains they were the saving of me for from the time oј the wreck my health began to pick up on reaching the canaries we determined to come home by the next mail ship but they only visit these islands every three months or so and one had just left we had to wait a weary time but the peace and the sunshine during our en forced stay completed my cure as you see oh how glad i am you came home and didnt go on round the worldl cried bonnie sir willoughby marched in beaming well well he said has madam hen found her chicks eh but as for the state your house is in my lady i hardly dare describe it to you we shall have to have it completely redecorated and whats to be done with all these poor orphans oh papa said bonnie

eyes of diana brisket who having been in a posi tion to bully and hector as much as she pleased was now reduced to a state where she had not a friend to stand by her mrs brisket had sold the school in blastburn and so diana had nowhere to go and was forced willynilly to stay with the orphans where it may be said in passing wholesome discipline and the example of aunt janes unselfish nature soon wrought an improvement in her character some of the parlor boarders and daughters of the nobility and gentry had been fetched away by their parents such as lived near enough and the rest were awaiting
